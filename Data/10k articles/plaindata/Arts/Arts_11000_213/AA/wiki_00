{"id": "20940977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20940977", "title": "African red slip ware", "text": "African red slip ware\n\nAfrican red slip ware, also African Red Slip or ARS, is a category of \"terra sigillata\", or \"fine\" Ancient Roman pottery produced from the mid-1st century AD into the 7th century in the province of Africa Proconsularis, specifically that part roughly coinciding with the modern country of Tunisia and the Diocletianic provinces of Byzacena and Zeugitana. It is distinguished by a thick-orange red slip over a slightly granular fabric. Interior surfaces are completely covered, while the exterior can be only partially slipped, particularly on later examples.\n\nBy the 3rd century AD, African red slip appears on sites throughout the Mediterranean and in the major cities of Roman Europe. It was the most widely distributed representative of the sigillata tradition in the late-Roman period, and occasional imports have been found as far afield as Britain in the 5th-6th centuries. African red slip ware was still widely distributed in the 5th century but after that time the volume of production and trade may well have declined. While the latest forms continued into the 7th century and are found in such major cities as Constantinople and Marseille, the breakup of commercial contacts that typified the later 7th century coincides with the final decline of the African red slip industry.\n\nThe production and success of African red slip is probably closely tied to the agricultural productivity of Rome's North African provinces, as indicated in part by the contemporaneous distribution of Roman-period North African amphoras.\n\nFrom about the 4th century, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including Asia Minor, the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt. Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics. Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul), but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.\n\nThere was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171). The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56), were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form.\n\nA wide range of bowls, dishes and flagons were made in ARS, but the technique of making entire relief-decorated vessels in moulds was discontinued. Instead, appliqué motifs were frequently used where decoration in relief was required, separately made and applied to the vessel before drying and firing. Stamped motifs were also a favoured form of decoration, and decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of Christianity as well: there is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps in the later centuries. Similar forms and fabrics were made for more local distribution in Egypt, which had its own very active and diverse ceramic traditions in the Roman period.\n\nSurface decoration of ARS is relatively simple during the first three centuries of production, with occasional rouletting, barbotine motifs and some appliqué being typical. In the 4th century applied decoration becomes common. By the 5th century stamped central motifs such as animals, crosses and humans are common on larger plates. Paralleling developments in other visual media, gladatorial scenes and references to pagan mythology come to be replaced by Christian figures. In the last phase of production, surface treatment consists of light spiral burnishing on some plates and rouletting around the floor of certain bowls.\n\nIn 1972 John Hayes published a type series running from form 1 to 200, with forms 112-120 remaining unused. A supplement appeared in 1980. In addition to other previous work, Hayes made use of Waage's work in both Antioch and the Athenian Agora, as well as Lamboglia's in Ventimiglia. Michael Fulford's publication of the British excavations at Avenue du Président Habib Bourguiba, Salammbo in Carthage expanded on the work of Hayes. Carandini's typology, published in \"Enciclopedia dell'arte antica classica e orientale\", is also important. Michael Mackensen offers an alternate typology for later forms based on his work in northern Tunisia. Michel Bonifay has also collected previous scholarship alongside his own observations.\n\nSome major ARS centres in central Tunisia are Sidi Marzouk Tounsi, Henchir el-Guellal (Djilma), and Henchir es-Srira, all of which have ARS lamp artifacts attributed to them by the microscopic chemical makeup of the clay fabric as well as macroscopic style prevalent in that region.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7094886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7094886", "title": "Alexis Colby", "text": "Alexis Colby\n\nAlexis Carrington Colby (maiden name Morell; formerly Dexter and Rowan) is a fictional character on the American TV series \"Dynasty\". She is the ex-wife of Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) whose schemes cause one problem after another for him and their children.\n\nThe role was originated by Joan Collins in the first episode of the show's second season in 1981, though the character appeared briefly in the first season finale, non-speaking and face unseen. Collins remained on the show until the finale in 1989, and then returned as Alexis for the 1991 miniseries \"\". The character appeared later in the first season of the 2017 \"Dynasty\" reboot series, portrayed by Nicollette Sheridan.\n\nAlexis' schemes to destroy ex-husband Blake, undermine his marriage to Krystle (Linda Evans), and control her children drive much of the action over the series' run. Passionate yet vengeful, Alexis loves her children fiercely and will do anything to protect them, but she often ignores their own needs and desires in place of what she thinks is best. Alexis marries three additional times, to Cecil Colby, Dex Dexter, and Sean Rowan. She is widowed twice, first by Cecil and then by fourth husband Sean, prompting Alexis' cousin Sable to remark that with Alexis \"death is always a simpler solution than divorce.\" Her third marriage (to Dex) ends in divorce after Alexis catches him in bed with her adult daughter Amanda. The name Alexis uses the most consistently over the course of the series is Alexis Colby, though her marriage to Cecil Colby is her shortest. Alexis is romantically linked to a number of men over the years, including oilman Rashid Ahmed, tennis pro (and Krystle's first husband) Mark Jennings, King Galen of Moldavia, shipping tycoon Zach Powers, Congressman Neal McVane, Blake's brother Ben Carrington, Dirk and Gavin Maurier, Cecil's brother Jason Colby, and even a near-reconciliation with an amnesiac Blake.\n\n\"TV Guide\" named Alexis #7 in their 2013 list of \"The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time\", and in 2016 \"Rolling Stone\" ranked her #27 of their \"40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\". In 2015, executive producer Lee Daniels noted that Taraji P. Henson's character Cookie Lyon in his TV series \"Empire\" was partially based on Alexis.\n\nIn the first season finale episode, \"The Testimony\", Blake Carrington is on trial for murder, and a female mystery witness in a large hat and veil appears. Writers Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock, brought in for season two, were told by the Shapiros that the character would be Blake's ex-wife Madeline, who would be played by Sophia Loren for four to six episodes. The Pollocks renamed her Alexis, told executive producer Aaron Spelling that Loren was not right for the part, and warned him that \"If you get rid of this character in four episodes, you are throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nSeries co-creator Esther Shapiro later said that the character of Alexis was based on the Roman empress Livia, as characterized in the 1934 novel \"I, Claudius\". Of creating the character, Collins said in 2018:\nShapiro said in 1985 that she and costume designer Nolan Miller \"had the same vision\" for Alexis: Joan Crawford.\nThe character of Alexis is a foil for \"good girl\" Krystle (Linda Evans), with an opposing moral stature and attitude. Described as \"scheming, conniving, and ruthless\", Alexis was often called a \"suberbitch\" and the \"quintessential character you love to hate\" by critics.\n\nThough Maggie Wickman appeared briefly at the end of the first season finale as the veiled surprise witness, the role of Alexis was originated by Joan Collins in the first episode of the show's second season in 1981. Collins was an English actress with a prolific film and television career, best known at that point for appearing in the Bette Davis film \"The Virgin Queen\" (1955), and for B movies like \"Land of the Pharaohs\" (1955), \"The Stud\" (1978), and \"The Bitch\" (1979).\n\nThe addition of Alexis, as well as the Pollocks' change in the writing, were credited with lifting \"Dynasty\" in the ratings, and the character \"quickly set off a host of female imitators in other prime-time soaps.\" Producer E. Duke Vincent said of Collins in 2005, \"Joan Collins is the queen of the archetype … How do you get that? You get it in the storytelling, obviously, but the actress herself, her personality, brought something to that role which I don't think anybody else could have done.\" Spelling added, \"We didn't write Joan Collins. She played Joan Collins … We wrote a character, but the character could have been played by 50 people and 49 of them would have failed. She made it work.\" Collins said in 2012 that Larry Hagman's performance as J.R. Ewing on \"Dallas\" had inspired her to play Alexis.\n\nAlexis' annual catfights with Linda Evans' Krystle became eagerly anticipated, and Alexis would later have similar brawls with Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll) and Sable Colby (Stephanie Beacham). As the sixth season began, Collins was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show, seeking an increased salary. The first episode of the new season, which followed the \"Moldavian Massacre\" cliffhanger, was rewritten without Alexis. Collins reportedly signed a $60,000 per episode contract, and returned for the season's second episode.\n\n\"Dynasty\" declined in ratings in later seasons. Brought on for season nine, executive producer David Paulsen found that there was no money left in the budget for any shoots outside of the studio, which he felt were important for the show. He hoped to reduce costs for the season by, among other things, cutting Collins from 22 episodes to 11 (she ultimately appeared in 13). At that time, she reportedly earned at least $100,000 per episode. Paulsen also brought in Beacham as her \"The Colbys\" character Sable to play opposite Collins. The ninth season finale ended with several characters in peril, including Alexis and Dex plunging from a balcony, which Paulsen said \"meant that the following year we could get rid of anybody we wished.\" Paulsen said, \"I think Joan Collins was angry because she kind of saw what I was doing.\" Collins was subsequently quoted at the Cannes Film Festival saying that she would not return the next season. However, in May 1989, new ABC entertainment president Robert A. Iger cancelled \"Dynasty\", leaving the cliffhanger last episode of season nine as the series finale. The majority of the cast (including Collins) reunited for the two-part, four-hour miniseries \"\" in 1991.\n\nIn \"Dynasty\" first season finale episode, \"The Testimony\", Blake Carrington is on trial for killing his son Steven's male lover, Ted Dinard. A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears, and Blake angrily asks his lawyer: \"What's she doing here?\" Blake's daughter Fallon gasps in recognition, \"Oh my God, that's my mother.\"\n\nAs the second season opens with the episode \"Enter Alexis\", the character has not only a face but a name: Alexis Morell Carrington. She had been exiled from Denver by Blake after an affair with Carrington estate manager Roger Grimes; her testimony, that Blake has a violent temper, proves damaging to his case. At odds with his father, Steven is drawn to the mother he hardly remembers; Fallon, however, is devoted to Blake and has long held a grudge against Alexis, a grudge further fueled by her testimony. Fallon says to her mother:\n\nAlexis soon sparks the ire of Blake's wife Krystle, and brazenly moves into a cottage on the Carrington estate: her former art studio which she still owns, thanks to a technicality. The household staff remembers the first Mrs. Carrington all too well—especially longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders. Staunchly loyal to Blake, Joseph has a particular dislike for Alexis and has followed her scandalous adventures for years through the tabloids. Fallon, although not openly hostile, keeps an icy distance from Alexis and the two trade subtle barbs; Steven is seduced by his mother's apparent devotion to him, but soon gets a taste of her poison. According to Alexis, Fallon is not Blake's daughter at all: her father is really Blake's longtime friend and business rival, Cecil Colby. The secret eats at Steven, and Fallon eventually finds out. Ultimately, it is proven untrue. Alexis' consistent meddling and intrusions help improve Krystle's relationship with Fallon, Joseph, and the rest of the household staff, and they soon accept her unconditionally as Blake's wife. Alexis makes an enemy in Krystle when she purposefully fires a shotgun to make Krystle's horse throw her; the pregnant Krystle miscarries and is told she will probably be unable to have more. Alexis becomes romantically involved with Cecil, now Blake's adversary, but Cecil has a heart attack while in bed with her.\n\nIn 1982, Alexis and Cecil marry on his deathbed (episode 40), Cecil exacting a promise from Alexis that she will use his company ColbyCo to ruin Blake. Two episodes previously, after their infant grandson L.B. Colby (son of Fallon and Jeff Colby) is kidnapped, former spouses Blake and Alexis make a televised plea that he be returned. Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, Adam, had been kidnapped as a baby and had never been returned. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children, Fallon and Steven. Meanwhile, in Billings, Montana, an old woman named Kate Torrance tearfully tells her grandson Michael that he is really the Carrington heir. Armed with items from Adam Carrington's baby carriage, lawyer \"Michael\" comes to Denver and is eventually accepted as a Carrington; but like Alexis, his selfishness, greed and ambition put him at odds with all of his relatives at one time or another.\n\nIn episode 42, Alexis offers Adam a job at ColbyCo. When she also recruits Fallon's husband Jeff, Adam is jealous. Revealing his devious nature, Adam has Jeff's office painted with toxic paint. Gradually, Jeff's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. In episode 51, Alexis sends Jeff away on a vacation. Realizing that Jeff will \"recover\" when he's not breathing toxic fumes every day, Adam confesses to Alexis, who orders Adam to have the paint removed from Jeff's office. Adam warns his mother that if she betrays him, he will implicate her in the scheme, since Alexis used Jeff's poor health to trick him into signing over his son's shares in Denver-Carrington to her.\n\nIn episode 66, Alexis learns that Fallon is investigating Jeff's mysterious illness and warns Adam that if Fallon learns the truth that he's on his own. In return, Adam tricks Alexis into signing documents that make it look like she ordered the office to be painted. Alexis travels to Montana to investigate her son's background and learns from Dr. Edwards that Adam had experimented with drugs as a teen and suffered a psychotic breakdown. She becomes more sympathetic to Adam at this point, feeling guilty that they gave up the search for their lost son so many years ago, condemning him to such a tragic life. As she doesn't want his past drug addiction to be widely known, Alexis is resigned to suffer the consequences of his actions. Therefore, she gave up her control of Denver-Carrington.\n\nLater, in 1983, she becomes romantically involved with Farnsworth \"Dex\" Dexter, the son of a Denver-Carrington board member Sam Dexter, an old friend of Blake Carrington's. Dex has been sent by his father to understand why ColbyCo. abruptly abandoned its plans to acquire Denver-Carrington. In episode 69, Dex confronts Blake and his ex-wife Alexis Colby. Dex and Alexis are immediately drawn to each other. Dex gets the best of Alexis in a business deal (he discovers information in her office and acts on it before she can) and offers her a 60-40 split so they can work together. Although Alexis resists, by episode 72 they become lovers.\n\nTheir relationship is tempestuous and passionate. In episodes 82 and 83, Dex learns that Alexis has slept with Rashid Ahmed in order to sabotage a deal he has with Blake. A furious Dex confronts Alexis. She slaps him - and much to her shock, he slaps her back. Their fight soon turns to lovemaking. However, Alexis continues to demand independence from Dex and he turns to Denver-Carrington PR Director Tracy Kendall for solace in a one-night stand. Tracy tells Alexis about their affair, and Alexis ends their relationship.\n\nAfter Alexis was arrested for the murder of Mark Jennings in episode 88, Dex rallies to her defense and bails her out of jail. Once she is found guilty because Steven testified against her, Dex and Adam desperately try to clear her name. They eventually uncover evidence that Neal McVane is the killer, trying to frame Alexis for ruining him. Alexis is freed.\n\nSoon after, in 1984, a young woman named Amanda Bedford appears on Alexis' doorstep; she is Alexis' daughter, and as news of her spreads, Blake takes a special interest. He soon learns that Alexis was pregnant when he banished her decades before. Though Alexis insists that Amanda's father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake's daughter.\n\nUnaware of the brief affair Amanda had with Dex when they found themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, Alexis proposes Dex to marry her and, as he regrets his actions, he accepts the proposal. Later, Alexis becomes suspicious and tries to keeps Amanda out from Dex by marrying her to Prince Michael of Moldavia, son of King Galen that she had known years ago. But during the wedding celebration which takes place in the 15 May 1985 season finale \"Royal Wedding\", terrorists interrupt the ceremony in an attempt to kill Galen and spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor.\n\nAlexis survives the wedding massacre, as do most of the wedding guests, but she is kept as prisoner as the rebels want to sign a deal with ColbyCo. Eventually she is released when Blake pays ransom for her (and for Krystle who was also imprisoned). The King is missing and presumed dead, however, Alexis learns that he is being held for ransom. Dex agrees to help her rescue the King. They sneak into Moldavia where they are captured. In episode 125, Dex escapes and rescues Alexis and Galen. Upon returning to Denver, Dex refuses to let a paralyzed Galen recuperate in their home. Dex suspects (correctly) that Galen is feigning his paralysis and tries to force him to walk. When Alexis rushes to his defense, Dex is driven closer to Amanda. When Dex catches Alexis imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia (complete with crown) in episode 135, he is heartbroken. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again - only to be caught in the act by Alexis in episode 136. Alexis immediately flies to St Thomas for a quick divorce.\n\nIn the meantime, Alexis' younger sister Cassandra Morell is released from a Caracas, Venezuela prison, having been incarcerated years before after an incident involving Alexis and her then-paramour, Zach Powers. Calling herself Caress, the younger Morell comes to Denver and hopes to make a fortune by writing a scathing tell-all book about Alexis and exposing her sister's darkest secrets. Alexis finds out about the book, secretly buys the publishing company and scuttles the project.\n\nIn 1986, Alexis turns on Blake as she wants him again in her life (episode 137). When he refuses to have an affair with her, she decides to destroy him for good. She flies to Australia and encourages Blake's brother Ben to come back in Denver and claim his share of his late father's estate. Alexis commits perjury on the stand and helps Ben to win over Blake during the trial (episodes 141 & 142). Wanting revenge, Blake mortgages his house and holdings on the hope that he will gain control over ColbyCo. Thanks to Ben and Alexis, he loses both the house and the holdings and also his lucrative South China Sea oil leases. In the cliffhanger season finale, Alexis informs Blake she has bought his house. Furious, he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her.\n\nAlexis is saved when Krystle pulls Blake off of her. Weeks after, Blake finds a way to force Alexis and Ben to relinquish their ownership of Denver-Carrington and all its holdings back to him. Later on, Blake, Alexis, and Ben are in southeast Asia visiting an oil rig when it catches on fire. Ben rescues a trapped Blake moments before the rig explodes. Blake awakens in the hospital with no memories of the last 25 years. Alexis has him discharged from the hospital and convinces him that they're still married. However, when Krystle finds them, Blake's memories return.\n\nA handsome stranger saves Alexis from drowning in a river in 1987; dashing Sean Rowan soon sweeps her off her feet and they marry. Sean soon insinuates himself into her business, alienating Alexis' son Adam. It is revealed that Sean is actually the son of former Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders, and is bent on avenging his father (who committed suicide) and sister, Kirby (who had been ill-treated by Alexis). Sean has an affair with Leslie Carrington and schemes to destroy the family, but is ultimately killed by Dex after trying to kill Alexis.\n\nA body is found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property in 1988. The dead body turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was sleeping when she and Blake divorced. He had been dead for 20 years but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Grimes after finding him beating Alexis, and Blake's late father had hidden the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure, hidden there by Blake's late father. Roger's body had been disturbed from its hiding place by a man looking for the treasure. The man happens to have been hired by Alexis' cousin, Sable Colby who was looking for some embarrassing information on her ex-husband Jason. But Sable has not come to Denver for having a revenge on Jason only but also on Alexis, who has betrayed her at several times in the past. Most of the season's action revolves around the battle between Alexis and Sable.\n\nIn episode 220, the final episode of the series, at the Carlton Hotel Dex confronts Sable and Alexis for using him and throwing him aside. He mentions that Sable is pregnant, much to her chagrin. Alexis and Adam taunt Dex with the news, causing Dex to push Adam to the floor in frustration. When Dex turns his back, Adam rushes him. Dex falls backward into Alexis, sending them both crashing through a railing and falling off a second-story balcony while Adam, Sable, and Monica (Sable's daughter) watch in horror.\n\nTwo years after her fall at the Carlton, in 1991, Alexis (who managed to turn in mid-air and land on top of Dex, who \"didn't fare that well\") meets Jeremy Van Dorn, head of Trans-Media Relations, who convinces her she needs to diversify her business. However, Jeremy is actually working for an international consortium who has its eye on ColbyCo. When Alexis learns the truth and wants to put an end to their partnership, Jeremy tries to kill her but she gets saved at the last minute by Steven.\n\nThe additions of Collins as Alexis and the \"formidable writing team\" of Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock are generally credited with \"Dynasty\" rise in the Nielsen ratings in its second season, the start of the series' rise to #1. Collins's performance \"set off a host of female imitators in other prime time soaps.\"\n\nIn 2002, \"TV Guide\" ranked Alexis number 40 on its list of the 50 Greatest Television Characters of All Time. The magazine named her #7 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time, and in 2016 \"Rolling Stone\" ranked her #27 of their 40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time.\n\nIn 2015, executive producer Lee Daniels noted that Taraji P. Henson's character Cookie Lyon in his TV series \"Empire\" was partially based on Alexis. Praising Cookie and Henson, several journalists have compared Cookie to Alexis.\n\nCollins was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Drama Series every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1983. She was nominated for an Emmy Award for Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1984. In 1985, Collins shared a People's Choice Award for Favorite Female TV Performer with her co-star, Linda Evans. She won a \"Soap Opera Digest\" Award for Outstanding Villainess in 1984, and again in 1985.\n\nA \"Dynasty\" reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. Executive producer Sallie Patrick said in August 2017 that Alexis would be introduced during the first season, but that the role had yet to be cast. She later said, \"We knew Alexis was coming before we even started shooting the pilot, which allowed us to pave the way for her ... throughout the season, we hear Blake, Steven, and Fallon's memories about the woman who abandoned their family. So by the time she actually enters the series, we've established expectations about her character—which Alexis will happily break.\" The character has a cameo in the pilot episode, seen briefly in a flashback sequence. Patrick said in September 2017:\nThe role was cast with Nicollette Sheridan in November 2017. Sheridan, known for portraying Paige Matheson on \"Knots Landing\" and Edie Britt on \"Desperate Housewives\", had been absent from series television since her character was killed off \"Desperate Housewives\" in 2009. The CW president Mark Pedowitz, who had been president of ABC Studios during Sheridan's run on \"Desperate Housewives\", called her about the role himself. He said, \"I was big fan of Nicollette from way back when. She wanted it, and she will be great in it.\" Sheridan said of the \"Dynasty\" role, \"I thought [\"Dynasty\"] was such a splashy, fun, strong comeback. It was just the right thing at the right time.\" Sheridan admitted, \"I have always been attracted to playing the naughty girl. And for some reason, my audience loves seeing me in that role. It's challenging to make that person likable, and I get to do it again [with Alexis].\" Sheridan's casting was a key factor in the decision to give \"Dynasty\" a back nine order of episodes after the initial 13. Pedowitz said in January 2018, \"I'm disappointed in the ratings, I wanted it to do more, but I'm happy with the production values that Josh, Steph and Sallie are doing. There are changes coming, I'm thrilled to have Nicollette [Sheridan] ... I'm looking forward to Nicollette and Liz [Gillies] really going at it as a mother-daughter situation, and I think that will add some juice to the show.\"\n\nA press release announced that the character \"will return unexpectedly ... challenging Blake's marriage to Cristal, seeking to reunite with her children, and fighting to claim what is hers.\" Alexis first appeared in episode 16, \"Poor Little Rich Girl\", on March 23, 2018. Patrick said:\nPedowitz later said, \"Nicollette has been a great addition. She is a disrupting force, she is that diva.\"\n\nSheridan said that Alexis \"truly is a loving mother\", though \"sometimes she gets a little lost in her quest for power or manipulation.\" Of Fallon she noted, \"Fallon Carrington is fierce, and upon mama's return, she has met her match tenfold. Alexis has the experience and the wisdom that comes with age. So as brilliant as her daughter is, she's in trouble now. [The writers] are really exploring the mother-daughter relationship, which to me is the most complicated relationship on the planet, so I love that.\" Patrick said, \"It's been a blast writing for Alexis, who in our version is part Mildred Pierce (willing to do anything to help her daughter), part \"Blue Jasmine\" (delusional on the verge of a nervous breakdown), and Nicollette is perfect for the role. When she goes toe-to-toe with Fallon, it's electric.\"\n\nIn \"Poor Little Rich Girl\", Blake is eulogizing his father Thomas Carrington when a woman appears whom Fallon recognizes as her mother, Alexis. In \"Enter Alexis\", the Carringtons are shocked to discover that Thomas has left the mansion and the grounds to Alexis. Blake vows to overturn the codicil to Thomas' will as Fallon makes overtures to connect with her mother. Accused of abandoning her children, Alexis tells Fallon that Blake bribed a judge to seize custody and exile her, which Cristal confirms. Fallon soon discovers, however, that Alexis has not been living a life of luxury abroad, but is housed in a trailer nearby, and has stayed in touch with Steven. A furious Fallon confronts Alexis, and their catfight takes them into the pool. Through a bribe, Fallon ensures that the codicil is invalidated, but Alexis reveals that she does legally own Michael's stable house—her former art studio—and moves in. Her renewed influence over the household staff sets off Blake, who issues an ultimatum to them. Believing Steven's new fiancé Sam Jones to be a poor match for her son, Alexis tries to frame Sam for shoplifting in \"Don't Con a Con Artist\". Fallon thwarts the plan, and Sam assists her in a plot to expose Alexis' machinations to Steven. Fallon manipulates Alexis into confessing, but Steven is more mad at Fallon for endangering Sam. A tearful Alexis admits to Steven that she spent all of her money trying to find her and Blake's kidnapped first child, Adam.\n\n"}

The group uses street theater, graffiti, murals, sculpture and poetry to foster public discussion about the issues of social injustice and government accountability, and transparency. Anataban members see solidarity, courage, integrity, inclusion, non-violence and political neutrality as the important values guiding their work.\n\nThe South Sudanese Civil War began in 2013. The people live in fear because there is a high level of armed violence and sexual violence, mostly against women. The conflict has affected food production leading to hunger and poverty.\n\nIn September 2016, Anataban was founded in Juba by a group of South Sudanese visual artists, musicians, actors, poets, and fashion designers. The group was created in response to the South Sudanese Civil War. The campaign emerged from a collaborative workshop held in Naivasha, Kenya, with Pawa 254, a Nairobi-based hub for activists, journalists, and artists. In Juba Arabic, \"Ana Taban\", means \"I am tired\".\n\nIn \"The Guardian\", the Anataban collective said, \"We are tired of war and all the suffering that comes with it. We are tired of just sitting by and seeing our country burn. We are tired of having a country with vast natural resources and yet a crashing economy. We are tired of the fact that we have a beautiful cultural diversity that is destroyed by tribal animosity. We are tired of having a starving population yet we have a fertile land. We are tired of being used to kill ourselves for the benefit of a few\".\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the International Day of Peace Anataban distributed 1000 white handkerchiefs with the message \"we are sorry for what we have done to each other\" written on them. They spoke with people in the streets, apologizing for what they have had to endure in this country.\n\nIn 2017, Anataban launched the campaign \"#BloodShedFree2017\" It seeks a genuine and permanent ceasefire in South Sudan; security for all citizens; an end to ethnic targeting and violence; protection of the right to free speech; and a return to justice and the rule of law.\n\nAnataban's aim is to create a platform for the ordinary South Sudanese citizen to speak out and have their voice heard. Anataban aims to create awareness of the common struggles of the South Sudanese people, especially the insecurity of war. The basis of Anataban's work is to use artivism to engage and mobilize people through community dialogues on the issues affecting them.\n\nAnataban visits various communities with art, music, street theatre, murals, sculptures, and poetry. They use various platforms such as media opportunities and social media to speak out.\n\nAnataban have released two songs. The first, released in 2016, was titled \"Ana taban\" The song performed well on local radio stations and reached the South Sudanese diaspora via YouTube. The second song was titled \"Malesh\", an Arabic expression meaning \"I am sorry\".\n\nThe visual artists of the campaign have painted walls and containers around Juba with images that represent the messages of the campaign. These include anti war messages, and images that represent what the citizens are experiencing in the conflict. Some show positive messages that encourage people to make a difference. This is the first time such street art has been done in Juba.\n\nAnataban has a social media presence. The hashtag #Anataban has become a popular phrase used by South Sudanese youth on social media to express their frustration with the ongoing conflict. Anataban have also used short films to spread their ideas. Some of the videos have focused on the problem of hate speech and ethnic targeting.\n"}
{"id": "1435357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1435357", "title": "André Messager", "text": "André Messager\n\nAndré Charles Prosper Messager (; 30 December 1853 – 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty opéras comiques, opérettes and other stage works, among which his ballet \"Les Deux Pigeons\" (1886) and opéra comique \"Véronique\" (1898) have had lasting success; \"Les P'tites Michu\" (1897) and \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" (1919) were also popular internationally.\n\nMessager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, Camille Saint-Saëns and Gabriel Fauré. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the West End and some on Broadway; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included musical comedies for Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps.\n\nAs a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the Opéra-Comique, the Paris Opéra, the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from Mozart to Richard Strauss, and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of Wagner. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of Debussy's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\", Massenet's \"Grisélidis\" and Charpentier's \"Louise\". At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet.\n\nMessager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French opéra comique and opérette.\n\nMessager was born at Montluçon in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-Émile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Cornélie, \"née\" Lhôte de Selancy. He recalled, \"You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father\". At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a Marist school where he continued his interest in the piano.\n\nTowards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school. They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the École Niedermeyer in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music. This was at the time of the Paris Commune (1871), and to escape the violence in the city the school was temporarily evacuated to Switzerland. Messager studied piano with Adam Lausset, organ with Clément Loret, and composition with Eugène Gigout, Gabriel Fauré and (after leaving Niedermeyer's school) Camille Saint-Saëns. The musicologist Jean-Michel Nectoux comments that after his studies Messager developed into one of the finest orchestrators of the period.\n\nFauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators. In 1874 Messager succeeded Fauré as \"organiste du chœur\" (choir organist) at Saint-Sulpice, Paris, under the principal organist, Charles-Marie Widor. In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the Concerts Colonne at the Théâtre du Châtelet in January 1878. He won further prizes for his cantatas \"Don Juan et Haydée\" and \"Prométhée enchaîné\".\n\nIn 1879 Fauré and Messager travelled to Cologne to see Wagner's \"Das Rheingold\" and \"Die Walküre\", and later to Munich for the complete \"Ring\" cycle, \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\" and \"Tannhäuser\"; in 1888 they went to Bayreuth for \"Die Meistersinger\" and \"Parsifal\". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\" (c. 1888). This short, skittish piano work for four hands burlesques motifs from \"The Ring\". The two composers had a more serious collaboration, their \"Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville\" (1881).\n\nIn 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the Folies Bergère, and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, \"Fleur d'oranger\" (1878) and \"Les Vins de France\" (1879). In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Théâtre in Brussels. At his invitation, Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden. He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis church, and from 1882 to 1884 he was organist and choirmaster at Ste Marie-des-Batignolles, a small church in the north west of Paris, where his assistant was another young composer, Claude Terrasse.\n\nMessager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer Firmin Bernicat died leaving an unfinished opérette, \"François les bas-bleus\". Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers. It was staged in November 1883 at the Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques and was an immediate critical and popular success. It was later produced in London and New York. In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Saëns as the soloist at a concert in Le Havre, Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year. Fauré played the organ at the ceremony, and composed a mildly cynical song, \"Madrigal\", as a wedding present. There was one child of the marriage, Jean André Emile Charles (1886–1952).\n\nIn December 1883 Messager and Emmanuel Chabrier gave the first performance of the latter's \"Trois valses romantiques\" at the Société Nationale de Musique. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of \"España\", arranged by Messager. Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and opérettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, \"Gwendoline\", appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work.\n\nFollowing the success of \"François les bas-bleus\" Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an opérette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The opérette, \"La Fauvette du temple\", first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891. The ballet, \"Les Deux Pigeons\", which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.\n\nA month after the opening of \"La Fauvette du temple\" the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's opéra comique \"La Béarnaise\", with Jeanne Granier in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including Florence St. John and Marie Tempest, running for more than 200 performances. \"The Times\" said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career. A production of \"La Béarnaise\" in New York followed in 1887, under the title \"Jacquette\".\n\nIn 1886 \"Les Deux Pigeons\" was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, \"Le Bourgeois de Calais\" (1888), was not well received. Richard Traubner remarks in \"Operetta: A Theatrical History\" on its \"boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score\"; a contemporary critic wrote, \"That \"Le Bourgeois de Calais\" will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece.\" Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, \"Isoline\" (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act opérette, \"Le Mari de la reine\" (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it \"the best of my flops\".\n\nMessager's fortunes revived in 1890 with \"La Basoche\", produced with much success at the Opéra-Comique. The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on \"Le Bourgeois de Calais\" wrote of the new piece, \"an exceptionally pleasing work ... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity.\" An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by Richard D'Oyly Carte. The theatrical newspaper \"The Era\" said, \"\"The Basoche\" is more than a success; it is a triumph\", but the piece had only a modest London run of three months. A New York production was given in 1893 but was not a success.\n\nMessager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian D. Kern Holoman describes him as \"given to immaculately tailored suits emphasizing his thin frame, careful grooming with particular attention to his mustaches, fine jewelry, and spats ... a witty conversationalist with an inexhaustible store of anecdotes and \"bons mots\" and a womaniser. In the early 1890s Edith Messager, tired of her husband's infidelities, divorced him. Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily. By the time of her death in 1892 the two had become close again, and Messager felt her loss deeply.\n\nIn 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct \"Die Walküre\" at Marseille. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. \"Madame Chrysanthème\", staged at the Théâtre de la Renaissance in 1893, was a setting of Pierre Loti's story of a betrayed geisha, a theme that later inspired Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\"; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. \"Mirette\", produced by Carte at the Savoy Theatre in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original Savoy opera by a French composer. To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859–1938), known professionally as Hope Temple. She became Messager's second wife in 1895. According to Bernard Shaw, Messager, concluding from the reception of \"La Basoche\" in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent, decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible. It ran for 41 performances, was withdrawn and revised, and then ran for another 61 performances. Messager vetoed any production in Paris. His next opera, a serious work, \"Le Chevalier d'Harmental\" (1896), was unsuccessful, and for a while he and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near Maidenhead, Berkshire.\nFrom 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto:\n\nThis was the opérette \"Les P'tites Michu\", which was presented to great acclaim at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Its 1905 English adaptation in London ran for 401 performances. Soon afterwards he was appointed musical director of the Opéra-Comique, and in the commercial theatre had another outstanding success with \"Véronique\" (1898).\n\nIn 1898 Messager's only child from his second marriage, Madeleine Hope Andrée (d. 1986) was born. From that year to 1904 Messager's work at the Opéra-Comique left him little time for composition, particularly after 1901, when he also spent May to July at the Royal Opera House in London. He turned down W. S. Gilbert's offer of a collaboration, and wrote only two stage works between 1898 and 1914. His international fame as a composer nevertheless grew, with productions of \"Les P'tites Michu\" and \"Véronique\" in countries including Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the US. Unusually for the London stage at the time, \"Véronique\" was given in French in 1903. An English translation was staged the following year and ran for 496 performances. Messager conducted the first nights of both productions. The English version was staged in New York the following year, running for 81 performances.\n\nAt the Opéra-Comique, Messager conducted the premieres of Massenet's \"Grisélidis\" and Charpentier's \"Louise\", and gave the first French performances of operas as contrasted as \"Hansel and Gretel\" and \"Tosca\". But by far the best known of his premieres was Debussy's \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" (1902). Messager encouraged the composer to complete the opera and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. In gratitude Debussy dedicated the work to Messager. Holoman writes, \"his championing of \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" alone would have earned him a place in music history.\" Debussy regarded Messager as the ideal conductor. Before the premiere he had trusted him to \"make his dream into a reality\"; after it he praised him for knowing \"how to awaken the inner sound world of \"Pelléas\" with tender delicacy\". After Messager's commitments obliged him to leave Paris for London, Debussy found the performances much less satisfactory. As a conductor, Messager won praise on both sides of the English Channel. The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that, good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of \"Pelléas et Mélisande\" was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better. The Parisian critic Pierre Lalo said of Messager:\n\nFrom 1901 to 1907 Messager was one of the directors of the Grand Opera Syndicate, which ran the annual seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, featuring the leading singers of the day, including Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso. Much of his time was spent on administration, and he had limited scope for conducting. From 1901, for two years, Messager had an affair with the Scottish soprano Mary Garden, whom he met at the Opéra-Comique and conducted when she took over the title role of \"Louise\". She also appeared in a revival of his \"Madame Chrysanthème\". His first appearance as a conductor at Covent Garden was in 1902 for the first performance of \"Princess Osra\" by Herbert Bunning. He next conducted there in 1904 in the British premiere of Saint-Saëns's \"Hélène\", followed in 1905 by \"Carmen\", \"Don Giovanni\", \"Faust\", the world première of Franco Leoni's \"L'oracolo\", \"Orphée et Euridice\" and \"Roméo et Juliette\"; in his final year, 1906, he conducted \"Armide\", \"Carmen\", \"Don Giovanni\", \"Faust\", the British premiere of \"Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame\", and \"Roméo et Juliette\". In 1906 he also introduced to Covent Garden his ballet \"Les Deux Pigeons.\" Despite his reputation as a Wagnerian, he yielded the baton for Wagner performances to Hans Richter, widely regarded as the world's foremost exponent of Wagner's music. In 1906 Messager and the London Symphony Orchestra travelled to Paris to play a programme of English music at the Châtelet Theatre, including works by Sullivan, Parry and Stanford. When he left Covent Garden in 1907, the directors found it necessary to appoint two people to fill his place: Neil Forsyth as general manager and Percy Pitt as musical director.\nIn 1907 Messager returned to composition. His \"comédie lyrique\" \"Fortunio\" was presented at the Opéra-Comique with great success. In the same year he was appointed joint director of the Paris Opéra, responsible for the artistic direction, with Frederick Broussan, formerly director of the Lyons Opera, taking charge of administration. The partnership lasted until 1913, but its success was hampered by shortage of funds and internal disputes. Messager decided on a policy of making the Opéra \"more genuinely French\". He revived Rameau's \"Hippolyte et Aricie\", for the first time in Paris since 1767, and presented unusual French repertoire including Fauré's \"Pénélope\". Foreign opera was not neglected; Messager gave Paris its first complete \"Ring\" cycle, presented a Russian season starring Félia Litvinne and Feodor Chaliapin, and conducted the French premiere of Richard Strauss's \"Salome\". At the invitation of the Emperor Wilhelm II, Messager and Broussan took the Opéra company to Berlin in 1908. Relations between the two co-directors were not always harmonious; after the French government refused Messager's resignation on at least one occasion, he finally announced it in November 1913, a year before his term of office was due to expire. He consented to return in January 1914 to conduct \"Parsifal\" – its first performance in Europe outside Bayreuth. His conducting of the work won critical praise.\n\nOn the strength of his experience as a Wagnerian, Messager was appointed conductor of the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1908. It was at the time, and for many years, the most prestigious symphony orchestra in France, and Messager was determined that it should enjoy the international prestige of the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras. Alongside the main orchestral repertoire of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt and French classics, Messager conducted major choral works by J. S. Bach, Handel, Schumann and Berlioz, as well as introducing early French music such as that of Janequin. In the 1913–14 season, he conducted a chronological cycle of Beethoven's symphonies and his \"Missa solemnis\", as well as Verdi's \"Requiem\", for the Italian composer's centenary. Messager took the orchestra outside Paris to Lille, Lyon and Antwerp during these years. During the First World War he took the orchestra on tour to Argentina (1916), Switzerland (1917), and the US and Canada (1918–19), giving concerts in more than 50 cities. After their concert at the Metropolitan Opera House in October 1918, the orchestra and Messager received a prolonged ovation that was typical of their reception as the tour progressed. At the end of that tour Messager retired from his post.\n\nMessager was criticised for performing the music of Wagner during the war, but he maintained that German music represented the noble side of the enemy nation's nature. Like Fauré, Messager refused to have anything to do with the National League for the Defence of French Music (La Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française), led by Saint-Saëns, which sought to boycott German music.\n\nIn 1914 Messager composed \"Béatrice\", described as a \"légende lyrique\", based on the 1911 play \"The Miracle\". The premiere was in Monte Carlo. The work was performed in Paris in 1917 but was not successful. In 1915 Messager joined with other musicians in contributing compositions to \"King Albert's Book\" to raise money for \"the relief of the suffering Belgian people\"; the other composers included Debussy, Elgar, Mascagni and Saint-Saëns.\nIn 1919 Messager's operetta \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" was premiered in Birmingham prior to a long run in the West End. The composer, who generally conducted British premieres of his works, was suffering from sciatica and could not even be in the audience for the first nights in either city. The work received its Paris premiere at the Théâtre Marigny in 1925, and it ran for 143 performances on Broadway. Later in 1919 Messager resumed the musical directorship of the Opéra-Comique for the 1919–20 season, conducting among other works the first complete performance in France of \"Così fan tutte\".\n\nIn the 1920s, Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences. He collaborated with Sacha Guitry on the musical comedies \"L'Amour masqué\" (1923) and \"Deburau\" (1926), starring Yvonne Printemps. The former was a considerable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the Lord Chamberlain, declared it \"unfit for the English public\", and banned C. B. Cochran's planned production starring Printemps and Guitry. In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's \"L'Étoile\". Fauré, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of \"L'Amour masqué\" and wrote to Messager, \"Your wit is the same as always – it never grows old – and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning\". Fauré died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of \"Deburau\" to his memory.\n\nIn 1924 Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of Auric's ballet \"Les Fâcheux\" and Poulenc's \"Les Biches\". In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the BBC for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to George Edwardes, whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.\n\nAfter a short illness Messager died in Paris on 24 February 1929 aged 75. He was interred in the Passy Cemetery near the graves of Debussy and Fauré. His last completed work, the opérette \"Coups de roulis\", was running in Paris when he died. A contemporary critic commented, \"Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made \"Véronique\" such a success. Throughout his life Messager remained without a peer as a composer of light music.\"\n\nMessager was elected President of the Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the Légion d'honneur. In his native town of Montluçon, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour. In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Musée des musiques populaires de Montluçon, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the \"comité d'honneur\" of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers Susan Graham, Dame Felicity Lott and Mady Mesplé, the conductors Sir John Eliot Gardiner, John Nelson and Michel Plasson, and the director Jérôme Savary.\n\nIn his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Fauré, Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him \"already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades\", and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on \"the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects\". He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked \"that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer\". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.\n\nGervase Hughes, in a study of French opérette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was \"one all too common to many composers of operetta – too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity\", although such was Messager's \"innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry\". One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for chromaticism; this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His \"Eh que ne parliez-vous?\", from \"La Basoche\", was quoted note-for-note by Poulenc in \"Les Mamelles de Tirésias\". Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In \"Madame Chrysanthème\" he made use of leitmotifs, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.\n\nUnlike some older contemporaries such as Saint-Saëns and Massenet, Messager remained open to new ideas and idioms throughout his life, and his style evolved to match the spirit of the times. His biographer and former pupil Henry Février commented that from classic opéras comiques, such as \"La Basoche\", Messager's later works, such as \"Les P'tites Michu\" and \"Véronique\", show a difference in style, \"bringing an altogether fresher approach to the genre.\" Towards the end of his career Messager successfully moved to \"comédie musical\", the French form of musical comedy.\nBallets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are opéras comiques (9), opérettes (7) and comédies musicales (3). The composer remarked late in his career:\n\nAlthough Messager called some of his early stage works opéras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with opérette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of opérette to that of opéra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre. Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but \"La Fauvette du temple\" (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with \"an Offenbach lilt\". Hughes judges the next two scores, \"La Béarnaise\" and \"La Fauvette\" (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries Planquette, Serpette and Lecocq.\n\nWagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score \"Les Deux Pigeons\" (1886). The piece is based on the fable \"The Two Pigeons\" by Jean de La Fontaine. The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the \"Entrée de tziganes\". Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version. In 1961 John Lanchbery revised this for Frederick Ashton's new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from \"Véronique\". This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the Royal Ballet and has been staged by such other companies as CAPAB and Australian Ballet.\n\n\"Isoline\" (1888), a musical fairy story (\"conte des fées\"), is neither an opérette nor an opéra comique. Writing in 1908, Fauré called it \"one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years\", but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when Reynaldo Hahn staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes. The whole piece was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.\n\nThe decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of \"La Basoche\" (1890). Février in his \"André Messager: Mon Maître, Mon Ami\" calls it \"the last of the great nineteenth-century French comic operas\" (\"le dernier des grands opéras-comique français du XIX siècle\") and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre. Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece. The musicologist James Harding rates it \"the best Messager had written to date ... one of his finest works\". When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in \"The Times\" called it, \"A work of great beauty and charm\", although \"the influence of \"Die Meistersinger\" is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming\".\n\nWith \"Madame Chrysanthème\" (1893), a four-act \"lyric comedy\" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by Puccini for \"Madama Butterfly\" (1904): a young Japanese geisha wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor. Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity – reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising opérette to the level of \"comédie lyrique\" – but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre. Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager. Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's, but add that the almost total eclipse of \"Madame Chrysanthème\" by \"Madama Butterfly\" may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti. After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.\n\nThe works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. \"Le Chevalier d'Harmental\" (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opéra comique (\"in a somewhat pretentious style\") was a failure, and an unpretentious opérette in the same year, \"La Fiancée en loterie\", fared no better. After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes \"Les P'tites Michu\" (1897) as \"a sensational hit\", and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opérettes so far (classing \"Le Basoche\" as opéra comique, as did its composer). The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Traubner describes the piece as \"one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better\". Setting a scene in the market of Les Halles was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: \"clever, lilting ... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain\". He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.\n\nThe final work from the decade was \"Véronique\". Messager described it as an opéra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of opérette and opéra comique. The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the \"Swing duet\" (\"Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette\") and the \"Donkey duet\" (\"De ci, de la\"). When the work was revived at the Proms in London in the 1960s, the music critic of \"The Times\" commented, \"Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that – thanks perhaps to Gilbert – redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan ... but \"Véronique\" has plenty of pretty things\". It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.\n\nMessager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between \"Véronique\" and the period after the First World War. \"Fortunio\" (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a sung-through opera. Eight decades later the critic Edward Greenfield described it as \"a long-buried jewel of a piece ... an improbable cross between musical comedy and \"Tristan und Isolde\"\". From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more opéras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, \"Monsieur Beaucaire\", a \"romantic operetta\" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on \"Messager's English operetta\" as over-sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes. Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is \"pure Edward German\" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres.\n\nOf Messager's 1920s comédies musicales the best known is \"L'Amour masqué\" (1923). The Théâtre Édouard VII where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a tango, \"a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time\".\n\nMessager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Fauré, he was fond of the poetry of Armand Sylvestre, and from \"La Chanson des cerises\" in 1882 to the cycle \"Amour d'hiver\" in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from Victor Hugo to Frederic Weatherly (author of among other things \"Danny Boy\").\n\nIn his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity. The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with sonata form in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the adagio and a scherzo third movement. Looking back he described it as \"très classique\". In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of Mendelssohn and possibly Schumann may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro \"con moto\" first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.\n\nWhen Messager was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal \"Le Ménestrel\" remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre – opérette – official status and recognition; but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had \"seen all, heard all, and remembered all\". The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Fauré called him \"familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new\". Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, \"I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too.\" Like Fauré, Messager wrote musical criticism for \"Le Figaro\" and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Fauré, who was known for his kindly reviews, Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.\n\nIn 1908 Fauré wrote of Messager, \"There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary\". \"Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians\" says of Messager, \"His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety.\" In his book \"Composers of Operetta\", Hughes comments that Messager combined \"a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's\" and in much of his music \"a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Saëns's aristocratic elegance, even Fauré's refined subtlety\". He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: \"Auber, Rossini and Meyerbeer were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of \"les Six\". ... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by Adolphe Adam in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out\".\n\nThe wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by \"Le Menéstral\", which said that he \"has served Wagner, Debussy, Fauré, Ravel and Stravinsky when their works were still struggling for recognition\". He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, \"His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra\". The music critic Pierre Lalo wrote that under Messager's direction, \"Parsifal\", without losing any of its grandeur, \"assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order ... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this.\" Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, \"[Messager] is not a master of the theatre [\"chef du théâtre\"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait.\" Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor:\n\nIn 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, of \"Les Chasseresses\" and \"Cortège de Bacchus\" from \"Sylvia\" by Delibes, Sérénade and Mules from \"Impressions d'Italie\" by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from \"Samson et Dalila\" and the Prelude to \"Le Déluge\", both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from \"Capriccio espagnol\" by Rimsky-Korsakov and \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" by Saint-Saëns. In Wagstaff's 1991 study of Messager, the list of recordings of the composer's music runs to 40 pages; 24 of his works are represented in the list of recordings up to that date.\nComplete recordings exist of several of Messager's stage works. There are three complete sets of \"Véronique\" – a 1953 mono recording for the Société française du son conducted by Pierre Dervaux, a 1969 stereo EMI recording conducted by Jean-Claude Hartemann, and a 1998 recording sung in English, conducted by J. Lynn Thompson. Other complete sets include \"L'Amour masqué\" (1970; conductor, Raymond Legrand), \"La Basoche\" (1960; Tony Aubin), \"Coups de roulis\" (1963; Marcel Cariven), \"Fortunio\" (1987; John Eliot Gardiner), \"Isoline\" (1947; Louis Beydts), \"Monsieur Beaucaire\" (1958; Jules Gressier), and \"Passionnément\" (1964; Jean-Paul Kreder).\n\nSingers who have recorded individual numbers by Messager include role creators such as Jean Périer (\"Véronique\"), Lucien Fugère (\"La Basoche\"), Pierre Darmant and Yvonne Printemps (\"L'Amour masqué\"), Koval (\"Passionnément\"), Marcelle Denya (\"Coups de roulis\"), and Maggie Teyte (\"Monsieur Beaucaire\"), as well as other contemporaries – Aino Ackté, Emma Eames, and John McCormack – whose recordings have been reissued on compact disc. Singers of the next generation who recorded Messager numbers included Georges Thill and Ninon Vallin. More recent examples include Mady Mesplé, Susan Graham, and Felicity Lott. \n\nOf Messager's non-operatic works, his \"Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville\", written jointly with Fauré, has been recorded by, among others, Harmonia Mundi, conducted by Philippe Herreweghe (1989). Messager's other collaboration with Fauré, the Wagner send-up \"Souvenirs de Bayreuth\", has been recorded by piano duettists including Kathryn Stott and Martin Roscoe (1995, Hyperion), and, in an orchestral arrangement, by the orchestra of the Bayreuth Festival. A suite from \"Les Deux Pigeons\" has been recorded several times, for example by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducted by Hugo Rignold (1948) and by Charles Mackerras (1958); in 1993 Decca recorded the complete score with the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard Bonynge. The Symphony in A has been recorded by the Orchestre Symphonique du Mans, conducted by Jose-Andre Gendille (2001).\n\nSingle act, except where shown\n\n\n\nFor solo voice with orchestral accompaniment\nFor solo voice with piano accompaniment\nSource: \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\"; L'académie nationale de l'opérette; and Wagstaff: \"André Messager\".\n\n\n"}

Rainbow first became a church chorister when his family moved to Clapham, and he was intrigued by watching the organist play. \n\nAfter another move he attended Rutlish School in Merton. Even though he still at school, Bernarr was appointed the organist and choirmaster at St James's, Merton, later holding similar posts at St Mary's, East Molesey and St Andrew's, Wimbledon.\n\nAfter his family moved to Hampton Court, Bernarr attended Trinity College of Music between 1933–1939, where he was a pupil of Dr William Lovelock. His 21st birthday was marked by a reception and dance at Hampton Court attended by 80 guests. While studying at Trinity he earned a living in the Map Branch of the Land Registry near Lincoln's Inn. Rainbow's studies were interrupted by World War II and he served with the Army in North Africa and Italy, until he was invalided out in 1944. In 1941 Rainbow married Olive Grace Still (1915–1996), at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Merton; composing the music for the service himself.\n\nIn September 1944 he became Organist of the Parish Church of All Saints, High Wycombe and, a few months later, the Senior Music Master at Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe. He made a considerable public impact at High Wycombe. He produced Gilbert and Sullivan operettas at the Royal Grammar School, put on concerts at the Parish Church, and started a week-long annual Festival there in 1946. Bernarr's pupils won awards and scholarships and in 1947 representatives from 30 local choirs joined in Handel's Messiah. Bernarr conducted the High Wycombe String Orchestra and was the soloist in his own Piano Concerto. In 1951 the High Wycombe Parish Church Choir was chosen to sing Evensong in the Festival Church on the new South Bank site. He turned the Royal Grammar School at High Wycombe into a singing school. Bemarr realised that the quality of music teaching in schools was paramount. This meant focussing on the teachers themselves. So in 1952 he became Director of Music at The College of St. Mark and St. John, Chelsea, the Church of England College for teachers, a remarkable community whose members have stayed friends. Later he became Head of Music at Gypsy Hill College, now Kingston University, and retired in 1978.\n\nHis distinguished record was acknowledged when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College in the following year. He was President of the Campaign for the Defence of the Traditional Cathedral Choir and in 1996 he established the Bernarr Rainbow Award for School Music Teachers.\n\nBernarr Rainbow died in Esher, Surrey on 17 March 1998 at the age of 83.\n\nDLitt, PhD, MEd, ARCM, LGSM, LRAM, FTCL, HonFTCL, FRSA\n\nThe Bernarr Rainbow Trust was set up by Rainbow and Professor Peter Dickinson in 1996 to support projects connected with music education. The Trust now runs an annual award for school music teachers in conjunction with the Institute of Education, University of London; has presented five Bernarr Rainbow Lectures in London [published as Music Education in Crisis - the Bernarr Rainbow Lectures and other Assessments, Boydell, 2013]; and supports the publication of Rainbow's books and his series of Classic Texts in Music Education.\n\n\nThe personal papers of Bernarr Rainbow are held in the Archives of the Institute of Education, University of London , and the catalogue of his papers can be accessed through the online catalogue.\n\n\n"}

It is the way in which the brands within a company’s portfolio are related to, and differentiated from, one another. The architecture should define the different leagues of branding within the organization; how the corporate brand and sub-brands relate to and support each other; and how the sub-brands reflect or reinforce the core purpose of the corporate brand to which they belong. Often, decisions about brand architecture are concerned with how to manage a parent brand, and a family of sub-brands – managing brand architecture to maximize shareholder value can often include using brand valuation model techniques.\n\nBrand architecture may be defined as an integrated process of brand building through establishing brand relationships among branding options in the competitive environment. The brand architecture of an organization at any time is, in large measure, a legacy of past management decisions as well as the competitive realities it faces in the marketplace.\n\nThere are three key levels of branding:\n\n\nProcter & Gamble is quoted by many authors as the antithesis of a corporate brand (Asberg and Uggla, Muzellec and Lambkin, Olins). \"However, this situation changed in 2012. After more than 150 years of invisibility of the organization for consumer, the brand developed corporate brand promise during the 2012 Olympic games. Commercials are aired on television around a message thanking all the \"moms\". In addition, each of their products is associated with the brand \"PG\" in advertisements for products.\n\nA recent example of brand architecture in action is the reorganization of the General Motors brand portfolio to reflect its new strategy. Prior to bankruptcy, the company pursued a corporate-endorsed hybrid brand architecture structure, where GM underpinned every brand. The practice of putting the \"GM Mark of Excellence\" on every car, no matter what the brand, was discontinued in August, 2009. In the run-up to the IPO, the company adopted a multiple brand corporate invisible brand architecture structure. The company's familiar square blue \"badge\" has been removed from the Web site and advertising, in favor of a new, subtle all-text logo treatment.\n\nAmbassador Brands\nThose brands that reflect the image of the company are Ambassador Brands. Success or Failure of these brands affect the favorable or unfavorable opinion respectively, of the company.\nE.g.: Colgate toothpaste, the market leader in toothpaste segment in India, can be rightly called Ambassador brand.\n\nPiggyback Brands\nThe nature of these brands is to live on other brands. They are not profit generators but build their image and gain mileage by riding on the back of these brands.\nE.g.: Colgate toothbrush is a piggyback brand which survives on the back of Colgate Toothpaste.\n\nBudget Brands\nThese brands signify those that are welcomed in every home. They do not lower the status of the upper-middle-class families as well as are affordable by the lower-class homes too.\nE.g.: Cibaca toothpaste can be described as budget brand which is mainly targeted in rural areas of India.\n\nStructuring a company brand portfolio can involve choosing a strategy based upon a number of variables, including the business strategy, market trends, competitive tactics, and sources of growth and profit. Often marketing mix modeling is used to help understand the role of brands in a portfolio, and how they support or cannibalize one another. A strong parent brand can be leveraged across multiple sub-brands to help maximize Return on Marketing Investment. Managing brand architecture to maximize shareholder value can often include using brand valuation model techniques.\n\nIn the UK, the term \"brand architect\" is sometimes used, but it is worth noting that the title architect is a legally protected title controlled by the Architects Registration Board.\n"}
{"id": "2994351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2994351", "title": "Buda Castle", "text": "Buda Castle\n\nBuda Castle (, ) is the historical castle and palace complex of the Hungarian kings in Budapest. It was first completed in 1265, but the massive Baroque palace today occupying most of the site was built between 1749 and 1769. The complex in the past was referred to as either the Royal Palace () or the Royal Castle (, ). The castle now houses the Hungarian National Gallery and The Budapest History Museum.\n\nBuda Castle sits on the south tip of Castle Hill, bounded on the north by what is known as the Castle District (), which is famous for medieval, Baroque and 19th-century houses, churches and public buildings. The hill is linked to Clark Ádám Square and the Széchenyi Chain Bridge by the Castle Hill Funicular. The castle is a part of the Budapest World Heritage Site, so declared in 1987. \n\nThe first royal residence on the Castle Hill was built by King Béla IV of Hungary between 1247 and 1265. It is uncertain whether it was situated on the southern tip of the hill or on the northern elevation, near the Kammerhof.\n\nThe oldest part of the present-day palace was built in the 14th century by Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, who was the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Only the foundations remain of the castle keep, which was known as Stephen's Tower (Hungarian: \"István-torony\"). The Gothic palace of King Louis I was arranged around a narrow courtyard next to the keep.\n\nKing Sigismund significantly enlarged the palace and strengthened its fortifications. Sigismund, as a Holy Roman Emperor, needed a magnificent royal residence to express his prominence among the rulers of Europe. He chose Buda Castle as his main residence, and during his long reign it became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late Middle Ages. Buda was an important artistic centre of the International Gothic style.\n\nConstruction began in the 1410s and was largely finished in the 1420s, although some minor works continued until the death of the king in 1437. The palace was first mentioned in 1437, under the name \"fricz palotha\".\n\nThe most important part of Sigismund's palace was the northern wing, known as the Fresh Palace (Hun: \"Friss-palota\"). On the top floor was a large hall called the Roman Hall () with a carved wooden ceiling. Great windows and balconies faced toward the city of Buda. The façade of the palace was decorated with statues, a and coat-of-arms. In front stood the bronze equestrian statue of Sigismund, later repaired by King Matthias Corvinus.\n\nThe southern part of the royal residency was surrounded with narrow \"zwingers\". Two parallel walls, the so-called \"cortina walls\", run down from the palace to the River Danube across the steep hillside. The most imposing structure, the Broken Tower (Hun: \"Csonka-torony\"), on the western side of the \"cour d'honneur\", remained unfinished. The basement of the tower was used as a dungeon; the top floors were probably the treasury of the royal jewels.\n\nThe last phase of large-scale building activity took place under King Matthias Corvinus. During the first decades of his reign the king finished the work on the Gothic palace. The Royal Chapel, with the surviving Lower Church, was likely built at that time.\n\nAfter the marriage of Matthias and Beatrice of Naples in 1476, Italian humanists, artists and craftsmen arrived at Buda. The Hungarian capital became the first centre of Renaissance north of the Alps. The king rebuilt the palace in an early Renaissance style. The \"cour d'honneur\" was modernised and an Italian \"loggia\" was added. Inside the palace were two rooms with golden ceilings: the Bibliotheca Corviniana and a passage with the frescoes of the twelve signs of the Zodiac. The façade of the palace was decorated with statues of John Hunyadi, László Hunyadi and King Matthias. In the middle of the court there was a fountain with a statue of Pallas Athene.\n\nOnly fragments remain of this Renaissance palace: some red marble balustrades, lintels and decorative glazed tiles from stoves and floors.\nIn the last years of his reign Matthias Corvinus started construction of a new Renaissance palace on the eastern side of the Sigismund Courtyard, next to the Fresh Palace. The Matthias Palace remained unfinished because of the king's early death. The palace had a monumental red marble stairway in front of the façade. Matthias Corvinus was usually identified with Hercules by the humanists of his court; the bronze gates were decorated with panels depicting the deeds of Hercules, and a great bronze statue of the Greek hero welcomed the guests in the forecourt of the palace complex, where jousts were held.\n\nThe walled gardens of the palace were laid out on the western slopes of the Castle Hill. In the middle of the enclosure, a Renaissance villa was built by Matthias. Only one column survives of this so-called \"Aula Marmorea\".\n\nAfter the death of Matthias Corvinus, his successor, King Vladislaus II, carried on the works of the Matthias Palace, especially after his marriage with Anna of Foix-Candale in 1502.\n\nUnder the reign of King John Zápolya (the last national ruler of Hungary) the palace was repaired. On the southern tip of the Castle Hill, the Great Rondella was built by Italian military engineers. The circular bastion is one of the main surviving structure of the old palace.\n\nAfter the Battle of Mohács, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary collapsed. The Ottoman Turks occupied the evacuated town on 11 September 1526. Although Buda was sacked and burned, the Royal Palace was not damaged. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent carried away all the bronze statues (the Hunyadis, Pallas Athene and Hercules) with him to Constantinople. The statues were destroyed there in a rebellion a few years later. The Sultan also took many volumes from the Corvina library.\n\nIn 1529 the Ottoman army besieged and occupied Buda again, and the palace was badly damaged. On 29 August 1541 Buda was occupied again by the Ottomans, without any resistance. Buda became part of Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Eyalet of Budin.\n\nAlthough Turkish travel writers wrote enthusiastically about the beauty of the palace of the Hungarian kings, the new Ottoman government let the palace decay. It was partially used as barracks a storage place and stables, and otherwise it stood empty.\n\nThe palace was called \"Iç Kala\" (\"Inner Castle\") and \"Hisar Peçe\" (\"Citadel\") by the Turks. The name of the \"cour d'honneur\" was \"Seray meydani\". The favourite nickname of the complex was \"Palace of the Golden Apples\".\n\nThe economic decline of Buda the capital city during the Ottoman conquest characterised by the stagnation of population, the population of Buda was not larger in 1686, than the population of the city two centuries earlier in the 15th century. The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal place to fall into ruins. The amortised palace was later transformed into a gunpowder storage and magazine by the Ottomans, which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686. The original Christian Hungarian population didn't feel secure during the Ottoman conquest, their numbers significantly shrank in the next decades, due to their fleeing to the Habsburg ruled Royal Hungary. The number of Jews and Gypsy immigrants became dominant during the Ottoman rule in Buda.\nIn the era between 1541 and 1686, the Habsburgs tried to re-capture Buda several times. Unsuccessful sieges in 1542, 1598, 1603 and 1684 caused serious damage. The Ottoman authorities repaired only the fortifications. According to 17th-century sources, many buildings of the former Royal Palace were roofless and their vaults collapsed. Nonetheless the medieval palace mostly survived until the great siege of 1686.\n\nThe medieval palace was destroyed in the great siege of 1686 when Buda was captured by allied Christian forces.\n\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed Western European Christian campaign was started to take the city. This time the Holy League's army was much larger, consisting of 65,000–100,000 men, including German, Hungarian, Croat, Dutch, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers and other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen and officers. The Turkish defenders consisted of 7,000 men.\n\nIn a heavy artillery bombardment, many buildings burned and collapsed. The Stephen's Tower, used as a gunpowder store by the Ottomans, exploded when hit by a single cannon, said to have been fired by a friar called Gábor, also referred as Tüzes Gábor (\"Gabriel Fiery\"). According to contemporary sources, the explosion killed as many as 1,500 Turkish soldiers and caused a wave on the Danube that washed away artillery batteries and guards standing on the opposite shore.\n\nHabsburg military engineers made several plans and drawings of the buildings in subsequent decades. Although the walls mainly survived, the burned-out shell rapidly decayed from a lack of maintenance. Between 1702 and 1715, Stephen's Tower disappeared completely, and the palace was beyond repair. In 1715, King Charles III ordered the demolition of the ruins. Johann Hölbling surveyed the still-existing structures. The king ordered the surviving marble statues, antiquities, inscriptions and coins should be spared (there is no evidence about the realization of the royal decree). The main part of the palace and the Broken Tower were totally demolished, the hollows and moats were filled and a new flat terrace was established. The southern fortifications, zwingers and rooms were buried under tons of rubbish and earth.\n\nIn 1715 a small Baroque palace was built according to the plans of Johann Hölbling. It was a simple rectangular building, with an inner court and a shorter side wing, which was later demolished. The Hölbling palace is identical with the core of the present-day palace, where the Baroque Court of the Budapest Historical Museum is now located.\n\nThe interior of the palace was left unfinished when work stopped in 1719. The Hofkriegsrat commissioned Fortunato di Prati to make several plans for the palace, but lack of money hindered their implementation.\n\nIn 1723 the palace was accidentally burned down and the windows were walled up in order to stop further deterioration. Several drawings from the 1730s and 1740s show the unfinished decaying shell of the simple two-storey blockhouse. Some engravings show an idealised finished version which never existed. Sometime around 1730 the roof was repaired.\n\nIn 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich, President of the Hungarian Chamber, appealed to the public to finish the derelict palace by means of public subscription. Palatine János Pálffy called upon the counties and cities to award grants for the project. The moment was favourable because relations between the Hungarian nobility and the Habsburgs were exceptionally good. The Hungarians supported Queen Maria Theresa in the dire need of the War of the Austrian Succession. The queen was grateful for this, and the new Royal Palace became the symbol of peace and friendship between the dynasty and the nation.\n\nThe plans of the splendid, U-shaped Baroque palace with a \"cour d'honneur\" were drawn by Jean Nicolas Jadot, chief architect of the Viennese court. After 1753 the plans were modified by his successor, Nicolaus Pacassi. Ignác Oraschek, master builder, who guided the works, and modified the plans according to his own ideas. The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 13 May 1749, which was the Queen's birthday. The work continued at a good pace until 1758, when financial difficulties caused a seven-year break. By that time only the interiors were left unfinished.\n\nAccording to surviving historical documents, the layout of the palace followed Jadot's signed plans of 1749. The façades, some interior elements and the St. Sigismund Chapel are the works of Nicolò Pacassi, while the special double false domes were probably planned by Oraschek, formerly the master builder of Count Grassalkovich. Double false domes were typical features of the so-called Grassalkovich-type Baroque castles like Gödöllő. However, this feature was later removed from the palace.\n\nIn 1764 the Queen visited the palace and allotted 20,000 thalers a year for the work, which recommenced in 1765 according to the plans of Franz Anton Hillebrandt. Hillebrand altered the \"cour d'honneur\" façade of the central wing in Rococo style. In 1769 the St. Sigismund Chapel was consecrated and the palace was finished the same year. According to the aggregate statement of Grassalkovich, the costs were 402,679 forints.\n\nThe future of the complex was uncertain; the Queen had no intention to use it as a royal residence, because she did not spend much time in Buda. In 1769 she gave one wing to the Sisters of Loreto, who came from Sankt Pölten. The building was handed over on 13 May 1770, but the elegant Baroque rooms were considered unsuitable for a nunnery. Alexander Keglevich, rector of the Eötvös Loránd University, had provided financing to Maria Theresa, which supposedly should have been repaid, according to her letters to her children and friends. In 1777 the Queen decided that the University of Nagyszombat should move to Buda.\n\nThe nuns moved out and the palace was hastily adapted to use as a university. The work was guided by Farkas Kempelen and led to classrooms, teacher's cabinets, museums, a library and a university press being built. In the front, the false dome was removed and a four-storey observatory tower, planned by Alfred Hillebrandt or Karl Georg Zillack was erected.\n\nIn 1778 Hillebrandt built a new chapel for the first king of Hungary, Saint Stephen's, the mummified right hand, which was recovered by Queen Maria Theresa from the Republic of Ragusa in 1771. The Chapel of the Holy Right was situated near the St Sigismund Chapel, in the middle of an inner court. The outer form was octagonal and the inside was oval, crowned by a dome. The altar-piece was painted by Joseph Hauzinger.\n\nThe ribbon-cutting ceremony of the university was held on 25 June 1780, the 40th anniversary of the coronation of the Queen. The throne room became a splendid aula decorated with frescoes depicting the four faculties. In 1953, two grisaille frescoes were discovered on the shorter sides of the room.\n\nFunctional problems of the university remained unresolved, which led to the faculties being moved to Pest in 1783. In 1791 the palace became the residence of the new Habsburg palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary, Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria. After the early death of the palatine in 1795, his younger brother Archduke Joseph succeeded him, followed by Archduke Stephen. The palatinal court in Buda Castle was the centre of fashionable life and high society in the Hungarian capital.\n\nIn 1810 the palatinal palace was damaged by fire, but in the next decades, plans were made to raise the building with an upper storey, but they were not implemented, although the observatory tower, which hindered the work, was removed. In 1838 the crypt of the St. Sigismund Chapel was rebuilt according to the plans of Franz Hüppmann: the Palatinal Crypt was the burial place of Palatine Joseph and his family. The crypt is the only part of the palace that survived the Second World War.\n\nPalatine Joseph established gardens on the southern and eastern hillsides of the Castle Hill according to the plans of Antal Tost. The gardens of Buda Castle were among the most famous English-style landscape gardens in Hungary.\n\nPalatine Stephen left the palace on 23 September 1848 when a break between the liberal Hungarian government and the dynasty became inevitable.\n\nOn 5 January Buda was occupied by the Austrian army led by Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz. The chief commander lodged in the royal palace.\n\nOn 4 May 1849, the Hungarian army, led by Artúr Görgey, laid siege on Buda Castle, which was being defended by General Heinrich Hentzi. On 20 May the Hungarians captured Buda with an assault. The palace was the last stronghold of the Austrian troops, and became a site of heavy artillery fighting. The ensuing fire consumed the central and southern wings; they were completely burned out and their interiors were destroyed.\n\nThe palace was rebuilt between 1850 and 1856 by Josef Weiss and Carl Neuwirth. The 13-axis central wing was raised with a third storey and a squat attic-tower. The central risalit was decorated with a balcony of six colossal columns. With these changes, the former Viennese Baroque palace of Maria Theresa became considered a more austere Neoclassical Baroque building.\n\nThe ballroom was redecorated with marbles and stuccoes. After 1853 stately rooms were designed in a French Rococo style, with white-gold stuccoes and furniture from the Hofburg. The palace was already too small for the needs of the royal court, so the kitchens and service rooms were housed in the neighbouring Zeughaus. The palace was connected with the Zeughaus by a glassed passageway.\n\nOn the western side of the \"cour d'honneur\" two smaller buildings were erected, using plans by Weiss and Neuwirth in 1854. The two-storey \"Stöckl\" housed the apartments of the archdukes and imperial officials, whereas the Wachlokal was built for the royal guards.\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph I of Austria visited Buda Castle in 1856 and 1857. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, Franz Joseph was crowned king of Hungary. The palace played an important part in the lavish ceremony and was a symbol of peace between the dynasty and the nation.\n\nIn the last decades of the 19th century Budapest experienced rapid economic development. Ambitious urban planning projects were carried out to express the growing wealth and higher status of the Hungarian capital, with special attention being paid to the rebuilding of Buda Castle. The autonomous Hungarian government intended to create a royal palace to match any famous European royal residence (especially their old rival, Vienna's Hofburg). The rebuilding spanned forty years, between 1875 and 1912, and caused sweeping changes in topography of the entire area.\n\nFirst the Várkert-bazár (Royal Garden Pavilion) was built on the embankment of the Danube, at the foot of the Castle Hill, between 1875 and 1882. This Neo-Renaissance gateway was designed by an Hungarian architect named Miklós Ybl. The structure was an open arcade, with pavilions, stairways and ramps, and two blocks of flats. Ybl also built a new waterworks pumping station, named Várkert-kioszk (Royal Garden Kiosk), and two stair towers against the medieval cortina walls. The southern stair tower followed French Renaissance style, resembling a small turreted castle, while the northern stair tower was similar to a Gothic brick donjon (a fortified main tower from a castle, also called a keep). Only Várkert-bazár and Várkert-kioszk survive currently.\nIn 1882 Prime Minister Kálmán Tisza charged Ybl with drawing a master plan for rebuilding the palace. In his 1885 plan, Ybl preserved the old Baroque palace, but mirrored it on the western side of the \"cour d'honneur\", which doubled the size of the residence. He also planned a new carriageway on the western hillside, demolishing the medieval walls and towers of the Újvilág-kert terrace. The narrowness of the natural plateau of the Castle Hill meant there was not enough space for the new Krisztinaváros wing, which Ybl solved by erecting a substructure down to the foot of the hill. The monumental western façade sits on this windowless, three-storey high substructure. The whole block covered almost the entire hill, but the main façade on the \"cour d'honneur\" had the same modest height as the Baroque palace. The façade was clad with stone slabs, while the old parts are stuccoed; hence, the difference between the original Baroque and the Neo-Renaissance wings is obvious. The formerly open \"cour d'honneur\" became a closed court with an arched gateway, guarded by the four lions of the sculptor, János Fadrusz. The court is called Lions Court (or \"Oroszlános udvar\").\nThe work began on 1 May 1890, but Ybl died on 22 January 1891. His successor, Alajos Hauszmann, slightly modified the plans of the Krisztinaváros wing. In 1896 the building reached the level of the court, and King Franz Joseph ceremoniously laid down the foundation stone of the palace, which was soon completed.\n\nIn 1893, the 25th anniversary of King Franz Joseph's coronation was celebrated in the Royal Palace. However, the old banqueting hall proved to be too small, so Hauszmann enlarged the room by knocking down and reconstructing the wall towards the \"cour d'honneur\" (which additionally had the Hillebrandt façade).\n\nIn spite of this expansion and Ybl's new wing, the palace was still deemed insufficient for great royal celebrations, so another round of construction began. The north wing, standing on the site of the old Zeughaus, was completely designed by Hauszmann. The architect doubled the Baroque palace on the Danube side, generally imitating its traditional architectural style. At the meeting point of the old and the new wings, a colonnaded portico was erected, with a lavishly-decorated tympanum (with allegorical statues by Károly Sennyey) and a flight of stairs called the \"Habsburg Stairs\". The whole palace was crowned with a dome with a copy of the Crown of St. Stephen at its apex. The dome, like other details of the north wing, shows German \"Jugendstil\" influences, as does the rear façade towards the western forecourt. This forecourt also contains the Matthias Fountain (Hungarian: \"Mátyás kútja\") by sculptor Alajos Stróbl. Above the main gate, towards Szent György tér, stood a statue of the Goddess Hungaria. This side was the main façade of the complex, but it was much shorter and less characteristic than the long Danube façade. The old Chapel of the Holy Right was demolished to make room for a carriageway.\nHauszmann designed a new riding school in the former Újvilág terrace, which was now named the \"Csikós\" court, after the Csikós statue of György Vastagh (now in the western forecourt). In front of the long Danube façade, an equestrian statue was erected in honour of Prince Eugene of Savoy, the victorious leader of the Habsburg army in the Battle of Zenta. The eastern forecourt was closed off with a lavish wrought-iron rail, which ended in a pillar crowned by a statue of the legendary Turul, the sacred bird of the Magyars, spreading its wings above Budapest. Two flights of stairs led up to the Szent György tér, which was on much higher ground.\n\nIn the western forecourt, Hauszmann designed a new neo-Baroque guardhouse and rebuilt the old Royal Stables. The Royal Gardens on the southern hillside were famous for their precious plants, glass houses and picturesque terraces. In the middle of the gardens stood the Swiss House of Queen Elisabeth, furnished with Hungarian folk art objects. The house was built above the ruins of the medieval gatehouse, partially making use of them.\n\nThe interior of the palace was decorated and furnished exclusively with works of the leading Hungarian artists of the age. The Royal Palace was officially inaugurated in 1912. Contemporary critics praised it as the most outstanding Hungarian building of the turn of the 20th century.\n\nThe Hauszmann palace existed for around three decades: on 30 December 1916, the building played a part in the coronation ceremony of the last Hungarian king, Charles IV of Hungary. After the 1918 revolution and the removal of the Habsburg dynasty, the Royal Palace became the seat of the new regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, Miklós Horthy. Horthy lived in the Krisztinaváros wing with his family between the years of 1920 and 1944. In this era the palace was the centre of Hungarian political and social life. Famous guests entertained by Horthy in the palace included King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy in 1937 and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) in 1938.\n\nOn 16 October 1944 a Nazi German commando unit, led by Otto Skorzeny, occupied the Royal Palace and forced the regent to abdicate. Buda Castle was the last major stronghold of Budapest held by Axis forces during the siege of Budapest between 29 December 1944 and 13 February 1945. The German and Hungarian forces defending the castle attempted to break the Soviet blockade on 11 February 1945, but failed. Allegedly the Soviet Red Army knew about their plans and had aimed heavy weapons at the possible escape routes hours earlier. This is considered one of the biggest disasters of Hungarian military history.\n\nHeavy fights and artillery fire rendered the palace into ruins. The furniture vanished, roofs and vaults collapsed and the southern and western wings were burned out. The destruction was comparable to that of the great siege of 1686.\n\nImmediately after the war, archeological research was begun in order to unearth the remains of the medieval castle. The research, led by László Gerő (1946–1966) and László Zolnay (1967–1979), was likely the biggest castle excavation in Europe. The former Royal Gardens stairways, pavilions and glass houses, which dated from the turn of the 20th century, had to be sacrificed. Important parts of the former Sigismund and Matthias Palace had survived under the thick earth fill.\nThe first reconstruction plan of the medieval remains was written by László Gerő in 1950 and finalised in 1952. The reconstruction work was finished in 1966. Contrary to the generally accepted principles of historic reconstruction, the medieval fortification system was rebuilt in its entirety. Important elements like the 16th century Great Rondella and the medieval Gatehouse, the Mace Tower, the walls and the zwingers were reconstructed according to the results of the archaeological research and contemporary pictorial evidence. The low-lying southern wing of the Gothic palace was also reconstructed, together with the vaulted Gothic Hall and the Lower Church of the former Royal Chapel. Medieval-style gardens were planted in the zwingers. The foundation of the Stephen's Tower was unearthed, but as archaeological evidence was lacking, the tower was not reconstructed. The remains of the Broken Tower were covered again.\n\nThe large-scale reconstruction of the medieval fortifications substantially changed the cityscape of Budapest. At the time it was considered a highly successful project, reconciling historical authenticity with urban-planning demands.\n\nIn the 1970s, archeological research continued on the northern and western side of the palace, led by László Zolnay. It produced many important achievements, including the Late Gothic Buda Castle Statues. The Karakash Pasha Tower, in the \"Újvilág Garden\", was a Turkish-era tower demolished at the end of the 19th century. Photographic evidence enabled its reconstruction, but the new tower was only a copy of the original, and the details are not considered authentic.\n\nThe government made a decision about reconstruction only in 1948. According to contemporary photos, all the important interiors were in a damaged state, but their reconstruction was technically possible. The new communist government of Hungary considered the Royal Palace a symbol of the former regime. Therefore, Hungarian leaders chose to thoroughly modernise the interior and exterior of the palace. Architectural trends played a part in the decision, as modernist architects had condemned the Hauszmann style as \"too ornate\".\n\nThe first modernist reconstruction plan was made by architect István Janáky in 1950. His controversial concept was later modified. In 1952 the Hungarian government asked for help from Poland, because they had successfully rebuilt Warsaw and, indeed, other cities. A delegation of Polish experts, led by the architectural historian Jan Zachwatowicz, proposed the rebuilding of the Hauszmann palace.\n\nDuring the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the remaining interior, including the rooms and halls that were undamaged, were destroyed. Important exterior details, such as the main entrance, the Habsburg Steps, the dome, the Royal Stables, the guardhouse and the riding school were demolished, and the remaining façades were simplified. In Lions Court the ornate gates of \"King's Stairs\" and \"Diplomat's Stairs\" were demolished. The doorway of the castle church disappeared, as did the chapel. The detailed Neo-Baroque roofs were simplified and plain new windows were installed. The allegorical sculpture group of the tympanum was destroyed.\n\nAt the same time however, medieval elements that were uncovered were reconstructed in what was thought their appearance was. No precise drawings existed of the medieval elements, therefore an approximate reconstruction of their appearance was done.\n\nThe modernist dome was designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961 after Italian Baroque models. The palace was rebuilt by 1966, but the interior spaces were ready only in the 1980s. Buda Castle became a cultural centre, home to three museums and the National Széchényi Library.\n\nIn March 2006 the National Office of Cultural Heritage finalised the long-term development plan of Buda Castle. Asserting that the modernisation in 1952–66 caused irreversible damage, they proposed the partial reconstruction of the façades, including the dome and the Habsburg Steps. No decision has been reached about the realization of the development plan.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány chose the medieval King's Cellar in Buda Castle as the place to announce the list of the \"most important public works projects\", which was financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013.\n\nIn 2008 an international consortium began to build an underground garage for 700 cars under the former Csikós Court. The developer was granted permission to demolish a section of the 15th-century castle wall. The demolition was carried out in spite of criticism from archeologists and the public. The area had been previously excavated by archeologists, who discovered many important finds, including medieval children's toys and a tooth from the pet leopard of King Matthias Corvinus. Additionally, the area outside the inner walls was used as a garbage dump during the 15th–17th centuries. However, financial difficulties interrupted the construction of the garage in 2009; work resumed for a short time in November 2011 but stopped again after the completion of the concrete basement slab. The government granted 1.3 billion forint for the completion of the project in 2015 after the half-built garage was bought by the state. \n\nThe castle courtyard was also used as the setting for Katy Perry's 2010 music video, \"Firework\", part of her \"Teenage Dream\" album.\n\nIn 1958–1962, architect László Gerő partially recreated the façades of the Gothic castle facing the narrow southern, western and eastern courts. Only the ground and first floors were reconstructed; the castle was originally much higher. The unfinished façade stops at the level of the Baroque terrace above, with two windows opening towards the southern court and another two opening towards the eastern court. The four almost-identical windows are square, four-panel stone constructions of very fine Gothic craftsmanship, with their outer frames decorated with small columns. One window, which had been walled up, was discovered \"in situ\" during archeological research, and the others were reconstructed from fragments by the sculptor Ernő Szakál by means of anastylosis. The ground floor openings are simpler. An arched stone doorway gives access to the southern court from the cellar under the Gothic Hall.\n\nThe façade was originally plastered. The whitewashed surface was decorated with a painted pattern in a rusty hue, resembling rustication. Fragments of painted geometrical decoration, a common feature on the medieval buildings of Buda, were discovered on the eastern façade, but it was not restored.\n\nA Gothic balcony tower projects from the wall at the end of the eastern façade. Its reconstruction was a much debated issue, because the balcony tower goes above the level of the Baroque terrace, disturbing the harmonious panorama of the palace. On the other hand, it clearly indicates that there are higher, missing floors.\n\nThe balcony tower is a two-storey structure standing on a wide stone basement. The first floor is a solid stone wall without any openings and the niche behind it belongs to the Gothic Hall. The second floor has a balcony with three windows; it is now closed off by a glass wall. Originally it would have been part of an important ceremonial room. The balcony is in the shape of half an octagon. The three Gothic double lancet windows are considered the most important architectural elements of the tower and the profiles; frames and mullions were restored in a simplified form, using many of the original stones. The tower is covered with a flat metal roof.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is connected to Stephen's Castle (\"István vár\") on the western side. It was named after Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Built in the 1340s–1370s, it is the oldest part of the medieval royal palace. Only the foundation and three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms survive.\n\nStephen's Tower (\"István torony\") was the keep of Stephen's Castle. However, it was destroyed by an explosion in 1686. The ground floor walls were discovered a little time after 1946. It was a square building (11.7 × 11.1 m), built upon the rock surface of Castle Hill. The walls are 2.31 to 2.7 m thick with narrow arrowslits on the southern, western and northern sides. The original doorway, on the eastern side, was walled up after the Gothic Hall was built in the 15th century.\n\nStephen's Tower was originally a free-standing structure, sited differently from later buildings. The triangle in front of it was walled up to create a continuous southern façade for the palace. During post-war reconstruction, this part of the façade (with a broken stone doorway) was not reconstructed. A vaulted room (6.2 × 6.3 m) on the ground floor was still intact in 1820, according to a contemporary drawing. Although the ribs, corbels and key stone were discovered during archeological research, the room was not reconstructed. A spiral stairway had connected the room with the missing higher floors.\n\nThe remaining part of the Stephen's Castle (with the barrel-vaulted rooms behind) has a simple stone façade with a Gothic doorway. The pointed arch was later restored.\n\nThe interior from the time of Maria Theresa and Franz Joseph was mostly destroyed during World War II and the post-war reconstruction, excluding the Palatinal Crypt, which survived both. Little information exists about the interiors from the medieval and Baroque eras, but the palace built at the turn of the 20th century was meticulously recorded, using detailed descriptions, photographic documentation and grounds plans. Architect Alajos Hauszmann said about the royal apartments: \"I created a long series of rooms, longer than any similar royal apartments in continental Europe except Versailles.\"\n\nA series of rooms from the medieval castle were unearthed and reconstructed during the post-war rebuilding of Buda Castle in 1958–62. They are now part of the permanent exhibition of the Budapest History Museum in \"Building E\" of Buda Castle.\n\nOnly a fragment of the medieval castle survived the destruction of 1686–1715. The surviving rooms are not considered the most important ones; and none of the more famous rooms and buildings mentioned in the medieval sources exist today. The rooms which were unearthed after 1946 were only saved by chance and by their geographical position at a lower level than the newly created Baroque terrace. The Gothic Hall and the Palace Chapel were built by King Sigismund Luxemburg at the beginning of the 15th century. The castle wing is surrounded by a complex system of medieval fortifications.\n\nThe first chapel in the castle was probably built in the 14th century during the reign of Louis I of Hungary. Eberhard Windecke claimed in his Chronicle that Charles II of Hungary was murdered in 1386 in a room from which the royal chapel could be seen. The chapel was again mentioned in the Chronicle of Lorenzo de Monacis, which was written around 1390.\n\nKing Sigismund of Luxemburg thoroughly rebuilt the old Anjou castle during the first decades of the 15th century. He erected a Gothic church in place of the former chapel. The Anjou castle's façade was now facing towards the inner palace courtyard, and the long chancel was projecting from the eastern side of the palace. The chancel was built upon a lower church due to a lack of space on the narrow plateau. The church had a nave and an chancel. The flamboyant Royal Church of Buda Castle was similar to the more famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.\nArcheological research proved the date of the church, because 15th-century strata were discovered under the intact brick floor of the lower church.\n\nIn November 1489, Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire sent the relics of John the Almoner to King Matthias Corvinus. The King placed the relics in the Royal Chapel, which was re-dedicated and embellished with Renaissance furniture. In 1526, Buda was plundered by the Ottoman Turks after the Battle of Mohács. The relics were rescued in time and carried to Pressburg, where they are still kept currently. A surviving church inventory from 1530 shows a wealth of furnishings. Later, King János Szapolyai converted the lower church into a bastion. The large Gothic windows were walled up; and only the rectangular arrow slits were left open.\n\nIn 1541 the Ottoman Turks captured Buda without resistance, and the Royal Church ceased to be a place of Christian worship. The upper church was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda, and the ruins were demolished in 1715. The vault of the lower church collapsed, and the interior was filled with rubbish. The remains were then buried under the new Baroque terrace for two centuries.\n\nThe ruins of the lower church were discovered by archeologists in 1949–50. The remains were buried in 1953 because of conceptional disputes about the possible reconstruction. The chapel, finally reconstructed by 1963, was re-consecrated in 1990.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is one of the most important surviving example of secular Gothic architecture in Central Europe. It was built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in the early 15th century as an extension of the earlier Anjou palace. It was built on the southern edge of the natural rock plateau of Castle Hill. The level difference between the plateau and the southern court was about . A vaulted cellar was built under the hall to span this difference.\n\nThe Gothic Hall is an irregular rectangle of , with a closed niche on the eastern side, which is the inside of the balcony tower. It is divided into two naves with Gothic rib vaults. The vaults are supported by two massive pillars which come up through the floor from the cellar beneath the room, and in addition, half-pillars in the corners support the ribs. All six vaults are quadripartite, and the two on the inner side are irregularly shaped.\n\nThe hall has four windows, two on the southern side and two on the eastern side, with stone benches in the window niches. The Hall was connected to the palace through a door in the northern wall, supposedly on the place of the original doorway. The northern section of the floor is three steps higher.\n\nAll the newly built side walls were plastered and painted white, while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, pillars, arches and window niches were restored by sculptor Ernő Szakál in 1961–62. The ribs have a simple profile, but fragments of a more complicated type were also found in the rubble, together with keystones. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room, but they were built into the reconstructed vaults by restorers in the 20th-century.\n\nThe northern pillar of the Gothic Hall was already discovered by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century. The remains were buried under the outbuildings of the Royal Gardens, and Hauszmann protected the medieval pillar by building a brick shaft around it.\n\nThree interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms belong to the oldest part of the palace, Stephen's Castle, which was built by Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, in the 14th century. The northern room is larger () than the southern ones (). The northern room is covered by an east-west axial vault while the southern rooms have north-south axial vaults.\n\nThe southern room is connected to the inner courtyard by a doorway. There is a small window high on the western wall. The middle room has a similar window. The larger northern room has three slit windows, one facing west and two facing north, all had iron rails. The rooms were connected to each other with carved Gothic corbel doors. The walls were originally plastered. In the southern room, a medieval stairway led to a trapdoor and a medieval toilet hidden in the empty space between the walls of the castle and the keep.\n\nThe barrel vaulted rooms were supposedly used as a prison in the Middle Ages. Later the southern vaults collapsed. The intact barrel vault of the northern room was broken by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century when he filled the cellar with rubble. The barrel-vaulted rooms were restored in 1958–1962.\n\nA medieval cellar north of the barrel-vaulted rooms, later called \"Albrecht pince\" (Albrecht Cellar), is covered with a Gothic brick barrel vault. The walls are blackened from burning. The cellar was probably built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg as the \"Cisterna Regia\", i.e. the great underground cistern of the palace.\n\nThe Cisterna Regia was situated under the former northern zwinger of the palace. This small rectangular courtyard became a private royal garden during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The private garden was an early Renaissance \"giardino segreto\" (hidden garden). It was designed by architect Chimenti Camicia in the 1470s. A well in the middle of the garden was fed by the cistern underneath.\n\nThe hidden garden, the well and the cistern survived the 1686 siege of Buda. They were indicated on the plans of the area drawn by military architect Joseph de Haüy in 1687. In 1715–1724 the former Cisterna Regia became the cellar of the new Baroque palace. A section of this room was later used as an ice chamber.\n\nThe King's Cellar (\"Király pince\") is not a medieval structure, but a Baroque-era brick cellar under the Danube side of Building E. It was filled with tons of earth and rubble, and the original eastern façade of the medieval royal palace survived under the fill. The inner walls of the Baroque palace were actually built upon the old façade. Only the basement section of the original façade remained.\n\nThis wing was built by King Sigismund of Luxenburg in the early 15th century and was rebuilt by King Matthias Corvinus 50 years later. The surviving eastern façade was built from large, finely carved blocks of stone. It followed the contour of Castle Hill with a break in the middle. A buttress was added and a rectangular tower with two buttresses on its corners. The lower part of a balcony on the tower was reconstructed, with three elegant Gothic corbels decorated with cusps.\n\nIt was not possible to demolish the King's Cellar because the whole Baroque palace was resting upon it; the inner fill was removed in 1961. The medieval façade was reconstructed inside the cellar space between 1961 and 1965. Large windows were cut in the outer wall of the cellar to let in the daylight. Currently, the architectural history of the palace is discernible by viewing the interwoven layers of the past.\n\nOn 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány chose the King's Cellar as the place to announce the list of the \"most important public works projects\", financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013.\n\nThe old ceremonial rooms were as follows:\n\nThe \"Zenta\" Room (\"\"Zenta\" előterem\") was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the audience antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the central wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the large painting of the Battle of Zenta contained therein.\n\nThe Audience Antechamber (\"Fogadási váróterem\") was situated north of the ballroom on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called \"Antichambre Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin\" (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Antechamber\"). The room gave access to Maria Theresa's private apartments from the ballroom. In the early 1900s, the audience antechamber became part of the ceremonial apartments and had the same white-golden Rococo stucco decoration as the white antechamber on the other side.\n\nThe Grand Throne Room (\"Nagy trónterem\"), formerly known as the ballroom (\"Nagyterem\"), on the first floor of the Baroque wing had several layers of Baroque decoration from the second half of the 18th and the 19th century. Two surviving drawings record the oldest form of the room. Jakob Schmutzer's drawing from 1777 shows the opening ceremony of the Eötvös Loránd University after it was moved to the palace. The room had a Late Baroque decoration with double grooved Corinthian pilasters between the windows and stucco garlands. The walls were decorated with Vinzenz Fischer's frescoes of the four faculties. József Pollencig's drawing from 1795 shows a ball scene in the \"Prunksaal\". The pilasters were kept, but the frescoes were already covered, and the whole room was stuccoed. On the vault the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary can be seen. After the destruction of the 1849 siege, the room was redecorated in Neo-Baroque style. In 1892 the old ballroom was rebuilt with a new ceiling and a gallery towards the Lions Court; three of its side walls were preserved. It was enlarged again after 1896. The function of the ballroom was given to another new hall and this room was converted into the main throne hall instead. In the early 1900s, the room had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with three large chandeliers.\n\nVinzenz Fischer's frescoes were re-discovered in 1953 during the post-war reconstruction. In spite of this, all the decoration layers were destroyed. Today it houses the Gothic altar collection of the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\nThe White Antechamber (\"Fehér előterem\") is on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated south of the throne room. In the Baroque era it was called \"Zweyten Antichambre\" (\"second antechamber\"). In the early 1900s it had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a white Rococo stove.\n\nThe \"Coronation\" Room (\"\"Koronázás\" előterem\"), also on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the white antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the southern wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the painting of Franz Joseph I's coronation as King of Hungary after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.\n\nThe old royal apartments are as follows:\n\nThe Small Throne Room (\"Kis trónterem\"), which was situated next to the Audience Antechamber on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called \"Audienz-Zimmer\" and was part of the Empress' private apartments. In Hauszmann's time it was converted into the throne room of the palace, with a simple Baroque throne under a baldachin. It had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo tile stove.\n\nThe \"Circle\" Tearoom (\"\"Circle\" teaszalon\") was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and situated next to the small throne room, in the corner of the southern wing. In the Baroque era it was called \"Gesellschaft Zimmer Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin\" (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Parlour\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo tile stove. The furniture consisted a Rococo parlour suite.\n\nThe Antechamber was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated next to the \"circle\" tearoom with two windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called \"Ankleide-Zimmer Ihrer Majestät der Kaiserin\" (\"Her Majesty the Empress' Dressing Room\") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. It was connected to another small room, the \"Frauen Kammer\". In Hauszmann's time the walls were largely clad with wallpaper. The furniture consisted a Rococo tile stove, chairs and paintings. The last small room of the Empress, the former \"Schreib cabinet\" (\"writing room\"), with one window opening on to the Danube, later became a simple passageway.\n\nThe Smoking Room (\"Dohányzó szalon\") was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated in the middle of the Danube side of the old palace. In the Baroque era it was called \"Schlafzimmer Ihrer k.k. Majestäten\" (\"The Imperial Couple's Bedroom\"). It was the only common room of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I. In the early 1900s, the walls were largely hung with wallpaper. The furniture consisted a Rococo parlour suite and paintings. In the old imperial apartments only the ceilings had the typically white-golden stucco decoration, used in the old ceremonial apartments.\n\nThe Writing Room (\"Írószoba\") was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was formerly part of the private apartments of Francis I. One window opened to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called \"Ankleidecabinet S.M. des Kaisers\" (\"Emperor's Dressing Room\"). It was connected to another small room, the second dressing room. Later, the imperial dressing room was divided with a wall; with half being converted into a simple passageway, the other into a small writing room. In the early 1900s the latter's walls were largely clad with a very ornate Rococo wallpaper. It had a white marble mantelpiece with a large Rococo mirror above.\n\nThe Parlour (\"Társalkodó terem\"), on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was part of the private apartments of Francis I. It was situated in the corner of the southern wing with 2+3 windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era the room was divided with a wall, one half named \"Empfangs Zimmer S.M. des Kaisers\" (\"Imperial Audience Room\"), the other \"Arbeits Cabinet\" (\"Study\"). In Hauszmann's time, it was converted to a great parlour with wallpaper clad walls, a Rococo tile stove, a chandelier, paintings, chairs and a mirror.\n\nThe Antechamber, on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was the last room of the former private apartments of Francis I. In the Baroque era it was called \"Zweyten Audienz Zimmer\" (\"second audience room\"). In Hauszmann's time the walls were mainly clad with wallpaper, and it had a Rococo tile stove, a chandelier, paintings and chairs.\n\nThe rooms of the south wing are as follows:\n\nThe Baroque Court (\"Barokk udvar\"), a rectangular court, which is the oldest part of the Baroque palace. Here the original 18–19th century façades survived, and in 1997 the court was covered with a glass roof and became the main exhibition hall of the Budapest History Museum.\n\nThe King's Staircase (\"Király-lépcső\"), the Baroque main staircase of the southern wing gave access to the private apartments of Emperor Francis I. Both the King's Staircase and its northern twin, the Diplomat's Staircase, had ornate gates opening onto Lions Court, decorated with telamons. The kitchens were originally situated on the ground floor of the southern wing, but they were relocated by Hauszmann.\n\nThe central wing had the following rooms:\n\nThe Diplomat's Staircase (\"Diplomata-lépcső\") was the Baroque main staircase of the central (originally northern) wing and gave access to the private apartments of Maria Theresa. In the 18th century there was an officer's dining room and a smaller kitchen on the ground floor and another dining room with a cafe kitchen on the first floor. The southern and northern (later central) wings had the same ground plan: all the rooms opened from a passageway running along the sides of a rectangular central court. The two monumental stairways were rebuilt by Hauszmann in Neo-Baroque style.\n\nSt Stephen's Chapel, known before as St. Sigismund Chapel, or Castle Church (\"Szent Zsigmond-kápolna\", \"Vártemplom\") was the chapel royal in the western end of this wing, which had no façades, only a door opening onto Lions Court (through an antechamber). Construction was finished in 1768 and the church was consecrated in 1769. The ground plan was drawn by Nicolaus Pacassi, with the interior was designed by his follower, Franz Anton Hillebrandt. The ground plan followed a typical \"violin\" form favoured in the Baroque church architecture of Central Europe at that time. It had a rectangular chancel and a nave with four bays for side altars. On the first and the second floors two oratories opened into the chancel and a two-storey high gallery was situated above the entrance. In 1777–78 a new door was opened in the first side bay to give access to the new chapel of the Holy Right. An engraving from 1771 to 1780 shows the original interior design in its completed form: double pilasters, windows with segmental arches, stucco and false marble decoration, double oratory windows and a doorway with a stucco veil drawn aside by flying putti. The church was slightly rebuilt by Hauszmann, who demolished the Chapel of the Holy Right in 1899 and built a new chapel for the relic behind the chancel (converting a small recess). This chapel was decorated with the golden Venetian mosaics of Károly Lotz. A new Neo-Baroque main altar was built in the church in 1899.\n\n20th-century photos testify that the church survived in its Baroque form until the war. During a siege, the vaults of the church partially collapsed and the furniture was plundered. The Castle Church was left decaying for more than a decade. In 1957 the remaining two vaults collapsed, and the church was totally destroyed and converted to exhibition spaces. The altar table was rescued and re-erected in Pilisvörösvár in 1957. The Lotz mosaics from the Chapel of the Holy Right were also rescued and re-assembled in Balatonalmádi.\n\nThe Palatinal Crypt (\"Nádori kripta\") was under the former palace chapel and is the only surviving room of the whole Royal Castle. The underground crypt was first used as a burial place between 1770 and 1777. In August 1820, Elisabeth Karoline, Palatine Joseph's infant daughter was buried in the crypt. Seventeen years later, the Palatine's 13-year-old son Alexander Leopold followed. Palatine Joseph decided to convert the crypt into a family mausoleum and commissioned Franz Hüppmann with the task. The work was finished in 1838, and other members of the Palatine's family were reburied here. Palatine Joseph himself was interred on 13 January 1847. The crypt was continuously used by the Hungarian branch of the Habsburg family. It was repeatedly restored and enriched with new works of art, frescoes, statues and ornate stone sarcophagi, made by renowned artists of the 19th century. The last member of the family buried there was Archduchess Klotild in 1927. The crypt survived the war unscathed and was spared during the post-war reconstruction.\n\nThe crypt was looted in 1966 and 1973 (during the construction works), when some corpses were thrown out of the sarcophagi by the thieves. The human remains were later identified and reburied. The crypt was restored in 1985–1987. Since then the Palatinal Crypt is part of the exhibition of the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\nThe main lobby (\"Előcsarnok\") of the Royal Palace was situated in Hauszmann's Northern Wing On the Danube side. It was a long, rectangular hall divided into four sections with free standing Ionic columns and two square pillars. The section at the southern end was elevated a few steps. Nine arched windows opened towards the Danube. In the middle of the other sidewall, a doorway led to the inner courtyard. The walls and the ceiling were stuccoed. The southern elevation was closed off with a stone balustrade between the pillars and the wall. The ornate lobby was designed for important state ceremonies.\n\nThe Grand Ballroom (\"Nagy bálterem\"), in the middle part of the northern wing, took over the function of the smaller old ballroom in the Baroque wing. Designed by Hauszmann, it was the most splendid room of the palace. The two-storey high, airy room was lavishly decorated with stuccoes, half columns, trabeation, balconies and six crystal chandeliers in Neo-Baroque style. Seven arched windows and doorways opened towards a pillared terrace facing the western forecourt. On the other side, the ballroom was connected to the Buffet Hall through three doors.\n\nPhotos made after the war show the room with its vaulted ceiling collapsed. The ballroom was not restored but totally destroyed in the course of the post-war remodelling.\n\nThe Dining Hall (\"Buffet-csarnok\"), on the Danube side of the northern wing, was a very long hall used for state banquets. It was connected to the Great Ballroom nearby and it was possible to join them together. There was a shorter, passage-like space between the two rooms. This passage was separated from the Buffet Hall by six square pillars, while its other side was a solid wall with three doors. On the eastern side of the Buffet Hall a long row of windows opened towards the Danube and a pillared terrace. The Buffet Hall was divided into three sections with free-standing Ionic columns, holding trabeations. The vaulted ceiling was lavishly decorated with frescoes and stuccoes.\n\nThe Habsburg Hall (\"Habsburg terem\") was situated in the middle of the long palace complex, under Hauszmann's (false) dome, where the new northern wing and the old palace met. Although this part of the building belonged to the original palace, it was thoroughly rebuilt by Hauszmann–this stately room was totally his own work. It was one of the three historical rooms of the palace representing the important periods of Hungarian history. A free-standing, double flight of steps, called the Habsburg Steps, connected the room with the Royal Gardens on the Danube terrace. The room had lavish Baroque decorations with half-pillars and gilded stuccoes. The vaulted ceiling was decorated with Károly Lotz's fresco \"Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty\". Károly Senyei's four Carrara marble busts stood in front of the sidewalls representing King Charles III, Queen Maria Theresa, King Franz Joseph and Queen Elisabeth.\n\nThe Habsburg Hall survived World War II relatively undamaged, but in the 1950s it was demolished for political reasons.\n\nThe Krisztinaváros wing faces the district of Krisztinaváros, which was named in honour of the daughter of Queen Maria Theresa, Archduchess Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen.\n\nThe entrance hall (\"Előcsarnok\") opened from Lions Court, under an arcaded Neo-Renaissance portico, through ornate wrought-iron doors. This now serves as the entrance of the Hungarian National Library. The hall was a long, oblong-shaped room with 4+4 free standing Ionic columns in front of the walls on the longer sides, holding a trabeation. In the end of the shorter sides two doors opened into antechambers. The three arcaded doorways on the longer side opened into a lobby. The ceiling of the hallway was stuccoed, and the whole design was Italian Renaissance in style.\n\nThe lobby (\"Előcsarnok\") was connected to the hall of the main staircase through pillars. The stuccoed ceiling was held up by two rectangular pillars. The apartments of Archduke József Ágost and his wife, Archduchess Auguszta, were situated on the ground floor of the Krisztinaváros wing and opened from this room. Now it serves as the lobby of the Hungarian National Library in a radically modernised form.\n\nThe monumental main staircase (\"Főlépcsőház\"), with three flights, led up from the lobby to the first floor in an airy, glass-roofed hall. The side walls of the hall were decorated in Italian Renaissance style with colossal Corinthian half-columns, stuccoes and lunette openings. Ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and intricate balustrades decorated the stairs. On the ground floor, colossal Atlas statues stood beside the side pillars, holding the weight of the upper flights. The marble statues were the works of János Fadrusz from 1897. During the post-war reconstruction the main staircase was radically modernised. Only the two colossal Atlas statues survived. Now they are standing somewhat incongruently near their original places.\n\nSt Stephen's Room (\"\"Szent István\" terem\"), on the first floor of the Krisztinaváros wing, was one of the \"historical rooms\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. Together with the Matthias Room and the Habsburg Room, they represented the three most important periods of Hungarian history. Saint Stephen's Room connected the new Private Royal Apartments and—through a very long passageway—the Old Royal Apartments in the Danube Wing. Its style evoked the age of the Árpáds, the first Hungarian dynasty in the early Middle Ages. The walls were clad with dark carved wood paneling. The most spectacular item was a large stone mantelpiece with Romanesque Revival architectural details and the bust of King Saint Stephen, the first king of Hungary. The room was furnished with medieval-looking metal chandeliers and heavy wooden furniture.\n\nMatthias Room (\"Mátyás terem\") was named after King Matthias Corvinus, who ruled in the late Middle Ages. It was one of the three \"historical rooms\" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. The room opened from the Royal Bedroom, at the end of the line of private apartments. It had three windows opening towards the hills of Buda. There was a long terrace in front of the room. The style of the Matthias Room was Renaissance, with carved wooden paneling and a coffered ceiling. It was furnished with a mantelpiece in the corner and two chandeliers, the most spectacular item being the equestrian statue of King Matthias, sculpted by János Fadrusz. The statue was a miniature copy of the original standing on the main square of Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca). This copy was saved after the war and put on display in the Hungarian National Gallery.\n\nThe Hungarian crown jewels were kept in the specially-designed Strong Room (\"Páncélterem\") on the second floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing. The Crown of Saint Stephen was kept here between 1900 and 1944.\n\nThe small Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum (\"Erzsébet Királyné Emlékmúzeum\") on the second floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing was established in remembrance of Queen Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. Memorabilia were collected by Ida Ferenczy, Elisabeth's former lady-in-waiting, Viscountess Pallavicini and Countess Ilona Batthyány. The museum opened on 15 January 1908 as an affiliate of the Hungarian National Museum. The collection contained personal items, letters and clothes. Its most important relic was the costume that Elisabeth had been wearing when she was murdered. One room was meticulously recreated as the Queen's own writing room with her original writing desk and her 219 Hungarian books. The museum was badly damaged during World War II, and the surviving relics were bestowed to other museums.\n\nThe Royal Entrance Hall (\"Fejedelmi előterem\"), on the first floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing, gave access to the rooms of the Private Royal Apartments of King Franz Joseph I. The private apartments were situated in the southwestern part of the Krisztinaváros wing, their windows opening towards the hills of Buda. The Royal Entrance Hall was connected through a wide passageway to the main staircase hall. The spacious, oblong-shaped hall was divided in three, with two pairs of Ionic marble columns supporting architraves. The central part of the room was much longer than the bays at the ends. Doors connected the hall with the rooms of the private apartments. In the middle of the longer wall stood an ornate stone mantelpiece with the bust of Franz Joseph. On the other side, three windows opened to the inner courtyard of the Krisztinaváros wing. The ceiling was stuccoed and the side walls of the hall were covered with marble.\n\nThe antechamber (\"Előterem\") of the private apartments opened from the Royal Entrance Hall. It had three windows facing toward the hills. The room had a typical Biedermeier white-golden stucco decoration with floral wallpapers, resembling to the cosy rooms of Schönbrunn Palace. All the rooms of the private apartments followed this Viennese style favoured by the King. The antechamber was furnished with a stone mantelpiece (with a mirror above), an Empire crystal chandelier, a stone flowerpot standing on a fluted column and Neo-Renaissance table with chairs.\n\nThe audience room (\"Fogadószoba\") of Franz Joseph I was situated in a corner of the private apartments wing, with two windows opening southwards and three windows opening westwards. It had a beautiful stuccoed and frescoed ceiling. The walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, a golden Rococo console table with a large mirror and a parlour suite.\n\nThe writing room (\"Írószoba\") of Franz Joseph had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white tile stove, a table and chairs. To the right and left two similar parlours opened from the room.\n\nThe bedroom (\"Fejedelmi hálószoba\") of the king had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, the baldachined royal bed and a folding screen. The bedroom was connected to a dressing room, a private bathroom and smaller rooms belonging to the butler and the servants.\n\nThe Royal Dining Hall (\"Fejedelmi ebédlő\") opened from the Royal Entrance Hall, and it was the largest room of the private apartments. The long hall had six windows opening towards Gellért Hill. Three crystal chandeliers gave light to the elegant stuccoed space. In the middle of the longer side wall, between the two doors, stood a marble mantelpiece.\n\nThe \"Circle\" Room (\"\"Circle\" terem\") opened from the Royal Dining Hall. It was the last room of the private apartments on the southern side, with three windows opening towards Gellért Hill. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white tile stove and chairs.\n\nThe small dining room (\"Ebédlő\") was situated in the northern part of the Krisztinaváros wing, among the other rooms of the Royal Guest Suite. Four windows opened towards Krisztinaváros. The ceiling was stuccoed, while the walls were covered with carved wooden panelling and wallpaper. A stone mantelpiece and large painting above it (depicting a hunting scene with a deer) gave a homey feeling to the room. It was furnished with a crystal chandelier and a long dining table with 12 chairs.\n\nThese apartments, on the ground floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing, were designed in 1902 for Archduke Joseph August of Austria (1872–1962), the head of the Hungarian branch of the Habsburgs and his wife, Archduchess Augusta (1875–1964). They could be reached from the lobby of the Krisztinaváros wing through a long passageway. The most important rooms were (in due course): the \"salon\", where guests were entertained; the \"great parlour\"; \"parlour\"; \"dining room\"; the \"Archduke's study\"; the \"Archduke's bedroom\"; the \"Archduchess' bedroom\"; the \"Archduchess' study\"; and the \"breakfast parlour\". All rooms had a relatively simple decoration with white stuccoed ceilings and stucco panels above the doorways. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Crystal chandeliers, stone mantelpieces and typical turn-of-the-century furniture gave the rooms a homey ambiance. The great parlour was decorated with large paintings.\n\nThe castle and its gardens have been decorated with works of art since their foundation in the 14th century. Only written sources speak about the most important medieval works, but detailed pictorial and written information exists about the 19th-century artistic decoration of the palace, which was mainly created by the most important Hungarian artists of the era. Many of the statues survived the destruction during the siege of Budapest in 1944–45 and were later restored. On the other hand, important works of art were destroyed during the controversial reconstruction of the castle during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe spectacular fountain decorates the western forecourt of the palace. It shows a group of hunters led by King Matthias Corvinus together with hounds, a killed deer, Galeotto Marzio with a hawk and Szép Ilonka with a doe. This group of people stands between fallen rocks with water running down into a basin. The fountain was made by sculptor Alajos Stróbl. The dead deer was modelled upon a majestic stag killed in 1896 by poachers in the forest owned by Stróbl. The damaged sculpture was restored after the war. Nowadays it is probably the most photographed object in the palace.\nThe equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy stands on the Danube terrace, in a prominent position, high above Budapest. The Neo-Baroque statue was made by sculptor József Róna for the town of Zenta, but the town could not afford the price. The monument was bought in 1900 as a temporary solution until the planned equestrian statue of King Franz Joseph was completed. This never happened, so Prince Eugen remained on his plinth. The plinth is decorated with two bronze reliefs showing the capture of the earth-works in Zenta and the decisive cavalry charge in the Battle of Zenta in 1697.\nThe statue of the Hortobágy National Park horseherd taming a wild horse originally stood in front of the Riding School in the former Újvilág terrace. It is the work of György Vastagh from 1901. The statue was displayed in the Exposition Universelle in Paris (1900). The damaged statue was removed during the 1960s, but it was later restored and erected in the western forecourt of the palace in 1983, next to the Matthias Fountain.\nThe mythological Turul, high above the Danube, was made by Gyula Donáth in 1905. The plinth and the ornate Neo-Baroque rail (Gyula Jungfer's work) was seriously damaged during the siege of Buda, but they were restored in 1981, together with the broken coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary on the plinth.\nThe Fountain of the Fishing Children on the Danube terrace is the work of sculptor Károly Senyei from 1912. It depicts two children grappling with a fish. The fine workmanship of the fishing net is remarkable. The fountain was removed in 1955 and re-erected at Rákóczi Square in Pest, but brought back to its original place in 1976. It was restored in 2001.\n\nThe two statues depicting Csongor and Tünde, literary figures from Mihály Vörösmarty's drama, originally decorated the Habsburg Steps in front of the palace. They are the works of sculptor Miklós Ligeti from 1903. The steps were demolished after the war, but the statues were saved and re-erected in 1976 on top of two simple concrete plinths near their original locations.\nTwo pairs of lions guard the monumental gate leading into Lions Court. The four statues are the works of János Fadrusz from 1901. The animals standing on the outer side of the gate are calm and dignified, while the inner ones are menacing. One lion was broken in two pieces during the war, but it was recreated in the 1950s.\n\nThe monumental allegorical bronze statues of War and Peace stand beside the entrance to the Budapest History Museum. They are the work of Károly Senyei. Both War and Peace are represented by angels, one with a trumpet, the other with an olive branch. Under the angel of Peace is a returning soldier, while under the angel of War there is a dead Ottoman soldier and ancient Hungarian warriors.\n\nThere are sepulchral monuments in the Palatinal Crypt decorated with the statues of György Zala, Alajos Stróbl and Károly Senyei.\n\nThe monumental sculpture group decorated the main (northern) façade of the palace, facing Szent György Square. On the top of the attic, crowning the façade, stood the female figure of Hungaria, the allegorical representation of Hungary. Two semi-nude figures sat at her side, one male and one female, representing Industry and Commerce. The group was made by sculptor Gyula Jankovits in 1905. The sculpture was destroyed, together with the whole northern façade, during the 1950s.\n\nThe pediment above the Habsburg Steps was decorated with an allegorical group of Károly Senyei representing the \"Apotheosis of the Dual Monarchy\". It was destroyed during the 1950s, together with the great coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary which originally crowned the façade. The present-day pediment is plain, without any sculptural decoration.\n\nThe ceiling of the Habsburg Room was decorated with a fresco representing the apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty. It was the last important work of Károly Lotz, painted in 1903, one year before his death. The artist was already seriously ill when he worked on the fresco. The \"Apotheosis\" followed the traditions of Baroque court painting, and the work was praised by contemporary critics. The fresco survived the war unscathed, but it was destroyed in the 1950s.\n\nThe Budapest History Museum is located in the southern wing of Buda Castle, in Building E, over four floors. It presents the history of Budapest from its beginnings until the modern era. The restored part of the medieval castle, including the Royal Chapel and the rib-vaulted Gothic Hall, belongs to the exhibition. The highlights of the exhibition are the Gothic statues of Buda Castle and a 14th-century silk tapestry decorated with the Angevin coats of arms. Small gardens were recreated in the medieval zwingers around the oldest parts of the building.\n\nThe Hungarian National Gallery is located in Building A, B, C and D. The museum presents the history of Hungarian art from the 11th century until the present, with a special exhibition concentrating on Gothic altarpieces (housed in the former Baroque Ballroom). The only surviving interior from the pre-war Royal Palace, the Palatinal Crypt, belongs to the museum.\n\n\"Building F\" is occupied by the National Széchényi Library, the national library of Hungary. Its collection of rare and antique books, codices and manuscripts contains 35 Corvina pieces from the famous library of King Matthias Corvinus. The original Bibliotheca Corviniana was housed in the medieval Royal Castle of Buda.\n\nDuring the ottoman era, the extensive cave system was utilized by the hunters to store tigers and Hungarian mountain bears. \n\nThe cellars stored an ornate wine collection from the Ergi wine growing region in the Northern frontier of Hungary.\n\nVZ\nPostage stamps depicting the castle were issued by Hungary on 26 March 1926 on 1 June 1967on 30 April 1986\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3793631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3793631", "title": "Children of Men", "text": "Children of Men\n\nChildren of Men is a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film directed and co-written by Alfonso Cuarón. The screenplay, based on P. D. James' 1992 novel \"The Children of Men\", was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human infertility have left society on the brink of collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. \"Children of Men\" also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Pam Ferris and Charlie Hunnam.\n\nThe film was released on 22 September 2006 in the UK and on 25 December in the U.S. Critics noted the relationship between the U.S. Christmas opening and the film's themes of hope, redemption, and faith. Despite the limited release and low earnings at the box office compared to its budget, \"Children of Men\" received critical acclaim and was recognised for its achievements in screenwriting, cinematography, art direction, and innovative single-shot action sequences. It was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing. It was also nominated for three BAFTA Awards, winning Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and for three Saturn Awards, winning Best Science Fiction Film. In 2016 it was voted 13th among 100 films considered the best of the 21st century by 117 film critics from around the world.\n\nIn 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility and depression, the world is on the brink as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the radiation and antibiotic-resistant plagues which have rendered the rest of the world uninhabitable. In response, the UK has become a police state as the British Army rounds up and exterminates immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the \"Fishes\", a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic.\n\nJulian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee. Theo later obtains the papers from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. Since the transit papers require that the bearer be accompanied, Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives Theo, Kee, and former midwife Miriam towards Canterbury. While en route, they are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. When the group is stopped by the police, Luke kills the officers and then the group hides Julian's body in the forest before heading to a Fishes safe house.\n\nKee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant and that Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \"Human Project,\" a supposed scientific group in the Azores, dedicated to curing infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay and is voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so Luke could become leader; they intend to kill Theo and use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they steal a car, escaping to the secluded hideaway of Theo's ageing friend Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist turned pot dealer.\n\nThe group makes plans to board the Human Project ship, the \"Tomorrow\", which will arrive offshore from a refugee camp at Bexhill-on-Sea. Jasper proposes getting Syd, a camp guard to whom he frequently sells drugs, to smuggle them into Bexhill, masquerading as refugees. When the Fishes discover Jasper's house, the group flees while Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes; Luke shoots and kills Jasper as Theo watches from the woods. The group meets Syd at an abandoned school, and he helps them board a bus to Bexhill. When Kee experiences contractions while at a checkpoint, Miriam distracts a suspicious guard by feigning mania and is taken away.\n\nInside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees—led by the Fishes. Having learned that they have a bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Theo kills him with a car battery and they escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment building under heavy fire; he confronts Luke, who is then killed in an explosion, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to a hidden boat, but chooses to stay behind as they depart.\n\nAs military aircraft bomb Bexhill from a distance, Theo reveals that he had been shot by Luke. He tells Kee how to wind/burp her baby to soothe her crying, and Kee tells Theo she will name her Dylan—after Theo and Julian's lost son. Theo loses consciousness as the \"Tomorrow\" approaches through the fog.\n\n\"Children of Men\" explores the themes of hope and faith in the face of overwhelming futility and despair. The film's source, P. D. James' novel \"The Children of Men\" (1992), describes what happens when society is unable to reproduce, using male infertility to explain this problem. In the novel, it is made clear that hope depends on future generations. James writes, \"It was reasonable to struggle, to suffer, perhaps even to die, for a more just, a more compassionate society, but not in a world with no future where, all too soon, the very words 'justice,' 'compassion,' 'society,’ 'struggle,' 'evil,' would be unheard echoes on an empty air.\"\n\nThe film switches the infertility from male to female but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered. This unanswered question (and others in the film) have been attributed to Cuarón's dislike for expository film: \"There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations ... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers ... Cinema is a hostage of narrative. And I'm very good at narrative as a hostage of cinema.\" Cuarón's disdain for back-story and exposition led him to use the concept of female infertility as a \"metaphor for the fading sense of hope\". The \"almost mythical\" Human Project is turned into a \"metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding.\" Without dictating how the audience should feel by the end of the film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: \"We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest their own sense of hope into that ending. So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end.\"\n\nLike Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", and Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", the crux of the journey in \"Children of Men\" lies in what is uncovered along the path rather than the terminus itself. Theo's heroic journey to the south coast mirrors his personal quest for \"self-awareness\", a journey that takes him from \"despair to hope\".\n\nAccording to Cuarón, the title of P. D. James' book (\"The Children of Men\") is a Catholic allegory derived from a passage of scripture in the Bible. (Psalm 90 (89):3 of the KJV: \"Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.\") James refers to her story as a \"Christian fable\" while Cuarón describes it as \"almost like a look at Christianity\": \"I didn't want to shy away from the spiritual archetypes,\" Cuarón told \"Filmmaker Magazine\". \"But I wasn't interested in dealing with dogma.\"\n\nThe film has been noted for its use of Christian symbolism; for example, British terrorists named \"Fishes\" protect the rights of refugees. Opening on Christmas Day in the United States, critics compared the characters of Theo and Kee with Joseph and Mary, calling the film a \"modern-day Nativity story\". Kee's pregnancy is revealed to Theo in a barn, alluding to the manger of the Nativity scene, when Theo asks Kee who the father of the baby is she jokingly states she is a virgin, and when other characters discover Kee and her baby, they respond with \"Jesus Christ\" or the sign of the cross. Also the Archangel Gabriel (among other religious figures) is invoked in the bus scene.\n\nTo highlight these spiritual themes, Cuarón commissioned a 15-minute piece by British composer John Tavener, a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church whose work resonates with the themes of \"motherhood, birth, rebirth, and redemption in the eyes of God.\" Calling his score a \"musical and spiritual reaction to Alfonso's film\", snippets of Tavener's \"Fragments of a Prayer\" contain lyrics in Latin, German and Sanskrit sung by mezzo-soprano, Sarah Connolly. Words like \"mata\" (mother), \"pahi mam\" (protect me), \"avatara\" (saviour), and \"alleluia\" appear throughout the film.\n\nIn the closing credits, the Sanskrit words \"Shantih Shantih Shantih\" appear as end titles. Writer and film critic Laura Eldred of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill observes that \"Children of Men\" is \"full of tidbits that call out to the educated viewer\". During a visit to his house by Theo and Kee, Jasper says \"Shanti, shanti, shanti.\" Eldred notes that the \"shanti\" used in the film is also found at the end of an Upanishad and in the final line of T. S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land\", a work Eldred describes as \"devoted to contemplating a world emptied of fertility: a world on its last, teetering legs\". \"Shanti\" is also a common beginning and ending to all Hindu prayers, and means \"peace,\" referencing the invocation of divine intervention and rebirth through an end to violence.\n\n\"Children of Men\" takes an unconventional approach to the modern action film, using a documentary, newsreel style. Film critics Michael Rowin, Jason Guerrasio and Ethan Alter observe the film's underlying touchstone of immigration. Alter notes that the film \"makes a potent case against the anti-immigrant sentiment\" prevalent in modern societies like the United Kingdom and the United States, with Guerrasio describing the film as \"a complex meditation on the politics of today\".\n\nFor Alter and other critics, the structural support and impetus for the contemporary references rests upon the visual nature of the film's exposition, occurring in the form of imagery as opposed to conventional dialogue. Visually, the refugee camps in the film intentionally evoke Abu Ghraib prison, Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and The Maze. Other popular images appear, such as a sign over the refugee camp reading \"Homeland Security\". The similarity between the hellish, cinéma vérité stylized battle scenes of the film and current news and documentary coverage of the Iraq War, is noted by film critic Manohla Dargis, describing Cuarón's fictional landscapes as \"war zones of extraordinary plausibility\".\n\nIn the film, refugees are \"hunted down like cockroaches\", rounded up and put into roofless cages open to the elements and camps, and even shot, leading film critics like Chris Smith and Claudia Puig to observe symbolic \"overtones\" and images of the Holocaust. This is reinforced in the scene where an elderly refugee woman speaking German is seen detained in a cage, and in the scene where British Homeland Security strips and beats illegal immigrants; a song by The Libertines, \"Arbeit macht frei\", plays in the background. \"The visual allusions to the Nazi round-ups are unnerving,\" writes Richard A. Blake. \"It shows what people can become when the government orchestrates their fears for its own advantage.\"\n\nCuarón explains how he uses his imagery to cross-reference fictional and futuristic events with real, contemporary, or historical incidents and beliefs:\n\nThe adaptation of the P. D. James novel was originally written by Paul Chart, and later rewritten by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. The studio brought director Alfonso Cuarón on board in 2001. Cuarón and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed \"Y tu mamá también\". Afraid he would \"start second guessing things\", Cuarón chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuarón himself read an abridged version. Cuarón did not immediately begin production, instead directing \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\". During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured Clive Owen and sent the film into pre-production. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the \"social dynamics of the British psyche\", giving him insight into the depiction of \"British reality\". Cuarón used the film \"The Battle of Algiers\" as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for \"Children of Men\". In order to create a philosophical and social framework for the film, the director read literature by Slavoj Žižek, as well as similar works. The film \"Sunrise\" was also influential.\n\n\"A Clockwork Orange\" was one of the inspirations for the futuristic, yet battered patina of 2027 London. \"Children of Men\" was the second film Cuarón made in London, with the director portraying the city using single, wide shots. While Cuarón was preparing the film, the London bombings occurred, but the director never considered moving the production. \"It would have been impossible to shoot anywhere but London, because of the very obvious way the locations were incorporated into the film,\" Cuarón told \"Variety\". \"For example, the shot of Fleet Street looking towards St. Paul's would have been impossible to shoot anywhere else.\" Due to these circumstances, the opening terrorist attack scene on Fleet Street was shot a month and a half after the London bombing.\n\nCuarón chose to shoot some scenes in East London, a location he considered \"a place without glamour\". The set locations were dressed to make them appear even more run-down; Cuarón says he told the crew \"'Let's make it more Mexican'. In other words, we'd look at a location and then say: yes, but in Mexico there would be this and this. It was about making the place look run-down. It was about poverty.\" He also made use of London's most popular sites, shooting in locations like Trafalgar Square and Battersea Power Station. The power station scene (whose conversion into an art archive is a reference to the Tate Modern), has been compared to Antonioni's \"Red Desert\". Cuarón added a pig balloon to the scene as homage to Pink Floyd's \"Animals\". Other art works visible in this scene include Michelangelo's \"David\", Picasso's \"Guernica\", and Banksy's \"British Cops Kissing\". London visual effects companies Double Negative and Framestore worked directly with Cuarón from script to post production, developing effects and creating \"environments and shots that wouldn't otherwise be possible\".\n\nThe Historic Dockyard in Chatham was used to film the scene in the empty activist safehouse.\n\n\"In most sci-fi epics, special effects substitute for story. Here they seamlessly advance it,\" observes Colin Covert of \"Star Tribune\". Billboards were designed to balance a contemporary and futuristic appearance as well as easily visualizing what else was occurring in the rest of the world at the time, and cars were made to resemble modern ones at first glance, although a closer look made them seem unfamiliar. Cuarón informed the art department that the film was the \"anti-\"Blade Runner\"\", rejecting technologically advanced proposals and downplaying the science fiction elements of the 2027 setting. The director focused on images reflecting the contemporary period.\n\n\"Children of Men\" used several lengthy single-shot sequences in which extremely complex actions take place. The longest of these are a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and a scene in which Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building in the middle of a raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.\n\nCuarón had experimented with long takes in \"Great Expectations\", \"Y tu mamá también\", and \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\". His style is influenced by the Swiss film \"Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000\", a favorite of Cuarón's. Cuarón said \"I was studying cinema when I first saw [\"Jonah\"], and interested in the French New Wave. \"Jonah\" was so unflashy compared to those films. The camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close-ups. It's elegant and flowing, constantly tracking, but very slowly and not calling attention to itself.\"\n\nThe creation of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio. It took fourteen days to prepare for the single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki convinced the director to leave it in. According to Owen, \"Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, when we come to shoot, we have to make feel completely random.\"\n\nCuarón's initial idea for maintaining continuity during the roadside ambush scene was dismissed by production experts as an \"impossible shot to do\". Fresh from the visual effects-laden \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", Cuarón suggested using computer-generated imagery to film the scene. Lubezki refused to allow it, reminding the director that they had intended to make a film akin to a \"raw documentary\". Instead, a special camera rig invented by Gary Thieltges of Doggicam Systems was employed, allowing Cuarón to develop the scene as one extended shot. A vehicle was modified to enable seats to tilt and lower actors out of the way of the camera, and the windshield was designed to tilt out of the way to allow camera movement in and out through the front windscreen. A crew of four, including the director of photography and camera operator, rode on the roof.\n\nHowever, the commonly reported statement that the action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to \"combine several takes to create impossibly long shots\", where their job was to \"create the illusion of a continuous camera move.\" Once the team was able to create a \"seamless blend\", they would move on to the next shot. These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. The coffee shop scene was composed of \"two different takes shot over two consecutive days\"; the car ambush was shot in \"six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions\"; and the battlefield scene \"was captured in five separate takes over two locations\". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. In an interview with \"Variety\", Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the \"single-shot\" action sequences: \"Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces.\"\n\nTim Webber of VFX house Framestore CFC was responsible for the three-and-a-half-minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth. Cuarón had originally intended to use an animatronic baby as Kee's child with the exception of the childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's computer-generated baby.\n\nCuarón uses sound and music to bring the fictional world of social unrest and infertility to life. A creative yet restrained combination of rock, pop, electronic music, hip-hop and classical music replaces the typical film score. The mundane sounds of traffic, barking dogs, and advertisements follow the character of Theo through London, East Sussex and Kent, producing what \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Kevin Crust calls an \"urban audio rumble\". For Crust, the music comments indirectly on the barren world of \"Children of Men\": Deep Purple's version of \"Hush\" blaring from Jasper's car radio becomes a \"sly lullaby for a world without babies\" while King Crimson's \"The Court of the Crimson King\" make a similar allusion with their lyrics, \"three lullabies in an ancient tongue\".\n\nAmongst a genre-spanning selection of electronic music, a remix of Aphex Twin's \"Omgyjya Switch 7\", which includes the 'Male Thijs Loud Scream' audio sample by Thanvannispen, not present on the original (nor indeed on the official soundtrack) can be heard during the scene in Jasper's house, where Jasper's \"Strawberry Cough\" (a potent, strawberry-flavoured strain of marijuana) is being sampled. During a conversation between the two men, Radiohead's \"Life in a Glasshouse\" plays in the background.\n\nA number of dubstep tracks, most notably \"Anti-War Dub\" by Digital Mystikz, as well as tracks by Kode9 & The Space Ape and Pressure are also featured.\n\nFor the Bexhill scenes during the film's second half, the director makes use of silence and cacophonous sound effects such as the firing of automatic weapons and loudspeakers directing the movement of \"fugees\" (illegal immigrants). Here, classical music by George Frideric Handel, Gustav Mahler, and Krzysztof Penderecki's \"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima\" complements the chaos of the refugee camp. Throughout the film, John Tavener's \"Fragments of a Prayer\" is used as a spiritual motif to explain and interpret the story without the use of narrative.\n\nA few times during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of tinnitus is heard. This sound generally coincides with the death of a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.\n\n\"Children of Men\" had its world premiere at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival on 3 September 2006. On 22 September 2006, the film debuted at number 1 in the United Kingdom with $2.4 million in 368 screens. It debuted in a limited release of 16 theaters in the United States on 22 December 2006, expanding to more than 1,200 theaters on 5 January 2007. , \"Children of Men\" had grossed $69,612,678 worldwide, with $35,552,383 of the revenue generated in the United States.\n\n\"Children of Men\" received critical acclaim; on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 92% approval rating based on 238 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus states: \"\"Children of Men\" works on every level: as a violent chase thriller, a fantastical cautionary tale, and a sophisticated human drama about societies struggling to live.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nDana Stevens of \"Slate\" called it \"the herald of another blessed event: the arrival of a great director by the name of Alfonso Cuarón.\" Stevens hailed the film's extended car chase and battle scenes as \"two of the most virtuoso single-shot chase sequences I've ever seen.\" Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"superbly directed political thriller\", raining accolades on the long chase scenes. \"Easily one of the best films of the year\" said Ethan Alter of \"Film Journal International\", with scenes that \"dazzle you with their technical complexity and visual virtuosity.\" Jonathan Romney of \"The Independent\" praised the accuracy of Cuarón's portrait of the United Kingdom, but he criticized some of the film's futuristic scenes as \"run-of-the-mill future fantasy.\" \"Film Comment's\" critics' poll of the best films of 2006 ranked the film number 19, while the 2006 readers' poll ranked it number two. On their list of the best movies of 2006, \"The A.V. Club\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"Slate\", and \"The Washington Post\" placed the film at number one. \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked the film seventh on its end-of-the-decade top 10 list, saying, \"Alfonso Cuarón's dystopian 2006 film reminded us that adrenaline-juicing action sequences can work best when the future looks just as grimy as today.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number two on his list of best films of the decade, writing:\n\nAccording to Metacritic's analysis of the most often and notably noted films on the best-of-the-decade lists, \"Children of Men\" is considered the 11th greatest film of the 2000s.\n\nIn the wake of the European migrant crisis of 2015, the British withdrawal from the European Union of the late mid-to-late 2010s, and the election of Donald Trump in 2016, all of which involved divisive debates about immigration and increasing border enforcement, several commentators reappraised the film's importance, with some calling it \"prescient\".\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top 10 lists as one of the best films of 2006:\n\nIn 2012, director Marc Webb included the film on his list of Top 10 Greatest Films when asked by \"Sight & Sound\" for his votes for the BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time. In 2015, the film was named number one on an all-time Top 10 Movies list by the blog \"Pop Culture Philosopher\".\nIn 2017 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked \"Children of Men\" as the best Sci-fi film of the 21st century.\n\nP. D. James was reported to be pleased with the film, and the screenwriters of \"Children of Men\" were awarded the 19th annual USC Scripter Award for the screen adaptation of the novel. Howard A. Rodman, chair of the USC School of Cinematic Arts Writing Division, described the book-to-screen adaptation as \"writing and screen writing of the highest order\", although Gerschatt, writing in \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", noted that the screenplay bore very little resemblance to the novel: The gender of the baby was changed (to female), as was the character who was pregnant (Julian, in the novel); Theo, who appears to die in the film, does not die in the novel.\n\nThe HD-DVD and DVD were released in Europe on 15 January 2007 and in the United States on 27 March 2007. Extras include a half-hour documentary by director Alfonso Cuarón, entitled \"The Possibility of Hope\" (2007), which explores the intersection between the film's themes and reality with a critical analysis by eminent scholars: the Slovenian sociologist and philosopher Slavoj Žižek, anti-globalization activist Naomi Klein, environmentalist futurist James Lovelock, sociologist Saskia Sassen, human geographer Fabrizio Eva, cultural theorist Tzvetan Todorov, and philosopher and economist John N. Gray. \"Under Attack\" features a demonstration of the innovative techniques required for the car chase and battle scenes; in \"Theo & Julian\", Clive Owen and Julianne Moore discuss their characters; \"Futuristic Design\" opens the door on the production design and look of the film; \"Visual Effects\" shows how the digital baby was created. Deleted scenes are included. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United States on 26 May 2009.\n"}
{"id": "1230181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1230181", "title": "De vulgari eloquentia", "text": "De vulgari eloquentia\n\nDe vulgari eloquentia (, ; ; \"On eloquence in the vernacular\") is the title of a Latin essay by Dante Alighieri. Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.\n\nIn the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and vernacular, and the search for an \"illustrious\" vernacular in the Italian area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the \"canto\" or song (also spelled \"canzuni\" in Sicilian), which is a literary genre developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.\n\nLatin essays were very popular in the Middle Ages, but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the philosophy of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.\n\nDante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the comic genre and the \"mediocre\" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.\n\nIn the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of language, which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the Greek languages; one to the north, with the Germanic languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': oc language, oïl language and sì language. He then discusses \"gramatica\", \"grammar\", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the natural languages. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the illustrious vernacular, among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region. In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.\n\nDante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, Occitan, Sicilian, and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the \"Ars Poetica\" by Horace, the \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" by an anonymous author, and \"De Inventione\" by Cicero. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one. The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that \"the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian\". \n\nThe major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably \"Razos de trobar\" by the Catalan troubadour Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun and the \"Vers e regles de trobar\", an amplification of Vidal's manual, by Jofre de Foixà. Both of these works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: , meaning \"To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else's vernacular and despise their own, I say...\" (\"Convivio\", treatise I, XI).\n\nDirectly or indirectly, Dante came to read Saint Augustine's works, the \"De Consolatione Philosophiae\" by Boëthius, Saint Thomas Aquinas's works and some encyclopedic dictionaries like the \"Etymologiae\" by Isidore of Seville and the \"Livre du Tresor\" by Brunetto Latini. He takes also inspiration from Aristotelian philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as Radical Aristotelianism can be found in Dante's work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36365518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36365518", "title": "Debtera", "text": "Debtera\n\nA debtera (or dabtara; Ge'ez\\Tigrinya\\Amharic: ደብተራ (\"Däbtära)\"; plural, Ge'ez\\Tigrinya: \"debterat\", Amharic: \"debtrawoch\" ) is an itinerant religious figure among the Beta Israel and in the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, who sings hymns and dances for churchgoers, and who performs exorcisms and white magic to aid the congregation. A debtera will claim an ecclesiastical identity and behave as in minor orders. They may in fact be officially ordained as deacons, or may act outside the Church hierarchy. They are usually feared by the local population.\n\nDebteras are usually chosen from families of other debteras, and are trained from childhood as scribes (learning Ge'ez) and as cantors. They are often taught traditional medicine and lay rites as well. While studying, they often live by begging, retailing, or practicing traditional medicine. The main purpose for their studies, however, is written and oral lore pertaining to religious functions, and the test for graduation is memorizing the psalter. Before services, they bathe and don white clothing, turbans, and a loose striped over-garment called a \"shamma\". Debteras carry prayer sticks to the service, where they sing, dance, and play drums and sistra outside the church or the synagogue during religious services.\n\nAmong the Beta Israel, the status of debtera is a milestone in the study to become a kahen. Unlike fully-fledged Kahens (who perform none of the functions of \"debtra\"), debteras are closer to the laypeople, often serving as intermediaries between them and the clergy. A Kahen who gives up his position or is deposed may serve as a \"debtera\".\n\n\"Kahens\" and \"debteras\" are two separate professions, though it is possible to pursue both roles. Orthodox Tewahedo churches see the division as following the model used by the ancient Israelites.\n\nDuring Lenten services, \"debteras\" tap prayer sticks to keep the rhythm. The Ethiopian Church condones the performances of \"debteras\", citing the story in 2 Kings of David dancing at the temple and (\"O clap your hands\") for Biblical examples. These performances also feature symbols connected to the Passion of Jesus: the sistrum's swaying and the beating of the drums represent Christ's swaying while enduring beatings, and the tapping of the prayer sticks represent the flagellation of Christ.\n\nDebteras participate in liturgy as singers and musicians and, outside the Church religio-magical healers by performing as herbalists, astrologers, fortune-tellers etc. Some Ethiopian authors consider these healers as ‘spiritual healers’ whereas, they are purely religio-magical healers. Not all duties taken on by Debteras are condoned by the Ethiopian Church. Many distribute contraceptive herbs to women and perform magic meant to perform contraceptive functions, in contradiction to the Ethiopian Church's teachings. Some are also reputed to study black magic invoking demons alongside their more benevolent official learning.\n\nSome Debteras manufacture apotropaic amulets meant to protect the wearer from evil spirits. These amulets are often made of silver and are noted for their use against the legendary budas, zār spirits, and the evil eye. They may also study a variety of anti-magic invocations, prayers, and exorcisms. These exorcisms may include prayers, blessing of holy water (which the possessed person drinks), burning of roots, and incantations from a \"Magic Star Book\". Some amulets may take the form of small scrolls kept in pouches or similar containers, made from the skin of a sacrificed goat or lamb whose blood is used to ritually purify the intended owner. Some practice (or rather circumvent) astrology, by giving unlucky people new stars by changing their names. This may be considered \"cheating\" by the locals, however. Some Debteras have also been noted to use Datura stramonium to cause hallucinations.\n\nA debtera may charge a fee for his charms, exorcisms, and astrological practices, but not liturgical activities.\n\nNot all of the Debteras duties and cures are supernatural. Debteras place scarecrows in farm fields to protect them and shave heads to prevent lice outbreaks. Before the 1974 revolution, nobles would often hire Debteras to educate their children.\n\nA major theological difference in the healing practices of Priests and Debteras is that for the priests, sin Vs virtue or evil-spirit Vs God is the basis for any sickness and healings. Therefore, they prescribe prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel), baptism (washing of sins), fasting, penance together with holy water as a remedy. For the debteras it is evil spirit Vs human beings; almost all the sickness are possession of evil spirits or caused by evil spirits, therefore, prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel) become the integral part of any ritualistic religious healing ceremony. Besides these, kitab or amulets are also prepared and give by them to be worn to wade away the evil spirits and evil eye (buda). On the other hand, the priests use the practice of confession, fasting, penance and Church attendance as a means of healing together with some sort of advice and guidance. The soul-father, called yenafs abbat is a kind of family spiritual-doctor, common in many places makes frequent visits to the home and performs services as required.\n\n"}

Diamond further bought out early-distributor Bud Plant Inc. in 1988, and main rival Capital City Distribution in 1996, to assume a near-monopoly on comics distribution, including exclusivity deals with the major comic book publishers.\n\nBy 1981/82 Geppi had four comics retail locations and was already \"doing a little informal distributing... for smaller retailers.\" Geppi found himself \"one of the biggest accounts\" for New Media/Irjax, and when the distributor \"relocated to Florida, he asked Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount.\" One of the \"last loyal customers\" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal: \"[t]he owner was going into retail,\" so Geppi agreed to provide New Media/Irjax with \"free books for a period of time in return for his account list,\" buying parts of the company, and founding Diamond Comic Distribution.\n\nGeppi had been a sub-distributor for Hal Shuster's Irjax in the late 1970s. In what Mile High Comics' Chuck Rozanski describes as an \"incredibly risky and gutsy move,\" Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's \"office and warehouse space\" and, recalled Rozanski, had to \"sort out the good customers from the bad overnight\" negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution. Almost overnight, noted Rozanski, \"[h]e went from being a retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place.\"\n\nGeppi named his new company 'Diamond' \"after the imprint Marvel Comics used on non-returnable comics,\" and although the \"publisher discontinued the symbol\" months later, the name remained. \"Diamond grew an average of 40 percent a year,\" as comics retail took off.\n\nIn 1983, Diamond hired an accounting firm, and in 1985 hired \"no-nonsense CPA\" Chuck Parker \"as Diamond's first controller\". In 1994, Diamond employee Mark Herr noted that this move was Geppi's \"best decision\", as Parker \"cares nothing about the comics. To him, it's dollars and cents.\" Parker describes his role as \"smooth[ing] the emotion out of some decisions. Steve [Geppi] is a visionary and a risk-taker... and I tend to be more conservative.\"\n\nAfter starting his business through buying New Media/Irjax's warehouses and offices in 1982, Geppi's distribution company has bought out many other distribution companies since. Many fans \"with little experience\" started rival distribution companies only to \"find they were in over their heads,\" allowing Geppi to \"[buy] out the smart ones or pick... up the pieces after the stupid ones went out of business,\" according to Herr. Diamond was aided in his efforts by the publishers themselves. In the early 1980s, Marvel and DC Comics provided trade terms favorable for larger distributors and those with efficient freight systems, effectively \"play[ing] into the hands of the major distributors such as Capital and Diamond,\" and hastening the demise of smaller distributors.\n\nMost notably, in 1988, Geppi bought up early mail-order distributor Bud Plant Inc., who had himself bought out Charles Abar Distribution in 1982. Plant had, since 1970, been selling underground comics (a field which Geppi and fellow distributor Buddy Saunders had tended to steer clear of). After making $19m in sales in 1987, Diamond bought West Coast distributor Plant's business in 1988 \"and went national\" thereby assuming control of \"40 percent of the direct-sales market.\" (Diamond and Capital City Distribution had control of at least 70% between them.)\n\nIn 1990, Diamond acquired the Seattle-based sub-distributor Destiny Distribution. Destiny had been started by Phil Pankow in the early 1980s, and was initially supplied by Bud Plant. Also in 1990, Diamond acquired Oregon-based Second Genesis Distribution (whose operations folded in 1991).\n\nIn 1991, Diamond moved into the UK market, acquiring Pacific Distribution, Ltd. In 1992, Diamond acquired the British distributor Titan Distributors, an arm of Titan Entertainment Group.\n\nIn 1994, Diamond acquired Staten Island-based distributor Comics Unlimited. By this point, Diamond had \"27 warehouses in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., employ[ing] between 750 and 900 people;\" operated its own trucking line; and controlled 45% of the market, making $222 million in sales.\n\nIn 1995, Marvel Comics challenged Diamond and main rival Capital City by buying the third largest distributor — Heroes World Distribution — and distributing its titles in-house. Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel's main rivals DC Comics, as well as Dark Horse, Image, and Archie Comics. Capital City's response saw it sign exclusive deals with Kitchen Sink Press and Viz Comics, but a year later faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out. Diamond bought Capital City in the summer of 1996, assuming near-control of the comics distribution system. The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquisition brought an estimated $50 million in sales revenue to Diamond.\n\nIn early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with the House of Ideas — giving the company its own section of comics catalog \"Previews\" (not least because the DC/Dark Horse/Image deal gave contractual prominence to those companies) — making \"Geppi... the sole king of comics industry distribution in the summer of 1996.\"\n\nIn 1997, Diamond's position in the comics industry, as \"the sole source of most new comics products to comics specialty shops,\" ultimately saw the company become the subject of \"an investigation by the U.S. Justice department for possible antitrust violations.\" The Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the comics industry and the alleged monopoly of Diamond Comics. The investigation was closed in November 2000, with no further action deemed necessary on the basis that, although Diamond enjoyed a monopoly in the North American comic book direct market distribution, they did not enjoy a monopoly on book distribution (books including non-comic books).\n\nIn addition to having cornered the American comics distribution market, Diamond includes a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies. UK and European comics distribution is served by Diamond UK, based in Runcorn, England.\n\nOn August 31, 2000, Diamond Comic Distributors acquired Alliance Game Distributors, North America's largest distributor of tabletop games.\n\nIn 2002, Diamond consolidated its book trade into Diamond Book Distributors, marketing graphic novels and trade paperbacks to bookstores including Barnes & Noble, Ingram, Baker & Taylor, Amazon.com and Borders.\n\nIn 1983, Diamond was criticized for taking exception to certain \"adult\"-themed titles and scenes, effectively causing the cancellation of a series called \"Void Indigo\" for its excessive violence.\n\nIn 1987, Geppi responded to \"a graphic childbirth scene in \"Miracleman\" #9 [written by Alan Moore].\" Geppi wrote to retailers that:\n\nThis call for retailers to refuse to stock \"Miracleman\" led to accusations of censorship, charges the company was forced to address when it criticized or refused to carry other titles, including books by Kitchen Sink Press, and Dave Sim in 1988, Jon Lewis in 1994, and Mike Diana in 1996.\n\nDiamond lost customers with this approach, however, \"and eventually backed down.\" Geppi recalls compromising, and accepting \"that as a distributor, I owed the retailers the product they wanted.\" In fact, in an attempt to prove Diamond did not practice censorship, the company joined DC Comics in 1993 to raise money for the industry's First Amendment advocacy group Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.\n\nBecause of its industry dominance, Diamond also faced charges it bullied publishers and discriminated against small publishers. These charges first surfaced in 1988 when Diamond rejected Matt Feazell's comic \"Ant Boy\", and in 1989 when it similarly decided not to carry Allen Freeman's \"Slam Bang\" anthology.\n\nAfter the industry consolidation of 1996, Diamond faced similar charges in 1996, 1999, and 2000 (when smaller publishers like Fantagraphics and Drawn and Quarterly lodged complaints).\n\nDiamond's monthly comics retail catalog, \"Previews\" has been produced by Diamond for over twenty-five years for store owners and comic shop customers to order their products. It is additionally available for sale to customers to facilitate pre-orders from \"pull and hold\" or subscription customers who frequent comic shops on a regular basis. Comics publishers vie for space within the publication's pages, with Dark Horse, DC Comics, Image Comics, and IDW Publishing taking precedence as \"Premier\" publishers. Marvel Comics has its own mini-catalog of \"Marvel Previews\" available separately, for contractual reasons.\n\nGeppi is also owner of Gemstone Publishing Inc., through which he publishes \"The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\". Gemstone has also published Russ Cochran's EC Comics reprints, Disney comics and Blue Book price guide in the past as well.\n\nIn 1994, Geppi purchased \"Baltimore\" magazine, \"a 50,000 circulation monthly and one of the nation's oldest regional publications.\"\n\nGeppi's publishing ventures in the comics field saw him create Gemstone Publishing Inc., which was formed in large part from other purchases. In 1992, Diamond bought Ernst Gerber Publishing (publisher-author of the \"Photo-Journal Guide to Comics\"). E. Gerber Products, LLC is a Diamond-affiliated company started by Gerber in 1977 which sells Mylar bags as well as \"acid-free boxes and acid-free backing boards\" for comics collectors to store their collection in. In 1993, Geppi bought Russ Cochran Publishing. Long-term EC Comics fan Cochran auctioned Bill Gaines' personal file copies of EC publications, as well as most pages of original EC artwork (which, almost uniquely, Gaines had maintained ownership and possession of), before being granted the reprint rights to the EC back catalog itself. Geppi included Cochran's publications — and Cochran himself — under his new imprint, Gemstone Publishing.\n\nIn 1994, Geppi bought Overstreet Publishing, taking up the publishing reins of official-Blue Book price guide \"The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\", and other related publications, bringing them under the Gemstone imprint. Geppi's publishing activities with Gemstone Publishing consist primarily of reprints of classic titles and artworks, as well as publications (including professional fanzines \"pro-zines\") focusing heavily on the history of the comics medium. Many Gemstone publications revolve around \"Comic Book Marketplace\"-editor and EC-shepherd Russ Cochran.\n\nCochran, like Geppi, was a particular fan of Carl Barks' Disney comics, and had previously-published EC reprints in association with Disney-reprinter Gladstone Publishing. In the early 1990s, Geppi's Gemstone embarked on a full series of reprints of classic EC titles, starting with new reprints of the Cochran/Gladstone-reprints of \"The Haunt of Fear\", \"The Vault of Horror\" and \"Weird Science\" (all 1992). Gemstone also republished (in single issue and 'annual' — four issues per 'annual' — format) EC's \"New Trend\" and \"New Direction\" titles between 1992 and 2000.\n\nIn 2005, Gemstone added to Cochran's earlier-published oversize, hardback, black & white slip-cased \"The Complete EC Library\" collections with the complete \"Picto-Fiction\" collection, comprising the EC comics: \"Confessions Illustrated\", \"Crime Illustrated\", \"Shock Illustrated\" and \"Terror Illustrated\", along with \"18 previously unseen stories, never published before\".\n\nIn 2006, Gemstone began producing a more durable and luxurious series of hardback reprint collections; the EC Archives — similar to the DC Archives and Marvel Masterworks volumes — which reprint in full-color hardback ('archival') format sequential compilations of the EC titles. Designed by art director/designer Michael Kronenberg, a number of volumes have been released, with the entirety of the \"New Trend\" and \"New Direction\" planned for eventual release. These EC Archives volumes have drawn praise for their quality, and feature introductions by such notable EC fans as George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and Paul Levitz.\n\nIn December 2002, it was announced that \"Gemstone Publishing had signed the license to publishing Disney comics in North America,\" with ex-Gladstone Publishing editor-in-chief John Clark joining Gemstone in the same position over its Disney line. Launched with a title for Free Comic Book Day 2003, the line started soon after with \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" and \"Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge\", both described by Clark as \"monthly 64-page prestige-format books at $6.95, which is the same price they were when last produced, in 1998.\" Other titles followed, and Gemstone held their license until early 2009.\n\nThe (Official) Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, first published by Robert M. Overstreet in 1970 as one of the earliest authorities on American comic book industry grading and collection values. Overstreet sold his company to Gemstone in 1994, but continued to \"serve as author and/or publisher of Geppi's Entertainment Publishing & Auctions' line of books.\" Publication of the \"Price Guide\" was taken over by Gemstone in 1998, Gemstone took over publication, and the twenty-eighth edition to the present have been (co-)published by Geppi's Gemstone publications. The \"Guide\"'s 39th edition was published by Gemstone Publishing in 2009.\n\nOverstreet also produced a variety of smaller publications updating his yearly guides on a monthly schedule. The most recent of these - \"Overstreet's Comic Price Review\" - began publication from Gemstone in July 2003, and was a monthly publication designed to update the yearly price guide more regularly, as well as provide articles, analysis and various lists of comics prices.\n\nGemstone published more than a hundred issues of the magazine \"Comic Book Marketplace\", a monthly magazine for comics fans focusing heavily on the Golden and Silver ages, while more popular magazines (such as \"Wizard\") skew more recent in focus.\n\nIn early 2009, the future of Gemstone Publishing was unclear, after reports of unpaid printing bills, particularly from the EC Archives. In April, Geppi responded to the uncertainty, noting that while there had been \"a reduction in staff at Gemstone,\" such moves did \"not signal the end of Gemstone Publishing.\"\n\nIn 2008, Diamond introduced ComicSuite, an add-on application for Microsoft Dynamics’ Retail Management System (RMS) software. Together, ComicSuite & RMS give specialty storeowners a point-of-sale (POS) system specifically geared towards their unique business model, offering a host of exclusive features that grant you direct communication with Diamond databases, making it easier than ever before to place orders, track inventory and maintain “pull-and-hold” subscriptions for your customers.\"\n\nIn 1995, Geppi founded Diamond International Galleries, which acquired Hake's Americana & Collectibles auction house (2004), and in 2005, Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions. In 1999, Geppi founded Diamond Select Toys, and in 2006 he founded Geppi's Entertainment Museum in Baltimore.\n\nAlliance Game Distributors is North America's largest distributor of tabletop games—role-playing games, collectible card games, miniature wargames, board games, and related merchandise—and the publisher of \"Game Trade Magazine\". Alliance was acquired by Diamond in August 2000, two years after being formed by the merger of game distributors Chessex and The Armory.\n\nEnvisioned to create collectibles for children and adults, DST was founded in 1999 and has since licensed a variety of pop culture properties, including Marvel Comics, Transformers, , Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, Ghostbusters, Halo, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Indiana Jones, Battlestar Galactica, 24 and Back to the Future. While they also make action figures in a variety of sizes, as well as banks, busts, statues and prop replicas, many of their licensed properties are released in the form of Minimates, which has helped make Minimates one of the most prolific and diverse block figure toy lines in the world. In 2007, after years of partnership, Diamond Select Toys made a move to acquire select assets of New York-based design house Art Asylum, the creators of Minimates and DST has since developed Minimates based on its own concepts, under the brands Minimates M.A.X. and Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders.\n\nIn 1995, Geppi \"opened Diamond International Galleries,\" a showplace for comics and collectibles, part of Geppi's attempts to \"see... collectibles attain serious respect.\" Nine years later, Diamond International Galleries purchased \"one of the country’s first, and most respected, collectibles auction houses: Hake's Americana & Collectibles.\" In 2005, Geppi added the \"Denver, Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions\" to his growing stable of parts of the collectibles market, which already included publishing the main comics price guide: \"The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide\".\n\nGeppi describes his International Galleries as being \"at the heart of many significant opportunities to preserve, promote and present historical comic character collectibles,\" an endeavor that led to his establishing Geppi's Entertainment Museum. Geppi's galleries showcase much of his private collection, including comics, movie posters, toys, original artwork by individuals including \"Carl Barks, Gustav Tengren , Alex Ross, Murphy Anderson, Joe Shuster, Joe Simon and Charles Schulz.\"\n\nDiamond International Galleries has assisted \"in such projects as DC's Archive series,\" as well as hosting industry events.\n\nGeppi's Entertainment Museum was a museum in Baltimore, Maryland, tracing the history of pop culture in American over the last four hundred years. Its collections include comic books, magazines, movies, newspapers, television, radio and video game memorabilia, including comic books, movie posters, toys, buttons, badges, cereal boxes, trading cards, dolls and figurines. The majority of the exhibits come from Geppi's private collection, while Geppi's daughter Melissa \"Missy\" Geppi-Bowersox became the executive vice-president of the museum in 2007, after Wendy Kelman left the museum on August 31, 2007, to start her own tourism consulting firm. The museum's curator is Dr. Arnold T. Blumberg, former editor at Geppi's Gemstone Publishing.\nThe museum closed in June 2018. Geppi donated much of his collection to the Library of Congress.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26289864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26289864", "title": "Guerrillero Heroico", "text": "Guerrillero Heroico\n\nGuerrillero Heroico () is an iconic photograph of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara taken by Alberto Korda. It was captured on March 5, 1960, in Havana, Cuba, at a memorial service for victims of the \"La Coubre\" explosion. By the end of the 1960s, the image, in conjunction with Guevara's subsequent actions and eventual execution, helped solidify the charismatic and controversial leader as a cultural icon. Korda has said that at the moment he shot the picture, he was drawn to Guevara's facial expression, which showed \"absolute implacability\" as well as anger and pain. Years later, Korda would say that the photograph showed Che's firm and stoic character. Guevara was 31 years old at the time the photograph was taken.\n\nEmphasizing the image's ubiquitous nature and wide appeal, the Maryland Institute College of Art called the picture a symbol of the 20th century and the world's most famous photograph. Versions of it have been painted, printed, digitized, embroidered, tattooed, silk-screened, sculpted or sketched on nearly every surface imaginable, leading the Victoria and Albert Museum to say that the photograph has been reproduced more than any other image in photography. Jonathan Green, director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has speculated that \"Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict. There isn’t anything else in history that serves in this way\".\n\nThe history and contemporary global impact of the image is the basis for the 2008 documentary \"Chevolution\", directed by Trisha Ziff, along with the 2009 book \"Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image\" by Michael Casey.\n\nOn March 4, 1960, the French freighter \"La Coubre\" suspiciously exploded in Havana Harbor, killing up to 100 people and injuring several hundred more. Upon hearing the blast, Guevara rushed to the harbor to board the burning ship, angrily forcing his way past those concerned for his safety following a secondary explosion.\n\nThe following day on March 5, President Fidel Castro blamed the U.S. CIA and called for a memorial service and mass demonstration at Havana's Colón Cemetery, to honor the victims. At the time, Guevara was Minister of Industry in the new government, and Korda was Castro's official photographer. After a funeral march along the seafront boulevard known as Malecón, Fidel Castro gave a eulogy for the fallen at a stage on 23rd street. Castro gave a fiery speech, using the words \"Patria o Muerte\" (\"Homeland or Death\") for the first time. Meanwhile, at 11:20 am, Guevara came into view for a few seconds. Korda snapped just two frames of him from a distance of about before he disappeared from sight. Korda immediately realised his photograph had the attributes of a portrait. Later, Korda said of this photograph, \"I remember it as if it were today … seeing him framed in the viewfinder, with that expression. I am still startled by the impact … it shakes me so powerfully\".\n\nDuring the rally, Korda took pictures of Cuban dignitaries and famous French existentialist philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, both admirers of Guevara at the time. Included in the film roll were shots of all the speakers and two pictures of Che's brief appearance. The classic picture appears on frame number 40 shot horizontally.\n\nThe first photograph had Guevara framed alone between the silhouette of Jorge Masetti and a palm tree; the second with someone's head appearing above his shoulder. The first picture, with the intruding material cropped out and the image rotated slightly, became Guevara's most famous portrait. The editor of \"Revolución\" where Korda worked, decided to use only his shots of Castro, Sartre, and Beauvoir, while sending the Che shot back to Korda. Believing the image was powerful, Korda made a cropped version for himself, which he enlarged and hung on his wall next to a portrait of the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, and also gave copies to some others as a gift. It was not until 1986 that José Figueroa, an established photographer in his own right who printed for Korda and was his unofficially \"adopted\" son, suggested they try printing the full frame version of the portrait. Korda continued to print both versions of the image up until his death.\n\nTo take the photograph, Korda used a Leica M2 with a 90 mm lens, loaded with Kodak Plus-X pan film. In speaking about the method, Korda remarked that \"this photograph is not the product of knowledge or technique. It was really coincidence, pure luck.\"\n\nAs a lifelong communist and supporter of the Cuban Revolution until his death, Alberto Korda claimed no payment for his picture. A modified version of the portrait through the decades was also reproduced on a range of different media, though Korda never asked for royalties. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. Korda's refusal to seek royalties for the vast circulation of his photograph \"helped it become the ultimate symbol of Marxist revolution and anti-imperialist struggle.\"\n\nHowever, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when in response to Smirnoff using Che's picture in a vodka commercial, Korda claimed his moral rights (a form of copyright law) and sued advertising agency Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph. Lintas and Rex claimed that the image was in the public domain. The final result was an out of court settlement for USD $50,000 to Korda, which he donated to the Cuban healthcare system, stating \"if Che was still alive, he would have done the same.\"\n\nAfter the settlement, Korda reiterated that he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:\n\nPassed out to the occasional friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor Régis Debray. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution he did not have to pay.\n\nUpon his return to Italy, Feltrinelli disseminated thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later in 1967 after his October 9, 1967 execution, Che's \"Bolivian Diary\" with Korda's photograph on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, crediting the copyright to (c) Libreria Feltrinelli 1967 (in the lower left hand corner of the image) with no mention of Korda. By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Alberto Korda later expounded that if Feltrinelli had paid him just one lira for each reproduction, that he would have received millions. However, Korda also expressed that he forgave him, because through his actions, the image became famous.\n\nFeltrinelli's version of the image was used in October 1967 in Milan, Italy, when spontaneous protests occurred in response to the news of Che's death. Italian photographer Giorgio Mondolfo later stated that \"the first time I saw the picture by Alberto Korda, I was not even slightly interested in the author. I was only fifteen, and it was the picture that had drawn us – many for the first time – to gather in the streets, crying \"Che lives!\"\"\n\n\"Guerrillero Heroico\" also appeared in the August 1967 issue of \"Paris Match\". Published only a few months before his eventual capture and execution, the issue featured a major article titled \"Les Guerrilleros\" by journalist Jean Lartéguy. Lartéguy wrote \"At a time when Cuban revolutionaries want to create Vietnams all over the world, the Americans run the risk of finding their own Algeria in Latin America.\" The article ended by asking \"Where is Che Guevara?\" The caption of the photograph read \"The official photograph of Che Guevara; on his beret the star, the symbol of the Comandante.\" It is not known who provided the magazine with the image, and it was also not credited to Feltrinelli. However, with its wide circulation throughout Europe, and its status as an influential news journal, \"Paris Match\" could also be viewed as one of the original purveyors of the image.\n\nDuring the May 1968 Paris student riots, which eventually shook the de Gaulle government (but did not overthrow it), organizer \"Danny The Red\" utilized Fitzpatrick's rendition of Che during the protests. At this time, Che's image was picked up by the Dutch anarchist group \"The Provos\" in Amsterdam, who focused on triggering violent responses from authorities through non-violent means.\n\nIn 1967, Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick was also using Korda's image as a basis for creating his own stylized posters. Fitzpatrick claims he received a copy of the photograph from the Dutch anarchist group \"the Provos\", who produced a magazine bearing the group's name. Fitzpatrick remembers that Provo magazine claimed the image originally came to Europe via Jean-Paul Sartre. Fitzpatrick's source of the image, then, would not have been Feltrinelli.\n\nTo create the image Fitzpatrick made a paper negative on a piece of equipment called a grant. They were then printed in one color black and one color red, and he handpainted the star in yellow. Fitzpatrick \"wanted the image to breed like rabbits\" and hand printed thousands of images to give away to anyone for free in London, in addition to getting friends to pass them out while encouraging others to make their own versions. He printed about a hundred copies at a time to fulfill the demand of political groups in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands who began requesting the image. A batch was also sent to Spain, where they were seized by Franco's police.\n\nBecause of the high demand, Fitzpatrick formed a poster company called \"Two Bear Feet\" and produced a variety of posters in 1967 using the Korda image. All of them were created without copyright, because Fitzpatrick wanted them to be reproduced. One of these posters would be published in the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\". The best-known was printed on silver foil and was exhibited in an exhibition in London called \"Viva Che\" at the Arts Laboratory, curated by Peter Meyer. This show was originally to be held at the Lisson Gallery in 1968 and illustrates how fast the image moved from protest into the realm of fine art.\n\nBecause of Fitzpatrick's desire for the photograph to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed \"F\" on the shoulder. It was not until the 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating \"I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone.\" At this time Fitzpatrick said that \"I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine.\" In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that \"Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit.\" Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.\n\nAccording to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while a teenage student at Gormanston College he worked a summer job at the Marine Hotel pub in Kilkee, the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an Irish whiskey. Fitzpatrick immediately recognized him because of his interest in the Cuban Revolution. Knowing about the Irish diaspora and history in Argentina, Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from Galway, with other family being from Cork.\n\nGuevara's father also bore the Irish surname \"Lynch.\" Fitzpatrick describes Che as \"curious\" about Ireland \"from a revolutionary point of view\" and remarks that Che proclaimed his \"great admiration\" for the fact that, in his view, Ireland was the first country to \"shake off the shackles of the British Empire\". Apparently Che was stranded on an overnight flight from Moscow to Cuba, and had touched down at Shannon Airport, where the Soviet airline \"Aeroflot\" had a refueling base. Unable to depart because of thick fog, Che and his accompanying Cubans took the day off for an \"unofficial\" visit. It was this experience, according to Fitzpatrick, that gave him the impetus to follow the future actions of Che, including his ill-fated mission to Bolivia.\n\nIn December 2008, Jim Fitzpatrick, along with local historian Anne Holliday and the Shannon Development, announced plans to commemorate Guevara's visit to Ireland, and specifically his time spent in Limerick. Early plans are focused on an exhibition of Guevara's visit at the City Museum, followed by the creation of a \"permanent mark\" symbolizing his time spent at Hanratty Hotel's – White House pub in Shannonside. Fitzpatrick defended the move by remarking \"we want to commemorate the fact Che Guevara spent some very important hours of his life here … this probably was Che's last hurrah.\"\n\nSinn Féin president Gerry Adams is interviewed in the 2008 documentary \"Chevolution\" about the famous photograph. As he speaks, the film shows a montage of Che murals in Belfast, with Adams remarking \"I suppose people from my background were drawn to that image, because of what Che Guevara represented.\"\n\nCuban historian Edmundo Desnoes has stated that \"Che's image may be cast aside, bought and sold and deified, but it will form a part of the universal system of the revolutionary struggle, and can recover its original meaning at any moment.\" That meaning's origin harkens back to when Korda's photograph was first published on April 16, 1961, in the daily Cuban newspaper \"Revolución\", advertising a noon conference during which the main speaker was \"Dr. Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.\" The conference was disrupted however, when 1,300 CIA-supported counter-revolutionaries stormed the beaches of Cuba, in what became known as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. The image was thus republished a second time advertising the newly convened conference on April 28, 1961. Because of this fact, it seems very likely that in the context of both of these publications, that Che could have seen the photograph that would later contribute to his iconic status.\n\nThe very first time Cubans on a large scale became familiar with the photograph, despite its earlier reproduction in \"Revolución\", was on hearing the news of Che's death. Upon the news of Che's execution, it was enlarged and draped on a banner down the five-story building of the Ministry of the Interior in the Plaza de la Revolución in Havana. This building where Che himself had formerly worked, served as a backdrop to Fidel's eulogy on October 18, 1967, publicly acknowledging the death of Che Guevara before a crowd of over a million mourners. José Gómez Fresquet, renowned Cuban poster maker and graphic artist, recalls how on hearing the news of Guevara's death, he immediately worked all night producing the poster to be used at the rally honoring him the next day. Korda had given Fresquet a copy of the portrait as a basis for the poster, which he created on red paper. This was the first privately produced \"Guerrillero Heroico\" to be created in Cuba. Since then the building has seen many versions of the image, and today a permanent steel outline, derived from the photograph, adorns the building.\n\n\"Guerrillero Heroico\" made its American debut in 1968 on New York City Subway billboards, when the image appeared in painted form by Paul Davis, for a poster advertising the February issue of Evergreen Review. Paul Davis has stated that he was \"inspired by Italian paintings of martyred saints and Christ\", in his romanticised version of Che.\n\nHowever, the fascination was not solely an American phenomenon. For instance, British journalist Richard Gott who met with Che Guevara several times expressed a similar view, by stating how he was \"struck by his magnetic physical attraction, comparable to the aura of a rock star.\" In Gott's opinion \"almost everyone had the same impression, and journalists were particularly susceptible.\" \"Time\" magazine, in an August 8, 1960, cover story after meeting with Guevara displayed this view, by remarking that Che wore \"a smile of melancholy sweetness that many women find devastating.\"\n\nArgentine journalist Julia Costenlos, recalls that in her view he was \"blessed with a unique appeal, an incalculable enchantment that came completely naturally.\" Indian Ambassador K Gajendra Singh, posted in 1965 as a young diplomat in Algiers, recalls his own similar personal encounter with meeting Guevara; describing him as \"indisputably the dazzling star of the show\" and compared shaking his hand at an economic seminar to \"getting an autograph of a celebrity.\" According to Singh, Che's \"charismatic presence in green olive fatigues and black beret\" at the time embodied \"the very best of the Hollywood and Bollywood stars all rolled into one\" Even under duress, \"The Times\" journalist Henry Brandon, who spoke with Guevara at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, remarked that Che possessed a \"genial charm\" that \"might have made Charles Boyer envious.\"\n\nIn judging the enduring appeal of the image, Darrel Couturier, representative for Korda since 1997, has opined that it was \"the image of a very dashing young man\" and that in the \"age of free love and flower power … the time was ripe for a figure\" or \"image that could represent this great diversity in thinking and behavior the world over.\" According to Couturier, this \"age of religious revolution\", matched with Guevara's premature death, \"elevated him to almost martyrdom.\"\n\nAs pop artists took to the image with glee, it evolved into a popular and heavily commercialized icon that often strayed far from Che’s hard-line Marxist message. British pop artist Sir Peter Blake has referred to \"Guerrillero Heroico\" as \"one of the great icons of the 20th century.\" When converted into a stark black cut-out, Korda's photograph became easy, cheap, and fast to copy using the favored material and method of the 1960s: lith film and screen painting. By the time of his death in 1967, Che was already \"a legend, the romantic epitome of worldwide rebellion\" and in the wake of his perceived martyrdom, Korda's photograph went viral. Rebellious young people found in it a \"sense of empowerment, a crystallization of the perennial idealism of youth.\"\nAccording to the V&A Museum, \"the photograph enshrines Che as a mythic hero. Taken from below, the revolutionary leader with searching eyes and resolute expression becomes larger than life. A perspective that dominates the imagery of social realism, it bears an irresistible aura of authority, independence and defiance.\" The V&A Museum goes on to state that Korda's famous photograph first deified Che and turned him into an icon of radical chic. Its story, a complex mesh of conflicting narratives, gave \"Guerrillero Heroico\" a life of its own, an enduring fascination independent of Che himself. The Italian magazine \"Skime\" evokes even more praise, decreeing it \"absolutely the most famous of history\" while proclaiming that it \"captures beauty and youth, courage and generosity, aesthetic and moral virtues of a person who possessed all the characteristics necessary to be converted into a symbol of an epoch like ours, lacking in historic legends and mythic incarnations.\" Journalist Richard Gott has also remarked that \"the red star in Che's beret was up there with 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. Jonathan Green, director of the UCR photography museum, has remarked that \"pop art is a rejection of traditional figuration, rhetoric, and rendition. Its egalitarian anti-art stance was the perfect corollary for Che's anti-establishment attitude.\"\n\nFitzpatrick's graphic was later used in a 1968 painting attributed to Andy Warhol and sold to a gallery in Rome. The painting used the same graphic processes used on the acclaimed Marilyn Monroe pieces. However this painting was a forgery, created by Gerard Malanga who was in need of money. When Warhol heard of the fraud, he \"authenticated\" the fake, provided that all the money from sales went to him.\n\n\n\nThe Che image has been cited as an example of the merging of politics and marketing and the power that images hold over our society. Trisha Ziff, the curator of a 2004 touring exhibition on the iconography of Che has stated that \"Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has become the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level, whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalisation. Its presence, everywhere from Belfast to Soweto, or from walls in the Palestinian territories to Parisian boutiques, makes it an image that is out of control. It has become a corporation, an empire, at this point.\"\n\nAlberto Korda's photograph has received wide distribution and modification, appearing on countless numbers of T-shirts, posters, consumer products, protest banners, personal tattoos, and in many other formats. It has morphed into an iconic countercultural symbol for a new generation of youth. The image is now worn on the chests of a diverse group of individuals, from those who truly support the ideals that Che Guevara lived for, to those expressing a more generalized anti-authoritarian stance.\n\nJournalist Michael Casey, in his 2009 book \"Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image\", notes how the universal image can be found \"in all corners of the world\" and theorizes that it arrived as a symbol of rebellion during an era when the world was aching for change. In defining Korda's photograph as a \"brand\" and \"quintessential post-modern icon\", Casey notes that somehow the photograph encapsulates \"hope and beauty,\" which causes people around the globe to \"invest their dreams in it.\" While David Kunzle, author of the book \"Che Guevara: Icon, Myth, and Message\", has opined that \"The beret functions subliminally as a flattened halo.\"\n\nTrisha Ziff, the curator of \"Che! Revolution and Commerce\" describes \"Guerrillero Heroico\" as a \"statuesque image taken from below,\" which \"derives from a visual language of mythologized heroes harking back to an era of socialist realism\" while referencing \"a classical Christ-like demeanor.\" Jon Lee Anderson, author of \"Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life\", in the photograph Che appears \"as the ultimate revolutionary icon\" with \"his eyes staring boldly into the future\" and \"his expression a virile embodiment of outrage at social injustice.\"\n\nThe stylized image of Che Guevara, adapted from Korda's photograph, is commonly accompanied by several different symbols that add context to its inherent suggested meaning. The most common of these are the red star, hammer and sickle, Cuban flag, and the saying in Spanish \"Hasta la Victoria Siempre\" (Translation: \"Towards Victory, Always\"). The multi meaning phrase became the sign off for Che Guevara's numerous letters and speeches as a revolutionary, and represent the commitment to both never give up on the eventual triumph of a Marxist world revolution, and the belief that this victory once it occurs, will be eternal. As a result, \"Hasta la Victoria Siempre\" has become a de facto slogan or catchphrase, used as a motto by those who continue to support and/or admire Che Guevara's life and/or ideals.\n\nFor decades the famous image was unhindered by international copyright agreements, because Cuba was not a signatory to the Berne Convention. Fidel Castro described it as a \"bourgeois concept\" which meant that artists and advertisers were free to use Korda’s work as they pleased. Legally, Cuban Law no. 156 signed on September 28, 1994, to amend part of Law no. 14 of the 1977 Copyright Act (Article 47), states that pictures taken in Cuba fall into the public domain worldwide, 25 years after their first use. As for the United States, since the image was first published in Cuba without compliance with U.S. copyright formalities and used in Cuba before February 20, 1972 (more than 25 years before Cuba signed the Berne Convention in 1997) it is also generally, although not universally, considered to be in the public domain.\n\nDespite conflicting claims about whether or not the image could have copyright established, Korda's children have sought to control commercial use of the image from defamation. Korda's daughter Diana Diaz pursued a 2003 lawsuit in France against a Paris-based press rights group Reporters Without Borders, for using the Che photograph in a poster campaign decrying Cuba as \"the world's largest jail\", aimed at dissuading French tourists from vacationing in Cuba after the jailing of 29 dissident journalists. In suing the group for 1.14 million euros, Diaz's lawyer, Randy Yaloz remarked that \"we are going after everyone who betrays the moral rights of my client\". Moral rights are a separate component of copyright law that are not recognized in the U.S., but are recognized in some other countries, notably in France where Diaz filed the lawsuit. Moral rights aim to protect the integrity of a work from defamation, distortion, slander, or offensive mutilation, even if the originator no longer owns the copyright. However, Reporters Without Borders stopped using the image before any legal judgment was rendered.\n\nAriana Hernández-Reguant addressed the image's copyright status in 2004 in her article \"Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism\". She expressed a skeptical view towards Korda's heirs being able to establish ownership over the image, noting in reference to the lawsuits involving the image, \"There was never any official ruling on whether the depiction constituted a violation of copyright.\" The author goes on to state that: \"Korda took the picture while working for a state-run newspaper, his actual property rights would be questionable under both Cuban and international law.\"\n\nIn 2007, law student Sarah Levy also addressed the potential legal status of the image in Cuba. It was her ultimate contention that \"in Cuba the copyright protection in Korda's Guevara photograph would have already expired, and despite the claims of ownership from Korda's heirs, the State would now hold any rights associated with the photograph.\" In regards to the more commonly disseminated stylized version of the photograph, lawyers say it will be an uphill struggle to deter non-photographic use of such a widely reproduced image, other than in countries like Italy where laws protect image rights.\n\nGuevara's heirs also believe they have legal justification to prevent the image's \"exploitation\" or slander. Guevara's Cuban widow Aleida March stated in 2005 that \"We have a plan to deal with the misuse. We can't attack everyone with lances like Don Quixote, but we can try to maintain the ethics of Guevara's legacy.\" In reference to this pronouncement, Guevara's daughter Aleida Guevara told Reuters, \"It will be costly and difficult because each country has different laws, but a limit has to be drawn.\" However, the family has not yet mounted any court challenges, and no determination of legal copyright internationally has been established.\n\n\n\n"}

The hectograph has been modernized and made practical for anyone to use.\n\nThe special aniline dyes for making the master image came in the form of ink or in pens, pencils, carbon paper and even typewriter ribbon. Hectograph pencils and pens are sometimes still available. Various other inks have been found usable to varying degrees in the process; master sheets for spirit duplicators have also been pressed into service. Unlike a spirit duplicator master, a hectograph master is not a mirror image. Thus, when using a spirit duplicator master with a hectograph, one writes on the back of the purple sheet, using it like carbon paper to produce an image on the white sheet, rather than writing on the front of the white sheet to produce a mirror image on its back.\n\nThe master is placed on the gelatin and spirits applied to transfer the ink from the master to the gelatin.\n\nAfter transfer of the image to the inked gelatin surface, copies are made by pressing paper against it.\n\nWhen a pad ceased to be useful, the gelatin could be soaked with spirits, the ink sponged away, and the pad left clean for the next master.\n\nA grey-colored, thick, absorbent paper pad was supplied to cover the gelatin surface for storage. This also removed ink from the surface, but it took many hours to do so. Care needed to be taken that the gelatin surface was kept clean, and not damaged (e.g. by fingernails) during duplicating.\n\nThe gelatin process produced print runs of somewhere between 20 and 80 copies, depending upon the skill of the user and the quality of the original. At least eight different colors of hectographic ink were available at one time, but purple was the most popular because of its density and contrast.\n\nHectography, requiring limited technology and leaving few traces behind, has been deemed useful both in low-technology environments and in clandestine circumstances where discretion was necessary. In the earlier 20th century, the process lent itself to small runs of school classroom test papers, church newsletters and science fiction fanzines. Prisoners-of-war at Stalag Luft III (the scene of The Great Escape) and at Colditz Castle during World War II used an improvised hectograph to reproduce documents for a planned escape attempt.\n\nThe Communist authorities in the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Area of China used the process for postage stamps in November 1948, produced in sheets of 35, with 13 $50 values, six $100, twelve $200, two $300 and two $500 values.\n\nIt has also been used, though not very extensively, as an artistic medium in printmaking. The Russian Futurists used it for book illustrations, and the German expressionist Emil Nolde made four hectographs.\n\nStephen King, in his book \"\", writes of how he and his elder brother Dave used the process to create their newspaper, \"Dave's Rag\".\n\nIt was also used in professional situations; in Macy's advertising department during the 1950s and 1960s, full-page newspaper ad layouts were drawn with hectograph pencils and then duplicated on a hectograph to make file copies for future reference. Before the popularization of spirit duplicators and the mimeograph, there were mechanized hectography machines that used a drum, rather than a simple flat tray of gelatin.\n\nIn the final chapters of \"The Pothunters\" by P. G. Wodehouse the major characters use a jellygraph to produce a school magazine at very short notice. Wodehouse assumes his reader knows exactly what a jellygraph is and alludes to its being unattractive: \"This jelly business makes one beastly sticky. I think we'll keep to print in future.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell's \"Keep the Aspidistra Flying\" (1936) describes a somewhat more subversive schoolboy publication:\n\nWhile the hectograph process is obsolete for printing on paper, it is still used for making temporary tattoos on human skin. Tattoo artists use hectograph pencils to draw pictures on paper and then transfer them to the recipient's skin.\n\nIt is also used to create unique acrylic paint prints. The gelatine hectograph has been commercialized by Joan Bess and Lou Ann Gleason. The hectograph has been plasticized, and made more resilient. Recipes are available on the web, to create a plate from common household substances.\n\nThe basic printing technique is simple. One spreads paint over the plate with a brayer, lays a sheet of paper over the paint, rubs the back of the paper a bit and pulls it up. The wet paint adheres to the paper. The interest and uniqueness of the prints comes in by the marks made in the paint before laying the paper down.\n\nThe materials used for printing on are almost as limitless. Any paper can be used. Fabric, plastic/acetate sheets, different types of tape, cardboard, wooden boards, sheet metal, almost anything that paint will stick to can be used. The prints are used in many different artistic applications.\n\n\n"}

The piece is a collection of 539 two-foot-long quilted triangles that honor women from around the world. Through the Flower, Chicago's not-for-profit organization, gifted the collection to University of Louisville Hite Art Institute in 2013 to be available for research and to exhibit.\n\nIn Judy Chicago's autobiography, \"Beyond the Flower\", she discusses initiating the International Quilting Bee, stating that \"people would be invited to submit their triangular quilts. . .honoring women of their own determination. By doing this, I intended to provide an opportunity for community participation and also to counter another criticism that had emerged, this time about my choices of women.\"\n\nIndividual Quilt panels were often created by groups of women after viewing or hearing about Chicago's \"Dinner Party\" . For example, a group from the Chrysallis Center at Saginaw Valley State University, Michigan, visited the Dinner Party exhibition in Chicago in 1981. Returning to Saginaw via bus that evening, they decided they needed to create a quilt panel and submit it to the project. Under the leadership of Rosalie (Riegle) Troester, an English instructor at the University, and Trish Nowicke, Campus Minister, a group of fourteen students created a multicolored butterfly wing (IQB-352) representing the growth stage it symbolizes as well as the student career counseling and support center of which they were members. They completed the project and forwarded their creation to Through the Flower for display in the next Dinner Party venue, Montreal.\n\nThe \"International Honor Quilt\" is a collection of 539 panels of triangular quilts honoring women, women's organizations, and women's issues.\n\n\n\nWomen from around the world wanted to be a part of the feminist spirit of \"The Dinner Party\" as it toured. Twelve countries are represented with over 136 known municipalities. The University of Louisville's Digital Archives has detailed information about locations of all the quilt pieces.\n\n"}
{"id": "190288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190288", "title": "John Tavener", "text": "John Tavener\n\nSir John Kenneth Tavener (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of religious works, including \"The Protecting Veil\", \"Song for Athene\" and \"The Lamb\".\n\nTavener first came to prominence with his cantata \"The Whale\", premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by \"The Guardian\" as \"the musical discovery of the year\", while \"The Times\" said he was \"among the very best creative talents of his generation.\" During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for \"The Protecting Veil\", which as recorded by cellist Steven Isserlis became a bestselling album, and \"Song for Athene\" which was sung at the funeral of Princess Diana. \"The Lamb\" featured in the soundtrack for Paolo Sorrentino's film \"The Great Beauty\". Tavener was knighted in 2000 for his services to music and won an Ivor Novello Award.\n\nTavener was born on 28 January 1944 in Wembley, London. His parents ran a family building firm and his father was also an organist at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Frognal, Hampstead. At the age of 12, Tavener was taken to Glyndebourne to hear Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\", a work he loved for the rest of his life. That same year he heard Stravinsky’s most recent work, \"Canticum Sacrum\", which he later described as \"the piece that woke me up and made me want to be a composer\".\n\nTavener became a music scholar at Highgate School (where a fellow pupil was John Rutter). The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys' voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler's Third Symphony and Orff's \"Carmina Burana\". He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto and, in 1961 with the National Youth Orchestra, Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No. 2. He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church), a post he held for 14 years.\n\nTavener entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1962, where his tutors included Sir Lennox Berkeley. During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.\n\nTavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata \"The Whale\", based on the Old Testament story of Jonah. It was premièred at the London Sinfonietta's début concert, which was also the opening concert of the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on Ringo Starr's home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded the Beatles to have \"The Whale\" recorded by Apple Records and released in 1970. The following year Tavener began teaching at Trinity College of Music, London. Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his \"A Celtic Requiem\", which impressed Benjamin Britten enough to persuade Covent Garden to commission an opera from Tavener: the ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright Gerard McLarnon, was \"Thérèse\". When staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.\n\nTavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou. His chamber opera \"A Gentle Spirit\" (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed \"far superior to \"Thérèse\", with the internal drama more suited to the stage\". Significantly, it also touched on Russian Orthodoxy, to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.\n\nTavener converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977. Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its mysticism, studying and setting to music the writings of Church Fathers and completing a setting of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener's first directly Orthodox-inspired music.\n\nTavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in \"Akhmatova Requiem\": this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its Proms' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished. Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of William Blake's poem \"The Lamb\", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday. This simple homophonic piece is usually performed as a Christmas carol. Later prominent works include \"The Akathist of Thanksgiving\" of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; \"The Protecting Veil\", first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the London Symphony Orchestra at the 1989 Proms; and \"Song for Athene\" (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by Mother Thekla, a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011. \"Song for Athene\" in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997.\n\nTavener's \"Fall and Resurrection\", first performed in 2000, used instruments such as ram's horn, ney flute and kaval. It was dedicated to the Prince of Wales, with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship. In 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work \"The Veil of the Temple\" (which was premièred at the Temple Church, London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as \"the supreme achievement of my life\", it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours. \"Prayer of the Heart\", written for and performed by Björk, was premiered in 2004. In 2007 Tavener composed \"The Beautiful Names\", a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in Arabic.\n\nIt had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left Orthodox Christianity to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including Hinduism and Islam, and became a follower of the Traditionalist philosopher Frithjof Schuon. In an interview with \"The New York Times\", conducted by British music journalist Michael White, Tavener said: \"I reached a point where everything I wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the Orthodox Church, and I felt the need, in my music at least, to become more universalist: to take in other colors, other languages.\" The interviewer also reported at the time that he \"hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian.\" Speaking on the BBC Four television programme \"Sacred Music\" in 2010, Tavener described himself as \"essentially Orthodox\". He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on \"Start the Week\", recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11 November 2013.\n\nIn 1974 he married the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou, but it only lasted eight months. In 1991 he married Maryanna Schaefer with whom he had three children, Theodora, Sofia and Orlando. He suffered from considerable health problems throughout his life. He had a stroke in his thirties, heart surgery and the removal of a tumour in his forties, and suffered two successive heart attacks which left him very frail. He was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome in 1990. Lady Tavener broadcast a charity appeal on BBC Radio 4 in October 2008 on behalf of the Marfan Trust.\n\nTavener had an interest in classic cars, owning an Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire, a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, a Jaguar XJ6 and a Bentley Mulsanne Turbo.\n\nTavener died, aged 69, on 12 November 2013 at his home in Child Okeford, Dorset. In the music world, composers John Rutter and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, cellist Steven Isserlis, Neil Portnow, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, Roger Wright, controller of BBC Radio 3 and director of the Proms, and soprano Patricia Rozario, paid tribute. A tribute was also received from Charles, Prince of Wales.\nTavener's funeral was held at the Anglican Cathedral in Winchester on 28 November 2013. The service was Orthodox, and presided over by Archbishop Gregorios of Thyateira, the representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the most senior Orthodox bishop currently in the UK. Some 700 mourners attended.\n\nJohn Rutter describes Tavener as having the \"very rare gift\" of being able to \"bring an audience to a deep silence.\" According to Steven Isserlis, \"he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write.\"\n\nWhile Tavener's earliest music was influenced by Igor Stravinsky and Olivier Messiaen – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular \"Canticum Sacrum\", and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide registral space and was usually diatonically tonal. Tavener recognised Arvo Pärt as \"a kindred spirit\" and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "916661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=916661", "title": "Jules Joseph Lefebvre", "text": "Jules Joseph Lefebvre\n\nJules Joseph Lefebvre () (14 March 183624 February 1911) was a French figure painter, educator and theorist.\n\nLefebvre was born in Tournan-en-Brie, Seine-et-Marne, on 14 March 1836. He entered the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in 1852 and was a pupil of Léon Cogniet.\n\nHe won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 1861. Between 1855 and 1898, he exhibited 72 portraits in the Paris Salon. In 1891, he became a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts.\n\nHe was professor at the Académie Julian in Paris. Lefebvre is chiefly important as an excellent and sympathetic teacher who numbered many Americans among his 1500 or more pupils.

The title alludes to \"Rubyfruit Jungle\", a 1973 novel by Rita Mae Brown that has explicitly lesbian themes.\n\nThe video bears the signature features of PixelVision: It is black and white and the image is grainy, fuzzy, and contained within a solid black frame. These hallmark characteristics are why PixelVision has been recognized for an erotic, tactile visuality which compliments the video's erotic subject matter.\n\nIssues of female sexuality, and whether or not homoerotic desires can be reconciled with mainstream culture and normative gender roles are explored in the video. The dialogue, presented alternately through spoken words and hand-written quotations on scraps of paper, questions whether or not sapphic attraction is acceptable, and depending on the answer to this, what the future holds for lesbian relationships.\n\nThe dialogue is an almost word-for-word recreation of a conversation between Molly Bolt, the protagonist of \"Rubyfruit Jungle\" with whom Benning identified, and her first girlfriend, Leota. The story is told in the style of a video-diary, through which Benning came out, though it is unclear to what extent the video constitutes an autobiography or memoir. Spoken dialogue is often paired with close-up shots of Benning's eye, while shots of written text pan from left to right, so that at each moment the viewer can read only a portion of what is written on the paper; the movement of the camera mimics the movement of the eye when reading. The dialogue is not attributed to its speakers in the book, nor are they distinguished by medium; both girls' lines appear in written and spoken word. For this reason, the video's dialogue has also been interpreted as an internal conversation between two parts of Sadie herself, one that is more traditional and one that is more rebellious.\n\nAs in other Sadie Benning videos, such as \"Girl Power\", the video is shot in her bedroom which has been said to create an intimate safe space apart from the Heterosexism of the mainstream media and the real world; though there is a tension between the protective shelter of Benning's bedroom and the exposure of her body through close ups of her eyes, hands, and ears. Mainstream media only surfaces when the camera pans over sexualized photos of heterosexual couples, muscular men, and phone sex ads and snippets of heteronormative love songs, including Your Cheatin' Heart, Darling Nikki, (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, Get Up Offa That Thing, and Mardi Gras Mambo.\n"}

She is known for her role as Karen Cooper Fairgate MacKenzie on the 1980s prime-time soap opera \"Knots Landing\" (1979–93), for which she was nominated for a 1982 Emmy Award and won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Actress in 1988, 1991 and 1992. She was the only performer to appear in all 344 episodes of the series.\n\nLee began her career on Broadway in \"Vintage 60\" (1960) and \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" (1961). She made her movie debut in the film version of the latter in 1967. Her other film appearances include the Disney film \"The Love Bug\" (1968), \"The Comic\" (1969) and \"Along Came Polly\" (2004). She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1974 for \"Seesaw\", and for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play in 2001 for \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\". She also played the title role in the 1998 TV film \"Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story\", and Madame Morrible in the Broadway musical \"Wicked\" in 2015.\n\nLee was born Michele Lee Dusick on June 24, 1942, in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Sylvia Helen (née Silverstein) and Jack Dusick, a make-up artist. She is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, her ancestors being from Poland and Russia. She attended Alexander Hamilton High School. Her television career began at age 19, on the December 26, 1961, episode of the CBS-TV sitcom \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\".\n\nWhen Lee was 18, after graduation from high school, she auditioned for the Broadway play, \"Vintage '60\". She soon began appearing in musicals, becoming a Broadway performer at the age of 19 in \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" opposite Robert Morse and Rudy Vallee, a role she reprised in the film version. She also appeared in dramas such as the Los Angeles production of Jerry Herman's \"Parade\" and the Broadway productions of \"Bravo Giovanni\" and \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\".\n\nAfter she sang in the film version of \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", she became known for her roles in the films \"The Comic\", opposite Dick Van Dyke, and \"The Love Bug\", opposite Dean Jones. The latter becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States. That same year, she starred in a special television production of the Jerome Kern–Otto Harbach musical, \"Roberta\", in which she sang \"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\", and also peaked at #52 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with \"L. David Sloane\". After the birth of her son, she worked infrequently until accepting a role on Broadway in \"Seesaw\", which netted her a Tony Award nomination in 1974. After her mother's death, she stopped working to spend time with her son.\n\nIn 1974, Lee starred in the pilot episode for proposed CBS sitcom \"The Michele Lee Show\". She played Michele Burton, a clerk in a hotel newsstand, with support from Stephen Collins. However, only the pilot episode was aired and the series did not proceed. Lee became a busy guest actor in the 1970s, appearing on \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Alias Smith and Jones\", \"Night Gallery\", \"Love, American Style\", \"Fantasy Island\" and \"The Love Boat\".\n\nIn 1979, Lee accepted the role of Karen Fairgate on \"Knots Landing\", a spin-off of the immensely popular \"Dallas\". Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit and became one of the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the \"First Lady of \"Knots Landing\"\" during her guest appearance on \"The Late Show\", which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: \"Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house.\" Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.\n\nAlthough Lee was enjoying a successful career on television, her marriage to actor James Farentino was failing. Farentino and she separated around the same time Lee's onscreen husband, Don Murray, left the series. Lee thus played a single mother on \"Knots Landing\" at the same time she was becoming one in real life. Lee revealed that when her character took off her wedding ring in a 1982 episode, she was taking off her real wedding band.\n\nDuring the fall of 1982, her character met M. Patrick \"Mack\" MacKenzie (Kevin Dobson), who became her screen husband the following year. They would continue working together until the end of the series. Lee won the \"Soap Opera Digest\" Award for Best Lead Actress (Primetime) three times, and was also nominated for an Emmy in 1982 for \"Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series\". In 1983, the writers/producers of \"Knots Landing\" urged her to do a storyline based on prescription drug dependency which became one of her most prominent storylines. Six years later, Lee directed her first of several episodes of the series. In 1991, \"Knots Landing\" reached a milestone with its 300th episode. During the same season, Lee filmed her favorite scene from the series, known as the \"Pollyanna Speech\" among fans. In this scene, for which Lee had much input, Karen reacts strongly against all of the social problems of 1990s society and explains how she does not want to be a Pollyanna and see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rather wanted the world to be rose-colored.\n\nAs \"Knots Landing\" moved into the 1990s, its popularity began to wane, although it had outlived all of its contemporaries. The big budget that the series once had was trimmed to the extent that, in the final season, the higher paid cast members were asked to appear in only 15 of the season's 19 episodes as the production company could not afford to pay them. However, Lee insisted on appearing in all 19 episodes that season, doing her extra four episodes for \"union scale\" pay.\n\nAfter \"Knots Landing\" ended in 1993, Lee has appeared in many made-for-TV movies, including a biopic of late country star Dottie West (\"\") and she became the first woman to star in, direct, and produce a TV movie for Lifetime, \"Color Me Perfect\" (1996). She also starred in the reunion miniseries \"\" (1997), and portrayed novelist Jacqueline Susann in the television biopic \"Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story\" (1998). In 2000, she returned to the Broadway stage in \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\" and received a 2001 Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. In 2004, she returned to feature films in the role of Ben Stiller's character's mother in \"Along Came Polly\". She guest-starred alongside Chita Rivera in a February 2005 episode of \"Will & Grace\". Also in 2005, she reunited with her \"Knots Landing\" co-stars for the nonfiction special \"\", in which the stars reminisced about their time on the hit series. Also in 2005, she appeared alongside Tyne Daly, Leslie Uggams, Christine Baranski and Karen Ziemba for the Kennedy Center Honor of Julie Harris. In 2010, Lee did voice work for an episode of the animated comedy series \"Family Guy\". She returned to Broadway in 2015 to star as Madame Morrible in the musical \"Wicked\".\n\nIn 1963, Lee met actor James Farentino on the set of the play, \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\", and in 1966, they were married. Their son, David Farentino, was born July 6, 1969. Lee and Farentino divorced in 1983. She married producer and writer Fred Rappaport in 1987.\n\n"}

It can be done as art or as a hobby. Napkin folding is most commonly encountered as a table decoration in fancy restaurants. Typically, and for best results, a clean, pressed, and starched square cloth (linen or cotton) napkin is used. There are variations in napkin folding in which a rectangular napkin, a napkin ring, a glass, or multiple napkins may be used.\n\nThe earliest instruction manual for the artistic folding of napkins was published in 1639 by Matthia Gieger, a German meat carver working in Padua, as a part of a series of treatises on culinary arts titled Le tre trattati. Napkin folding has a centuries-old history and dates back to the times of Louis XIV of France (5 September 1638 – 1 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi-Soleil), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death. The shift of the napkin from simply a folded cloth to a folded art object occurred in the 16th century in Florence, Italy around the same as voluminous clothing, such as ballooned sleeves, had become fashionable among the wealthy. Rather than simply laying a tablecloth flat on a table, starched linens were folded into large centerpieces, called \"triumphs,\" that could depict a variety of real and mythical animals, natural elements and architectural forms. A popular gift wedding guests received during this time was a personally folded napkin that distinguished whether they were related to the bride or groom. In the mid-18th century, table setting practices were so specific that in Germany there were particular traditions on how to fold napkins, display figures at the table and arrange plate. During this golden age of napkin folding, there was a school in Nuremberg devoted entirely to this art and butlers had shelves of instructional books to keep up with the changes in the field. Napkin folding in the form of table sculptures began being replaced by porcelain decorations during the 18th century.\n\n\n\n"}

The triangular island took its name after a number of canals and shipbuilding facilities that rendered its appearance similar to Amsterdam. Peter the Great took the opportunity to create a naval port, including a wooden palace for his own use.\n\nDuring the following centuries, the island belonged to the Russian Admiralty, which would adapt the plot for its various needs. Originally, there was a minor shipyard for rowing boats. In 1732, the Admiralty engaged architect Ivan Korobov to construct a network of basins and wooden warehouses along the island's perimeter in order to store lumber for shipbuilding.\n\nIn 1765, Savva Chevakinsky was ordered to rebuild the warehouses in brick but without customary stucco decoration. By 1788, when the project was halted, Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe had designed and supervised the construction of a highly pitched Neoclassical arch over the canal. This magnificent red-brick gateway to the island, known as the New Holland Arch, is flanked by massive Tuscan columns of red granite.\n\nNew Holland did not achieve its present appearance until the building of a naval prison in 1828–29 and a basin for naval architects in 1893. Aleksei Krylov used this basin for testing new models of ships between 1900 and 1908. The most powerful radio station in Imperial Russia was launched there by the General Staff of the Navy in 1915. \n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the 18th-century buildings of New Holland Island fell into neglect, serving time as military barracks, warehouses and (most recently) offices for various commercial enterprises.\n\nOn Navy Day in 2000, New Holland was opened to the public for the emplacements project (1997–2000), an art project created by artists Françoise Dupré and Roxane Permar with support from Russian artists, including Lyudmila Belova and Tatyana Nikolaenko, involving over two dozen artists altogether.\n\nIn 2004, the Ministry of Defense evacuated the buildings, which were to be refurbished for hotels and clubs to a design by Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank, until the consortium running the project ran into difficulties.\n\nIn 2010, a new project was established, under the control of Roman Abramovich, with space for galleries and a museum, possibly to house Abramovich's art collection, acquired with the help of Daria Zhukova. The island opened to the public in 2011. Work Architecture Company (WORKac) of New York is working on the project. The planned £256m complex is intended to combine commercial and residential properties with the restoration of monuments that are protected by UNESCO. A branch of the Centre of Contemporary Art (based in Moscow) is also planned.\n\n"}

NYFAI offered workshops and classes, held performances and exhibitions and special events that contributed to the political and cultural import of the women's movement at the time. The women's art school focused on self-development and discovery as well as art. Nancy Azara introduced \"visual diaries\" to artists to draw and paint images that arose from consciousness-raising classes and their personal lives. In the first half of the 1980s the school was named the Women's Center for Learning and it expanded its artistic and academic programs. Ceres Gallery was opened in 1985 after the school moved to TriBeCa and, like the school, it catered to women artists. NYFAI participated in protests to increase women's art shown at the Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney Museum of American Art and other museums. It held exhibitions and workshops and provided rental and studio space for women artists. Unable to secure sufficient funding to continue its operations, NYFAI closed in 1990. Ceres Gallery moved to SoHo and then to Chelsea and remained a gallery for women's art. However, a group continues to meet called (RE)PRESENT, a series of intergenerational dialogues at a NYC gallery to encourage discussion across generations about contemporary issues for women in the arts. It is open to all.\n\nNew York Feminist Art Institute opened in June 1979 at 325 Spring Street in the Port Authority Building. The founding members and the initial board of directors were Nancy Azara, Miriam Schapiro, Selena Whitefeather, Lucille Lessane, Irene Peslikis and Carol Stronghilos. A board of advisers was established of accomplished artists, educators and professional women. For instance, feminist writer and arts editor at \"Ms. Magazine\" Harriet Lyons was an adviser from its start.\n\nInspired by the actions of the Feminist art movement, the founders sought to create a community that would inspire women artists and help them assess how their art was created in the \"social and psychological context of our identity as women.\"\n\nNYFAI Mission (1979): \"Our vision of the New York Feminist Art Institute obliges us to act now to create an environment for the training of women in the arts. The challenge is to discover a teaching method which encourages women to use personal experience to create a radiant art of our own. The curriculum of the school involves the development of self-awareness in a social and political context, and the development of a sense of group identity. Work is both collective and individual. Consciousness raising and feminist philosophy are the primary components from which the curriculum organically develops.\"\n\nThe Joint Foundation provided a grant that allowed the organization to operate initially. The American Stock Exchange, The Eastman Fund, America the Beautiful Fund, RCA, the Ford Foundation and the NEA also provided grants to the organization. It held biannual open houses and annual benefits to raise funds. One of the earliest was very successful and had Louise Nevelson as a guest of honor. Open house honorees were Alice Neel, Elaine DeKooning, Vivian Browne, Louise Bourgeois, Lenore Tawney, Faith Ringgold, Nancy Spero, Elizabeth Murray and The Guerilla Girls among others.\n\nIn April 1981 the organization held a weekend conference \"Political Consciousness/ Political Action: Dialogues and Strategies for the 80s\" to help women gain a greater sense of personal power and discover ways to engage in the political process. NYFAI also moved to a new location in 1984 in TriBeCa on Franklin Street, which had gallery space for the cooperative Ceres Gallery, additional space for its school and had rental studio and storage space for artists.\n\nIn 1984 they co-sponsored a Museum of Modern Art protest, \"Let MoMA Know: Women Artists Visibility Event (WAVE),\" with the Women's Interart Center, , and the Women's Caucus for Art's New York chapter. They protested the few numbers of women in MoMA's grand-reopening and \"An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture\" exhibition; Of 165 exhibitors, only 14 of them were women. Buttons with the statement, \"The Museum of Modern Art Opens but Not to Women,\" were worn by 400 protesters.\n\nThe Institute, which had struggled with ensuring it had sufficient funding for some time, shut down its operations by 1991. Rutgers University Libraries received its library and archives. The non-profit Ceres Gallery moved in 1992 to SoHo and then Chelsea at 547 West 27th Street.\n\nThe Art Institute focused on self-discovery and art education. First years students participated in consciousness-raising classes developed by Nancy Azara where students created \"visual diaries\" by recording their feelings and thoughts by writing, painting or writing words into art journals. It taught the history of anthropology and art and feminist theory. Art studies included drawing, sculpture, and painting. It was a program that required inspiration and self-motivation, students did not have grades. Performance was measured by teachers assessments and student self-assessments. Students were offered the opportunity to work as apprentices with professional artists. Part-time students attended weekend workshops and evening courses.\n\nThe school added the title the \"Women's Center for Learning\" in the early 1980s. Focused on personal development, it added writing and psychology classes. Its art program was expanded to include basketry, puppetry, printmaking, papermaking, poetry, filmmaking and much more.\n\nHarmony Hammond, Louise Fishman, Arlene Raven, Barbara Hammer, Elke Solomon, Sarah Draney and Zarina Hashmi were instructors and Leila Daw, Faith Ringgold, May Stevens and Darla Bjork taught weekend workshops at the school.\n\nThe school closed in 1990.\n\nCeres Gallery is a feminist, not-for-profit, alternative gallery in New York City, dedicated to the promotion of contemporary women in the arts. Ceres provides an exhibition space that enhances public awareness and helps remediate women’s limited access to commercial galleries. It also serves as a supportive base for a diversity of artistic and political views. Over the years Ceres has encouraged not only artists but writers, musicians, dancers, poets and storytellers to perform in the gallery and take risks with their work that might not be possible in a commercial setting. The members of Ceres Gallery believe the arts provide an important social service - that art has the power to educate, enhance and enrich the quality and depth of people’s lives.\nCeres provides a showcase for women artists regardless of age, artistic style or commercial viability to exhibit their work in New York City, many for the first time. All work meets professional standards of excellence but is not restricted in style, medium or theme. Through its progressive programing, the Gallery has become a gathering place for educational and community activities and in addition to providing the general public with a place to expand their knowledge of contemporary art is also a place for women artists to gather for support and friendship. Many artistic and political events are presented throughout the year with participation by gallery artists, artists not affiliated with the gallery and others from the larger arts community. The gallery operates as a cooperative which means members vote on all decisions including the review of possible new members and they participate in monthly meetings to plan the overall direction of the gallery. In addition, Ceres has a professional Director to facilitate the smooth running of all programs and exhibitions. Currently, Ceres has a roster of showing artists from the New York metropolitan area and from across the country with a small number from countries outside the U.S.\n\nCeres Gallery was founded in 1984 by Rhonda Schaller, Polly Lai and Darla Bjork, in conversation with NYFAI director, artist Nancy Azara as a program of the New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI, 1979-1990). Early members included: Carol Goebel, Phyllis Rosser, Joan Arbeiter, Sandra Branch and Vivien Tsao. The gallery was first located at 91 Franklin Street in Tribeca on the ground floor of the building which housed the New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI). Large salon style shows, joint exhibitions and others were held yearly such as: “Reflections: Women in Their Own Image” and “Heroic Female: Images of Power.” In 1993 it moved to 584 Broadway in SoHo where it remained until 2003. Today, Ceres Gallery has 2000+ square feet in one of Chelsea’s premier art destination buildings, The Landmark Arts Building, 547 West 27th Street. Members still at Ceres include Carol Goebel, Phyllis Rosser and Vivian Tsao.\n\n\n"}

Although it supports up-and-coming artists, PIPA Prize's mission is not to discover new talents, but to recognize new Brazilian contemporary artists that already have a critical following and a place in the art market.\n\nThere are no entries to run for the Prize. The artists that take part in the PIPA Prize are nominated by the Nominating Committee. Each member of the Committee selects up to three artists or art collectives that work in any media. During the 2010 to 2012 editions, each member could nominate up to five artists.\n\nAll of the artists selected by the Nominating Committee are showcased in a printed catalog and get a profile page in the award's website. Of these, four finalists are selected to exhibit their works at the Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro and donate a piece to their collections.\n\nThe winners and the runner-up for the PIPA award also donate an additional work of art to the PIPA Institute.\n\nThe Board is the PIPA’s senior management body, composed of five to eight members, including representatives of PIPA Institute, representatives of MAM/RJ and renowned art experts invited for each edition.\n\nThe Board is responsible for selecting the four finalists from the nominated artists. The Board also nominates the members of the Nominating Committee and the Award Jury.\n\nThe Nominating Committee is a set 20 to 40 art experts, invited in each edition, by the PIPA Board. They can be Brazilian or foreign artists, art critics, collectors, gallerists, or curators.\n\nA group of five to seven members invited by the PIPA Board who will select the winner of PIPA amongst the four finalists. Their decision is based on the artists' portfolio, career, works presented at the MAM/RJ exhibition, and the role that the award would play in their trajectory as artists.\n\nPIPA Prize gives out awards in three categories. There are no restrictions for an artist to win in more than one of them.\n\nPrincipal award. Winners are determined by the Award Jury and receive a cash prize of R$130,000 and a three month long artistic residency at Residency Unlimited, in New York.\n\nWinner is determined by popular vote of those who attended the MAM/RJ exhibition showcasing the four finalists. They receive a cash prize of R$24,000.\n\nThis award is determined by popular vote on the PIPA Prize website and encompasses all of the nominated artists. The website features profiles for each of the nominated artists in both English and Portuguese with photos of their work, texts and videos. From 2012 onward, the voting process happens in two shifts: artists that receive more than 500 votes on the first round go on to the second one, where a winner is determined. First place wins a cash prize of R$10,000, the runner-up receives R$5,000. From 2014 to 2014, the winning artist would also participate in a two month long art residency at Instituto Sacatar, in Bahia.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, the Online category was split up into two distinct categories: PIPA Online, where a juri determined the winner among all nominated artists; and PIPA Popular Online, where the winning artists was selected by popular vote on the award's website.\n\nWinners:\nFinalists: Antonio Obá, Bárbara Wagner, Carla Guagliardi, Éder Oliveira\n\nNominating Committee: Alice Miceli, Ana Candida de Avelar, Anna Bergamasco, Claudia Saldanha, Claudio Mubarac, Consuelo Bassanesi, Daniel Senise, Felipe Ribeiro, Frances Reynolds, Francisco Dalcol, Gabriela Kremer Motta, Gabriela Salgado, João Laia, Josué Mattos, Kaira Cabañas, Marina Câmara, Marta Mestre, Flavia Gimenes, Michelle Sommer, Paulo Nazareth, Paulo Vieira, Tanya Barson, Thyago Nogueira, Vânia Leal Machado, Waldir Barreto Filho.\n\nAward Jury: Leda Catunda, Marcelo Campos, Consuelo Bassanessi, Fernando Cocchiarale, and Luiz Camillo Osorio.\n\nWinners:\nFinalists: Clara Ianni, Gustavo Speridião, Luiza Baldan, Paulo Nazareth\n\nNominating Committee: André Severo, Cadu, Carlito Carvalhosa, Caroline Carrion, Catherine Petitgas, Cauê Alves, Fabio Faisal, Gabriel Pérez-Barreiro, Guilherme Gutman, Jacopo Visconti, Jesús Fuenmayor, Jones Bergamim, José Rufino, Kiki Mazzucchelli, Lenora de Barros, Lisette Lagnado, Luiza Teixeira de Freitas, Manuel Neves, Maria Ines de Almeida, Maria Iovino, Max Perlingeiro, Michael Ashbury, Monica Hoff, Pablo Leon de la Barra, Paulo Miyada, Rosangela Rennó, Solange Farkas, Virginia de Medeiros.\n\nAward Jury: Fernando Cocchiarale, Marisa Flórido, Júlia Rebouças, Milton Machado, and Luiz Camillo Osorio.\n\nWinners:\nFinalists: Cristiano Lenhardt, Leticia Ramos, Marina Rheingantz, Virginia de Medeiros\n\nNominating Committee: Alejandra Hernández Muñoz, Alice Miceli, Aline Figueiredo Espíndola, Carlos Eduardo Bitu Cassundé, Daniel Rangel, Daniela Labra, Felipe Scovino, Fernanda Brenner, Fernanda Lopes, Gabriela Kremer Motta, Guilherme Simões de Assis, Janaina Melo, Josué Mattos, Júlia Rebouças, Luisa Duarte, Manuela Moscoso, Mara Fainziliber, Marcelo Rezende, Maria Montero, Marisa Mokarzel, Marta Mestre, Orlando Maneschy, Pablo Lafuente, Pedro Barbosa, Tadeu Chiarelli, Vanda Klabin.\n\nAward Jury: Cauê Alves, Gilberto Chateaubriand, Luiz Camillo Osorio, Pablo Leon de La Barra, Rosangela Rennó\n\nWinners:\nFinalists: Alice Miceli, Daniel Steegmann Mangrané, Thiago Martins de Melo, Wagner Malta Tavares\n\nNominating Committee: Agustin Pérez Rubio, Alejandra Hernández Muñoz, Alexia Tala, Alfredo Setubal, Antonio Manuel, Beatriz Milhazes, Cadu, Carlos Eduardo Bitu Cassundé, Catherine Petitgas, Charles Watson, Cristiana Tejo, Daniela Labra, Fabio Cypriano, Fabio Szwarcwald, Fernando Oliva, Fersen Lamas Lambranho, Guilherme Simões de Assis, Heitor Reis, Jacqueline Jappur Plass, Jesús Fuenmayor, Jorge Menna Barreto, José Resende, Kaira M.

{"id": "465495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465495", "title": "Public Domain Enhancement Act", "text": "Public Domain Enhancement Act\n\nThe Public Domain Enhancement Act (PDEA) ( (108th Congress), (109th Congress)) was a bill in the United States Congress which, if passed, would have added a tax for copyrighted works to retain their copyright status. The purpose of the bill was to make it easier to determine who holds a copyright (by determining the identity of the person who paid the tax), and to allow copyrighted works which have been abandoned by their owners, also known as orphan works, to pass into the public domain.\n\nIn the bill's latest form, the tax would have been a multiple-time affair, a sum of US$1 per work charged 50 years after the date of first publication or on December 31, 2006, whichever occurs later, and every 10 years thereafter until the end of the copyright term, only on works first published within the United States (as charging it from foreigners would violate the Berne convention except in some interpretations of the Berne three-step test). Failure to pay the Copyright Office the copyright renewal fee on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter would allow the work to irreversibly lapse into the public domain in the United States and other countries and areas applying the rule of the shorter term of the Berne Convention. However, if payments are made in time, the copyright may be extended to the end of the normal maximum term, currently 95 years for a work made for hire. In practice, this would resemble copyright renewal under the Copyright Act of 1909, but the bill will create a 50-year term renewable five times for 45 years.\n\nThe problem that the law attempts to solve is that the cost of locating the owner of a work is often prohibitive. For works that are still in print, this is usually not a problem, but otherwise there is typically not a clear record of whether the original creator transferred the rights, died, or had a clear successor to its rights. The PDEA solves this problem by requiring a small tax to maintain copyright on a work. For works that the copyright owner no longer cares about, the copyright will lapse, and so copies and derivatives can be made freely. The Act would also require the Copyright Office to maintain an easily searchable database, so that for works that the original publisher still wishes to maintain copyright on, potential derivative creators can find out who paid the US$1 tax and negotiate with them for permission.\n\nThis bill was first introduced in the House on June 25, 2003 by representatives Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and John T. Doolittle (R-CA) where it went to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On September 4, 2003, it moved to the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. On May 17, 2005 it was reintroduced by Lofgren as H.R. 2408, and was once again referred to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nOpposition to the Public Domain Enhancement Act comes from the entertainment industry sphere, particularly the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its lobbyists. In his book \"Free Culture\", Lawrence Lessig lays out the reason for the MPAA opposition to the bill:\n\n\nProponents such as Lessig have suggested that copyright holders may be motivated to oppose the PDEA by a competitive threat: a huge wave of abandoned works would spill into the public domain which could form the basis of new derived works that would compete commercially with established copyrighted works.\n\n"}
{"id": "23194446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23194446", "title": "Puss in Boots", "text": "Puss in Boots\n\n\"Master Cat, or The Booted Cat\" (; ), commonly known in English as \"Puss in Boots\", is a European literary fairy tale about a cat who uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low-born master. The oldest telling is by Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola, who included it in his \"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\" (c. 1550–53) in XIV–XV. Another version was published in 1634 by Giambattista Basile with the title \"Cagliuso\", and a tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by Charles Perrault (1628–1703), a retired civil servant and member of the \"Académie française\". The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\". The book was an instant success and remains popular.\nPerrault's \"Histoires\" has had considerable impact on world culture. The original Italian title of the first edition was \"Costantino Fortunato\", but was later known as \"Il gatto con gli stivali\" (lit. \"The cat with the boots\"); the French title was \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé, avec des moralités\" with the subtitle \"Les Contes de ma mère l'Oye\" (\"Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals\", subtitled \"Mother Goose Tales\"). The frontispiece to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed \"MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES\" and is credited with launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. \"Puss in Boots\" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries. The cat appears in the third act \"pas de caractère\" of Tchaikovsky's ballet \"The Sleeping Beauty\", and appears in the sequels to the animated film \"Shrek\". Puss in Boots is a popular pantomime in the UK.\n\nThe tale opens with the third and youngest son of a miller receiving his inheritance—a cat. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the mules. The feline is no ordinary cat, however, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, for which he is rewarded.\n\nOne day, the king decides to take a drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, who falls in love with him at once.\n\nThe cat hurries ahead of the coach, ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the \"Marquis of Carabas\", saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion, frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and, impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter, the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement.\n\nThe tale is followed immediately by two morals: \"one stresses the importance of possessing \"industrie\" and \"savoir faire\" while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess.\" The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas.\n\nThis is the theme in France, but other versions of this theme exist in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nPerrault's \"The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots\" is the most renowned tale in all of Western folklore of the animal as helper. However, the trickster cat was not Perrault's invention. Centuries before the publication of Perrault's tale, Somadeva, a Kashmir Brahmin, assembled a vast collection of Indian folk tales called \"Kathā Sarit Sāgara\" (lit. \"The ocean of the streams of stories\") that featured stock fairy tale characters and trappings such as invincible swords, vessels that replenish their contents, and helpful animals. In the \"Panchatantra\" (lit. \"Five Principles\"), a collection of Hindu tales from the fifth century A.D., a tale follows a cat who fares much less well than Perrault's Puss as he attempts to make his fortune in a king's palace.\n\nIn 1553, \"Costantino Fortunato\", a tale similar to \"Le Maître Chat\", was published in Venice in Giovanni Francesco Straparola's \"Le Piacevoli Notti\" (lit. \"The Facetious Nights\"), the first European storybook to include fairy tales. In Straparola's tale however, the poor young man is the son of a Bohemian woman, the cat is a fairy in disguise, the princess is named Elisetta, and the castle belongs not to an ogre but to a lord who conveniently perishes in an accident. The poor young man eventually becomes King of Bohemia. An edition of Straparola was published in France in 1560. The abundance of oral versions after Straparola's tale may indicate an oral source to the tale; it also is possible Straparola invented the story.\n\nIn 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was published in Giambattista Basile's collection \"Pentamerone\" although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved in a manner similar to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.\n\nIt is likely that Perrault was aware of the Straparola tale, since 'Facetious Nights' was translated into French in the sixteenth century and subsequently passed into the oral tradition.\nThe oldest record of written history was published in Venice by the Italian author Giovanni Francesco Straparola in his \"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\" (c. 1550-53) in XIV-XV. His original title was \"Costantino Fortunato\" (lit. \"Lucky Costantino\").\n\"Le Maître Chat, ou le Chat Botté\" was later published by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 in a collection of tales called \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\". The collection included \"La Belle au bois dormant\" (\"The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood\"), \"Le petit chaperon rouge\" (\"Little Red Riding Hood\"), \"La Barbe bleue\" (\"Blue Beard\"), \"Les Fées\" (\"The Enchanted Ones\", or \"Diamonds and Toads\"), \"Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre\" (\"Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper\"), \"Riquet à la Houppe\" (\"Riquet with the Tuft\"), and \"Le Petit Poucet\" (\"Hop o' My Thumb\"). The book displayed a frontispiece depicting an old woman telling tales to a group of three children beneath a placard inscribed \"CONTES DE MA MERE L'OYE\" (Tales of Mother Goose). The book was an instant success.\n\n\"Le Maître Chat\" first was translated into English as \"The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots\" by Robert Samber in 1729 and published in London for J. Pote and R. Montagu with its original companion tales in \"Histories, or Tales of Past Times, By M. Perrault\". The book was advertised in June 1729 as being \"very entertaining and instructive for children\". A frontispiece similar to that of the first French edition appeared in the English edition launching the Mother Goose legend in the English-speaking world. Samber's translation has been described as \"faithful and straightforward, conveying attractively the concision, liveliness and gently ironic tone of Perrault's prose, which itself emulated the direct approach of oral narrative in its elegant simplicity.\" Since that publication, the tale has been translated into various languages and published around the world.\n\nPerrault's son Pierre Darmancour was assumed to have been responsible for the authorship of \"Histoires\" with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the youngest niece of Louis XIV, which was signed \"P. Darmancour\". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in \"contes de veille\" or \"contes de ma mère l'oye\", and in 1693 published a versification of \"Les Souhaits Ridicules\" and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called \"Peau d'Ane\". Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including \"Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Botté\") existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication. Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales. Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for \"La Belle au bois dormant\", which the paper had published in 1696.\n\nPerrault's tale has been adapted to various media over the centuries. Ludwig Tieck published a dramatic satire based on the tale, called \"Der gestiefelte Kater\", and, in 1812, the Brothers Grimm inserted a version of the tale into their \"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\". In ballet, Puss appears in the third act of Tchaikovsky's \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in a \"pas de caractère\" with The White Cat. In film and television, Walt Disney produced an animated black and white silent short based on the tale in 1922. It was also adapted into a manga by the famous Japanese writer and director Hayao Miyazaki in 1969, and in the mid-1980s, \"Puss in Boots\" was televised as an episode of \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" with Ben Vereen and Gregory Hines in the cast. Another version from the \"Cannon Movie Tales\" series features Christopher Walken as Puss, who in this adaptation is a cat who turns into a human when wearing the boots. Another adaptation of the character with little relation to the story was in the Pokémon anime episode \"Like a Meowth to a Flame,\" where a Meowth owned by the character Tyson wore boots, a hat, and a neckerchief. DreamWorks Animation released the animated feature \"Puss in Boots\", with Antonio Banderas reprising his voice-over role of Puss in Boots from the \"Shrek\" films, on November 4, 2011. This new film's story bears no similarities to the book. The cat food named Puss n Boots is owned by Retrobrands USA LLC and is available in the United States and Canada.\n\nJacques Barchilon and Henry Pettit note in their introduction to \"The Authentic Mother Goose: Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes\" that the main motif of \"Puss in Boots\" is the animal as helper and that the tale \"carries atavistic memories of the familiar totem animal as the father protector of the tribe found everywhere by missionaries and anthropologists.\" They also note that the title is original with Perrault as are the boots; no tale prior to Perrault's features a cat wearing boots.\n\nFolklorists Iona and Peter Opie observe that \"the tale is unusual in that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning acceptance of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues.\" The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of \"Histoires\" is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author \"heard\" them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in the simplicity of the tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered \"populaire\" and \"du bas peuple\", and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside.\n\nAccording to the Opies, Perrault's great achievement was accepting fairy tales at \"their own level.\" He neither recounted them with impatience nor mockery, and without feeling that they needed any aggrandisement such as a frame story—although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming \"moralité\". Perrault would be revered today as the father of folklore if he had taken the time to record where he obtained his tales, when, and under what circumstances.\n\nBruno Bettelheim remarks that \"the more simple and straightforward a good character in a fairy tale, the easier it is for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other.\" The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as \"Puss in Boots\" build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life. Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in \"Puss in Boots\") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.\n\nIn \"Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion\" Jack Zipes notes that Perrault \"sought to portray ideal types to reinforce the standards of the civilizing process set by upper-class French society\". A composite portrait of Perrault's heroines, for example, reveals the author's idealized female of upper-class society is graceful, beautiful, polite, industrious, well groomed, reserved, patient, and even somewhat stupid because for Perrault, intelligence in womankind would be threatening. Therefore, Perrault's composite heroine passively waits for \"the right man\" to come along, recognize her virtues, and make her his wife. He acts, she waits. If his seventeenth century heroines demonstrate any characteristics, it is submissiveness.\n\nA composite of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates the opposite of his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility to work their way up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.\n\nAccording to fairy and folk tale researcher and commentator Jack Zipes, Puss is \"the epitome of the educated bougeois secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence.\" The cat has enough wit and manners to impress the king, the intelligence to defeat the ogre, and the skill to arrange a royal marriage for his low-born master. Puss's career is capped by his elevation to \"grand seigneur\" and the tale is followed by a double moral: \"one stresses the importance of possessing \"industrie et savoir faire\" while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess.\"\n\nThe renowned illustrator of Dickens' novels and stories, George Cruikshank, was shocked that parents would allow their children to read \"Puss in Boots\" and declared: \"As it stood the tale was a succession of successful falsehoods—a clever lesson in lying!—a system of imposture rewarded with the greatest worldly advantages.\"\n\nAnother critic, Maria Tatar, notes that there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a \"linguistic virtuoso\", a creature who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. \"Puss in Boots\" has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, \"it has something to do with inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters.\"\nBriggs does assert that cats were a form of fairy in their own right having something akin to a fairy court and their own set of magical powers. Still, it is rare in Europe's fairy tales for a cat to be so closely involved with human affairs. According to Jacob Grimm, Puss shares many of the features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent seven-league boots. This may mean that the story of \"Puss and Boots\" originally represented the tale of a family deity aiding an impoverished family member.\n\nStefan Zweig, in his 1939 novel, \"Ungeduld des Herzens\", references Puss in Boots' procession through a rich and varied countryside with his master and drives home his metaphor with a mention of Seven League Boots.\n\n\n\n"}

To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the digital humanities and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of computer science and software engineering, which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.\n\nThe conceptual origins of software studies include Marshall McLuhan's focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in Friedrich Kittler's essay, \"Es gibt keine Software,\" Lev Manovich's \"Language of New Media\", and Matthew Fuller's \"Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software\". Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and computer-aided design are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.\n\nThe first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.\n\nIn 2008, MIT Press launched a \"Software Studies\" book series with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's \"Software Studies: a Lexicon\"), and the first academic program was launched, (Lev Manovich, Benjamin H. Bratton and Noah Wardrip-Fruin's \"Software Studies Initiative\" at U. California San Diego). \nIn 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established \"Computational Culture\", an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for \"inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures.\"\n\nSoftware studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the digital humanities that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective. Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code. Notably related are critical code studies, which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program, and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.\n\n\n\n"}

The sculpture was commissioned by Brian Maxwell of Powerbar the Maxwell Family Foundation for the late environmentalist David Brower and its name was often used by Brower referring to mankind traveling through life in a common vehicle. Today the sculpture is located at Kennesaw State University adjacent to the Social Science building, the first LEED-certified building at the University System of Georgia.\n\nThe 175-ton chunk of rock was formed from 88 individual pieces of quartzite and bonded with specially made polyepoxide. After these pieces were in place, Eino attached a life-size bronze model of the late Brower. Additionally, 2,400 bronze pieces were added to the exterior to outline land masses on the earth.\n\n\"Spaceship Earth\" was completed in August 2006 and unveiled in October. The sculpture broke apart and started spilling over just two months later. First reports cited poor adhesive and unsound construction contributed to its demise while Eino argued that it had to have been an act of vandalism. The sculpture was rededicated in November 2006.\n\nA few months before the November 2000 death of the first Executive Director Sierra Club and lifelong environmentalist David Brower, the founders of PowerBar, Brian and Jennifer Maxwell, commissioned the 175-ton tribute in his honor. It was during a morning run with photographer Galen Rowell and PowerBar's Brian Maxwell that the tribute was conceived. Shortly after Maxwell met with his friend, environmentalist and Finnish-American artist Eino, to create such a sculpture.\n\nEino was sent stone samples from a rock quarry in Brazil at the start of the project and \"[he] thought, oh my, this is three times harder than marble. But immediately I understood this was the right stone. It is more permanent than anything else. No pollution can hurt it. No graffiti will harm it. It was the right stone to be here for 1,000 years.\" Over 175 tons of Brazilian blue quartzite was shipped and stored in a parking lot while Eino and Maxwell sought to secure a home for the sculpture. Locations in Berkeley to Washington, D.C., were proposed, but all were turned down by local art commissions or city councils. For nearly a year, Eino argued to have the sculpture placed in the streets of San Francisco, but the San Francisco Arts Commission’s Visual Arts Committee turned it down by saying it \"not only had little or nothing to do with the city\" but \"was too big and did not represent Brower's ideals.\"\n\nLater, in 2004, Jennifer Maxwell, then the widow of Brian Maxwell, contacted the City of Berkeley to find a home for the tribute. A few members of the Berkeley Arts Commission spoke out against the sculpture's design and how it seemed to be forced on the city. In October 2004, the commission voted 7-2 to accept the sculpture with conditions. For final approval by the Civic Art Commission sculpture could not be adorned with the bronze statue of Brower, and the Maxwell family had to pay the entire installation cost. By 2005, with a push from the Mayor, the Civic Art Commission found nearly 30 different locations the sculpture could live. In August 2005, two Berkeley area commissions voted to consider another location. While negotiations were dragging on with bureaucrats in Berkeley, officials at Kennesaw State University contacted Eino and accepted the memorial.\n\nToday the sculpture resides at Kennesaw State University, adjacent to the Social Science building. Nearly six years after its conception, Spaceship Earth was finished and unveiled on October 20, 2006. In late December 2006, only three months after its installation on campus, \"Spaceship Earth\" collapsed. The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet. After the collapse, Eino attributed the disaster to vandalism, but later reports associated the collapse with poor construction. Reconstruction was to begin in February 2007 but was delayed until July and was completed by November 2007.\n\n"}

{"id": "1970651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970651", "title": "The Eternal Jew (1940 film)", "text": "The Eternal Jew (1940 film)\n\nThe Eternal Jew is a 1940 antisemitic German Nazi propaganda film, presented as a documentary. The film's initial German title is Der ewige Jude, the German term for the character of the \"Wandering Jew\" in medieval folklore. At the insistence of Nazi Germany's Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, the film was directed by Fritz Hippler.\n\nWith a screenplay credited to Eberhard Taubert, the film consists of feature and documentary footage combined with materials filmed shortly after the Nazi occupation of Poland. At this time, Poland's Jewish population was about three million, roughly ten percent of the total population. Actor Harry Giese narrated.\n\nHitler and Goebbels believed that film was a vital tool for molding public opinion. The Nazis first established a film department in 1930 and Goebbels had taken a personal interest in the use of film to promote the Nazi philosophy and agenda. Soon after the Nazi takeover, Goebbels insisted in speeches that the role of the German cinema was to serve as the \"vanguard of the Nazi military\".\n\nThe Goebbels film appears to have been intended as a violently anti-Semitic version of the British film \"The Wandering Jew\", which argued that Jews were victims of relentless persecution throughout history. Saul Friedländer suggests that Goebbels' intent was to counter three films: \"Jew Süss\", \"The House of Rothschild\", and \"The Wandering Jew\". These three films, all released in 1933-34, showed that Jews were persecuted throughout history; the Goebbels films presented the opposite message.\n\nIn 1937, a special wing of the Propaganda Ministry put on an art exhibition in Munich titled \"Der ewige Jude\". It followed this up with the publication of a book of the same title, consisting of 265 photographs, each with a derogatory caption asserting the degeneracy of the Jewish race.\n\nIn November 1938, Goebbels made a series of attacks against the Jews in the German media that were a factor which resulted in the pogrom known as Kristallnacht. Despite the emotional satisfaction afforded the Nazis by carrying out their antisemitism with direct violence, Kristallnacht was considered by Hitler to have been a political disaster both within Germany and internationally. Not only did the brutality indirectly caused by Goebbels evoke harsh criticism internationally, the mixed reaction in the German media showed a lack of broad-based support among Germans for antisemitism and violence.\n\nHitler expressed his frustration and anger at the mixed response from the German media and insisted that, instead of openly calling for violence against the Jews as Goebbels had in instigating the pogrom, Nazi propaganda should \"elucidate events of foreign policy\" in such a way that the German people themselves would call for violence against the Jews.\n\nIn response to Hitler's harsh reprimand, Goebbels launched a campaign to promote the anti-Semitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an anti-Semitic film. In the case of \"The Eternal Jew\", Goebbels conceived of a film that would communicate to the German people the same antisemitic message that had been the theme of the 1937 Munich exhibition. Hitler preferred films such as \"The Eternal Jew\" which presented the Nazi anti-Semitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straightforward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching anti-Semitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal. The film \"Jud Süß\" is an example of Goebbels' preferred approach.\n\nAlthough Goebbels did not generally take an active role in the production of particular films, he elected to do so in the case of major propaganda films such as \"The Eternal Jew\". The film was in production for over a year. Throughout the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, Goebbels devoted \"constant attention\" to the production of what he referred to as \"the Jew film\".\nAs early as 1938, Goebbels had wanted to have a film crew travel to Poland to shoot the ghetto scenes; however, he was unable to gain permission from the Polish government. In October and November 1939, almost immediately after the German/Soviet invasion of Poland, he instructed Hippler to send camera crews to Łódź, Warsaw, Cracow and Lublin to shoot footage of Polish Jews. \n\nThe footage that Hippler shot in the Jewish ghettos of those cities in German occupied Poland was the only footage shot specifically for the purpose of the film. At the beginning of the film, animated text informs the audience that this \"documentary footage\" shows Jews in their original state \"before they put on the mask of civilized Europeans.\" In the Nazi press, Hippler expanded on this claim, asserting that his filming techniques captured Jews \"in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings.\"\n\nAlthough Hippler advertised the film as being a factual documentary consisting of pictures of real Jews with nothing faked or simulated, his claims were complete falsehoods. In reality, the film was an exercise in manipulation for the purposes of propaganda. In shooting his footage, Hippler did in fact simulate scenes and use actors who were performing under duress and without knowledge of how the footage would be employed. For example, in order to get shots of Jewish worship services, Hippler and Goebbels assembled the congregation of the Vilker synagogue, ordered them to wear the \"tallithim\" and \"tefillin\" and hold a full-scale service. When the Germans ordered the Torah reader to read from the Torah, he started by saying on camera \"Today is Tuesday\" signalling that his reading of the Torah was coerced since it was not customary to read the Torah on Tuesdays.\n\nAside from the footage shot in Poland, the rest of the film consisted of stills and archival footage from feature films (often without permission) that the film presented as if they were documentary footage.\n\nThe movie was produced in a documentary format and, like other Hippler films, relied heavily on narration.\n\nThe film can be roughly divided into four thematic areas:\n\nRichard Barsam writes the film's \"essential contrast is between myths and stereotypes of Jews and the Nazi ideal of a 'master race,' between the alleged inferiority of the Jews and the superiority of the Germans.\" According to Stephen Fritz, Goebbels' intent was to create a film that would serve as \"both a demonstration of the parasitical nature of the Jews and a justification for drastic measures against them.\" Maria Tatar writes that the Nazis were able to use Hippler's film to \"position the victims of their genocidal project as dangerous aggressors who had to be exterminated.\" Similarly, Barsam describes the film as arguing that \"Jews are criminals;... they have no soul;... they are different in every way;... killing them is not a crime, but a necessity—just as killing rats is a necessity to preserve health and cleanliness.\"\n\n\"Unser Wille und Weg\", a Nazi Party monthly publication aimed at propagandists, provides a rationale for why \"The Eternal Jew\" was made. The author of the essay \"The Film of a 2000-Year Rat Migration,\" who remains anonymous, believes the film shows \"a full picture of Jewry\" and provides \"the best treatment of this parasitic race.\" The author connects the Jews' migration from the Middle East to Egypt and their following of German colonists to rats traveling as a group, who \"even then displayed the same criminal traits that they still displayed\". The film is complimented for \"its portrayal of the Jews' vulgar methods and the brutality and all-devouring hatred they exhibit when they reach their goal and control finance.\" The slaughtering method causes the author to question the \"so-called Jewish religion\", as butchers do their work with grins on their face. In closing, the author states the film will be a valuable tool in the struggle to break the Jews' \"power over us. We are the initiators of the fight against world Jewry, which now directs its hate, its brutal greed and destructive will toward us. We must win this battle for ourselves, for Europe, for the world.\"\n\nRichard Taylor describes the basic tenet of the film as arguing that \"the Jew is an oriental barbarian who has insinuated himself cleverly into European society, and now exploits it parasitically.\" This point is emphasized throughout the film, starting from the very opening lines of the film's commentary:\nThe \"civilized\" Jews that we know in Germany give us only an incomplete picture of their racial character. This film shows genuine shots of the Polish ghettos. It shows the Jews as they really are, before they conceal themselves behind the mask of the civilized European.\nFollowing this commentary, the film provides a succession of scenes in which Jews are portrayed as an uncivilized, parasitic people with low social standing. The images were mostly shot on site in the Warsaw Ghetto and other Polish ghettos, showing subjects who were deliberately chosen to be poorly dressed, dirty and who had partially toothless grins. The locations shown are dirty and infested by vermin. Robert Reimer asserts that a central theme of the film is the assertion that \"Jews have always lived in the ghettos and in fact they \"choose\" to live this way.\" According to Reimer, the film asserts that ghettos are \"ordinary [and] normal\" aspects of Jewish life. Reimer charges that what the film is actually showing is not the normal life of Polish Jewry but rather the \"effect of the Nazi administration and the disruption of the lives of millions of Polish Jews.\" Erik Barnouw describes the Warsaw Ghetto after the Nazi conquest as a place where \"hundreds of thousands of Jews were herded by the Nazi conquerors into pockets of indescribable misery.\" He describes footage shot there as showing \"half-starved, unshaven creatures caught in pathetic acts of barter - a pair of socks for a scrap of food.\" It is scenes such as these that the film presents as showing Jews \"in their natural state.\"\n\nThe film utilizes a montage that juxtaposes these images of ghetto Jews with images of rats to draw an analogy between the migration of Jews from Eastern Europe with the migration of rats. For example, one of the shots shows a pack of rats emerging from a sewer, followed by a shot of a crowd of Jews in a bustling street of the Łódź Ghetto. Close-ups of those in the crowd reveal sickly, malformed facial features. The narrator states that, as rats are the vermin of the animal kingdom, Jews are the vermin of the human race and similarly spread disease and corruption. Unlike rats, however, the narrator continues, Jews have the uncanny ability to change their appearance and blend into their \"human hosts.\" A scene depicts four bearded men in traditional religious Jewish clothing, then shows them shaved and in modern business suits, while the narrator explains that only a \"trained eye\" can distinguish their Jewish features.\n\"Where rats appear, they bring ruin by destroying mankind's goods and foodstuffs. In this way, they spread disease, plague, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and so on. They are cunning, cowardly and cruel and are found mostly in large packs. Among the animals, they represent the rudiment of an insidious, underground destruction – just like the Jews among human beings.\"\nThe film also claims that:\n\n[Jewish people] need other people because they need the goods with which to carry on business. The things that are valued by the creative \"Aryan\" peoples have been reduced by the Jew to the level of a mere piece of merchandise, which he buys and sells but cannot produce himself. He leaves production to the labourers and peasants of the people upon whom he has imposed his presence. The Jews are a race without farmers and without manual labourers, a race of parasites.\n\nAccording to \"Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany\":\nBy showing the way in which Jews allegedly insinuate themselves from small-scale to large-scale operations by preying on others, the film returns to its original image of the Jew concealing himself 'behind the mask of the civilised European'. [...] According to the film, the Jew presents an insidious, because concealed, threat, and one that is growing and must be brought under control. The message of this part of the commentary is that Jews will always be Jews, and that the 'civilised European' Jew is only a guise for a new and more dangerous forms of parasitic exploitation.\n\nThe film also claims that the Jewish people ... \n...change their outward appearances when they leave their Polish nests and go out into the rich world. [...] When he appears without them, then it is only the keen-eyed amongst us who recognise his racial origins. [...] It is true that their fathers and grandfathers still lived in ghettoes, but there is no trace left now in their external appearance. Here in the second and third generation, the Aryanisation has reached its zenith. [...] And people lacking in intuition allow themselves to be deceived by this mimicry and regard them as being in truth their equals. Therein lies the dreadful danger, for even these 'civilised' Jews remain foreign bodies in the organism of their hosts, no matter how much their outward appearance may correspond to that of their hosts.\n\nThe film claims:\n\"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews sit at the junction of the world financial markets. They are an international power. Only one percent of the world's population, with the help of their capital they terrorize the world stock exchanges, world opinion, and world politics.\"\nThe movie blamed Jews for inflation and unemployment in Germany. It charged that they had crept into all professions through usury, racketeering and crimes against German assets.\n\"Out of a thousand workers in Berlin, only two were Jews. For the start of 1933, out of one hundred prosecutors in Berlin 15 were Jews. Out of a hundred judges were 23 Jews. Out of a hundred lawyers 49 Jews. 52 Jews out of a hundred doctors. And out of every hundred of businessmen 60 Jews. The average wealth of Germans was 810 marks each. The average wealth of each Jew amounted to 10,000 marks.\"\nThe evidence for these assertions is unstated in the film. The occupational information is found in Germany's June 1933 census, which proves the claims made in the movie to be greatly exaggerated.\n\nIn 1933, 5,600 Jewish doctors and 3,030 Jewish lawyers were practicing in Germany, corresponding to 11 percent of doctors and 16 percent of lawyers. Still, an exceptionally large number of successful lawsuits over equal citizenship and rights had been filed in the Weimar Republic, most of them by Jewish lawyers. The Nuremberg Laws specifically forbade German judges from citing any precedents by Jewish jurists and cut off Jewish doctors from reimbursement under public health care insurance.\n\nIn contrast, during the economic crisis between the end of World War I and the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were disproportionately likely to be laid off from the labor market, to the point that 1 out of every 4 Jews had been laid off by 1935. The original set of layoffs also had the effect of concentrating Jewish employment during this period into the professional and self-employed sectors, while post-1933 delicensing and other Nuremberg legislation gradually pushed Jews completely out of professional occupations and into positions such as street peddlers.\n\nThe reference to average wealth probably used the wealth of the Jewish Rothschild family as the basis for its calculation. The Rothschild banking family is still believed to have had the largest private fortune in the world during the 19th century, as well as the largest fortune in modern world history. Although the Creditanstalt debts were assumed in part by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, its bankruptcy was later used by Hitler as an example of how the Jews were responsible for all the economic and social troubles of Germany and the world.\n\nThe movie goes on to assert that: \"The most common expressions in the jargon of international gangsters and criminals stem from Hebrew and Yiddish words.\" According to the movie, Jews are likewise disproportionately plentiful in organized crime, where they represent 82% of international crime organizations, and 98% of international prostitution. This Jewish influence is seen as well in the international language used by criminals (see also \"Rotwelsch\"). The evidence for these blatant assertions is nowhere produced. Insofar as \"organized crime\" represents lawbreaking other than that forced by the Nuremberg Laws, it has not been corroborated by subsequent research.\n\nThe film also claims that the Jewish people have some kind of \"genetic predisposition towards barter and haggling\", saying that \"[Jewish people] rush into trade\" because it is fitting \"with their character and inclination\", and that \"For the Jew, there is but one object of value – money. How he earns it is a matter of complete indifference to him.\" It also accuses Jews of passing corruption on to their children by religious means, saying that:\n\nThese children see no ideals before them like our own. The egoism of the individual is not used in the service of higher common goals. On the contrary, Jewish racial morality claims, in contrast to \"Aryan\" morality, that the unrestrained egoism of each Jew is a divine law. His religion makes a duty out of treachery and usury.\n\nIn a long sequence of images, the film provides examples to illustrate its claims that Aryan/European culture had been corrupted by Jews.\nThis sequence includes footage of notable figures who had earned Adolf Hitler's wrath, such as physicist and Nobel laureate Albert Einstein and Spartacist uprising leader Rosa Luxemburg (erroneously named as one and the same person as anarchist Emma Goldman) as representatives of so-called \"international Jewry\". Einstein's image was juxtaposed with a series of images about the supposed Jewish control of the pornography industry. Einstein was characterized as \"the relativity Jew, who masks his hatred of Germany behind his obscure pseudo-sciences\".\nOther film clips presented Jewish (or supposedly Jewish) actors from the Weimar era such as Curt Bois, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Ernst Lubitsch. Charlie Chaplin was also included in this sequence and inaccurately identified as Jewish, possibly as a consequence of his role as the Jewish barber in \"The Great Dictator\".\n\nThe film includes two scenes from the Hollywood film \"The House of Rothschild\" (1934). The first clip shows Mayer Rothschild, a rich man, hiding money and putting on old, shabby clothes in order to fool a corrupt tax collector. And the second shows him speaking to his sons, encouraging them to start an international banking business to take advantage of nations' misfortunes in times of war. The clips were used without permission.\n\nThe film's narrator asserts that: \"the Jew is instinctively interested in everything abnormal and depraved.\" To illustrate this point, Hippler included a scene from Fritz Lang's film \"M\" in which the child murderer Beckert (played by Peter Lorre) makes an impassioned plea to the \"jury\" of criminals, begging for his life and disclaiming responsibility for his crimes on account of insanity. Beckert shrieks, \"... it burns within me. I must go the way I am driven. Who knows what is going on inside me? How I must - not want, must!\" According to Sharon Packer, Hitler used this scene to assert that \"Jews transmit inheritable criminality and therefore deserve to die.\"\n\nThe film proceeds to suggest that pictorial art and music have degenerated under Jewish influence, with many spurious examples given. Degenerate art included works of abstract art as well as those from specific individuals such as George Grosz and Emil Nolde, while degenerate music included jazz and so-called \"Negermusik\", although here the connection to Jewry is absent.\n\nAfter showing how Jews have supposedly been responsible for the decline of Western music, science, art, and commerce, the film presents a scene of a cow being slaughtered for meat by a \"shochet\" (Jewish ritual slaughterer). The scene is prefaced by a warning similar to the one in \"Frankenstein\", warning the squeamish about what is coming next. This long sequence, lasting several minutes, shows cows and sheep in their death throes as they bleed to death. The producers apparently filmed this scene because of Hitler's opposition to cruelty to animals. He had banned kosher slaughter of animals in Germany and felt that such footage would shock the German public.\n\nThis scene was cut from the version intended for young audiences.\n\nThe film concludes with footage of Hitler's speech in the Reichstag in which he proclaims:\n\n\"If international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, the result will not be Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!\"\nThe film ends with images of SA troops on parade.\n\nIn and of itself, the movie did not have much impact on the German public. The film suffered from being released after \"Jud Süß\", which had been wildly popular, perhaps because the antisemitic message was secondary to an engaging period drama. The actors in \"Jud Süß\" were leading German actors of the time. In contrast, \"Der ewige Jude\" only original footage was of Jews in the Polish ghetto and animated maps. All the other footage consisted of stills and archive film clips.\n\nThus, unlike \"Jud Süß\", which was a box-office smash success, \"Der ewige Jude\" was a commercial flop. David Culbert asserts that it is unlikely that there were more than one million paid admissions compared to over 20 million paid admissions to \"Jud Süß\". The film was more known by word-of-mouth descriptions than from people actually viewing it. Some Germans were quoted as saying \"We've already seen enough Jewish filth. We don't need to see any more.\"\n\nThe film was chiefly screened by party supporters and Nazi organizations like the Hitler Youth and the SS. Its themes and content made it a topic of discussion by a wider audience that never saw it. Himmler invited to screen it SS troops headed for the Eastern Front to carry out the \"Final Solution\".\nIn 1946, Fritz Hippler was tried for directing \"Der ewige Jude\" but was not found guilty. Hippler contended Joseph Goebbels was the true creator of \"The Eternal Jew\" with Hitler's close supervision. He claimed that Goebbels gave Hippler credit as a reward \"for his excellent work in the newsreel department\".\n\nFranz Hippler was interviewed in the Emmy Award-winning program \"The Propaganda Battle\" in the PBS series \"Walk Through the Twentieth Century\" (1983–1984). In this interview he stated that he regretted being listed as the director of \"The Eternal Jew\" because it resulted in being interrogated by the Allies after the war. He thought this was unfair because, in his opinion, he had nothing to do with the killing of Jews. In an interview shown in the German documentary series \"Holocaust\" (2000), the 90-year-old Hippler described the film as \"the most disgraceful example of antisemitism.\" The film's narrator, Harry Giese, went on to narrate other films, but he was associated with this film and other films by the Third Reich and he found less work in the Postwar German cinema of the 1950s and 60s.\n\nThe public distribution and exhibition of the film is prohibited in Germany. The only exception is for use in college classrooms and other academic purposes; however, exhibitors must have formal education in \"media science and the history of the Holocaust\", and it can only be screened in a censored version with annotations.\n\nThe full version can be viewed on YouTube, either with English subtitles or dubbed into English.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The concept album serves as the companion soundtrack to Sixx's autobiography, \"\", and is about Sixx's severe heroin addiction in 1987. The first single, \",\" debuted at #26 on the Billboard charts.\n\nDesigned to be an accompaniment to \"\", the autobiography of Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx co-written by Sixx and Ian Gittens that details his severe heroin addiction in 1987, \"The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack\" is a concept album that captures Sixx's basic story of his life during that time, although the album can stand alone. The story begins with the reasons for Sixx starting his diary, followed by his first (albeit temporary) abstinence from heroin, his relapse and mental and physical decline, his near-fatal overdose and out-of-body experience, and finally, his emotional recovery, which eventually led to long-term sobriety. The 13 tracks on the album each correspond to one month of his diary, which he kept from December 1986 to December 1987. Some of the tracks feature spoken word featuring Sixx himself reading some lines from the book.\n\n\"\", the first single off the album, was originally posted on Sixx's MySpace page; after \"[picking] up momentum,\" it debuted at #26 on the Billboard rock singles chart.

Jim Kaz of IGN, praising the emotional lyrics of the album, called it \"not really an album but rather a musical book. It is almost impossible to recommend any specific songs over others.\"\n"}

The four original paintings – The Briar Wood, The Council Chamber, The Garden Court and The Rose Bower – and an additional ten adjoining panels, are located at Buscot Park in Oxfordshire, England.\n\nThe four major panels were first exhibited at Agnew's Gallery in Bond Street, London in 1890. They were acquired by Alexander Henderson, later to become the Lord Faringdon, for Buscot Park. When Burne-Jones visited the house and saw the paintings in their new setting he decided to extend the frames of each of the four paintings and fill in the gaps with joining panels which continued the rose motif from the main paintings.\n\nEach major panel measures 49 by 98¼ inches but the ten joining panels vary in width. The paintings do not tell a sequential story but record the same moment in each location.\n\nThe painting depicts the discovery of the sleeping soldiers by a Knight. In their slumber they have become completed entwined by the barbed thorns of the Briar rose.\n\nRunning beneath each of the major panels is an inscription of a poem by William Morris, under \"The Briar Wood\" the inscription reads:\n\n\"The fateful slumber floats and flows<br>\nAbout the tangle of the rose;<br>\nBut lo! the fated hand and heart<br>\nTo rend the slumberous curse apart!\" \n\nThe painting shows the scene in the Council chamber. The members of the council sleep, as does the King who is slumped on his throne. Under the draped curtains and through the window further soldiers can be seen sleeping.\n\nUnder \"The Council Chamber\", the inscription reads:\n\n\"The threat of war, the hope of peace,<br>\nThe Kingdoms peril and increase<br>\nSleep on, and bide the latter day<br>\nWhen Fate shall take her chain away.\" \n\nThe painting shows the weavers having fallen asleep at their loom. The walls of the castle form the backdrop to the painting as do arches of roses. \n\nUnder \"The Garden Court\", the inscription reads:\n\n\"The maiden pleasance of the land<br>\nKnoweth no stir of voice or hand,<br>\nNo cup the sleeping waters fill,<br>\nThe restless shuttle lieth still.\" \n\nThe sleeping beauty lies on her bed surrounded by her slumbering attendants. The rose is seen encircling the drapery in the background\n\nUnder \"The Rose Bower\", the inscription reads:\n\nHere lies the hoarded love, the key<br>\nTo all the treasure that shall be;<br>\nCome fated hand the gift to take<br>\nAnd smite this sleeping world awake.\" \nThe paintings depict a moment in the story of \"Sleeping Beauty\", the title of the series coming from the version presented by the Brothers Grimm in their collection of 1812.\n\nBurne-Jones created two other series of paintings on the same subject. \n\n"}

It is the second book by Adams featuring private detective Dirk Gently, the first being \"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\". The title is a phrase that appeared in Adams' novel \"Life, the Universe and Everything\" to describe the wretched boredom of immortal being Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged, and is a play on the theological treatise \"Dark Night of the Soul\", by Saint John of the Cross.\n\nThe novel is named for that time on a Sunday, after afternoon but before evening, as the week-end had finished but the week had not yet begun, that occurred to Adams as a listless limbo of the working man:\nDirk Gently, who calls himself a \"holistic detective\", has happened upon what he thinks is a rather comfortable situation. A wealthy man in the record industry has retained him, spinning a story about being stalked by a seven-foot-tall, green-eyed, scythe-wielding monster. Dirk pretends to understand the man's ravings involving potatoes and a contract signed in blood coming due; when in reality, Dirk is musing about what he might do if he actually receives payment for his \"services\" – such as getting rid of his refrigerator, which is so filthy inside that it has become the centrepiece of a show-down between himself and his cleaning woman. The seriousness of his client's claims becomes clear when Dirk arrives several hours late for an appointment to find a swarm of police around his client's estate. The aforementioned client is found in a sealed and heavily barricaded room, his head neatly removed several feet from his body and rotating on a turn-table. While at his recently deceased client's house, he discovers that his client had a son. However, after Dirk disconnects the television set the boy had been watching, the boy promptly breaks Dirk's nose.\n\nNearly incapacitated by guilt, Dirk resolves to take his now-late client's wild claims seriously. During his investigation, Gently encounters exploding airport check-in counters, the gods of Norse mythology, insulting horoscopes, a sinister nursing home, a rhino-phagic eagle, an I Ching calculator (to which everything calculated above the value of 4 is apparently 'a suffusion of yellow'), a god who gives his powers to a lawyer and an advertising executive in exchange for clean linen, and an attractive American woman who gets angry when she can't get pizza delivered in London.\n\nA BBC radio adaptation, \"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\", starring Harry Enfield, Peter Davison, John Fortune and Stephen Moore was broadcast on October 2008.\n\n\"Dirk Gently\" (2010, 2012) starred Stephen Mangan in the title role in a pilot broadcast on BBC 4 in 2010 and a three episode series broadcast in 2012.\n"}

{"id": "1393859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1393859", "title": "Travel literature", "text": "Travel literature\n\nThe genre of travel literature encompasses outdoor literature, guide books, nature writing, and travel memoirs.\n\nOne early travel memoirist in Western literature was Pausanias, a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD. In the early modern period, James Boswell's \"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" (1786) helped shape travel memoir as a genre.\n\nEarly examples of travel literature include Pausanias' \"Description of Greece\" in the 2nd century CE, the \"Journey Through Wales\" (1191) and \"Description of Wales\" (1194) by Gerald of Wales, and the travel journals of Ibn Jubayr (1145–1214) and Ibn Battuta (1304–1377), both of whom recorded their travels across the known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval Arabic literature.\n\nTravel literature became popular during the Song dynasty (960–1279) of medieval China. The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in narrative, prose, essay and diary style. Travel literature authors such as Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Xu Xiake (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' \"Record of Stone Bell Mountain\" by the noted poet and statesman Su Shi (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.\n\nOne of the earliest known records of taking pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it, is Petrarch's (1304–1374) ascent of Mount Ventoux in 1336. He states that he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height. His companions who stayed at the bottom he called \"frigida incuriositas\" (\"a cold lack of curiosity\"). He then wrote about his climb, making allegorical comparisons between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.\n\nMichault Taillevent, a poet for the Duke of Burgundy, travelled through the Jura Mountains in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams. Antoine de la Sale (c. 1388–c. 1462), author of \"Petit Jehan de Saintre\", climbed to the crater of a volcano in the Lipari Islands in 1407, leaving us with his impressions. \"Councils of mad youth\" were his stated reasons for going. In the mid-15th century, Gilles le Bouvier, in his \"Livre de la description des pays\", gave us his reason to travel and write:\n\nIn 1589, Richard Hakluyt (c. 1552–1616) published \"Voyages\", a foundational text of the travel literature genre.\n\nIn the 18th Century, travel literature was commonly known as the book of travels, which mainly consisted of maritime diaries. In 18th century Britain, almost every famous writer worked in the travel literature form. Captain James Cook's diaries (1784) were the equivalent of today's best sellers Alexander von Humboldt's \"Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804\", originally published in French, was translated to multiple languages and influenced later naturalists, including Charles Darwin.\n\nOther later examples of travel literature include accounts of the Grand Tour. Aristocrats, clergy, and others with money and leisure time travelled Europe to learn about the art and architecture of its past. One tourism literature pioneer was Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894), with \"An Inland Voyage\" (1878), and \"Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes\" (1879) about his travels in the Cévennes, (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first sleeping bags.\n\nTravel books come in styles ranging from the documentary, to the literary, as well as the journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with tourism and include guide books. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals, and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen Eric Newby, H. V. Morton, the Americans Bill Bryson and Paul Theroux, and Welsh author Jan Morris are or were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel \"per se\"). Bill Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild. On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the Main Library the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11). Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel \"The Mosquito Coast\", which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award for \"Riding the Iron Rooster\". In 2005, Jan Morris was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for \"a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature\".\n\nTravel literature often intersects with essay writing, as in V. S. Naipaul's \"\" (1976), whose trip became the occasion for extended observations on a nation and people. This is similarly the case in Rebecca West's work on Yugoslavia, \"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\" (1941).\n\nSometimes a writer will settle into a locality for an extended period, absorbing a sense of place while continuing to observe with a travel writer's sensibility. Examples of such writings include Lawrence Durrell's \"Bitter Lemons\" (1957), Deborah Tall's \"The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an Irish Island\" (1986), and Peter Mayle's best-selling \"A Year in Provence\" (1989) and its sequels.\n\nTravel and nature writing merge in many of the works by Sally Carrighar, Gerald Durrell and Ivan T. Sanderson. Sally Carrighar's works include \"One Day at Teton Marsh\" (1965), \"Home to the Wilderness\" (1973), and \"Wild Heritage\" (1965). Gerald Durrell's \"My Family and Other Animals\" (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of Corfu between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's \"Corfu trilogy\", together with \"Birds, Beasts, and Relatives\" and \"The Garden of the Gods\" (1978). Ivan T. Sanderson published \"Animal Treasure\", a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa; \"Caribbean Treasure\", an account of an expedition to Trinidad, Haiti, and Surinam, begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and \"Living Treasure\", an account of an expedition to Jamaica, British Honduras (now Belize) and the Yucatán. These authors are naturalists, who write in support of their fields of study. Another naturalist, Charles Darwin, wrote his famous account of the journey of HMS \"Beagle\" at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.\n\nA number of writers famous in other fields have written about their travel experiences. Examples are Samuel Johnson's \"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland\" (1775); Charles Dickens' \"American Notes for General Circulation\" (1842); Mary Wollstonecraft's \"Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark\" (1796); Hilaire Belloc's \"The Path To Rome\" (1902); D. H. Lawrence's \"Twilight in Italy and Other Essays\" (1916); \"Mornings in Mexico and Other Essays\" (1927); Rebecca West's \"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\" (1941); and John Steinbeck's \"\" (1962).\n\nIn the world of sailing Joshua Slocum's \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" (1900) is a classic of outdoor adventure literature. In April 1895, Joshua Slocum set sail from Boston, Massachusetts and in \"Sailing Alone Around the World\", he described his departure in the following manner:\n\nMore than three years later, on June 27, 1898, Slocum returned to Newport, Rhode Island, having circumnavigated the world.\n\nA guide book or travel guide is \"a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists\". An early example is Thomas West's guide to the Lake District, published in 1778. Thomas West, an English priest, popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the Lake District of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations. To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities. Published in 1778 the book was a major success.\nIt will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of travel websites.\n\nA travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of Pausanias (2nd century AD) who produced his \"Description of Greece\" based on his own observations. James Boswell published his \"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" in 1786 and Goethe published his \"Italian Journey\", based on diaries, in 1816. Fannie Calderón de la Barca, the Scottish-born wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico 1839–1842, wrote \"Life in Mexico\", an important travel narrative of her time there, with many observations of local life. A British traveller, Mrs Alec Tweedie, published a number of travelogues, ranging from Denmark (1895) and Finland (1897), to the U.S. (1913), several on Mexico (1901, 1906, 1917), and one on Russia, Siberia, and China (1926). A more recent example is Che Guevara's \"The Motorcycle Diaries\". A travelogue is a film, book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller. American writer Paul Theroux has published many works of travel literature, the first success being \"The Great Railway Bazaar\". Anglo-American Bill Bryson is known for \"A Walk in the Woods\", made into a Hollywood film of the same name.\n\nSome fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish fictional from non-fictional works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of Marco Polo or John Mandeville. Examples of fictional works of travel literature based on actual journeys are: \n\nIn the 21st century, travel literature became a genre of social media in the form of travel blogs, with travel bloggers using outlets like personal blogs, Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally. Travel blogs were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.. In 2018 the most popular self hosted blogging platform is WordPress, due to its ease of use.\n\nThe systematic study of travel literature emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry in the mid-1990s, with its own conferences, organizations, journals, monographs, anthologies, and encyclopedias. Important, pre-1995 monographs are: \"Abroad\" (1980) by Paul Fussell, an exploration of British interwar travel writing as escapism; \"Gone Primitive: Modern Intellects, Savage Minds\" (1990) by Marianna Torgovnick, an inquiry into the primitivist presentations of foreign cultures; \"Haunted Journeys: Desire and Transgression in European Travel Writing\" (1991) by Dennis Porter, a close look at the psychological correlatives of travel; \"Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing\" by Sara Mills, an inquiry into the intersection of gender and colonialism during the 19th century; \"Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation\" (1992), Mary Louise Pratt's influential study of Victorian travel writing's dissemination of a colonial mind-set; and \"Belated Travelers\" (1994), an analysis of colonial anxiety by Ali Behdad.\n\nDisrupting the assumptions of traditional travel writing, Amitav Ghosh's \"In an Antique Land\" may be regarded as an example of \"counter travel narrative\", reversing the \"roles of traveller and local, viewing the present as contextualized by the colonial and precolonial past, and eschewing definitive authorial authority [in] a powerful rebuttal to the ideology of the traditional travel text.\"\n\nPrizes awarded annually for travel books have included the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award, which ran from 1980 to 2004, the Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature, and the Dolman Best Travel Book Award, which began in 2006. The North American Travel Journalists Association holds an annual awards competition honoring travel journalism in a multitude of categories, ranging across print and online media.\n\n\n\n\n"}
