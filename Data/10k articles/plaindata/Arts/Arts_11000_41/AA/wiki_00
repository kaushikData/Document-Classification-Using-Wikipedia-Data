But when the festival's negotiations fell through, Billy Klüver and the whole group moved the event to the 69th Regiment Armory and called it \"9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering.\" The participants consisted of 10 artists and some 30 engineers to create a blend of avant-garde theatre, dance and new technologies.\n\n9 Evenings was the first large-scale collaboration between artists and engineers and scientists. The two groups worked together for 10 months to develop technical equipment and systems that were used as an integral part of the artists’ performances. Their collaboration produced many \"firsts\" in the use of new technology for the theater, both with specially-designed systems and equipment and with innovative use of existing equipment. Closed-circuit television and television projection was used on stage for the first time; a fiber-optics camera picked up objects in a performer's pocket; an infrared television camera captured action in total darkness; a Doppler sonar device translated movement into sound; and portable wireless FM transmitters and amplifiers transmitted speech and body sounds to Armory loudspeakers.\n\nArtists involved with 9 Evenings include: John Cage, Lucinda Childs, Öyvind Fahlström, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, David Tudor, and Robert Whitman.\n\nNotable engineers involved include: Bela Julesz, Billy Klüver, Max Mathews, John Pierce, Manfred Schroeder, and Fred Waldhauer.\n\nThe 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering DVD Series (director: Barbro Schultz Lundestam) is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies.\nThe Swedish journalist and movie/documentary director Barbro Schultz Lundestam visited Billy Klüver and his wife, Julie Martin, in New Jersey in 1993. The couple showed her their archives of the \"E.A.T. projects\", including manuscripts, photographs and 16mm film recordings on \"9 Evenings\". (Julie Martin and Billy Klüver had met during rehearsals for \"9 Evenings\", since she was an assistant to Robert Whitman for his performance.)

{"id": "16175151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16175151", "title": "Bathers at Asnières", "text": "Bathers at Asnières\n\nBathers at Asnières () is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Georges Pierre Seurat, the first of his two masterpieces on the monumental scale. The canvas is of a suburban, placid Parisian riverside scene. Isolated figures, with their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with trees, austere boundary walls and buildings, and the River Seine are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness.\n\nSeurat completed the painting of \"Bathers at Asnières\" in 1884, when he was twenty-four years old. He applied to the jury of the Salon of the same year to have the work exhibited there, but the jury rejected it. The \"Bathers\" continued to puzzle many of Seurat’s contemporaries, and the picture was not widely acclaimed until many years after the death of the artist at the age of just thirty-one. An appreciation of the painting’s merits grew during the twentieth century, and today it hangs in the National Gallery, London, where it is considered one of the highlights of the gallery’s collection of paintings.\n\nThe spot depicted is just short of four miles from the centre of Paris. It is in fact the case that the figures on the river-bank are not in the commune of Asnières, but are rather in Courbevoie, the commune bordering Asnières to the west. The bathers themselves are in the River Seine. The slope forming most of the left hand side of the painting was known as the \"Côte des Ajoux\", near the end of the \"rue des Ajoux\", on the north bank of the river. Opposite is the island of la Grande Jatte, the east tip of which is shown as the slope and the trees to the right, and which Seurat has pictorially extended beyond its actual length. The Asnières railway bridge, and the industrial buildings of Clichy are in the background. Locations such as this one were sometimes shown on French nineteenth century maps as \"Baignade\" (or, ‘bathing area’).\n\nMany artists painted canvases from this stretch of the Seine during the 1880s. As well as the \"Bathers\", some of Seurat’s better known works to come from the vicinity include his \"The Seine at Courbevoie\", \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\", and \"The Bridge at Courbevoie\".\n\nSeurat uses a variety of means to suggest the baking heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens the edges of the trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and factories in the background—the blue of the sky at the horizon is paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of \"Bathers at Asnières\" subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.\n\nThe isolated figures are given statuesque but largely unmodeled treatment, and their skin and their clothes are clean, with a waxy finish. They appear unselfconscious, at ease in their environment, and—with the possible exception of the boy to the bottom right—are locked in a pensive and solitary reverie. Horizontal and vertical lines at the middle and far distance contrast with arched backs and the relaxed postures of the figures toward the front. These postures, angles of heads, directions of gaze, and positions of limbs are repeated among the figures, giving the group a rhythmic unity. Distinctively coloured forms in close proximity, such as the grouping of horse-chestnut colours of the clothes on the bank, and the grouping of oranges of the boys in the water, add to the stability of the work—an effect reinforced in the cluster of shadows to the left on the bank, and the un-verisimilar play of light around the bathing figures.\n\nSeurat described one of the brush-stroke techniques he developed on this canvas as the \"balayé\" technique, wherein a flat brush is used to apply matte colours using strokes in a criss-crossing formation. These strokes become smaller as they approach the horizon. The \"balayé\" technique is not rolled out in a consistent manner across the painting, but is adapted where Seurat thought it appropriate. The foreground—for example—consists of a \"balayé\" network of strokes atop a more solid layer of underpaint, suggesting the flickering play of sunlight over the blades of grass. This chunky, cross-hatched brushstroke pattern is in contrast with the nearly horizontal, much thinner strokes that are used to depict the water, and is in even greater contrast with the smoothly rendered skin of the figures.\n\nAt the time of this painting, urban development in Paris was proceeding at a very rapid pace. The population of Paris had doubled from one million in 1850 to two million in 1877, and the population of Asnières had almost doubled in just ten years to reach 14,778 in 1886. The reality of the often unpleasant or dangerous conditions in which industrial workers laboured had already been fully taken on by painters, such as in—for instance—Monet’s painting of 1875, \"Men unloading coal\", which in fact shows the bridges at Asnières as they were almost a decade before Seurat painted them. \nSeurat however, elected not to make the real or imagined plight of the suburban workers his concern, instead portraying the labouring class and petit-bourgeoisie of Asnières and Courbevoie with dignity, and in a scene of lazy leisure. It was in the late nineteenth century a break with practice to use painting on this scale in this way, but \"Bathers at Asnières\" carries this unusual message with no note of incivility or incongruity.\n\nNot only did Seurat decline to make absolutely clear the social status of the major figures in \"Bathers\", but neither did he show them performing a public role of any kind. Their faces are for the most part shown in profile, and not one of them faces in the direction of the viewer. The anonymity and ambiguity with which these figures are painted was never again to feature so prominently in any major painting from Seurat.\n\nThe industrial infrastructure of bridges and factories to the rear is a notable feature of the composition. In spite of the unglamarous function and appearance of these recent additions to suburban Paris, they are painted as subtly variagated and somewhat classicised masses—veiled by the heat haze, and surrounded by trees at each side. Their appearance is punctuated by sails of sailing-boats and the strikingly coloured head of the central figure. These factories and trains were noisy and smelly, but Seurat does not permit this to dominate the painting; for all that the chimneys belch, they seem powerless to disrupt the settled scene.\n\nIn 1878 and 1879—only a few years prior to painting the \"Bathers\"—Seurat had been a student at the École des Beaux-Arts. The \"École\" instructed its students that before work began on any large scale painting, there must first be extensive efforts with preparatory paintings and drawings. It seems possible that Seurat completed his first small oil study in this preparatory phase for the painting of the \"Bathers\" as early as 1882. \n\nCésar de Hauke’s \"catalogue raisonné\" of the works of Seurat lists fourteen works as oil studies for the \"Bathers\", most if not all of which were almost certainly painted outdoors, and in which the composition of the final piece may be seen gradually taking shape. The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most obviously in respect of its size; it is just 25 cm long and 16 cm high. Seurat was fond of these small studies, calling them his \"croquetons\" (a nonce word best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on the walls of his studio.\n\nWhereas for the most part Seurat used these oil studies to work through his compositional problems, nine extant drawings in conté crayon show him focusing individually on each of the five main figures in the painting. The drawings show Seurat working out ways of deploying light and shade for the purpose of implying space and plasticity. Many of the details the painter worked on in these monochrome drawings were to find their final realisation when translated into the colours of the finished oil painting.\n\nThese arduous methods of preparation were in keeping with the general values espoused at the \"École\". But one professor from that institution was to have a more particular and wide ranging impact on Seurat’s imagination, which bore directly discernable effects in the \"Bathers\". Charles Blanc had been a professor and director at the \"École\" and had arranged for copies of Quattrocento fresco paintings from Arezzo to be displayed in the \"École\" chapel. The huge, stately and dignified figures in these frescos, and the regularity of their spacing has obvious echoes in the \"Bathers\". Among these fresco painters was Piero della Francesca, whose \"Resurrection\" depicts a sleeping guard at the bottom-left sharing a number of features with the seated man in \"Bathers at Asnières\". The curvature of slumping back and bent legs is clearly matched in both figures, and indeed the posture also appears in the \"Young Male Nude Seated beside the Sea\" of Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, a painting with which any student at the \"École\" would have been familiar. The sculpted contours of Piero’s soldier’s cape find an echo in the rugged contours of the trousers in Seurat’s painting, and the flick at the back of the guard’s hat becomes a rhythmic motif showing up with hats, hair and bootstraps alike in \"Bathers\".\n\nFurther, Blanc had written a book in 1867, which Seurat read the year he began his studies at the \"École\", and which was to strongly influence him during his formative years—the \"Grammaire des arts du dessin\". Near the beginning of this book, Blanc had claimed that Nicolas Poussin’s \"The Finding of Moses\" was an exemplary case of how art should idealise nature, concluding his passage, ‘This is how a scene from everyday life suddenly becomes raised to the dignity of a history painting.’ This remark seems pertinent to the Bathers, which certainly shares a number of compositional elements with Poussin’s masterpiece of 1638. Both works show to the right a lowered male figure, and to the left a reclining male figure painted from behind. The horizon in both paintings is punctured just off-centre with a head, and in both paintings the river is spanned with a distant bridge, with block-like buildings on the left bank and trees on the other. And both pictures have a flat-bottomed boat at the centre-right.\n\nThe influence of Seurat’s French contemporary Pierre Puvis de Chavannes—and in particular of his \"Doux Pays\" shown at the Salon of 1882—is also evident in the \"Bathers\". Both paintings are on the monumental scale—that of Puvis’ being over four metres long—and both works have life-size figures. The theme of the architectonic group of figures to the left in \"Doux Pays\" is echoed by Seurat; where Puvis shows a half-pedimental group in one plane, Seurat uses recession, and suggests association by means of repetition. The two paintings also share the technique of dividing their large canvases into areas of predominant colours—of blue and gold in \"Doux Pays\", to rather cool effect, and of blue and green in the \"Bathers\" with a warmer result. In both paintings a prominent figure breaks into the horizon just off-centre, a curved sail appears in almost the same spot to the right, and triangular poses are observed, as are boys in varying degrees of restivity. William I. Homer, in addressing the light hues and matte surface of the \"Bathers\", remarked that its, “pale and somewhat chalky tonality… recalls the earlier decorations of [Puvis].”\n\nAlthough a receptive and conscientious student at the revered \"École\", Seurat had been open to ideas from some more esoteric sources too. In 1879, with his friend, fellow \"École\" student, and future portrait-subject Edmond Aman-Jean, Seurat attended the fourth exhibition of paintings from the then very unrevered Impressionist painters, where they duly received an “unexpected and profound shock”. And although Seurat had already seen modern aesthetic theories summarised in Blanc’s Grammaire, he sought out the original texts from the theoreticians themselves, such those of David Sutter, the chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, and the physicist Ogden Rood, whose \"Modern Chromatics\" was written while Seurat was at the \"École\", and which the artist read as soon as it was translated into French in 1881. Having immersed himself in these authors’ works, Seurat borrowed heavily from their modern theories about colours and the way humans perceive them. These influences allowed Seurat to emerge from the venerable disciplines of the \"École\" to fashion his own distinctly modern method of using tone and colour.\n\nOne of the recurrent themes of these painstakingly detailed new theories was the idea that humans may not perceive colours in isolation but rather, that one colour may be seen to interfere with another colour neighbouring it. In this way, colour perception was explained as a complex, interpretive process, rather than a static and simple record of visual data. Seurat’s response to the theories in these writings is widely evident in the Bathers, most obviously in such areas as those of the torso and legs of the man seated centre-left on the persimmon-orange cushion, and of the central figure as his back contrasts with light blue water and his arm contrasts with water of a darker hue.\n\nIn 1882 Seurat rented a small studio in the rue Chabrol close to his family’s home. \"Bathers at Asnières\" was painted in this studio, on a canvas identical in size to that part of \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" that excludes the painted border. Following the rejection of the \"Bathers\" by the jury of the Salon of 1884, Seurat joined forces with some like-minded artists to become a founder members of the \"Groupe des Artistes Indépendants\". This institution held its first exhibition—the \"Salon de Artistes Indépendants\"—between May 15th and July 1st, 1884 at a temporary building in the place du Carrousel, adjacent to the Louvre. \"Bathers at Asnières\" is listed in the exhibition catalog as painting number 261, and it was displayed along with works from a total of 402 artists. Despite the fact that Seurat was a founder member of the \"Groupe\", his painting was displayed in the unglamorous location of the exhibition beer hall, and appears to have had no great impact on spectators at the exhibition. Later the same year, the Groupes des Artistes Indépendants went on became the Société des Artistes Indépendants, and the \"Bathers\" was also hung at the first exhibition of the newly renamed \"Société\". In 1886 Paul Durand-Ruel took the picture, along with some three hundred other canvases, to the National Academy of Design in New York, where he held his exhibition of the “Works in Oil and Pastel by the Impressionists of Paris.”\n\nThe painting received mixed reviews from critics and commentators on both sides of the Atlantic. The novelist and Biographer Paul Alexis commented equivocally, ‘This is a false Puvis de Chavannes. What funny male and female bathers! But it is painted with so much conviction that it appears almost touching and I don’t quite dare poke fun at it.’ In \"L’Intransigeant\", Edmond Bazire, writing under the pseudonym ‘Edmond Jacques’, wrote, ‘behind and under some prismatic eccentricities Seurat conceals the most distinguished qualities of draughtsmanship, and envelops his bathing men, his ripples, his horizons in warm tones.’ Both Jules Claretie and Roger Marx also described the painting as being a noteworthy ‘Impressionist’ painting. \"The Art Amateur\"’s anonymous reviewer of the New York exhibition—who even explicitly likened \"Bathers at Asnières\" to Italian fresco painting—, also called the picture a modern ‘Impressionist’ work. Paul Signac remarked that the \"Bathers\" was painted ‘… [I]n great flat strokes, brushed one over the other, fed by a palette composed, like Delacroix’s, of pure and earthy colours. By means of these ochres and browns the picture was deadened and appeared less brilliant than the works the impressionists painted with a palette limited to prismatic colours. But the understanding of the laws of contrast, the methodical separation of elements—light, shade, local colour, and the interaction of colours—as well as their proper balance and proportion gave this canvas its perfect harmony.’\n\nLess flatteringly, an anonymous reviewer of Durand-Ruel’s Impressionist Exhibition in New York City wrote in the newspaper \"The Sun\" that, “The great master, from his own point of view, must surely be Seurat whose monstrous picture of \"The Bathers\" consumes so large a part of the Gallery D. This is a picture conceived in a coarse, vulgar, and commonplace mind, the work of a man seeking distinction by the vulgar qualification and expedient of size. It is bad from every point of view, including his own.” This was by no means the only such uncomplimentary review in American and French newspapers. But with the passage of decades, the \"Bathers\" slowly emerged into critical respectability. The critic and friend of Seurat, Félix Fénéon waited many years before commenting, ‘Though I did not commit myself in writing, I then [\"in 1884\"] completely realised the importance of this painting.‘ For many years, \"Bathers at Asnières\" remained in the possession of Seurat’s family, and in 1900 the work was purchased by Felix Fénéon. In 1924 it was purchased for the British national collections and hung in the Tate Gallery. It was moved in 1961 to the National Gallery where it has remained since.\n\nX-ray imaging of the \"Bathers\" has revealed that some components of the composition were altered as Seurat’s work on the canvas progressed, while other components were probably not in the painting at all, as he first painted it. The two reclining figures—one at the front of the image, the other with the straw hat toward the rear—are revealed by the X-ray image to have been among the later concerns for Seurat. The reclining man at the front has had the position of his legs moved to a position more horizontal than that in which they were when first painted. The reclining figure toward the rear is not visible in the X-ray image at all, showing he is a late addition. His posture reflects the altered position of the man in the foreground, raising the suggestion that he was painted in as a compositional response to the alteration made to the man at the front. The skiff and the ferry boat with the tricolor, and the pointillistically applied spots at various locations in the lower mid-section of the painting, are also absent in the X-ray image. A contentious theory suggests that these elements were added by Seurat as a means of making a connection between the \"Bathers\" and \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\". In spite of their remoteness in the middle distance, the motifs and the seated figures on the boat are present in the later painting, and the ferry boat indeed traverses the river between the Courbevoie river-bank and the \"île de la Grande Jatte\" itself. The late additions in \"Bathers\" bring for the first time a note of vitality to the serene picture in keeping with the more \"sociable\" climate of \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\".\n\nSeurat's \"Bathers\" preceded \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\", which shows people on the bank of the other side of the river. While the bathers at Asnieres on the left bank are working-class people, it is the bourgeoisie who are on the right bank. The bathers are cast in light, while on the \"Grande Jatte\" almost everyone is in shadows, and there are allusions to lust (a woman with a monkey on a leash) and prostitution (a woman \"fishing\"). Seurat's message has been interpreted as implying that the working class represented the future, while the middle classes had grown decrepit and ridden with vice. Seen in this light and context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asnières appears to be calling out to them, as if to say \"we are the future, come and join us\".\n\n"}

The book details Cahalan's struggle with a rare autoimmune disease and her recovery. It was first published on November 13, 2012 through Free Press in hardback, and was later reprinted in paperback by Simon & Schuster after the two companies merged. \n\nThe book narrates Cahalan's issues with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and the process by which she was diagnosed with this form of encephalitis. She wakes up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month, during which time she would have violent episodes and delusions. Her eventual diagnosis is made more difficult by various physicians misdiagnosing her with several theories such as \"partying too much\" and schizoaffective disorder. Eventually several physicians, including Dr. Souhel Najjar, began to suspect that Cahalan was suffering from an autoimmune disease. Najjar diagnosed Cahalan using a test that involved her drawing a clock, a test normally given to people suspected of having dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the disease caused Cahalan to draw all of the numbers 1 through 12 on the right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery.\n\nThe book also covers Cahalan's life after her recovery, including her reactions to watching videotapes of her psychotic episodes while in the hospital. Cahalan also discusses her symptoms prior to her hospitalization, as she had previously been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with bipolar disorder. While researching, she learned that the disease had only been discovered three years before she became ill. Her research indicated that in 2009 most people with the disease were either misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Cahalan was fortunate to be correctly diagnosed because, according to Najjar's estimates, only 10 percent of people with the disease were properly diagnosed at that time. Since then, a better understanding of the disease and its symptoms has resulted in more frequent diagnosis and treatment.\n\nCritical reception for \"Brain on Fire\" has been mostly positive. NPR commented that the author was \"a naturally talented prose stylist\" and that \"she perfectly tempers her brutal honesty with compassion and something like vulnerability.\" The \"Washington Post\" praised Cahalan's researching abilities for the book, as they noted that she had to rely on information from others, including family members and medical documents.\n\nIn May 2014, it was announced that the book was being adapted into a film of the same name starring Chloë Grace Moretz and produced by Cahalan and Charlize Theron. The film was released on Netflix on June 22, 2018.\n"}

Portrayed by Diahann Carroll from 1984 to 1987, the character is the surprise half-sister of millionaire Blake Carrington (John Forsythe). Dominique was written out of the series at the end its seventh season, and did not return for the 1991 miniseries \"\".\n\nWith \"Dynasty\" in its fourth season, Diahann Carroll saw the success of prime time soap operas, and noted that while they had covered many issues like rape and homosexuality, they had yet to tackle racial integration. She said at the time, \"I want to be the first black bitch on television.\" Carroll had her manager reach out to \"Dynasty\" producer Aaron Spelling, but there had been no response before she and Spelling ran into each other soon after. Barbra Streisand had asked Carroll to sing a song from \"Yentl\" at the Golden Globes ceremony, and afterwards Carroll and Spelling found themselves at the same nightclub. He said, \"When Diahann came in, [\"Dynasty\" co-creator] Esther Shapiro and I looked at her, looked at each other and said, 'My God, she is \"Dynasty\".'\" Carroll told Shapiro that night, \"If it's not me let it be someone, because it's time.\" Spelling said,\"We virtually closed the deal that night while having a drink at the bar.\"\n\nJoining \"Dynasty\" made Carroll the only black actress with a continuing role on a nighttime serial at that time, and Dominique the first prominently-featured African-American character on a prime time soap opera. Carroll said, \"I certainly wasn't researching the number of blacks on TV, but how could you fail to see they're not there?\" Appearing in the final two episodes of the fourth season, Carroll's estimated salary was $35,000 an episode, and she was contracted for at least 17 of season five's 29 shows. Shapiro said, \"We wanted a part where a black could be on the same social and economic level as the other characters. The one thing we wouldn't do is put on a black woman as a victim.\" She added, \"Our intention is to play the characters in 1984 with an emphasis on character, not color.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Dominique was intended as a foil for Alexis Colby, the villainess played by Joan Collins. Shapiro said, \"Dominique is not out to outbitch Alexis per se.\" Collins said, \"I think it is wonderful to have another fabulous 'over 40' in prime time. We have had a couple of bitch-to-bitch scenes which have been very good. And of course, no one knows better than I that in playing a bitch you don't have to be one.\" Carroll commented, \"Joan and I are close enough in age and experience to realize that this is great for all of us. In the final analysis we will be good for each other.\" Willis Edwards, president of the Beverly Hills/Hollywood chapter of the NAACP, said of Carroll's casting, \"This is a major thing as far as we’re concerned. We've been fighting for something like this for years.\" Linda Evans, who played Krystle Carrington, said at the time, \"I don't think the impact of her coming on the show will affect only blacks. I think it will be great for all the people who see her.\"\n\nWhile pursuing a role on one of the nighttime soaps, Carroll said \"I want to be wealthy and ruthless\". She said in 2011 that \"Dynasty\" producer Elaine Rich \"liked the idea of [Dominique] being a bitch\", and Carroll said to her, \"I think the most important thing for us to remember is write for a white male, and you'll have it. We'll have the character Don't try to write for what you think I am, write for a white man who wants to be wealthy and powerful. And that's the way we found Dominique Deveraux.\"\n\nIn a 1984 interview, Carroll said \"I've never played a role quite this unlikeable. And I like that. I like that very much because I think very often, particularly minorities, it's almost required of them that they are nice people, and I don't want to play a nice person.\"\n\nCarroll originated the role of singer/businesswoman Dominique Deveraux in the 1984 episode \"New Lady in Town\". She appeared in 71 episodes of \"Dynasty\", and seven episodes of \"The Colbys\". The character last appeared in the 1987 \"Dynasty\" season seven finale \"Shadow Play\".\n\nTo circumvent any chance the storyline would leak to the press, a number of scenes were filmed to introduce Dominique, including alternative lines revealing that she was the mother of Kirby Anders (Kathleen Beller) or the ex-wife of Alexis' former husband, Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner). Carroll was repeatedly featured rehearsing and/or performing songs in several episodes of both series.\n\nSuccessful and wealthy chanteuse Dominique Deveraux arrives in Denver in \"New Lady in Town\" (1984) with a flourish, asking Fallon Carrington Colby (Pamela Sue Martin) questions about her mother, Alexis Colby (Joan Collins). In the next episode, the fourth season finale, Dominique wonders aloud to herself, \"Won't it just knock their socks off when they find out I'm a Carrington?\"\n\nDominique's husband Brady Lloyd (Billy Dee Williams) arrives in Denver in the September 26, 1984 season premiere episode, \"Disappearance.\" He asks why Dominique is performing at La Mirage. Brady and Dominique fight when she will not tell him why she is choosing to remain in Denver. Dominique's hostility toward oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) is noticed by Blake's wife Krystle (Linda Evans).\n\nFollowing Fallon's memorial service in \"The Rescue\", Dominique makes the shocking claim that she is the daughter of Blake's father Tom Carrington and his longtime mistress, Laura Matthews, and offers proof (found in a letter in an old trunk left in the care of Laura's sister Bessie), therefore making her Blake's half-sister. A financially strapped Blake makes a business deal with the very wealthy Dominique: Forty percent of Denver-Carrington in exchange for $70 million. This subsequently makes Dominique an enemy of Alexis, who has been scheming to destroy her ex-husband Blake. When Brady learns the truth, he is furious that Dominique didn't confide in him earlier.\n\nAs Blake's business partner, Dominique travels to Istanbul to meet with the shady Rashid Ahmed in order to help Blake obtain a confession from him. Despite this assistance, in episode 100, Blake tells Dominique that Tom denies that he is her father. Furious, Dominique instigates a lawsuit against Blake for misappropriation of company funds after Blake uses some of the money she invested in Denver-Carrington to prevent losing his mansion. However, episode 102, \"The Will\", Dominique and Blake visit their father Tom on his deathbed in Sumatra; Alexis, a favorite of Tom's, follows them. Tom meets his illegitimate daughter Dominique for the first time, and she convinces him to accept her. Tom dies, but not before including Dominique in his will, as well as making her the executor, which further infuriates Alexis (who is also a beneficiary). In episode 103, \"The Treasure\", Blake and Dominique discuss the matter between them and Blake finally acknowledges her as his half-sister. Dominique, in a show of gratitude, tells Blake that she has dropped her lawsuit against him. Later on, Blake summons Alexis to his office and tells her that if she persists in trying to break Tom's will, he will put his support firmly behind Dominique. Furthermore, he reiterates the fact that she is now family and that he will fight to the death for her. Alexis concedes to Blake's demands, but tells him she'll find a way to destroy Dominique regardless. Later that evening at the Carrington mansion, Blake holds a dinner gathering to formally welcome Dominique into the family. Adam goes out of his way to welcome her as well and Dominique is overcome with emotion. Later on, Amanda tells Alexis about the gathering and that she is proud to have Dominique as her new aunt, much to Alexis' annoyance. Alexis then places a call to one of her associates and orders him to find out everything he can about Dominique.\n\nIn episode 108, Dominique learns that Brady has filed for divorce and that Alexis is attempting to take over her company, Deveraux Group, Inc., after which she collapses. At the hospital Dominique learns that she needs heart surgery. She pulls through her illness and becomes closer to Blake and Krystle. Although the divorce goes through, Brady refuses to sell his shares in Deveraux Group, Inc. to Alexis, foiling the takeover. Noticing that famed photojournalist Lady Ashley Mitchell appears to have designs on Blake, she warns Ashley to keep away and advises Krystle to watch out.\n\nDominique is among the family guests invited to Moldavia to celebrate the wedding of her niece, Amanda, to Prince Michael, where a military coup takes place and insurgents take over the chapel and gun down the entire wedding party.\n\nDominique survives the wedding massacre, and rejects an offer by the rebel leader to remain in Moldavia to \"entertain the troops and improve morale\". Back in Denver, Dominique works with Blake on a pipeline deal with Jason Colby (Charlton Heston). She encounters Jonathan Lake (Calvin Lockhart), a state department employee, who reminds Dominique that they met years ago in Paris. Romance seems to be blossoming between the pair, but then a man from her past returns: Garrett Boydston (Ken Howard), Jason Colby's lawyer. Garrett tries to rekindle their romance, but Dominique is resistant. Years earlier, Dominique and Garrett had an affair. At the time, Garrett claimed that he was married and refused to leave his wife. Dominique is torn between the two men until she learns that Jonathan has aligned himself with Bart Fallmont, a politician who is fighting the pipeline project.\n\nDominique travels frequently to Los Angeles, and hires Monica Colby (Tracy Scoggins) to help run her L.A.-based record company. While there, she continues to see Garrett. He cannot understand her reluctance to resume their relationship.\n\nIn episode 134, Dominique's daughter, Jackie (Troy Beyer) visits her mother and asks to remain in Denver instead of returning to finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. In episode 136, Garrett meets Jackie and is immediately convinced that he is her father. Garrett presses Dominique but she continues to deny that he is Jackie's father. Jackie, who would like to see her mother married and happy, also wonders about the true nature of their relationship. In episode 143, Jackie runs away when she learns that her father is listed as \"unknown\" on her birth certificate. Alexis encounters Jackie and manipulates the girl into telling her troubles. Dominique finally admits to Garrett that he is indeed Jackie's father. Jackie returns home in episode 145 and finally learns that Garrett is her father.\n\nIn episode 146, Dominique and Garrett decide to marry. In the season finale, at their engagement party Alexis reveals that Garrett was never married before. He lied in order to avoid a long-term relationship. Dominique slaps Alexis and orders her to leave. She confronts Garrett with the story who admits that he lied so many years ago. Stunned, Dominique breaks off the engagement. Her guests continue to celebrate, unaware that the wedding is cancelled — or that a fire is raging in other parts of the hotel.\n\nDuring the fire, Dominique panics when she cannot find Jackie. Dex Dexter manages to rescue Jackie, but she is badly burned. Jackie provides eye witness testimony to the cause of the fire, before leaving Denver for state-of-the-art burn treatment.\n\nDuring this time, Dominique helps Blake to fight Alexis, who has taken over Blake's company with the assistance of their estranged brother, Ben. She also attempts to revive her singing career. When a bad review appears in Alexis's newspaper, Dominique goes to confront her in episode 160 and a cat fight ensues.\n\nIn episode 154, Dominique meets geologist Nick Kimball, who romantically pursues her. Dominique resists him at first, but by episode 158 she gives in to his advances and they share a passionate night together. In episode 163, Nick saves Dominique from two thugs who were sent by businessman Gary Tilden to \"rough her up\" after she rejected a business deal from Tilden. But Dominique is still restrained about their relationship – and draws closer to Alexis's ex-husband Dex. Nick returns in episode 173 to whisk Dominique off for a romantic weekend in San Francisco, where he proposes. While Dominique contemplates marrying Nick, Jackie returns to Denver to tell her mother that Garrett is still in love with her. In episode 175, Jackie asks Nick to break it off with Dominique. When Dominique states that she will not get back together with Garrett, a defeated Jackie leaves Denver again. In episode 176, the season finale, Dominique and Nick attend the wedding of her nephew, Adam. After the ceremony, Dominique accepts his proposal and the two leave Denver.\n\nThough not physically seen after season seven, Dominique (having revived her singing career touring Europe) is mentioned in season nine as Blake investigates the murder of Roger Grimes. Blake visits Dominique's uncle Charles Matthews, brother to her mother Laura and Aunt Bessie. Charles and his wife Jane later provide Blake with some of his father's belongings, left with them by Laura and then Bessie for safekeeping.\n\nA \"Dynasty\" reboot premiered on The CW on October 11, 2017. In the 2018 season one episode \"Trashy Little Tramp\", Jeff and Monica Colby's grandmother confesses that their mother, Millie, was fathered by Thomas Carrington, making her Blake's sister.\n\nA May 2018 press release teased that the show would introduce Blake's half-sister Dominique Deveraux, Jeff and Monica's mother, in season two.\n"}

{"id": "54971420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54971420", "title": "Enfants Riches Déprimés", "text": "Enfants Riches Déprimés\n\nEnfants Riches Déprimés (; also known as ERD) is a Los Angeles and Paris based luxury fashion brand founded by the conceptual artist, Henri Alexander (also known as Henri Alexander Levy).\n\nERD was founded in late 2012 by Henri Alexander as an Avant-garde fashion collective, in an effort to create a French punk streetwear line based on the movements of the late 1970s and Japanese Avant-garde movements of the 1980s.\n\nAlexander was educated at the prestigious Institut Le Rosey boarding school in Rolle, Switzerland, as well as various other boarding schools. Based on interviews with Alexander, his experiences at these boarding schools had a lasting impact on his psyche and artistic perspective. He subsequently attended UCLA's art program in Los Angeles, wherein he further developed his concentration in conceptual art. In this program, he was mentored by prominent artists, including Rodney McMillian, Barbara Kruger, and Andrea Fraser.\n\nRelying heavily on concepts of deconstruction and \"DIY,\" ERD has sought to revolt against the luxurious fashion world with garments of oversized proportions—juxtaposing tailored wear with brutally ripped garments. With vintage-inspired T-shirts, leather jackets and tattered oversized sweaters, the line depicts a dichotomy between couture and street life.\n\nOne of the core precepts of the brand is high price points, with T-shirts ranging from $300 to $1,000, and haute couture jackets priced as high as $95,000. ERD consistently utilizes the business model of artificial scarcity. In this regard, all styles are sold on an extremely exclusive basis, and thus in relatively small quantities. \"The price point is not only a marker of value, but intrinsically part of the piece itself,\" Alexander remarked in a 2015 interview with The Guardian. He further noted that, \"No pieces are alike and everything is limited. I have no interest in making affordable pieces for the masses.\" \n\nConsistent with this perspective, the artist further noted in a 2016 interview with Complex Magazine that, \"The best way for me to explain the brand is elitist, nihilist couture…The price point eliminates the masses, and the ideas eliminate the people who I don't want, generally, in it, due to the dark nature.\" \n\nThe originality of ERD's designs has also resulted in other brands appropriating similar designs and styles, most notably Gucci, Balmain and Vetements. ERD has made a point to be extremely particular with respect to accepting new stockists. Enfants reportedly informed stores in 2017 that if there is any evidence of carrying brands that copy ERD or feature \"mid-level contemporary bullshit,\" the brand will categorically prohibit those stores from carrying the brand.\n\nEnfants Riches Déprimés began with just a small handful of stockists in 2012. From 2013 to 2014, the label quietly garnered a cult-like following amongst celebrities, including Jared Leto, Kanye West, Pusha T, Beyoncé, G Dragon, Sky Ferreira, Courtney Love, Frances Bean Cobain, Justin Bieber, Guns N' Roses, and Zayn Malik.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Enfants Riches Déprimés has experienced significant business growth, notably with its garments being stocked by Barneys New York, Maxfield, SSENSE, Selfridges, 10 Corso Como, Luisa Via Roma, and Trois Pommes. The brand has also earned considerable artistic acclaim in the fashion world with Alexander's trailblazing and particularly confrontational and provocative designs. These garments have catapulted the brand to an unprecedented level.\n\nEnfants Riches Déprimés unveiled its SS18 pre-collection at Christie's Paris in June 2017, the first time in which a fashion house has shown at the historic auction house, founded in 1766.\n\nThe brand's official press release stated that, \"the location serves as an adequate setting for a definitive moment of Enfants Riches Déprimés, in which Henri Alexander's concepts are displayed without compromise nor restraint.\" The runway traveled through the various Matignons of Christie's, wherein each room was curated with Henri Alexander's paintings—a series of massive valet tickets and psychological process diagrams, which sought to emblematize, \"violent and naïve gestures.\" Attendees cogitated on Alexander's array of chaotic scribbles juxtaposed on his fine tailoring, as the paintings—which were on display at Christie's for days prior to the show—filled the pacing on the runway.\n\nTextures of silver chains and reconfigured 18th century antique brooches complimented SS18's suiting and ready-to-wear—thereby acting as a form of functional assemblage. The structure of the show, \"[lured] patrons into relapses of Neoclassicism and outbreaks of savagery.\" The press release further noted that, \"a story is told—a final dichotomy—with lonely silhouettes of a boy and chain—beautifully knit in collaboration with Loro Piana—peeking out between looks of spring pastels and shades of black, similar to a de Kooning.\" \n\nHenri Alexander's paintings, garments, references, and setting created a prolific collage of regression, coupling luxury with the fine art function. Alexander stated in an interview with Vanity Fair that his SS18 pre-collection allegorized, \"the tragic only child of capitalist realism, neo-Dadaism and the refined unconscious mind.\"\n\nEnfants has taken inspiration from a variety of historical sources. In an interview with V Magazine, Henri Alexander commented that \"As far as other painters I am really into Robert Motherwell. I'm envious of the scale of his work. Also, [the work of ] Cy Twombly, Antoni Tàpies and Jean Dubuffet…I find particularly appealing at this point in my life. I think those that are familiar with Tàpies' work, will see he has influenced ERD from the informality to the way he uses furniture and rags.\" The artist has also noted being influenced by Japanese fashion designers Rei Kawakubo And Yohji Yamamoto, artist Raymond Pettibon, and punk rockers Darby Crash and Johnny Thunders.\nWith respect to socio-political stimuli, Alexander asserted that, \"The line is essentially a result of my conflict between punk influences and my entitled (wealthy bourgeoisie) upbringing and my views on it. While it could be argued that there is a sort of glorification of what I know, there is also a strong correlation to Romanticism in that the revolt against aristocratic social and political norms is very present in the line in various ways.\" \n\nEnfants Riches Déprimés has engaged in a number of collaborations over the years. In 2012, the brand did a limited T-shirt release with Young & Starving, a New York nonprofit organization that works to support budding artists and curators. In 2015, the brand collaborated with Vans to create a custom classic high-top sneaker, featuring hand-drawings and \"rebellious scribbling\". For their Fall Winter 2016 collection, ERD collaborated with the estate of Cy Twombly to create a capsule collection featuring interpretations of the late artist's polaroid works.\n\nERD has also had a continuing relationship with the contemporary artist and architect, Didier Faustino. His sculpture was notably featured as the centerpiece of their Paris runway show in September 2016, which premiered the brand's Spring Summer 2017 main collection.\n\nIn early 2017, Enfants Riches Déprimés collaborated with Daft Punk for their exclusive pop-up store at Maxfield in Los Angeles. For this project, Enfants reimagined how Daft Punk's merchandise would have looked during the band's nascent stages—both in terms of aesthetic and form. The styles sought to pay homage to a bygone era of music, reflecting those raw motifs by juxtaposing photographs of the notoriously hermetic musicians onto the front of vintage-style band T-shirts and onto the back of leather couture jackets, emblazoned with \"Daftendirekt\", the title of the first track on the duo's debut album, Homework. Other styles sought to celebrate Daft Punk's legendary production techniques, depicting the duo toying with their vintage synthesizers and drum machines, with the phrase \"La Nouvelle Vague\" plastered across the front. The classic ERD label was also altered to the pseudonym, \"Electronic Research Development.\"\n\nIn late 2016, Henri Alexander was introduced to Kanye West. Directly following his release from the hospital after being admitted for psychological evaluation, West was photographed in December 2016 visiting ERD's Los Angeles studio. There have reportedly been rumors circulating that Alexander and West are working on a collaboration for 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, Enfants Riches Déprimés launched a pop-up store at Maxfield, transforming the sprawling space into a pawn shop. The shop featured a capsule collection of archival pieces, as well as a number of new limited edition styles. Notably, the brand premiered its newest high-top sneaker collaboration with Vans, and an exclusive sunglasses collaboration with the Parisian eyewear designer, Thierry Lasry.\n\nThere have been a multitude of controversies surrounding the brand and its designs. The brand has prided itself on extreme provocation, featuring Nazi insignia and obscene pornographic images. For instance, the brand created a T-shirt featuring Donald Duck emblazoned with a swastika giving a Nazi salute. They also created another shirt depicting Mickey Mouse, adorned with a swastika, engaging in aggressive sexual intercourse with a battered Minnie Mouse.\n\nIn 2014, the brand experienced a controversy surrounding the actress Ashley Benson. In the days following actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's drug overdose and death, the actress tweeted an anti-drug warning to her Twitter fans. On the same day, she was photographed wearing ERD's DJ Heroin T-shirt. This image sparked considerable backlash against her for the audaciously contradictory and distasteful move.\n\nMoreover, Enfants has gained infamy through the creation of controversial accessories, including but not limited to narcotic spoons and hangman's nooses. Commenting on the noose, Alexander stated that, \"I make pieces for myself, not for other people, not for the consumer…If you were going to kill yourself, wouldn't you want to do it with a $7,000 cashmere noose?\"\n\n"}
{"id": "13714969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13714969", "title": "Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa", "text": "Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa\n\nEuphrosyne Parepa-Rosa (7 May 1836 – 21 January 1874) was a British operatic soprano who established the Carl Rosa Opera Company together with her husband Carl Rosa. Parepa's aristocratic father died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, the widowed Parosa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York and founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady; they toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.\n\nEuphrosyne Parepa was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, to the soprano Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of basso Arthur Edward Seguin) and the Wallachian boyar Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of Bucharest. Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished. Parepa's mother turned to the stage to support her child and herself and trained the girl in singing.\n\nHer operatic début was in 1855 at the age of 16 in Malta as Amina in \"La Sonnambula\", followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the Lyceum Theatre, in the role of Elvira in \"I Puritani\", with the Royal Italian Opera company, with whom she spent the 1857 season. The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856–57 season at the Lyceum because the Royal Opera House was being remodeled after a fire. See Obituary: \"Madame Parepa Rosa\", \"The Times\", 23 January 1874, p. 10</ref> The critic of \"The Observer\" wrote of this introduction: \"Parepa possesses a soprano voice of excellent quality and remarkable compass. She acts and sings well. Her version of \"Son vergine vezzosa\" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and … [after the \"finale\"] she was again called for. … \"Qui la voce\" … was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the \"artiste\" was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience.\"\n\nFrom 1859 to 1865, she appeared in opera at both Royal Opera House in Covent Garden and at Her Majesty's Theatre, becoming known for such roles as Leonora in \"Il trovatore\", Zerlina in \"Fra Diavolo\" and Elvira in \"La muette de Portici\". During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in Alfred Mellon's \"Victorine\" in 1859 and the role of Mabel in George Alexander Macfarren's opera \"Helvellyn\" in 1864. She also was a successful oratorio and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond. She sang with Charles Santley at the opening of the Oxford Music Hall in 1861, appeared before the Royal Philharmonic Society in Schumann's \"Paradise and the Peri\" and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of Handel, performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.\n\nHer first husband, Army Captain H. de Wolfe Carvelle, died in Peru in 1865, sixteen months after their wedding. She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Levy and violinist Carl Rosa, the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867. Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the French Theatre on Fourteenth Street, New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of Balfe's opera \"The Puritan's Daughter\", with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from \"The Bohemian Girl\" and \"Maritana\" to Weber's \"Der Freischütz\" and \"Oberon\".\n\nIn 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at Cairo, Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871–72. In 1872, Parepa sang at the Lower Rhine Festival in Düsseldorf, and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in \"Don Giovanni\" and the title role in \"Norma\" at the Royal Opera House. In September 1873, the company changed its name to Carl Rosa's English Opera, since Parepa was pregnant.\n\nParepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" as part of her husband's planned season a Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season. She is buried at Highgate cemetery. After her death, Rosa endowed the Parepa-Rosa Scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in her memory.\n\nWilliam Winter wrote that \"Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of \"Norma\". … [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in \"The Barber of Seville\" ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture.\" Her obituary in \"Illustrated London News\" stated: \"Her voice was a genuine soprano, of extensive compass and fine quality, while her highly-cultivated execution and her general musical knowledge gave her exceptional advantages, both mechanical and intellectual\".\n\nHer achievements were recognised by the Philharmonic Society of London (now the Royal Philharmonic Society) with the rare award of their Gold Medal in 1872.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33523637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33523637", "title": "Feather tights", "text": "Feather tights\n\nFeather tights is the name usually given by art historians to a form of costume seen on Late Medieval depictions of angels, which shows them as if wearing a body suit with large scale-like overlapping downward-pointing elements representing feathers, as well as having large wings. Other sources use feathered angels to describe the style. The style is assumed to derive from actual costumes worn by those playing angels in medieval religious drama, with the \"feathered\" elements presumably flaps or lappets of cloth or leather sewn onto a body suit. The feathers on angels in art can often to be seen to stop abruptly at the neck, wrists and ankles, sometimes with a visible hemline, reflecting these originals.\n\nMary Magdalene's hair suit is another iconographic feature, with a background in hagiographic legend, whose depiction apparently borrows from religious drama.\n\nHistorians of English churches tend to refer to the feather tights style as 15th century, and by implication essentially English, but it can be seen in several major late medieval European works from the late 14th to early 16th centuries. These include the Holy Thorn Reliquary in the British Museum, made by a court goldsmith in Paris in the 1390s, and on two wooden angels from South Germany around 1530 (Museum Kunstpalast Düsseldorf, right), as well as two stone ones hovering over the \"Lamentation of Christ\" by Tilman Riemenschneider at Maidbronn (1526), and others on Veit Stoss's wooden altarpiece at Bamberg Cathedral (1520–23). There is also a figure with greenish-black feathers, in Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece of 1515.\n\nThe \"devil in his feathers\" featured in the Chester Midsummer Watch Parade as late as the 1590s, provided by the butcher's guild; these parades had originally used the costumes from the Chester Plays, where \"the devil in his feathers, all ragger [ragged] and rent\" also appeared. An early English version of the style is found in the Egerton Genesis Picture Book, an unusual and much discussed illuminated manuscript attributed by the British Library (who own it) to \"England, S.E. or N. (Norwich or Durham?)\" in the \"3rd quarter of the 14th century\".\n\nIt is believed that this practice arose from medieval liturgical dramas and mystery plays, in which the actors portraying angels wore garments covered with feathers to emphasize their power of flight, often standing on \"clouds\" of wool. Costumed angels also might be introduced for one-off special occasions: at the coronation of Henry VII's queen, Elizabeth of York, in 1487 an angel swinging a large censer was lowered from the roof of Old St Paul's, and at the marriage of their son Arthur to Catherine of Aragon in 1501, the archangel Raphael was part of the ceremony, with \"goldyn and glyteryng wingis and ffedyrs of many and sundry colours\".\n\nThe feathering might be used as a substitute for other clothing, or under vestments or Saint Michael's armour. Feathered tights are not to be confused with the feathers of the extra pairs of wings traditionally attributed to cherubim and other higher orders of angels, which are often shown pointing downwards covering the legs. Further enhancements to actor's costumes might include expensive real peacock feathers to represent the \"eyed\" wing feathers of the cherubim; elsewhere whether real or simulated feathers, or a combination, were worn by actors is unclear. The more common and traditional angelic costume of an alb-like robe flowing to the feet was also used in drama, as records show.\n\nThe depictions may be in wood, stone or alabaster, or glass. The well-preserved church of St Mary the Virgin, Ewelme has examples in wood on the roof and the top of the large font cover, and in stone and alabaster round the tomb monument to Alice de la Pole, Duchess of Suffolk, and the Beauchamp Chapel in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick has ones in stone (still painted) and glass. Other examples from English churches in painted or stained glass are at Great Malvern Priory, St Nicholas, Blakeney and Cawston, Norfolk, St Peter Hungate in Norwich and the Victoria and Albert Museum (Norwich School), which also has a large painted Nottingham alabaster figure of the Archangel Michael some 70 cm tall. The rare surviving wall paintings on the crossing-arch at St Mary's Attleborough, Norfolk include two prominent feathered angels.\n\nA similar depiction of the penitent Mary Magdalene appears in some Southern German works around mostly 1500, but with body hair rather than feathers. The earliest may be in the scene of Mary's last Holy Communion in Lucas Moser's Altar with scenes from the life of the Magdalene in Tiefenbronn, from 1432. Tilman Riemenschneider's carved figure in the Münnerstadt Altar (1490-1492), now Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich is the best known. According to medieval legend the Magdalene had spent a period of repentance as a desert hermit after leaving her life as a prostitute and her life as a follower of Jesus. Her story became conflated in the West with that of Saint Mary of Egypt, a 4th-century prostitute turned hermit, whose clothes wore out and fell off in the desert. In earlier medieval depictions Mary's long hair entirely covers her body and preserves her modesty, but in these her hair is more naturalistic and does not do so.\n\nInstead she has a coat of hair somewhat like a dog's, ending rather neatly at the neck, wrists and ankles, suggesting derivation from a theatrical costume, as with the feather suits. The suits, which are mainly consistent in depiction, do not cover her breasts or knees, or sometimes elbows. The bare patches on the knees and elbows probably are meant to have been worn bare by Mary praying on her knees, resting her elbows on a rock ledge, as she is often shown in later paintings of the Penitent Magdalen. The lack of hair on the breasts presumably follows the pattern of body hair typical of mammals and familiar to late medieval Germans from farm animals such as sheep and cattle.\nMost such images depict the \"Ascension\" or \"Elevation of Mary Magdalene\", showing the regular visits of angels to Mary's desert home (actually in Provence in the South of France according to the legend) to raise her into the air and feed her heavenly food. In the words of William Caxton's English translation of the \"Golden Legend\": \n...the blessed Mary Magdalene, desirous of sovereign contemplation, sought a right sharp desert, and took a place which was ordained by the angel of God, and abode there by the space of thirty years without knowledge of anybody. In which place she had no comfort of running water, ne solace of trees, ne of herbs. And that was because our Redeemer did do show it openly, that he had ordained for her refection celestial, and no bodily meats. And every day at every hour canonical she was lifted up in the air of angels, and heard the glorious song of the heavenly companies with her bodily ears. Of which she was fed and filled with right sweet meats, and then was brought again by the angels unto her proper place, in such wise as she had no need of corporal nourishing.\n\nMoser's altar shows the scene of her last Holy Communion after her return to the world and just before her death, as recounted in the \"Golden Legend\":\n... [Saint Maximinus] saw the blessed Mary Magdalene standing in the quire or choir yet among the angels that brought her, and was lift up from the earth the space of two or three cubits. And praying to our Lord she held up her hands, and when S. Maximin saw her, he was afraid to approach to her. And she returned to him, and said: Come hither mine own father, and flee not thy daughter. And when he approached and came to her, as it is read in the books of the said S. Maximin, for the customable vision that she had of angels every day, the cheer and visage of her shone as clear as it had been the rays of the sun. And then all the clerks and the priests aforesaid were called, and Mary Magdalene received the body and blood of our Lord of the hands of the bishop with great abundance of tears, and after, she stretched her body tofore the altar, and her right blessed soul departed from the body and went to our Lord.\n\nThe relief panels on the inside of the shutters of the Münnerstadt Altar show four scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene, with her covered in body hair in the last two, showing her last Communion and burial (these are still in the church). \n"}
{"id": "50526428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50526428", "title": "Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media", "text": "Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media\n\nThe Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is a non-profit research organization that researches gender representation in media and advocates for equal representation of women. Madeline Di Nonno joined as CEO of the Institute in 2009. The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is currently headquartered at Mount St. Mary’s University, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAfter watching children’s TV with her young daughter, Geena Davis noticed that the large majority of television shows lacked a large amount of female characters. This inspired her to think critically about what American media showed to young children; and to eventually investigate the role of gender in media. She realized the importance of the female representation in children’s shows, as these representations can impact how young girls see themselves. Specifically, Davis wanted to focus on television shows, films, and other media outlets that are intended for children under 11, as these are formative years for one’s identity. After conducting research on this type of entertainment, Davis found that three times more men than women appear in children’s television shows and films.The research also showed that characters in the workplace were 80.5% male and only 19.5% female.. Davis studied \"122 G, PG, and PG-13 films theatrically-released between 2006 and 2009.” Generally, she found that “only 29.2% of all speaking characters are female,” and these women are more sexualized than the men. As “children are engaging with media up to 7-10 hours/day,” the representation of women in children’s television shows and films has a major impact on how young girls believe they should act and how they view themselves. Davis subsequently founded the eponymous Institute in 2004.\nAt its core, the Geena Davis Institute believes that, too often, the media “sidelines, hypersexualizes, or simply omits” women, particularly in movies and television.\n\nGeena Davis was motivated to start her foundation because of her Academy Award Nominated role in Ridley Scott’s Thelma and Louise, the 1991 film that she had said changed her life. When the film was released to overwhelming acclaim it made her realize just how few opportunities there were to see empowered female characters on screen, and it inspired her to establish her institute.\n\nDavis said that throughout her career she consciously chose roles that would empower women and girls. She acknowledges that this was a luxury because she “hasn’t run out of money yet” and added that if she ever appeared as Sean Connery’s comatose wife, “about right, by Hollywood standards” - we should know she’s broke.\n\nDavis says the Institute targets the entertainment industry rather than the public. It seeks to increase diversity in casting and advocates for equal representation of women in media. For example, Davis cited research by the Institute that 17% of people in crowd scenes are women. Using her connections in the industry, Davis takes these statistics to media executives to educate them about the poor representation of women in media. Children's entertainment is a primary focus of the Institute.\n\nThe Institute is the only research-based organization working within the media to exchange, educate, influence, and expound on the need for gender balance, and, it is a leading voice to create a wide variety of roles for females in the entertainment industry.  The Institute is against stereotyping of female characters, and it furthers calls for roles that empower women rather than denigrate them. \n\nDavis states, “The fact is women are seriously underrepresented in nearly all sectors of society across the globe, not just on screen, but, for the most part, we are simply not aware to this reality, and media images exert a powerful influence in perpetuating our unconscious bias” \n\nOne of the reasons that impelled Davis to start her foundation was personal experience with Hollywood’s sexist treatment of older women. Davis says, “Film roles really did start to dry up when I got into my 40’s. If you look at IMDB, up until that age I made roughly one film a year. In my entire 40’s, I made one movie, Stuart Little.” \n\nThe Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has garnered several notable accomplishments concerning their research. As an Institute, they have cultivated one of the largest repositories of research around the intersection of gender and media for the past 25 years.\n\nThe Institute has engaged in several large scale research projects concerning the current conditions for women in mass media. In addition, the Institute collaborates with several other non-profits and for-profit corporations in order to highlight their feelings on the need to reform the way that women are represented in popular culture. Contributors to the Institute include scientists, non-profit coordinators, business leaders, as well as those involved in producing and acting in media.\n\nIn 2010, the Institute, along with the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation, established a $5000 award for diversity in children's animation created by college students.\n\nThe Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has teamed-up with several multi-national corporations to achieve their goal of informing media consumers about the current state of women in popular culture. Recently, the Institute has partnered with Ford and several YouTube stars to create a video series entitled #ShesGotDrive. The partnership between Ford and the Institute seeks to highlight several stories of women content creators overcoming significant challenges. Thus far, the campaign has featured Taryn Southern, Yulin Kang, and Clara C. The purpose of this campaign is to highlight the power of women in media and inspire other women to follow their dreams. In addition, the campaign seeks “to fight unconscious gender bias in media.” \nThe Institute has also teamed up with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America (GSUSA) to create a program entitled Girls’ Fast Track Races. With this program, girls construct their own race cars. The program was created in order to foster learning of automobile engineering in young women. Previously, in 2016, the Institute received a 1.2 million dollar grant from Google. Using this grant, the Institute developed the Geena Davis Inclusion Quotient (or GD-IQ). The GD-IQ is an algorithm that can quickly scan a feature-length film to detect gender differences in representation. The Institute believes that the GD-IQ will significantly improve the Institute’s research of on-screen gender disparities.\n\nIn addition to its partnerships with several for-profit corporations, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media has also partnered with a number of non-profit organizations in order to further the institute’s goal of generating equal representation for women in media. The institute has partnered with the United Nations; and founder Geena Davis is a chair on the California Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nThe Institute has completed several large studies around the representation of gender in media. One larger study was conducted over gender roles in popular culture, including topics such as the disparity between speaking roles for men and women; and what type of roles men and women were shown as portraying on screen. The Institute conducted this research by analyzing several blockbuster films from 2008 and concluded that gender roles are stereotyped in popular culture. A second larger study was conducted over the impact that gender plays in both on screen media as well as behind the scenes of media production. The Geena Davis Institute investigated and discovered that in the film industry, only 8% of directors are women, coupled with 19% of producers and 13.6% of writers. Several other studies conducted by the institute concern additional issues regarding gender and media including gender disparity in media across several countries as well as the portrayal of gender in films specifically marketed to young girls and families.\nEach year, the institute studies female representation in entertainment and publishes their findings Through this study, the institute hopes that bringing the facts about media representation to the public’s attention will bring positive change for female representation in the media. In 2015, the institute studied the top 100 grossing films of 2014 and 2015 and found that, overall, women spoke less than men and received less screen time in films. However, the study also found that “women had a particularly strong presence in the comedy and action genres,” and cites women like Tina Fey and Melissa McCarthy as a couple of the year’s leading ladies. Yet even with female leads like Fey and McCarthy, out of the 100 films, only “11% featured a female lead.” Even though films featuring a female lead made up less than a quarter of the top 100 grossing films, “films led by women grossed 15.8% more on average than films led by men.” \n\nIn 2016, the organization found that there were increasingly more female leads in movies than ever before. A separate study exemplifies the influence of female leads: after the release of films like The Hunger Games and Brave, both of which feature female archers as leads, the number of young girls participating in archery greatly increased. According to Davis, “68% of the film companies they’ve worked with have changed two or more of their projects” to include more female representation. \n\nIn addition to many of their research contributions, the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media also created the Bentonville Film Festival. Davis founded the Bentonville Film Festival with Trevor Drinkwater. Films that are in the Bentonville film festival are guaranteed distribution, a move that Davis says will fix the disproportionate number of women creators in Hollywood. The yearly festival is held in Bentonville, Arkansas.Nearly 100 films are showcased at the growing festival.The festival also has concerts with various artists each year. In 2018 country singers Carly Pearce and Lauren Alaina performed as well as Jillian Jacqueline, Vintage Troube and Fifth Harmony's Ally Brooke.\n\n"}

His oeuvre began with portraits and classical historical subject matter but he later moved on to allegorical and mythological themes.\n\nHe was an academic painter and one of the founders of the Neo-Grec school, along with his close friends Gustave Boulanger, Jean-Léon Gérôme, and Jean-Louis Hamon, also academic painters. All of them studied in the workshops of both Paul Delaroche and later Charles Gleyre. Picou's style was noticeably influenced by Gleyre. While the rest of the group generally painted classical and mythological subjects, Picou also received commissions for large religious frescoes from many churches, including the Église Saint-Roch.\nHis artistic debut was at the Salon in 1847. The next year he was awarded a second-class medal for his painting, \"Cléopâtre et Antoine sur le Cydnus\". Also known as \"Cleopatra on the Cydnus\", it is commonly regarded as Picou's masterpiece. This showing at the Salon in 1848 was written about by the critic Théophile Gautier, who felt that the subject matter was too ambitious, but also said that \"As it is, it gives the best hope for the future of the young artist, and ranks among the seven or eight most important paintings of the Salon.\" In 1875, the painting was exhibited in New York, and afterward found lodgment on the walls of a private art gallery in San Francisco.\n\nPicou maintained a large workshop in Paris on the Boulevard de Magenta, which provided him room to work on his expansive frescoes. His popularity continued to rise and he went on to win the Second Prix de Rome in 1853 for his painting, \"Jésus chassant les vendeurs du Temple\" (\"The Moneylenders Chased from the Temple\"), and another second-class medal for his Salon painting in 1857. From his debut in 1847, he was a regular at the Salon, showing almost every year until his final exhibit in 1893. He has been called the most fashionable painter towards the close of the Second French Empire.\n\n"}
{"id": "357090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357090", "title": "High Renaissance", "text": "High Renaissance\n\nIn art history, the High Renaissance is a short period of the most exceptional artistic production in the Italian states, particularly Rome, capital of the Papal States, during the Italian Renaissance. Most art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500 and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael, although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525, or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, or about 1530 (see next section for specific art historians’ positions). The best-known exponents of painting, sculpture and architecture of the High Renaissance include Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael and Bramante. In recent years, the use of the term has been frequently criticized by some academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.\n\nThe term \"High Renaissance\" was first used by Jacob Burckhardt in German (\"Hochrenaissance\") in 1855 and has its origins in the \"High Style\" of painting and sculpture of the time period around the early 16th century described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann in 1764.. Extending the general rubric of Renaissance culture, the visual arts of the High Renaissance were marked by a renewed emphasis upon the classical tradition, the expansion of networks of patronage, and a gradual attenuation of figural forms into the style later termed Mannerism.\n\nAlexander Raunch in \"The Art of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy\", 2007, states the High Renaissance began in 1490, while Marilyn Stokstad in \"Art History\", 2008, states it began in the 1490s. Frederick Hartt states that da Vinci’s the \"Last Supper\", the painting of which began in 1495 and concluded in 1498, makes a complete break with the Early Renaissance and created the world in which Michelangelo and Raphael worked while Christoph Luitpold Frommel, in his 2012 article \"Bramante and the Origins of the High Renaissance,\" states the \"Last Supper\" is the first High Renaissance work but adds that the peak period of the High Renaissance was actually 1505 to 1513. David Piper in \"The Illustrated History of Art\", 1991, also cites the \"Last Supper\" writing the work announced the High Renaissance and was one of the most influential paintings of the High Renaissance, but contradictorily states that the High Renaissance began just after 1500. Burchkardt stated the High Renaissance started at the close of the 15th century, while Franz Kugler, who wrote the first \"modern\" survey text, \"Handbook of Art History\" in 1841, and Hugh Honour and John Fleming in \"The Visual Arts: A History\", 2009, state the High Renaissance started at the beginning of the 16th century. Another seminal work of art which was created in the 1495-1500 timeframe was Michelangelo's the Pietà, housed in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, which was executed in 1498-99. \n\nIn contrast to most of the other art historians, Manfred Wurdram, in \"Masterpieces of Western Art\", 2007, actually states that the dawn of the High Renaissance was heralded by da Vinci’s \"Adoration of the Magi\" of 1481, for which only the underpainting was completed.\n\nAs far as the end of the High Renaissance is concerned Hartt, Frommel, Piper, Wundrum and Winkelman all state that the High Renaissance ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael. Honour and Fleming stated the High Renaissance was the first quarter of the 16th century meaning it would have ended in 1525. By contrast, Luigi Lanzi, in his \"History of Italian Painting\", 1795-96, stated it ended with the Sack of Rome in 1527. when several artists were killed and many other dispersed from Rome, and Stokstad agrees. Raunch asserts that 1530 has been considered to be the end of the High Renaissance. Hartt adds that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism.\n\nHigh Renaissance style in architecture conventionally begins with Donato Bramante, whose Tempietto at S. Pietro in Montorio at Rome was begun in 1510. The Tempietto, signifies a full-scale revival of ancient Roman commemorative architecture. David Watkin writes that the Tempietto, like Raphael's works in the Vatican (1509–11), \"is an attempt at reconciling Christian and humanist ideals\".\n\nThe High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective, the realistic depiction of both physical and psychological features, and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, sfumato (softening the transition between colours) and chiaroscuro (contrast between light and dark), in a single unifying style which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony. In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole. Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour. The High Renaissance was traditionally viewed as a great explosion of creative genius, following a model of art history first proposed by the Florentine Giorgio Vasari. \n\nThe paintings in the Vatican by Michelangelo and Raphael are said by some scholars such as Stephen Freedberg to represent the culmination of High Renaissance style in painting, because of the ambitious scale of these works, coupled with the complexity of their composition, closely observed human figures, and pointed iconographic and decorative references to classical antiquity, can be viewed as emblematic of the High Renaissance.\n\nEven relatively minor painters of the period, such as Fra Bartolomeo and Mariotto Albertinelli, produced works that are still lauded for the harmony of their design and their technique. The elongated proportions and exaggerated poses in the late works of Michelangelo, Andrea del Sarto and Correggio prefigure so-called Mannerism, as the style of the later Renaissance is referred to in art history.\n\nThe serene mood and luminous colours of paintings by Giorgione and early Titian exemplify High Renaissance style as practiced in Venice. Other recognizable pieces of this period include Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" and Raphael's \"The School of Athens\". Raphael's fresco, set beneath an arch, is a virtuoso work of perspective, composition and \"disegno\".\n\nIn more recent years, art historians have characterised the High Renaissance as a movement as opposed to a period, one amongst several different experimental attitudes towards art in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century. This movement is variously characterised as conservative; as reflecting new attitudes towards beauty; a deliberate process of synthesising eclectic models, linked to fashions in literary culture; and reflecting new preoccupations with interpretation and meaning .\n\nHigh Renaissance sculpture, as exemplified by Michelangelo's \"Pietà\" and the iconic \"David\", is characterized by an \"ideal\" balance between stillness and movement. High Renaissance sculpture was normally commissioned by the public and the state, this becoming more popular for sculpture is an expensive art form. Sculpture was often used to decorate or embellish architecture, normally within courtyards where others were able to study and admire the commissioned art work. Wealthy individuals like cardinals, rulers and bankers were the more likely private patrons along with very wealthy families; Pope Julius II also patronized many artists. During the High Renaissance there was the development of small scale statuettes for private patrons, the creation of busts and tombs also developing. The subject matter related to sculpture was mostly religious but also with a significant strand of classical individuals in the form of tomb sculpture and paintings as well as ceilings of cathedrals.\n\n"}

It’s not a problem – if they choose the right pieces. If they take more feminine music... This is a purely biological question.” Other conductors, such as his former student Salonen, responded critically to Panula's remarks.\n"}

{"id": "7827322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7827322", "title": "Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)", "text": "Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)\n\nLas Hilanderas (\"The Spinners\") is a painting by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, housed in the Museo del Prado of Madrid, Spain. It is also known by the title \"The Fable of Arachne\". It is usually regarded as a late work by the artist, dating from around 1657. \n\nTraditionally, it was believed that the painting depicted women workers in the tapestry workshop of Santa Isabel. In 1948, however, Diego Angula observed that the iconography suggested Ovid's Fable of Arachne, the story of the mortal Arachne who dared to challenge the goddess Athena to a weaving competition and, on winning the contest, was turned into a spider by the jealous goddess. This is now generally accepted as the correct interpretation of the painting.\nIt was painted for Don Pedro de Arce, huntsman to King Philip IV. It entered the royal collection in the eighteenth century, and was probably damaged by the fire at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid in 1734. New sections were added at the sides (37 cm in total) and over 50 cm to the top of the canvas. The painting remains at the extended size but is currently (in November 2013) displayed behind a screen with a frame added over a cut-away section revealing only the original dimensions.\n\nStylistic elements, such as the lightness, the economical use of paint, and the clear influence of the Italian Baroque, have led many scholars to assert that it was painted in 1657. Others place it earlier, at some time between 1644–50, perhaps because certain aspects of its form and content recall the bodegones Velázquez painted in his early career.\n\nIn \"Las Hilanderas\", Velázquez developed a layered composition, an approach he had often used in his earlier bodegones, such as the \"Kitchen Scene with Christ in the House of Martha and Mary\". In the foreground is the contest. The goddess Athena, disguised as an old woman, is on the left and Arachne, in a white top facing away from the viewer, is on the right. Three helpers assist them. In the background, a raised platform (perhaps a stage) displays the finished tapestries. The one visible to us is Arachne's, showing The Rape of Europa — another Greek myth. This is in fact a copy of Titian's painting of the subject, which was in the Spanish royal collection. \n\nThe painting has been interpreted as an allegory of the arts and even as a commentary on the range of creative endeavor, with the fine arts represented by the goddess and the crafts represented by Arachne. Others think that Velázquez' message was simply that to create great works of art, both great creativity and hard technical work are required. Other scholars have read political allegories into the work and interpreted it through popular culture.\n\n\n"}

Surrounding the four figures, in the foreground, are various symbols of knowledge and learning: a bust, a scroll (labeled \"geometry\"), papers and columns (architecture); a globe (geography), a lyre and sheet music (music), and a paper with escutcheons on it (history and heraldry).

{"id": "41118773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41118773", "title": "List of esports games", "text": "List of esports games\n\nEsports are video games which are played in professional competitions, usually fall into a few major genres. The majority of esports titles are fighting games, first-person shooters (FPS), real-time strategy (RTS), or multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA), with the MOBA genre being the most popular in terms of participation and viewership. The following is a selection of games which currently have or had a professional scene, sorted by genre and ordered roughly chronologically.\n\nFighting games were among the earliest games to be in tournaments, with the founding of what would become the Evolution Championship Series in 1999.\n\nCompetitions in the genre are generally individual competitions with both players providing input to the same machine. The genre originally focused on arcade play, but has gradually moved to console play as arcades have declined. The \"Street Fighter\" series, \"The King of Fighters\" series, \"Mortal Kombat\" series, \"Marvel vs. Capcom\" series, \"Tekken\" series, \"Killer Instinct\" series and \"Super Smash Bros.\" series are amongst those fighting games played at a professional level. Important tournaments for the genre include the Evolution Championship Series and Capcom Cup, Tougeki – Super Battle Opera was a major tournament for several years.\n\nFighting game enthusiasts generally prefer the moniker \"competitive gaming\", and often eschew the term \"e-sports\", citing cultural differences between the predominantly PC-gaming esports communities and the older arcade-gaming community.\n\nMembers of the fighting game community are generally especially cognizant of their cc to the old arcade-era competitions, wishing to prioritize the preservation the spirit of those competitions over simple monetization of fighting competitions.\nThe \"Street Fighter\" has one of the earliest and longest running professional gaming scenes.\n\nProfessional \"Street Fighter\" players include Daigo Umehara, who had two of his matches included in a 2011 Kotaku list of \"The 10 Best Moments in Pro-Gaming History\". His early 1998 match against American player Alex Valle in \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\" ranked sixth and his 2004 comeback against American player Justin Wong in \"\" ranked first, while his 2009 grand finals match against Wong in \"Street Fighter IV\" at Evo 2009 was listed as having \"[j]ust missed the cut.\"\n\nNintendo's \"Super Smash Bros.\" series has a large competitive community. While every title has been featured in high-profile tournaments, \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" and \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" are the most popular for high level competition as of 2016. Major League Gaming regularly sponsored \"Melee\" events from 2004 to 2007, before dropping it in favor for the 2008 sequel \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". According to Major League Gaming, over 400 \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" competitive tournaments were held in 2010 in North America. Since then, \"Melee\" has again been periodically hosted at MLG events, with the latest being MLG 2015 World Finals. \"Smash Wii U\" had an online contest sponsored by ESL. Other notable national tournaments to feature \"Smash\" games include Apex and Evolution Championship Series (EVO). At EVO 2016, \"Smash Wii U\" became the largest \"Smash\" tournament ever with 2,662 entrants.\n\n\"Marvel vs. Capcom\" (MvC) is a fighting game series developed by Capcom that features characters from Capcom games and Marvel comic book characters. The series was played at the Evolution Championship Series from 2000 until 2017.\n\nNamco's \"Tekken\" series is known as the lightning chess of fighting games, having a large player base in Asian countries. Over the years Tekken has been cited as the most technical among fighting games. Praised for its balance, strong basics, depth and one of the few fighting games to feature a real 3D design, it continues to be featured in various championships. The \"Master cup\" series of Japan, \"Final round\" series of U.S.A, \"Strongstyle\" series of U.S.A, \"UT\" championship series of Europe are a few examples of events that are, or started off as exclusive Tekken events, and still hold it as a main game. The \"King of Iron Fist Tournament\" is a Tekken only tournament hosted by Namco themselves. Apart from this, other shows such as \"Tekken Crash\", \"Tekken Strike\" are Tekken only shows held in South Korea on the E-sports channel \"Nice Game T.V\". Tekken has made it periodically into the Evo Championship series, and since 2013 has become a permanent part of the event. Although it has a lesser player-base in the west, it seems to be steadily rising. In the east it dominates the arcade scene today leaving other games of its genre miles behind.\n\nThe \"Killer Instinct\" series is a combo-heavy franchise created by Rare and currently maintained by Iron Galaxy Studios and Microsoft. The franchise' most-played game is the 2013 Killer Instinct reboot, with the platform of choice being Xbox One. A circuit for the game has been created called the Killer Instinct World Cup, with a second iteration ending in early 2017. Killer Instinct's best player is Jonathan \"Rico Suave\" Deleon, who currently holds the EVO and Killer Instinct World Cup titles.\n\nIn January 2017, Ultra Arcade enforced a ban on taunting and teabagging in major Killer Instinct tournaments which sparked controversy among the fighting game community with some stating that it is considered impossible to enforce due to certain players' playstyles.\n\nFirst person shooters focus on simulating a firefight from a first person perspective, and may be either individual or team based. Classic games include the PC game \"Team Fortress 2\", which is featured in a few smaller leagues such as the ESEA League, RGL, United Gaming Clans, and European Team Fortress 2 League. \"Call of Duty\" and \"Halo\" competitions usually play their console editions.\n\nDoom is a series of multiplayer 1v1 and free-for-all deathmatch games developed by id Software. Doom is notable for establishing the arena-style deathmatch format, and also was partially responsible for the first online FPS community through DWANGO, an online gaming service officially endorsed and partially worked on by id Software. People also played Doom deathmatch online through other BBS services. The Ultimate DOOM and \"Doom II,\" alongside Heretic, were played in the Deathmatch '95 tournament, sponsored by id Software, Microsoft, and DWANGO. This tournament, perhaps the first PC esports tournament of its kind, was played through the online DWANGO service. Finalists from the US and the UK were flown to Microsoft headquarters to compete in a LAN party format event, named Judgement Day. Dennis Fong, best known for his victory at the Red Annihilation tournament for \"Quake\", won Judgement Day, marking his first entry into esports. Doom II was also played in Cyberathlete Professional League and QuakeCon tournaments.\n\n\"Doom 3\" featured a 1v1 mode which was played professionally at QuakeCon 2004, QuakeCon 2005, and CPL Winter 2004, but was ultimately replaced by \"Quake 4\" and \"Painkiller\".\n\nQuake is a series 1v1 PC based games developed by id Software. In 1996, id released the original Quake, and launched QuakeCon. QuakeCon is an annual convention which hosts competitions for the series, and has become the largest LAN event in North America. The first offline \"Quake\" tournament, Red Annihilation took place in May 1997. The winner, Dennis Fong, going under the alias \"Thresh\", took home the prize of \"Quake\" co-creator John D. Carmack's own red Ferrari 328 GTS convertible.\n\n\"Quake 4\" supported a small professional scene, with a dozen professional players signed to a few professional teams and a number of players marketing themselves through other means. Tournament play for \"Quake 4\" peaked around 2006, with the game included in tournaments such as the Electronic Sports World Cup, the World Series of Video Games before the league's demise, the World Cyber Games 2006, and KODE5. As of 2008, \"Quake 4\" has fallen out of favor in competition for the previous game in the series, \"Quake III Arena\".\n\n\"Quake Live\" was released in 2010, primarily based on \"Quake III Arena\". \"Quake Live\" was played in tournaments such as DreamHack, QuakeCon, and FaceIt. The popularity of the title declined after a couple years. In 2012, the last major tournament to host \"Quake\" competitions, the Intel Extreme Masters, decided to drop the title.\n\nThe \"Counter-Strike\" series is a series of team based first person shooters which began as a \"Half-Life\" mod which was bought by Valve and released from beta in 2000. Professional competition is centered in North America and Europe in tournaments such as the World Cyber Games, CEVO, ESEA League, Intel Extreme Masters, Cyberathlete Professional League and the Electronic Sports League. The defunct league Championship Gaming Series franchised teams with contracted players who played \"\".\n\n\"Counter Strike\" is consistently at competitions such as DreamHack and World Cyber Games as the 1.6 version released in 2003, despite newer versions having been released by Valve over the years.\n\nThe most recent game in the series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, was released in August 2012. Although \"Counter-Strike\" did not appear in the World Cyber Games 2013, the largest prizepool in the series' history has been announced for ELEAGUE, with $1.4 million USD.\n\nThe \"Call of Duty\" series is a first-person shooter that has been played as an esport primarily in North America and is primarily played on PlayStation consoles, but was formerly played on Xbox. It has been featured in MLG tournaments ever since \"\" was introduced to the league in 2008. Tournaments usually have a large number of unknown teams competing to play with the top pro teams. A well known example is OpTic Gaming, who have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from competing in leagues and tournaments.\n\nBeginning with the release of the first game in 1998, the \"Unreal Tournament\" series of first person shooters supported competitions in the early 2000s, such as the series' inclusion the World Cyber Games from 2001 through 2004. There are no longer major tournaments for the series, as it has been dropped from leagues such as the Electronic Sports League.\n\nThe \"Halo\" series has been featured in the American Major League Gaming since the release of Halo: Combat Evolved for the original Xbox. The series has also been played internationally, such as the European Console League's event in July 2010 in Liverpool. The Australian Cyber League hosted a Pro Circuit with tournaments in several major cities in Australia, including a January 2009 event in Brisbane. Partially due to changes to the series' design, \"Halo\" competitions have gone into steep decline that started in 2010 with the release of Halo: Reach, a drastic change from what was considered traditional Halo, as seen in the original three games. The decline had continued into late 2013/2014 where Halo 4 had been introduced and was an even bigger change to the series than Halo: Reach, and as a result had no major competitive events held, other than the Halo 4 World Championships, which was put on by developer 343 Industries as an early attempt to save Halo esports. 343 Industries later released Halo: The Master Chief Collection, re-releasing all 4 original titles in 60fps, but featuring a completely remastered version of Halo 2 to use as the primary game for halo esports. Although this was a good attempt by the developer to bring back the dying community, the game suffered from many bugs and glitches that made the game unplayable, which furthermore damaged that Halo esports community. At the same time around the release of Halo: the Master Chief Collection, 343 Industries introduced the Halo Championship Series as another attempt to re-establish Halo as a competitive esports title. As Halo declined, it was dropped from Major League Gaming, to be replaced by Call of Duty as the new staple game for the league. Currently Halo 5 is the newest game in the series and has entirely built around being competitive and well suited for esports, featuring vanilla competitive settings, a wide array of competitive game modes, and an in-depth spectator mode. 343 Industries is hosting the Halo World Championships, which will be a 4v4 competition, held in part with competitive leagues MLG, ESL, and Gfinity. The prize pool is currently 2 million dollars, which is crowd funded through Halo 5's in-game \"REQ Pack\" purchases. The game franchise's history in esports is currently focused at the Halo Championship Series (HCS) Pro League in conjunction with the ESL esports organization, with the first season finished up in\n\n\"Painkiller\" is a 2004 game developed by Polish game studio People Can Fly and published by DreamCatcher Interactive. At the end of 2004 \"Painkiller\" was chosen by the Cyberathlete Professional League to be their official 2005 CPL World Tour game. This was slightly controversial with many e-sports followers and competitors due to the fact that other games had proven themselves at least as popular online multiplayer games. As the tour had already been announced as a one-on-one deathmatch format competition, \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" and \"Doom 3\" were also fan favourites for this tour. However, since \"Unreal Tournament 2004\" developer Epic Games was in the process of changing publishers from Atari to Midway Games and could not guarantee their full support throughout the year-long tour, it was not chosen. An agreement between the CPL and DreamCatcher stipulated that no other organization was allowed to use \"Painkiller\" in a gaming competition with prizes above 2,000. without obtaining a license from the CPL. For the 2006 CPL World Tour, \"Quake III Arena\" was selected as the one-versus-one deathmatch game, replacing \"Painkiller\".\n\n\"Battlefield\" series games have been played in multiple tournaments. The PC version of the games are usually used. Electronic Sports League has sponsored \"Battlefield\" tournaments since \"Battlefield 2\".\n\n\"CrossFire\" is a Korean-developed shooter similar to \"Counter-Strike\" that is most popular in East Asia. CrossFire Stars is the name of the highest professional league.\n\n\"Overwatch\" has attracted attention as an esports title including teams being picked up by professional teams. Blizzard Entertainment has founded an official Overwatch League for professional, salaried players.\n\n\"Team Fortress 2\" is a class-based shooter that has been played in several online leagues, notably ESEA League, RGL, UGC League, ETF2L, Ozfortress and Asiafortress in a 6vs6 format and a Highlander League 9vs9 format. The game has made appearances at DreamHack due to support from Razer Arena Team Fortress 2 has also held annual international LAN events at the Multiplay Insomnia Gaming Festival during the summer since 2012.\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is the first esports game in the series. Official competitions of Rainbows Six Siege is Rainbow Six Pro League run by ESL and Ubisoft..\nRecently ESL hosted the Rainbow Six Siege ESL pro league season 8, in which G2 Esports crowned the season 8 winners.\n\n\"Alliance of Valiant Arms\" (A.V.A) was a first-person shooter most popular in Asia. Developer Aeria Games sponsored a world championship, and there were also some other independent offline events held. The game has recently shut down, but a sequal (Alliance of Valiant Arms: DOG TAG) is currently in the works which will feature E-Sports.\n\n\"Special Force II\" has the Special Force II Pro League in Taiwan run by the Taiwan esports League, as well as events organized by Electronic Sports League in Europe.\n\nCompetitions involving traditional real time strategy games generally feature individual competitors competing on personal computers over a local area network or the internet. While not nearly as popular as other RTS games during this period, the \"Age of Empires\" series was played competitively as well, and was part of the World Cyber Games from 2000-2003, and 2007-2008.\n\n\"StarCraft\" was used at several tournaments including the Professional Gamers League. However, its expansion pack \"StarCraft: Brood War\" was far more popular than the original.\n\n\"\" was foundational in the establishment of e-sports, and along with \"StarCraft II\", remains among the most popular series in competitive gaming. \"StarCraft\" competitions did especially well in South Korea, which remains central to the competitive scene as a whole. Professionals in Korea achieved a status similar to professional athletes. In the west, \"StarCraft\" enjoyed significantly less competitive popularity. \"StarCraft\" was the very first game to have been accepted into the World Cyber Games tournament, and had a tournament at their events every year until it was replaced by \"StarCraft II\" in 2011. In Korea, prominent \"StarCraft\" competitions included the Ongamenet Starleague, the MBCGame StarCraft League, and Proleague. Finals for these league attracted tens of thousands of fans, and became very popular on Korean cable TV.\n\n\"Warcraft III\" has been played professionally all around the world, especially in South Korea, China, France, and Germany. Although the game never achieved the same competitive popularity of the original \"StarCraft\", the game supported a few dozen professional teams. The game lacks a singular world championship, as there have been numerous large tournaments. Events have been organized by Blizzard Entertainment, have also been televised Korean leagues, and large tournaments have been held in China. Chinese players generally have used their own clients for online competition, due to a poor connection to the outside world. Notable \"Warcraft III\" players include: Xiaofeng \"Sky\" Li, Dae Hui \"FoV\" Cho, Jang \"Moon\" Jae Ho, Fredrik \"MaDFroG\" Johansson and Manuel \"Grubby\" Schenkhuizen. In more recent times, Warcraft III competition has declined in popularity. Many professional \"Warcraft III\" players have since moved to \"Starcraft II\", including Grubby and Moon. Despite this, \"Warcraft III\" continues to be played competitively, still appearing in events such as WCG 2013.\n\nAfter its release in 2010, \"StarCraft II\" competitions gradually replaced the prior \"Brood War\" competitions. For example, \"StarCraft II\" has replaced the original game in the WCG, and the initially \"Brood War\"-focused Proleague mixed \"StarCraft II\" into their competitions, before finally phasing out \"Brood War\" entirely. Initially, disagreements between Blizzard and Kespa prevented many players in Korea from moving to \"StarCraft II\", but conditions improved, and were ultimately resolved by 2012.\n\nMany leagues and e-sports organizations in Korea and across the world host \"StarCraft II\" tournaments, including the Team Liquid StarLeague, Major League Gaming, North American Star League, DreamHack, the Intel Extreme Masters and the GOMTV Global Starcraft II League.\n\nIn 2012, Blizzard Entertainment created the \"StarCraft II\" World Championship Series. In the tournament's initial 2012 season, Korean player PartinG beat Creator to win the $100,000 grand prize. As of 2013, the WCS system divides players into three leagues: WCS Korea, WCS Europe, and WCS North America. Players earn points based on their performance in many different tournaments, including the ones mentioned above, and the 16 players with the most points advance to world championship at BlizzCon. In the 2013 grand finals, sOs beat the crowd favorite Jaedong 4-1, winning the $100,000 grand prize. The 2nd-place finish for Jaedong awarded him $45,000, making his total prizepool earnings $489,384.83, the highest of any esports player at that time.\n\n\"FIFA Football\" is a generally individual competition available on consoles as well as PCs. FIFA has been an official game of the World Cyber Games since its first tournament in 2001. In 2003, a FIFA tournament was also held at the first event of CPL Europe. Germany has the biggest \"FIFA Football\" community, hosting leagues such as the Electronic Sports League and the World League eSport Bundesliga (which was aired on the national TV-broadcaster \"Deutsches Sportfernsehen\" before the league's cessation). There are also leagues in South Korea like the Ongamenet FifaLeague that are televised. The ESL continues to host FIFA competitions into 2013, as does the ESWC.\n\nFurthermore, the FIFA Interactive World Cup (FIWC) is the world's largest video game tournament and with that the biggest FIFA tournament there is. The virtual football world championship is organised annually by FIFA and its presenting partner EA Sports. The inaugural FIWC took place in Zurich in 2004 and since then enabled millions of football fans from all around the world to fight for the world champion title. The tournament is played on the latest console generations of Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nThe \"Madden NFL\" series of American football games has been used as esports. Game developer Electronic Arts sponsored a $1 million \"Madden NFL 17\" Championship Series. The television series \"Madden Nation\" was an American reality television show, created as a joint effort between EA SPORTS and ESPN Original Entertainment and focused on the competitive scene of \"Madden\".\n\nIn February 2017, the National Basketball Association, in conjunction with Take-Two Interactive, announced the creation of an esports league centering on the \"NBA 2K\" franchise. Known as the \"NBA 2K eLeague\", it is set to commence competition in 2018.\n\nPES League is the official competition series of \"Pro Evolution Soccer\" run by Konami. In 2016 and 2017, the PES League final competition was held together with UEFA Champions League finals.\n\n\"Rocket League\" competitions have been run by Twitch.tv, Psyonix Studios, ESL and Major League Gaming as well as other independent tournaments. The $100,000 2v2 Rocket League tournament will kick off in July through the online competitive gaming platform, FaceIt, and move onto regional finals through select NBC Sports regional networks including New England, the Bay Area, and other non-NBC regional networks around the world — a first for Rocket League. The grand finals in August will be broadcast on NBC Sports Network in the U.S. and on Syfy in a handful of other countries. \nRSHL competitions have been running since 1998, making this online hockey league one of the oldest sport based esports on the net. Currently RSHL Season 25 is being played using a Waiver-based team system. Recent years competitions have been aired on both YouTube and Twitch.tv. Although most teams and seasons have been strictly amateur, various paid players and performance based pay teams have competed over the years to try and win the coveted \"Blackie\" cup. Most league players have 1000s of hours of experience giving the game a very competitive atmosphere.\n\nNASCAR hosts an affiliated annual video game competition since 2010 known as the NASCAR iRacing.com World Championship Series, which had a grand prize of $10,500 USD in 2011.\n\n\"Project CARS\" has become an official esport with the Electronic Sports League and has become a success.\n\n\"TrackMania\" is a racing game franchise developed by Nadeo, and has been an esport since 2006. The majority of the competition on this game are played in TrackMania 2: Stadium, and many tournaments have taken place since then. Until 2015, TrackMania 2: Stadium even had a world cup which took place every year, and the game still has important tournaments with price pools sometimes exceeding US$10,000.\n\nMultiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games are historically a spin-off of real-time strategy games, but are different enough that they are now generally considered a separate genre. While traditional RTS games feature many units controlled by a single player, MOBAs are typically team focused, the model being five players on a team, each controlling a single \"hero\" unit. MOBAs are generally played on personal computers.\n\nThe \"Dota\" franchise began as a fan-made \"\" mod named \"Defense of the Ancients\" (\"DotA\"), released in 2003. The popularity of the original mod, both in casual and competitive play, encouraged Valve Corporation to create a stand-alone sequel, \"Dota 2\". Together, the two games are amongst the most popular electronic sports games played professionally. These titles have been featured at major international tournaments, including DreamHack, as well as the World Cyber Games and ESWC events. Valve hosted \"Dota 2\"'s public debut in 2011 at The International, which featured a USD$1 million grand prize. In 2012, Valve hosted The International 2012, which also had a million dollar grand prize. The following two internationals set records for having the largest esports prize pool at the time. The International 2015 boasted a prize pool that totalled over $18 million USD, making it the largest esports prize pool for a single tournament until it got surpassed by The International 2016, which boasted a prize pool that totalled over $20 million USD.\n\nEarly in the development of \"Dota 2\", Valve was legally opposed by Riot Games and Blizzard Entertainment, both of which voiced their opinions that the \"DotA\" name should have remained a community asset. In August 2010, Riot filed an opposing trademark for \"DotA\", in order to \"protect the work that dozens of authors have done to create the game\". Valve subsequently won the case, but was opposed by Blizzard, who filed a trademark with similar reasoning. In May 2012, Blizzard and Valve announced that the dispute had been settled, with Valve retaining the commercial franchising rights to the term \"Dota\", while non-commercial usage of the name could still be used. By July 2016, \"Dota 2\" tournaments had awarded roughly $65 million in prize money altogether, with 12 players winning over $1 million each.\n\n\"League of Legends\" (\"LoL\") is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games, primarily inspired by \"Defense of the Ancients\". It was released on October 27, 2009. In an early \"LoL\" tournament, the game was featured as a promotional title in the 2010 World Cyber Games in Los Angeles. The victors were the Counter Logic Gaming team from North America, winning a $7,000 prize. \"LoL\" was added to the Intel Extreme Masters lineup for the 2011 Electronic Sports League season. The Season 1 World Championships were held at DreamHack Summer 2011 in Sweden. The European team Fnatic defeated teams from Europe and the USA to win US$50,000 of the tournament's US$100,000 prize pool.

It had been in the family since 1834 and because of the globe on the left it was assumed to be a double portrait of Joan Blaeu (1596-1673) and his wife Geertruid Vermeulen (died 1676). The next year it was determined the couple was clearly too old at the time to be the youthful newlyweds portrayed in the painting, and it was speculated that they were therefore the son of Blaeu, Willem Blaeu II (1635-1685) and his wife Anna van Loon (1638-1680), though their ages didn't match either. Since the bust of Laurens Janszoon Coster features quite prominently above their portraits and De Bray himself was a Haarlem painter whose brother Dirck made engravings for the Casteleyn printing firm until he left town in 1678, it was finally correctly catalogued upon the discovery of a drawn self-portrait by Casteleyn in the North Holland Archives.

{"id": "571815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571815", "title": "Rokurokubi", "text": "Rokurokubi\n\nThe rokurokubi (ろくろ首, 轆轤首) is a type of Japanese \"yōkai\" (apparition). They look almost completely like humans, with one major difference. There are two types of Rokurokubi: one whose neck stretches, and one whose head comes off and flies around freely (\"nukekubi\"). The Rokurokubi appear in classical \"kaidan\" (spirit tales) and in yōkai works. It has been suggested, however, that the idea of rokurokubi may have been created purely for entertainment purposes rather than originating from any folk beliefs or legends.\n\nThe word \"rokurokubi\" may have derived from the word \"rokuro\" which refers to a potter's wheel, a water well's pulley (since it elongates). or an umbrella handle (which also elongates).\n\nThe nukekubi are rokurokubi whose heads come off and float about. These were the first rokurokubi, whereas the other kind came afterwards. Nukekubi sometimes perform bad deeds such as attacking at night and drinking their victims' blood. It's theorized that the nukekubi has a weakness when it is sleeping and the head is floating around: if the body moves, then the head cannot be re-united to the body. Classical literature about rokurokubi describe tales of people witnessing and encountering floating heads at night time.\n\nSometimes, the action of the head separating from the body is seen as the soul wandering away from the body i. e. somnambulism. For example, in the \"Sorori Monogatari\" (曾呂利物語, 1663 CE), in the chapter, \"A Woman's Wild Thoughts Wandering Around\" (女の妄念迷ひ歩く事, \"Onna no Mōnen Mayoiaruku Koto\") the head separating from the body interpreted to be the woman's soul wandering while asleep. In the same book, a man saw a nukekubi that changed into a chick and a woman's head, so he took his sword and chased the head. The head fled into a home, and people said that they heard a voice from inside say, \"I had a scary dream. I was chased by a man with a sword. I ran away all the way back home, and then I woke up.\" (refer to picture).\n\nA similar story appears in Shokoku Hyaku Monogatari (諸国百物語, 1677 CE), which drew a lot of inspiration from the Sorori Monogatari. In \"About Rokurokubi in the Province of Echizen\" (ゑちぜんの国府中ろくろ首の事, \"Echizen no Kuni Fuchū Rokurokubi no Koto\"), there's the story of a man who chases a nukekubi (who was a woman's soul detached from her body) all the way home. It's said that the woman had been shamed by a crime she has committed, so as a result, she left her husband, shaved her hair, and committed suicide.\n\n\"Hokusō Sadan\" (北窻瑣談, 1910 CE) is an Edo period essay by Tachibana Nankei (橘春暉). Here too, it was interpreted to be an illness resulting in a detaching soul. The story goes: in the first year of Kansei, in Echigo Province (now Fukui Prefecture), there was a house maidservant whose head rolled off the pillow while she was asleep, detached from the body. Later in the story, it was explained that it was not really the head, but rather the soul making the appearance of a head.\n\nIn \"Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hyōban\" (古今百物語評判, 1686 CE), a book of ghost stories that explains yōkai tales by Yamaoka Genrin, there is a chapter called \"How Priest Zetsugan saw Rokurokubi in Higo\" (絶岸和尚肥後にて轆轤首を見給ふ事, \"Zetsugan Oshō Higo nite Rokurokubi wo Mitamou Koto\"). In Higo Province (now Kumamoto Prefecture), the head of an innkeeper's wife leaves her body and floats in the air. It returned to normal the next day, but there was a line around her neck. The author made references to examples from Chinese books, and then commented, \"as these kinds of things were often seen in South-East Asia, not just limited to the creation of the heaven and earth, it is difficult to fathom them with ordinary common sense such as the idea that octopi do not have eyes, and as these things are unheard of in the capital, everything strange is in faraway lands.\" In the same book, there is a story which tells of a woman in the village of Tawa, Nagao, Ōkawa District, Kagawa Prefecture (now Sanuki) who is a rokurokubi and has a ring-like bruise around her neck.\n\nIn the \"Churyō Manroku\" (中陵漫録) is a tale which describes a \"Rokurokubi Village\" in the recesses of Mount Yoshino where all the residents, even children, wore scarves to cover a line around their necks.\n\nIn the \"Kasshi Yawa\" (甲子夜話, ca. 1821 CE) by Matsura Seizan is a story which tells of a woman in Hitachi Province who has a terminal illness. A peddler has told her husband that the liver of a white dog will cure her. The husband kills the pet dog and gives his wife the dog's liver as a medicant. The woman is cured but her next born daughter is a rokurokobi. When the roukorkobi's head detached and flew in the air, the white dog appeared, bit the head and killed the rokurokobi.\n\nAlthough rokurokubi and nukekubi are usually female, in \"Shousai Hikki\" (蕉斎筆記), an Edo period tale, there is a nukekubi that is male. A priest is sleeping in his temple when a head appeared and approached his chest. He grabs it and throws it away and it left. In the morning, the manservant asks to take leave, and when asked why, the manservant asks, \"did a head come visit last night?\" The priest answered yes, the manservant then explained that \"I have the nukekubi illness, and I fear it will interfere with my work too much from now on.\" The manservant went away to his home in Shimōsa Province where this \"illness\" was thought to be common.\n\nIn the essay \"Mimibukuro\" by Negishi Shizumori, a woman who was rumored to be a rokurokubi is married but manages to lives well since the rumor was nothing more than a rumor. She was not actually a rokurokubi so she achieved a happy ending, which is unusual for tales about rokurokubi because bad fortune almost always results when the true identity of a rokurokubi is discovered.\n\nIn the Edo period encyclopedia, \"Wakan Sansai Zue\" Rokuokubi like creatures from Chinese lore are described. They are written as 飛頭蛮 meaning \"flying head barbarians\". They use their ears like wings and they eat insects. The ones from China and Japan were believed to be foreigners. The foreigner nukekubi also appears in \"Rokurokubi\" by Lafcadio Hearn. In his story, the spirits masquerade as a family of woodcutters from the city who kill and eat travellers.\n\nStarting in the Edo period, tales were written about people's necks stretching when they were asleep. Examples of these tales are \"Buya Zokuda\" (武野俗談), \"Kanden Kōhitsu\" (閑田耕筆) and \"Yasō Kidan\" (夜窓鬼談).\n\nIt's thought that the idea of an extending neck originated from people misinterpreting visual depictions of nukekubi, the earlier kind of rokurokubi. There was the idea that nukekubi had a string attaching the head to the body, and when this string was depicted in visual depictions, people misinterpted this string as an elongated neck.\n\nIn the \"Kasshi Yawa\" (甲子夜話), there is a tale which tells of a female servant with a pale face who is suspected to be a rokurokubi. One night, her master checks on her while she is sleeping and sees something like steam gradually rise from her chest. The steam becomes thick and obscures her head and then suddenly it appears as though her neck has risen up and stretched. Perhaps due to being surprised from seeing her master, the girl stirs, turns over and her neck returned to normal. This servant had a pale face, but otherwise looked completely normal, but despite this, she was fired and in fact has had trouble staying in any job, always being fired shortly after being employed. For the soul to leave the body and create the shape of a neck, as seen in this story and the before mentioned Hokusō Sadan, is sometimes interpreted to be \"ectoplasm\" in parapsychology.\n\nIn the late Edo period \"yomihon\" (illustrated novel), \"Rekkoku Kaidan Kikigaki Zōshi\" (列国怪談聞書帖) by Jippensha Ikku the author suggests the elongated necks of rokurokubi originate in the spiritual principle, \"karma\". In Ikku's work, \"Kaishin\", a monk from Enshū and a woman called Oyotsu elope together. However, when Oyatsu collapsed from an illness, they ran out of money, so he killed her. When Kaishin eventually returned to secular life, he slept with a girl he met at an inn. When they sleep together, the girl's neck stretched and her face becomes that of Oyotsu, who then told him about her resentment. Kaishin felt regretful his actions and proceeded to tell Oyatsu's father everything. The girl's father then told Kaishin that he has also killed a woman before. He stole her money and with it, he opened his inn. He had a daughter was born soon after who, due to karma, became a rokurokubi. Kaishin then reentered the priesthood. He built a grave for Oyotsu, said to be the Rokurokubi no Tsuka (Rokurokubi Mound), which told the story to future generations.\n\nIn some stories, rokurokubi are not a yōkai, but rather people who have an affliction that affects the body. For example, the Edo period author Ban Kōkei in his work \"Kanden Kōhitsu\" told a tale of a geisha at the Yoshiwara brothel whose neck would elongate in her sleep. It stated that her neck stretched to due her \"heart becoming loose\"\n\nRokurokobi are also appear in the oral tradition of Japanese myths. For example, there is a myth about an old highway between the villages of Iwa and Akechi in Gifu Prefecture where it is said that a snake shapeshifted into a rokurokubi. Another example is a myth from the oral tradition of Koikubo area of Iida, Nagano Prefecture where it is said a rokurokubi appeared in someone's home.\n\nIn the Bunka period, a kaidan story became popular, where there was a prostitute whose neck would smoothly stretch and would lick the oil of paper lanterns when she slept with guests, showing how rokurokubi were spoken of as things that women would transform into or an illness that they would be afflicted with. In this period, rokurokubi were also popular in freak shows. The \"Shohō Kenbunroku\" (諸方見聞録) records a freak show in 1810 (Bunka 7) in Edo, now Tokyo where a male rokurokubi with an elongated neck appeared.\n\nTales of rokurokubi appeared even in the early Meiji period. There was a tale of how a merchant and his wife from Shibaya town, Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture who witnessed their daughter's neck stretch every night. Despite their supplications in Shinto and Buddhism, their daughter did not get better, and eventually the whole town came to know about it. The couple couldn't bear it anymore, so they left, leaving no clues as to where they went.\n\nThe rokurokubi is also a kind of Japanese magic show tricks using curtains and life sized dolls without heads. It's reported that a doll without a head wearing a kimono in seiza is put in front of the curtain. There's a rope behind the curtain and a female performer connected to it who shows only her face. As she stands and squats, the fake neck would stretches and contracts, as if it were a rokurokubi.\n\nExplanations and pictures about what's behind this trick were written in magazines of the Meiji period (1800s), giving a date for how early these shows first appeared. This was a time period when mystery phenomena were vigorously exposed by the scientifically minded, so for magic tricks to be revealed is fitting with the zeitgeist.\n\nIn the Taishō period, there were businesses arranging rokurokubi to appear in show tents in festivals and fairs at temples and shrines, and they were quite popular.\n\nThe type of rokurokubi whose necks separate from the rest of the body is said to have derived from stories of the Chinese yōkai, the \"hitōban\" (飛頭蛮) a yōkai whose head separates from the body and floats about. Like the rokurokobi, the hitoban has a line around its neck. Chinese stories also tell of a yōkai called a \"rakutō\" (落頭) whose head comes off and floats about while the torso remains at rest on the futon. There is a tale that in the Three Kingdoms period, an Eastern Wu general, Zhu Huan employed a female servant who was a rakutō. It's said that she used its ears like wings. Another tale relates that in the Qin era, there was a clan from the south called \"rakutōmin\" (落頭民) who could fly around in only their heads.\n\nThere are legends of creatures including Palasik, Kuyang, and Leak from Indonesia, Penanggalan in Malaysia, and Krasue in Thailand. The heads of these creatures would separate from the body and float about with the entrails attached.\n\nThe Chonchon is a mythical creature of South America which takes the form of a human head flying around in the air, sucking the life out of people.\n\nThe Manananggal is a creature of Philippines mythology. This female monster is slightly different since its whole body from the waist up detaches and grows giant bat-like wings.\n\nThe yōkai researcher, Tada Katsumi states that these stories arrived in Japan in the Muromachi to Azuchi-Momoyama periods, when there was still trade with southern China and Southeast Asia. In the Edo period, when Japan adopted an isolationist policy an original Japanese yōkai, the \"rokurokubi\" evolved.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36764580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36764580", "title": "School of Posillipo", "text": "School of Posillipo\n\nThe School of Posillipo refers to a loose group of landscape painters, based in the waterfront Posillipo neighborhood of Naples, Italy. While some among them became academicians, it was not a formal school or association.\n\nIn the 18th century, landscape painting or vedute had emerged as a profitable, and respectable, style of painting. Landscapes were, in part, higher in demand than depictions of Catholic religious imagery to buyers from Protestant Europe during the Age of the Enlightenment. This included the mainly aristocratic travellers on a grand tour of Southern Europe. Items in demand by travellers were paintings evoking memories of the place, playing the role that photographic postcards now fill. Pietro Fabris, for example, had created views of Pompeii and the Volcanic fields surrounding Vesuvius and Etna. In Venice, Canaletto and the Guardi for example, had depicted mainly urban vistas of the waterlogged city. Vanvitelli, Panini, and Belloto adapted these styles to different urbanscapes in Italy and abroad. Their styles were realistic, and Canaletto was said to use a camara obscura.\n\nSuch detailed realism, however, was rarely applied to natural scenery. There was a tradition in Italy of landscape painting dating to the Baroque 17th century with Claude Lorrain in Rome and Salvatore Rosa in Rome and Naples as two distinct trends. Lorrain's landscapes were lush and imagined, and still often anchored in classical stories using subsidiary figures. Rosa painted tempestuous short range arrangements of natural elements, a craggy hillock with perilously perched trees.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century in Naples, the premier representative of landscape painters was the Dutch emigree Jacob Philipp Hackert (1737–1807), the court painter of Ferdinand IV, who seem to be following the tradition of Lorrain. His paintings had a stock arrangement of a nearby tree in a pastoral hill or mountainside, and with distant ruins or a recognizable mountain in the background. Volcano-ridden southern Campania and Sicily had such distinctive peaks. The fortunes of Hackert suffered with the rise of the Napoleonic Neoclassicism and the deposition of the Bourbon kingdom of two Sicilies by the French.\n\nIn 1815, the painter Anton Sminck Pitloo, (1790–1837) was coaxed to move to Naples. He opened a studio in the Chiaia neighborhood. he preferred to paint outdoors with natural lighting. Posillipo at one end of the crescent shape bay of Naples, was a natural spot that allowed the painters to paint both buildings and water. Some say he was influenced by the visits of Turner (1819–1820) and Corot to Naples, but in general, Pitloo's paintings are devoid of passionate political or social imagery Pitloo's favorite vedute was painted out of doors, not in the studio; and was a view of the crescentic Neapolitan shore from his vantage point from the peninsula of Posillipo. In this way his canvas scene included water, the bustling shoreline and docks, and the land across the bay. The vista while somewhat idyllic romanticism; there was also the encroachment of the daily activities of sailors, fisherman, and their families.\n\nLike Hackert before him, Pitloo became a professor at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Naples, and was able to influence fellow painters and pupils such as Carl Götzloff, Giacinto Gigante, Teodoro Duclere, Gabriele Smargiassi, Vincenzo Franceschini, Achille Vianelli, and Consalvo Carelli. Many of the works of these painter from circa 1820 to circa 1850 are known as products of the \"School of Posillipo\". Other painters influence by this school are Salvatore Fergola, a pupil of Hackert. In time, the lessening of the demands for accuracy and a greater attention to the mood of the painting during the age of Romanticism, led to more impressionist styles found in post-1850s Tuscan school of Macchiaioli (who also painted out of doors), or in the School of Resina represented by painters such as Guglielmo Ciardi.\nThe most prominent of Pitloo's students was Giacinto Gigante (1806–1876), who started his career working for the Neapolitan Royal Topographic Office. Gigante had observed the use of a camara lucida in the studio of Swiss-German artist, Jakob Wilhelm Hüber (1787–1871), who used camara lucida. He also worked with watercolors. He collaborated with Cuciniello and Bianchi in landscapes collected in a book titled \"Viaggio pittorico nel Regno delle Due Sicilie\" (Pictorial journey through the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies). Gigante befriended Sylvester Shchedrin, and through him also obtained commissions from the Russian aristocracy. Like Pitloo before him, Gigante he was appointed chief of design at the Neapolitan Academy. Giuseppe and Filippo Palizzi (1818–1899) were briefly pupils of Gigante, but soon fell under the influence of the Barbizon School, who in turn were to influence Domenico Morelli\n"}

She is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, she was a 2005 Fellow in Film of the New York Foundation for the Arts. She is also a teacher, having taught animation at the Pratt Institute from 2000 to 2002.\n\nSigne Baumane was born in Auce, Latvia, and grew up in Tukums, Latvia and Sakhalin Island. She was married to Yuriy Gavrilenko, an artist and impresario, and Lasse Persson, a Swedish animator. She began writing for publication at the age of 14. She attended Moscow University and graduated in 1989 with a BA in Philosophy.\n\nShe began working as an animator in 1989, taking a position as animator at Dauka Animation Studio. Over the next several years, local television aired several animated commercials that Baumane had designed and directed. In 1991 she produced her first animated film, \"The Witch and the Cow\", of which she was the scriptwriter, director, designer, and animator.\n\nFollowing a two-year stint as a children's book illustrator in Moscow, she returned to animation, illustration and stage design in 1993 in Riga. She relocated to New York City in September 1995, finding work with Bill Plympton as production manager, color stylist, and cel painter the following January.\n\nIn 1998 she resumed work as an independent animator, making several films. Two of these, \"Woman\" and \"Veterinarian\" were made during visits to Latvia. The remainder were made in New York City.\n\nSigne has initiated and curated a number of independent animation programs and along with Patrick Smith and Bill Plympton is the organizing core of \"Square Footage Films\", a group of New York independent animators that self-publishes and distributes DVDs of their own work.\nBesides doing animation, Baumane is a fine artist, and has produced numerous paintings and sculptures, and has also worked as an illustrator for children's books.\n\nHer films have been screened at important film festivals such as Annecy, Tribeca, Sundance, Berlin, Ottawa, Venice and they have received numerous awards. In 2017, Baumane was awarded a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship for her exceptional creative ability in the arts.\n\nBaumane's animation \"Rocks in My Pockets\" is a feature-length autobiographical animation that explores the depression that has haunted three generations of women in her family. \"Rocks in My Pockets\" was selected as the Latvian entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards but was not nominated.\n\nThe project received early funding from NYSCA, The Jerome Foundation, and Women Make Movies, the project's fiscal sponsor. In 2013 after two years of working on the project Baumane and team raised another $50,000 on Kickstarter.\n\nSigne is currently directing and animating her second animated feature film, \"\", which will infuse music and science into a personal love story. The film will examine the biological chemistry of love and gender, as well as societal pressures on an individual to conform to the social mores of the times.\n\nAfter receiving a development grant from NYSCA, through Women Make Movies, the project then raised over $132,000 through Kickstarter to fund production. As of summer 2017, all of the voice actors have been recorded and the film's soundtrack has been completed, and animation has begun, in a partnership with Locomotive Productions, based in Latvia.\n\nThe voice cast is scheduled to include Dagmara Dominczyk, Matthew Modine, Cameron Monaghan, Stephen Lang, Erica Schroeder, Emma Kenney, and Michele Pawk in key roles.\n\nBaumane mainly utilizes a personal narration over a flat 2D hand-drawn cel-shaded style of animation. In her feature film, Rocks in My Pockets, she combined papier-mâché and stop-motion with traditional animations.\n\nHer work tackles difficult subjects such as sex, pregnancy and depression and makes it palatable through irony and humor. Her narrative style uses visual metaphors to communicate how living people feel inside; one example is in her animated short Birth her use of the body as a vessel in her film. Baumane's \"Teat Beat of Sex\", a series of semi fictionalized personal recollections that stem from the artist's firsthand experience and an array of viewpoints on the subject, are uncompromisingly yet refreshingly candid, oftentimes dealing with somewhat taboo areas that can serve as discussion points.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, Jr. promoting certain conspiracy theories concerning the 1865 assassination of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe central premise of the book is that \"traditional\" historians have perpetuated a cover-up, originally orchestrated by Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton(D) and some Radical Republican allies in 1865, by over-reliance on false documentation produced by Stanton and his conspirators. This was done, the book argues, to disguise the fact that Stanton, Union spy Lafayette C. Baker, Senator Benjamin F. Wade, Senator John Conness, other congressional Radical Republicans, and a group of Northern bankers and speculators were all involved in a plot to kidnap Lincoln. Lincoln was then intended to be hidden for a time while bogus articles of impeachment would be drafted to remove him as President. The primary motivations for this supposed plot would have been strong opposition to Lincoln's generous Reconstruction plans and the loss of profits due to Lincoln's restrictions on the cotton trade during the U.S. Civil War.\n\nThe book then states that in 1864, Baker uncovered the plans of Lincoln's future assassin, John Wilkes Booth, to kidnap Lincoln with the help of a different group of conspirators with different motives. The Stanton group, through Baker and Conness, supposedly provided Booth with money and information on Lincoln's movements. After several abortive attempts, Booth was ordered to halt his efforts in March 1865, and made no further attempts to kidnap Lincoln, but secretly resolved to murder him instead, the book alleges.\n\nLincoln's assassination by Booth on April 14 is said to have thrown Stanton and his allies into a panic, fearing that their involvement in the kidnap plots would be exposed. A frantic search soon turned up Booth's coat, which contained a highly incriminating diary documenting meetings with several members of the Stanton group. A few days later on April 26, a Confederate double agent (James William Boyd), mistakenly identified as Booth, was shot and killed in Virginia, according to the authors. Stanton, aware of the mistaken identity, allegedly saw to it that the autopsy records were altered to remove or obscure descriptions of the body not consistent with Booth. Booth's diary, now in Stanton's personal possession, is said to have had 13 pages of incriminating references removed. Baker quietly pursued the hunt for Booth as far as Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, where the trail went cold.\n\nAt the military trials of Booth's conspirators (theorized to not have been members of the Stanton group), held in May and June 1865, the proceedings were rushed, the government produced witnesses against the defendants who the authors suggest were paid, and even the trial records were supposedly altered. Four of Booth's co-conspirators were hanged on July 7, 1865. Others received long prison sentences, but Booth himself, the book concludes, eventually escaped to England, his whereabouts after that uncertain.\n\n\"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" was greeted with hostility and derision from academic historians. Many objections were raised against the book's sensational theories and the authors' use (and misuse) of source materials. \"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" is often considered a form of negationist or even alternate history.\n\n\"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" was the basis of the 1977 film of the same name by Sunn Classic Pictures, the publishing division of which also released the book.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France.\n\nCourbet painted \"The Painter's Studio\" in Ornans, France in 1855. \"The world comes to be painted at my studio,\" said Courbet of the Realist work. The figures in the painting are allegorical representations of various influences on Courbet's artistic life. On the left are human figures from all levels of society. In the center, Courbet works on a landscape, while turned away from a nude model who is a symbol of Academic art. On the right are friends and associates of Courbet, mainly elite Parisian society figures, including Charles Baudelaire, Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Courbet's most prominent patron, Alfred Bruyas.\n\nThe 1855 Paris World Fair's jury accepted eleven of Courbet's works for the Exposition Universelle, but \"The Painter's Studio\" was not among them. In an act of self promotion and defiance, Courbet, with the help of Alfred Bruyas, opened his own exhibition (The Pavilion of Realism) close to the official exposition; this was a forerunner of the various Salon des Refusés. Very little praise was forthcoming, and Eugène Delacroix was one of the few painters who supported the work. Of the painting, Courbet stated that \"The Painter's Studio\" \"represents society at its best, its worst, and its average.\"\n\nThe painting was produced during Courbet's involvement with Realism in art in the mid-1800s. Due to the short amount of time Courbet had to paint it, many original plans for the work had to be discarded. The most noticeable example of this is in the background of the painting. On the back wall of the studio in the painting, Courbet planned to paint replications of other works of his. He ran out of time to paint these in their entirety, so he then covered them up with a reddish-brown preparation color, leaving the partially-finished paintings still relatively visible.\n\nThe left side of the painting depicts people of everyday life in France. The Jewish man and the Irishwoman were seen on a trip Courbet took to London in 1848, according to a letter Courbet wrote to Champfleury detailing what the painting would look like. There is also a \"lay figure\"/\"crucified figure\" directly to the left of Courbet's easel. This figure appears contorted and potentially mangled. Art historians Benedict Nicolson and Georges Riat both interpret this figure as a symbol of the \"death\" of the art of the Royal Academy of Art in France.\n\nThe center of the painting depicts Courbet painting a landscape, a nude female figure, a young boy, and a white cat. On his canvas, Courbet paints the Loue River valley. This valley in the Franche-Comté region of France is a tribute to Courbet's homeland of Ornans, France. The female figure is based on an 1854 photograph by J. V. de Villeneuve and has been interpreted as a representation of the art of the Academy or as Courbet's Muse for Realism.\n\nThe right side of the painting depicts a large number of Paris elites, including friends of the artist. These are figures who played a role in the development of Courbet's career as an artist, or who inspired him in some way. Portrayals included on this side of the painting include Alfred Bruyas (a patron of Courbet), Champfleury, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Charles Baudelaire, and a wealthy pair of art collectors, among other prominent society figures. A majority of these portraits were copied from previous portraits or from photographs, since the painting was entirely made in Ornans but the subjects on this side of the painting resided in Paris. For example, the portrait of Charles Baudelaire was directly copied from Courbet's 1847 portrait of the writer. Courbet was in written correspondence with Champfleury in regards to this painting (from which much of the interpretation of \"The Painter's Studio\" is derived) and requested a photograph of Proudhon, the philosopher and anarchist, so that he could be included in the painting. It is the photograph Courbet received from Champfleury on which Proudhon's portrait is based.\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

The book documents Radford's five-year investigation into accounts of the chupacabra. The chupacabra is said to be a vampiric predatory animal that drains the blood of animal victims while avoiding human detection.\n\nThe author, Benjamin Radford, attempts to solve the mystery of the chupacabra, including whether it is a legend or real animal, what its physical and behavior characteristics are, its origin and connection to folklore, and what exactly is happening to the animals reported to be its victims.\n\n\"Tracking the Chupacabra\" documents Radford's five-year investigation, including his travels into the mysteries surrounding the chupacabra. It also includes his research, with interviews and documentation collected during this process.\n\nOpening with \"The Goatsucker Mystery,\" Radford introduced the essential portions of the chupacabra legend and its different versions, comparing the creatures' characteristics with another, Bigfoot, which he writes is known for leaving large footprints. In his overview Radford summarized theories concerning the origin of the chupacabra, some paranormal or religious in nature, and interviewed several cryptozoologists.\n\nIn \"A Brief history of Vampires,\" Radford wrote about common themes of vampire folklore. While exploring 18th-century accounts of European vampires, Radford notes that reports of vampire predation are used to explain otherwise unexplained misfortunes, such as disease, malnutrition, or loss of livestock. \n\n\"Chupacabras in Popular Culture\" described how, in Radford's view, the legend grew in Puerto Rico from observations by locals of apparent animal predations into rumors of a mysterious creature that was responsible. According to Radford, the news media leapt to conclusions, which, in his opinion, further drove alleged sightings and reports, to the extent that \"any odd event\" was attributed to the chupacabra.\n\nThe chapter \"Searching for Chupacabras in Nicaragua\" deals with Radford's investigation in Nicaragua near the Río San Juan, where one of the best known alleged chupacabra remains had been discovered. While performing a physical search for the animal, Radford interviewed local experts, such as guide Fernando Casanova of Nicaragua's Indio Maiz Biological Reserve, about the local understanding of the chupacabra's \"character or description,\" as well as examining tracks found in the area and comparing them to casts reportedly taken from scenes surrounding chupacabra victims.\n\nIn \"The Dead Vampires Speak: Chupacabra Carcasses,\" Radford discussed the analyses of various recovered corpses put forward as candidates for identification of the chupacabra animal. \"The Curious Case of the Cuero Chupacabra\" covers the analysis of a carcass of the American canid version of the chupacabra, discovered by a rancher in Cuero, Texas. The chapter also discusses Radford's participation in an episode of MonsterQuest, which aired in 2008 during the series' second season. Having analyzed the various forms of chupacabra remains and reports, in \"Reconsidering the Goatsucker,\" Radford attempted to determine the origins of the chupacabra creature.\n\nRadford concluded his investigation with the chapter \"The Zoology of Chupacabras and the Science of Vampires.\" Compiling reports of researchers who examined victims of animal predation in apparent chupacabra attacks, Radford noted that the reports' claims that the animals had been exsanguinated were inaccurate. The apparent loss of blood could be explained by internal hemorrhaging and pooling of blood at the bottom of the corpse. The attribution of the attacks on livestock to a vampiric entity can be explained by the puncture wounds resulting from the canine teeth left by most predators, who often instinctively go for the neck, according to taxidermist Jerry Ayer. Radford attributes much of the spread of chupacabra sightings to factors including the mass media (especially the Internet and television shows), eyewitness misperceptions, ignorance of forensic science, social contagion, and mass hysteria, and concludes that \"every supposedly mysterious detail of the bloodsucking 'monster-thing' and its victims was explained.\"\n\nMatt Crowley, reviewing the book for \"The Skeptical Inquirer\" in July 2011, recapped Radford's process of tracing the origins of reported chupacabra sightings, tracking the changing physical attributes of the creature based on its description as reports journeyed from Puerto Rico eventually traveling to the United States. Crowley praised what he described as the \"elegance\" of Radford's investigation, stating that it \"lies in the process of the proof, not just the result.\"\n\nReviewing \"Tracking the Chupacabra\" for \"Library Journal\", Janet Tapper described Radford as \"thorough in his investigation; interviewing witnesses, providing creepy photographs of otherworldly creatures, serving up DNA analysis, and contemplating theories of mass psychosis.\" Tapper recommended the work, stating \"this objective probe will appeal to readers interested in exploring and exploding modern mysteries.\"\n\nReviewing the book for the \"Journal of Folklore Research\", Memorial University of Newfoundland's Virginia Fugarino stated that \"to date, few books have been dedicated to taking a serious look at this creature,\" and commented on Radford's treatment of folklore, saying \"he particularly explores how the chupacabra and other Latin American vampiric creatures can be seen to represent metaphorically postcolonial concerns and resentment of intrusion from outside political forces, specifically the U.S. government.\" While criticizing Radford for what Fugarino states is an \"at times [...] dismissive tone toward individuals who believe in the creature,\" she stated that the work was \"clear and well presented.\"\n\nThe American Folklore Society invited Radford to speak at its 2011 Annual Meeting, where he presented an abstract, \"The Chupacabra and Folklore.\" At the same meeting, Radford participated in a panel on \"Fairy Animals, Demonic Beasts and Fantastic Creatures in International Tradition I.\"\n\nCryptozoologist Karl Shuker performed a review of Radford's work in a March 2012 issue of \"Fortean Times\", stating that \"the chupacabra has met its match,\" recommending the book's \"scientific detachment and common sense\" for readers looking for those traits.\n\nIn a review for \"Aztlán\", an interdisciplinary journal of Chicano studies published by the University of California, Los Angeles, San Diego State University's William A. Nericcio wrote that \"the power of Radford's work is the depth of his research.\" Nericcio went on to discuss the impact of Radford's investigation on the dialogue regarding the cultural impact of the chupacabra in the Latin American community. According to Nericcio, \"the rise of evangelical churches in Latin America and the American Southwest [...] coincides with sightings of the chupacabra and the virus-like spread of its mythology,\" referring to the perceived connection by some proponents between the chupacabra and satanic or occult phenomena.\n\nA reviewer for \"The Latin Americanist\", the University of Oklahoma's J. Justin Castro noted that chupacabra reports have \"captured the imagination of people around the world,\" and praised Radford's \"insightful and entertaining book,\" stating that \"Radford sets the record straight, debunking many of the myths about the goatsucker.\" While Castro criticized some of Radford's arguments concerning feelings of U.S. exploitation of Puerto Rico as \"largely unfounded,\" Castro stated that \"His concluding arguments, on the other hand, are more viable. He makes a strong case that cinema greatly influenced the chupacabra phenomenon.\"\n\nTim Hull, in \"Tucson Weekly\", stated that \"Radford's most interesting revelations are about the psychological and sociopolitical structures behind the folklore, especially as they relate to the monster's origins in Puerto Rico, where some people believe that the chupacabra is a secret U.S. government experiment gone wrong.\" Hull also went on to say that \"While Radford's book—which is well-written and a fun read—should be the last word on the chupacabra's real-world existence, it won't be. As the author points out, the beast has entered the realm of conspiracy, where no amount of evidence, or logic, can sway the true believer.\"\n\nJay Koester, in \"El Paso Times\", called Radford's book \"[...] an enjoyable ride.\" Koester also went on to say that \"The legend doesn't hold up well under Radford's scientific microscope, but the curious will still love this tour through the tall tales.\"\n\nRosanne Boyett, in the Cibola County Beacon, stated that \"Radford questions documented reports and the resulting conclusions. But the author’s criticisms leave him vulnerable to accusations of racial prejudice, particularly the references to eyewitnesses’ reports.\"\n\nThe staff at \"Fate\" magazine stated that \"[...] Tracking the Chupacabra is by no means another collection of witness accounts and unsubstantiated facts. The author has not only gone on an expedition to find the elusive beast (complete with all the expected disappointment) but has researched just about every reported Chupacabra encounter with the journalistic zeal of Woodward and Bernstein.\"\n\nIn a review for The Skeptics Society, Sharon A. Hill called the book \"[...] satisfying for those willing to consider a legitimate, evidence-based explanation.\" Hill went on to say that \"I’m hard pressed to find any stone unturned in this stunning exposé of the first Internet-age cryptid.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52150731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52150731", "title": "Typometry (printing)", "text": "Typometry (printing)\n\nTypometry was a short-lived relief printing technique developed during the 18th and 19th centuries to compose maps, drawings and other designs, using moveable type to reproduce words, lineworks and map symbols.\n\nDuring the European Renaissance, many engravers and printers revolved to typography to solve the problem of small lettering on maps, which was very difficult to reproduce solely by using custom engraved lettering. One of the techniques they relied on was the setting of metal type, which was fitted inside a special form, surrounded by spacing material. Words set that way could then be overprinted over woodcut-printed maps as a separate plate, either in black or coloured ink. This technique has been considered a precursor of the typometric technique of the 18th century.\n\nIn the 18th century, the German deacon August Gottlieb Preuschen (1734–1803), from Karlsruhe, published two books on the art of printing maps using movable type. The books were printed in Basel, Switzerland, using type from the foundry \"Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei\", by Wilhelm Haas-Münch (1741–1800). Wilhelm Haas-Münch has been quoted as the inventor of typometry in 1776, in competition with Johann Gottlob Breitkopf of Leipzig. The name \"typometrie\" was proposed by August Gottlieb Preuschen himself, the former name of the method being \"ingénieurie d'estampes\" (sic.) (\"engraving's engineering\", in French in the original).\n\nAfter some rudimentary tests by Preuschen, the 1776 map of the Canton of Basel (in \"cuarto\" format) was the first map created by this technique. Some others would follow, such as the 1777 map of Sicily, which features toponyms printed with moveable type as well as roads, coasts, divisions and rivers printed with folding metal filaments. Special moveable topographic symbols mark the mountain ranges of the island, its fortifications, and other landmarks.\n\nThe printer Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf, based in Leipzig (Germany) was at first critical with the invention, claiming that it was impossible to accurately adapt and assemble different shapes of types to create a new form. But, after the typometric prints were proven to be successful, he began experimenting himself with the technique, and he printed a map of the whereabouts of Leipzig by using it.\n\nIn the early 19th century, two different issues of a French review called the \"Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement pour l’Industrie Nationale\" contains articles about typometry. The first one, of 1808, refers to the research work of Mr. Periaux and Mr. Poterat, to produce typometric maps, in order to generate a viable alternative to engraved maps. The second article, of 1825, introduces the advancements made by Firmin Didot, son, in the technique of printing maps by using typographic means. \n\nThe polychrome maps of France made by Didot were sold at the price of 1 franc and 50 cents, which was more affordable than the monochrome engraved maps of the time. Typometric maps, even with their inferior detail quality, were also considerably faster to produce than engraved maps. After Didot, and util 1832, printers Wegener the Young in Berlin and Georg Michael Bauerkeller (1805-1886) in Frankfurt am Main did some essays with the technique for producing maps, but without attaining much success.\n\nIt was not until 1839 in Vienna that Slovak cartographer Franz Raffelsperger (1793-1861), having prefected his own printing methods without knowing the work of his predecessors, produced a typometric postal card of the Austrian Empire of unprecedented quality. This postal card was rewarded with the golden medal at the industrial exhibition that took place that year in Vienna, and the next year he opened his own typometric press in that city. Raffelsperger produced moveable type characters that allowed him to print every possible feature in a map, including geographic and topographic features, mathematical and geometric symbols, architectural landmarks and even plants and animals. He also designed custom symbols for cities, forests and other elements, that he printed in five different text sizes and in several languages. He then combined these this typometric technique with polychromy, so he could print moveable type characters for each geographical feature of the map with their very own precise colour hue. The different available sizes of his printing components allowed him to print his maps in several sizes without losing quality, and that at a very reduced cost.\n\nAfter Raffelsperger, other European printers continued to experiment with typometry, and several examples were presented at the 1855 International Exhibition in Paris. However, with the advent of lithography, invented by Alois Senefelder in 1796, typometry was confronted with another method that was even better at reproducing detail and that allowed to print several solid colours at a low price, so it was progressively abandoned.\n\n"}

Xuan paper is renowned for being soft and fine textured, suitable for conveying the artistic expression of both Chinese calligraphy and painting.\n\nXuan paper was first mentioned in ancient Chinese books \"Notes of Past Famous Paintings\" and \"New Book of Tang\". It was originally produced in the Tang dynasty in Jing County, which was under the jurisdiction of Xuan Prefecture (Xuanzhou), hence the name Xuan paper. During the Tang dynasty, the paper was often a mixture of hemp (the first fiber used for paper in China) and mulberry fiber. By the Song dynasty, the paper producing industries in Huizhou and Chizhou were gradually transferred to Jing County.\n\nDue to different producing methods, Xuan paper can be classified into \"Shengxuan\", \"Shuxuan\", and \"Banshuxuan\". Shengxuan (literally \"Raw Xuan\"), which is not specially processed, excels in its ability to absorb water, causing the ink on it to blur. Shuxuan (literally \"Ripe Xuan\"), however, has Potassium alum worked into it during production, which results in a stiffer texture, a reduced ability to absorb water, and less resistance to shear stress (meaning that it can be torn much more easily). This feature makes Shuxuan more suitable for Gongbi rather than Xieyi. Banshuxuan (literally \"Half-ripe Xuan\") has intermediate absorbability, between Shengxuan and Shuxuan.\n\nXuan paper features great tensile strength, smooth surface, pure and clean texture and clean stroke, great resistance to crease, corrosion, moth and mold. The majority of ancient Chinese books and paintings by famous painters that survived until today are well preserved on Xuan paper. Xuan paper won the Golden Award at the Panama International Exposition in 1915. Xuan paper was used to make scrolls.\n\nThe material Xuan paper uses is closely related to the geography of Jing County. The bark of \"Pteroceltis tatarinowii\", a common species of elm in the area, was used as the main material to produce Xuan paper. Rice, along with several other materials, was subsequently added to the recipe in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Bamboo and mulberry also began to be used to produce xuan paper around that time.\n\nThe production of Xuan paper can be loosely described as an 18-step process, and a detailed account would involve over a hundred. Some paper makers have invented steps which have been kept secret from others. The process includes steaming and bleaching the bark of \"Pteroceltis tatarinowii\", as well as the addition of a variety of juices.\n\n\n"}

Once located along Calle Iris (now a part of C.M. Recto Avenue), Manila, the theatre was named after José Zorrilla (1817 - 1893), a Spanish poet and playwright. The building, which had a seating capacity of 900 people, was officially opened on 17 August 1893, and it was the venue for Spanish-language and Tagalog-language stage performances.\n\n\n"}

Located 4 km east of Borrby in Skåne County in southern Sweden, it belongs to the Diocese of Lund. The church is noted for its frescos and for its sculpted baptismal font.\n\nBuilt of travertine, the apse and chancel are the earliest parts of the church, dating from the early 12th century. The nave was added in the second half of the 12th century, possibly in connection with an early tower. The two arms of the transept were added much later in 1850.\n\nThe altarpiece (1654) has elements in both the Renaissance and Baroque styles. Its paintings depict scenes from the Old and New Testaments. The pulpit bears the date of 1651 but is probably older as it includes the arms of Queen Anne of Denmark who died in 1619. It is said the pulpit was intended for Trinity Church, Kristianstad but was brought here after the ship transporting it was stranded.\n\nThe font, sculpted with a figure of Christ enthroned, is the work of the 12th-century craftsman Majestatis, also known as the Tryde Master.\n\nThe church has frescos from various periods. In the apse and on the east wall of the nave there are fragments of late Romanesque decorations from the second half of the 13th century. Immediately after completion of the ceiling vaults in the 15th century, their ribs and arches were decorated with ornaments. Remains of these can be seen in various places. Around 1460, the arches were decorated with vines by the Fjälkinge Workshop which probably also altered a fresco of the Majestas in the apse to one of the Mercy Seat. Traces of the original Majestas rainbow can still be seen. The frescos in the apse and on the vaults were improved and extended from 1500 to 1515 by the Åle Workshop which worked around Aarhus in Denmark. The same workshop probably also painted the frescos in the vestibule under the tower.\n\nThe chancel vault contains frescos of the apostles by the Åle Workshop. The ribbons of text include remnants from the Creed and the names of the apostles. On the chancel wall there are images of Anne and Mary with Jesus on her lap. Among the frescos on the vaulting at the point where the transept crosses the nave, there are fragments of the story of Adam and Eve. The serpent in one of the scenes is shaped like the figure of a woman bearing an apple for Adam and Eve.\n"}
