It can also be used to describe the quality of execution of that process. When used as a means of expression, it is synonymous with illustrating. However, it may be used for mere visualization of existing data regardless of any preconceived message or idea to express. Rendering is also a technique that can be used while designing packaging and branding. \n\nThe alternative method to rendering an image is capturing an image such as photography or image scanning. Both rendered and captured images can be mixed, edited, or both.\n\nArtistic rendering is the application of visual art styles to rendering. For photorealistic rendering styles, the emphasis is on accurate reproduction of light-and-shadow and the surface properties of the depicted objects, composition, or other more generic qualities. When the emphasis is on unique interpretive rendering styles, visual information is interpreted by the artist and displayed accordingly using the chosen art medium and level of abstraction in abstract art. In computer graphics, interpretive rendering styles are known as non-photorealistic rendering styles, but may be used to simplify technical illustrations. Rendering styles that combine photorealism with non-photorealism are known as hyperrealistic rendering styles.\n\n"}

It is a sheet bronze covering of a (now vanished) wooden shield decorated in La Tène style. The shield is on display in the British Museum, and a replica is housed in the Museum of London.\n\nThe Battersea Shield is currently dated by the museum to c.350–50 BC, though later dates up to the early 1st century AD have previously been suggested. A date in the later part of this range is usually preferred; Miranda Aldhouse-Green is typical in using \"2nd-1st century BC\". It was dredged from the bed of the River Thames in London in 1857, during excavations for the predecessor of Chelsea Bridge; in the same area workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians to conclude that the area was the site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain, although it is now thought that the shield was a votive offering, which probably predates the invasion.\n\nThe Battersea Shield is made of several different pieces, held together by rivets concealed under the decorative elements. It is decorated with repoussé decoration, engraving, and enamel. The decoration is in the typically Celtic La Tène style, consisting of circles and spirals. There are 27 small round compartments in raised bronze with red cloisonné enamel; the bronze within the compartment forms a sort of swastika, thought to have been associated with good luck and also \"solar energy\". Enamel was a Celtic speciality, and reflects the use of red Mediterranean coral inlays in other British Celtic artefacts, such as the Witham Shield, and here may perhaps be considered as an imitation of imported coral, though the use of enamel allows a more elaborate design. Some scholars have read a reversible human face into the decoration at the points where the smaller circles link to the larger one.\n\nThe bronze sheet is said by archaeologists to be too thin to have offered effective protection in combat, and shows no signs of battle damage. It is therefore believed that the shield was cast into the river as a votive offering, and made either as a \"parade piece\" or status symbol or specifically for votive offering. The metal plate of the shield that remains would have been fixed onto a plain, wooden or leather shield behind it.\n\n\n\n"}

The school conducted electronic keyboard music workshops in collaboration with the University of Mumbai from 1996 to 2005, until it came under controversy for allegations of witchcraft and black magic, by parents of some students. Cases were filed in the Bombay High Court regarding the same, and were later dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.\n\nThe Boss School of Music was founded as a nonprofit organisation in 1996. The school conducted short-term electronic keyboard music courses in suburban Mumbai for novices and professionals, after which students could reportedly perform certain pieces on the electronic keyboard, read music notation and write their own compositions.\n\nDuring its tenure, musicians, educationists, doctors, artists and engineers joined the school as staff, working on a non-salaried basis to design better methods of music education. They ran centres in Bandra, Colaba, Dadar, Vile Parle and Churchgate. They prepared students for standardised graded examinations conducted by Trinity College London in Mumbai, requiring 3–6 months of training using their methods. Such examinations reportedly required up to 8 years of training using traditional methods.\n\nTheir education method utilised audio-visual technology and simplified concepts. Students were provided with keyboards during classes, and were given supplementary books and CDs printed and published by the school.\n\nThey entered into a collaboration with the Department of Music, University of Mumbai in 2002, and conducted classes that could reportedly train a novice student into becoming a music teacher in 6 months. Dr. Vidyadhar Vyas, Head of the Music Department at the university claimed that they \"revolutionized\" music learning by teaching complex musical concepts in short periods of time.\n\nIn 2005, parents of some students filed cases in the Bombay High Court accusing the school of practising witchcraft and black magic. Investigations by the Mumbai Police found no evidence for such claims, and a local representative of Trinity College London confirmed that the examination certificates received by the students were authentic. The police halted investigation awaiting evidence and witnesses for the allegations. Due to attacks by local mobs and fearing their safety, the school staff and researchers subsequently left their Thane premises.\n\nIn 2008, several staff members of the school proceeded to the Supreme Court of India with cases against individuals, government officials and High Court judges for shutting down the institution, defamation and \"witch-hunting\", an act they termed \"genocide\". The Supreme Court dismissed their cases, reportedly because it contained allegations against high-ranking officials, judges and police. The Supreme Court also arrested 4 of the staff members on grounds of contempt, after a staff member hurled a slipper at a Supreme Court judge. The High Court cases regarding the allegations were dismissed by the Supreme Court.\n\nAnother three staff members filed cases in the Federal Court of Australia, accusing the Sydney-based Exclusive Brethren sect for committing a \"genocide\" by destroying their group, and bribing Indian officials and judges to do so. Reportedly, they did not have the funding for proper legal representation, and appeared in court without lawyers. The Federal Court questioned its ability to order the Australian Federal Police to investigate the matter, and the case was adjourned. In 2009, a delegation of 12 Indian judges travelled to Sydney for an \"exchange program\" with the Australian Federal Court, which the Australian government offered to fund.\n\nWhile defending High Court cases that claimed she was \"mentally unsound\", one of the staff members received two gold medals from the Mumbai University for topping the board that year.\n\n"}
{"id": "5949300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5949300", "title": "Brand licensing", "text": "Brand licensing\n\nLicensing means renting or leasing of an intangible asset. It is a process of creating and managing contracts between the owner of a brand and a company or individual who wants to use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a trademark or character onto products of a completely different nature.\n\nExamples of intangible assets include a song (\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\"), a character (Donald Duck), a name (Michael Jordan), or a brand (The Ritz-Carlton). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor).\n\nBrand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of patents and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. Mickey Mouse's popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.\n\nThis process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. McDonald's play food, Burger King T-shirts and even ghastly Good Humor Halloween costumes became commonplace. Brand extensions later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to \"rent\" the product of an established brand name. Armor All auto vacuums, Breyers yogurt, TGI Friday's frozen appetizers, and Lucite nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.\n\nA company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for brand extensions or products. For example, when Apple launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a licensee make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded \"Earbud Headphones\", \"iPod docking stations\" and \"iPod socks.\" Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licensees.\n\nApart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their merchandise, but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee’s products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps:\n\n\nLicensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. Royalties are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.\n\nThe main international professional association for brand licensing is the Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association, which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo.\n\nThe Society of Product Licensors Committed to Excellence (SPLiCE) is a Licensors Community of Practice with the vision to continuously improve brand licensing. The mission of SPLiCE is to act as a community of licensors who share best practices for protecting, promoting and enhancing brand integrity. The SPLiCE Licensors Workshop acts as its annual board of directors and members' meeting. During SPLiCE Licensors Workshop, benchmark findings and industry trends are highlighted in feature panel presentations that are relevant to the community at large. They engage a creativity philosophy of divergence and convergence to sustain unique idea implementation on best practices. The vision for SPLiCE Licensors Workshop is to provide best in practice licensing education through sharing educational best practices through benchmarking initiatives, task force collaborations, committee reports, and guest industry speakers\n\nEach May, \"License! Global\" magazine publishes an annual list of \"The Top 150 Global Licensors\". For 2017, the leader was Disney Consumer Products with $53 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise, followed by Meredith Corp. with $23.2 Billion and PVH with $18 Billion.\n\nAccording to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association (LIMA), global licensed merchandise sales was $272.2 billion in 2016, versus $262.2 billion in 2015. \n\nThe liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1992 brought a slew of international brands to India. Many of these brands have been licensed to Indian companies. Arvind represent Arrow, Cherokee, ELLE, Nautica, USPA, AEROPOSTALE, CHILDRENS PLACE, Ed Hardy, GAP and Kipling. The Murjani Group is the licensee for Calvin Klein Jeans, FCUK and Tommy Hilfiger. Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) is licensed to Spencers Retail. \n\nCharacter Licensing is another big licensing segment of brand licensing in India. The big players in the character licensing industry in India are Disney India, Viacom 18 and Cartoon Network Enterprises. Characters licensed out by Disney India include Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Viacom has brought in popular characters from Nickelodeon like Dora The Explorer and SpongeBob SquarePants. Cartoon Network boasts of a portfolio including characters such as Ben 10, Powerpuff Girls, Mr. Bean, Roll no. 21, We Bare Bears.\n\nBrand Licensing in Italy started in the seventies with very few Licensing Agencies. Apart from Disney which had its own dedicated office in the market, all the other big Entertainment majors were represented by independent agencies. One of these companies named DIC 2 (Distribution International Characters), founded in 1973 by Gianfranco Mari contributed to create the licensing business in Italy and set big phenomena as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Marvel Comics, \"Star Wars\", Hanna & Barbera characters, Zorro, Asterix and so on. DIC 2 is still one of the biggest independent agencies in Italy, representing different cartoon characters and famous brands.\n"}
{"id": "6492028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6492028", "title": "Cassandra's Dream", "text": "Cassandra's Dream\n\nCassandra's Dream is a 2007 dramatic thriller film written and directed by Woody Allen. Filmed in the United Kingdom, it was released in 2007 in Europe and in January 2008 in the United States. It was developed as a British-French-American co-production.\n\nThe film was premiered in secret at Avilés, Spain on June 18, 2007. It was officially premiered at the Venice Film Festival on September 2, 2007 and was already in theaters in Spain by November 3. The film had its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2007.\n\nBrothers Terry (Colin Farrell) and Ian (Ewan McGregor), who live in South London, were raised by a weak father Brian (John Benfield) who runs a restaurant, and a strong mother Dorothy (Clare Higgins) who taught her sons to look up to their uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson), a successful plastic surgeon and businessman.\n\nThe brothers buy a sailboat at an oddly low price, despite its near pristine condition. They name it \"Cassandra's Dream\", after a greyhound that won Terry the money to buy the boat. Knowing nothing of Greek mythology, they are unaware of the ominous antecedents of this name—the ancient prophetess Cassandra, whose prophecies of doom went unheeded by those around her.\n\nWhile driving home from a day's sailing in a borrowed car, Ian crosses paths with beautiful actress Angela Stark (Hayley Atwell), with whom he becomes infatuated.\n\nTerry has a gambling addiction that sinks him deeper in debt. Ian wishes to invest in hotels in California to finance a new life with Angela. To overcome their financial issues, they ask Howard for help. He agrees to help them, but asks for a favor in return: they must murder someone for him. Howard faces imprisonment for unspecified crimes and his future is threatened by Martin Burns (Phil Davis), a former business partner who plans to testify against him. Howard asks his nephews to get rid of Burns, and in return he will reward them financially. After initial reluctance, the brothers agree.\n\nThey make two zip guns, untraceable and easily destroyed. Lying in wait in Burns' home, their plan is foiled when Burns arrives with a woman. Their resolve shaken, they leave and agree to commit the murder the next day.\n\nThe next day, they succeed in carrying out the murder and later destroy the guns. Ian is content to move on as if nothing happened, but Terry is consumed by guilt and begins abusing alcohol and other drugs. His behavior frightens his fiancée (Sally Hawkins), who tells Ian about the situation and that Terry believes he has killed someone. After Terry confides that he wants to turn himself in to the police, Ian goes to Howard for advice. They agree there is no alternative but to get rid of Terry. Ian plans to poison Terry during an outing on the boat. Ian can't bring himself to kill his own brother, and attacks him in a fit of rage. In the chaos, Terry knocks Ian down the steps into the cabin, killing him.\n\nThe boat is later discovered adrift by the police, and the audience learns that Terry snapped and drowned himself after killing his brother. The last shot is of \"Cassandra's Dream\", still in beautiful condition despite the tragedies it set in motion.\n\n\nThis is the first Woody Allen film since \"Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)\" to have an original score commissioned for it. The score was composed by Philip Glass.\n\nIt was also his first film released with a stereo soundtrack. Allen previously eschewed stereo although often employing Dolby Stereo and Dolby Digital technologies to convey a higher quality mono soundtrack. The film is stereo for its music only.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score 46% based on reviews from 116 critics. Another aggregator Metacritic gave the film an average rating score of 49 out of 100, based on 31 reviews.\n\nManohla Dargis commended the film in her review for \"The New York Times\". Although offering criticism such as the film feeling \"too lightly polished and often rushed, as if he had directed it with a stopwatch,\" she suggests that Allen's film \"is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn't just stop making comedies once and for all.\" Roger Ebert compared the film negatively to Sidney Lumet's similarly themed \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\" adding: \"The Lumet film uses actors who don't look like brothers but feel like brothers. Allen's actors look like brothers but don't really feel related.\" He rated the film two out of four stars, and noted that Allen's previous film \"Match Point\" presented the material more effectively.\n\nDamon Wise of \"Empire\" magazine concluded that \"Cassandra's Dream\" was \"[a] clumsy, clichéd morality play that may actually represent the lowest point of Allen's recently chequered career.\" Paul Jordan also compared the film to a morality play—but considered that praise: \"Allen gets past the guard of a modern audience which would not have taken seriously the appearance of a Mephistopheles or an Old Scratch. Uncle Howard is a chilling 21st Century Tempter, fulfilling the heart's desire in return for murder and leading his nephews to terrible perdition.\"\n\nIn his \"Best of the Decade\" article, \"New Yorker\" critic Richard Brody called \"Cassandra's Dream\" one of the best films of the 2000s: \"Few aging directors so cogently and relentlessly depict the grimly destructive machinery of life, and every time the word 'family' is uttered, the screws tighten just a little more.\"\n\nIn 2016 film critics Robbie Collin and Tim Robey ranked it as one of the worst movies by Woody Allen.\n\n"}

{"id": "308673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308673", "title": "Chantal Akerman", "text": "Chantal Akerman\n\nChantal Anne Akerman (; 6 June 19505 October 2015) was a Belgian film director, screenwriter, artist, and film professor at the City College of New York. She is best known for her three hour \"magnum opus\" \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\" (1975), which was dubbed a \"masterpiece\" by \"The New York Times\". According to film scholar Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, Akerman's influence on feminist filmmaking and avant-garde cinema has been substantial.\n\nAkerman was born in Brussels, Belgium to Holocaust survivors from Poland. She was the older sister of Sylviane Akerman, her only sibling. Her mother Natalia (Nelly) had survived years at Auschwitz, where her own parents had died. From a young age, Akerman and her mother were exceptionally close, and she encouraged her daughter to pursue a career rather than marry young. \n\nAt age 18, Akerman entered the Institut National Supérieur des Arts du Spectacle et des Techniques de Diffusion, a Belgian film school. Akerman dropped out during her first term to make the short film \"Saute ma ville\"; she funded the film's costs by trading diamond shares on the Antwerp stock exchange.\n\nAkerman had an extremely close relationship with her mother, captured in some of her films. In 1976 \"News From Home\", Akerman's mother's letters outlining mundane family activities serve as a soundtrack throughout the film. The 2015 \"No Home Movie\" centers on mother-daughter relationships, largely situated in the kitchen, and is a response to her mother's death. The film explores issues of metempsychosis, the last shot of the film acting as a memento mori of the mother's apartment.\n\nAkerman acknowledged that her mother was at the center of her work and admitted to feeling directionless after her death. The maternal imagery can be found throughout all of Akerman's films, as an homage and an attempt to reconstitute the image and voice of the mother. In \"Family In Brussels\", Akerman narrates the story, interchanging her own voice with her mother's.\n\nAkerman claimed that, at the age of 15, after viewing Jean-Luc Godard's \"Pierrot le fou\" (1965), she decided, that same night, to become a filmmaker. In 1971, Akerman's first short film, \"Saute ma ville\", premiered at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. That year, she moved to New York City, where she remained until 1972.\n\nAt Anthology Film Archives in New York, Akerman was impressed with the work of Stan Brakhage, Jonas Mekas, Michael Snow, Yvonne Rainer, and Andy Warhol.\n\nHer first feature film, \"Hotel Monterey\" (1972), and subsequent short films, \"La Chambre 1\" and \"La Chambre 2\", reveal the influence of structural filmmaking through these films' usage of long takes. These protracted shots serve to oscillate images between abstraction and figuration. Akerman's films from this period also signify the start of her collaboration with cinematographer Babette Mangolte. \n\nIn 1973, Akerman returned to Belgium and, in 1974, she received critical recognition for her feature \"Je, Tu, Il, Elle (I, You, He, She)\". Feminist and queer film scholar B. Ruby Rich noted that \"Je Tu Il Elle\" can be seen as a \"cinematic Rosetta Stone of female sexuality\".\n\nAkerman's most significant film, \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles\", was released in 1975. Often considered one of the greatest examples of feminist filmmaking, the film makes a hypnotic, real-time study of a middle-aged widow's stifling routine of domestic chores and prostitution. Upon the film's release, \"The New York Times\" called \"Jeanne Dielman\" the \"first masterpiece of the feminine in the history of the cinema\". Chantal Akerman scholar Ivone Margulies says the picture is a filmic paradigm for uniting feminism and anti-illusionism. The film was named the 19th greatest film of the 20th century by J. Hoberman of the \"Village Voice\".\n\nAkerman has acknowledged that her cinematic approach can be explained, in part, through the writings of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. Deleuze and Guattari write about the concept of minor literature as being characterized by the following things:\n\nDeleuze and Guattari claim that these characteristics describe the revolutionary conditions within the canon of literature. Akerman has referenced Deleuze and Guattari on how, in minor literature, the characters assume an immediate, nonhierarchical relation between small individual matters and economic, commercial, juridical, and political ones. While the filmmaker has an interest in multiple deterritorializations, she also considers the feminist demand for the exercise of identity, where a borderline status may be an undesirable position.\n\nAkerman has used the setting of a kitchen to explore the intersection between femininity and domesticity. The kitchens in Akerman's work provide intimate spaces for connection and conversation and serve the function of a backdrop to the dramas of daily life. The kitchens, alongside other domestic spaces, act as self-confining prisons under patriarchal conditions. In Akerman's work, the kitchen acts as a domestic theatre.\n\nAlthough Akerman is often grouped within feminist and queer thinking, the filmmaker has articulated her distance from an essentialist feminism. Akerman resists labels relating to her identity like \"female\", \"Jewish\" and \"lesbian\", choosing instead to immerse herself in the identity of being a daughter; Akerman has stated that she sees film as a \"generative field of freedom from the boundaries of identity\". The filmmaker has advocated for multiplicity of expression, explaining that \"when people say there is a feminist film language, it is like saying there is only one way for women to express themselves\". The filmmaker asserted that there are as many cinematic languages as there are individuals. \n\nWriter and scholar Ivone Marguiles notes that Akerman's resistance to be categorized is in response to the rigidity of cinema's earlier essentialist realism and \"indicates an awareness of the project of a transhistorical and transcultural feminist aesthetics of the cinema\".\n\nAkerman works with the feminist motto of the personal being political, complicating it by an investigation of representational links between private and public. In Jeanne Dielman, Akerman's most well-known film, the main protagonist does not supply a transparent, accurate representation of a fixed social reality. Throughout the film, the housewife and prostitute Jeanne is revealed to be a construct, with multiple historical, social, and cinematic resonances. \n\nAkerman engages with realist representations, a form which is historically grounded to act as a feminist gesture and simultaneously as an \"irritant\" to fixed categories of \"woman\".\n\nIn 1991, Akerman was a member of the jury at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. In 2011, she joined the full-time faculty of the MFA Program in Media Arts Production at the City College of New York as a distinguished lecturer and the first Michael & Irene Ross Visiting Professor of Film/Video & Jewish Studies.\n\nImportant solo exhibitions of Akerman's work have been held at the Museum for Contemporary Art, Antwerp, Belgium (2012), MIT, Cambridge Massachusetts (2008), the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel (2006); Princeton University Art Museum, Princeton, NJ (2006); and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (2003). Akerman has participated in Documenta XI (2002) and the Venice Biennale (2001). \n\nIn 2011, a film retrospective of Akerman's work was shown at the Austrian Film Museum. \n\nThe 2015 Venice Biennale included an installation of interspersed parallel screens displaying the landscape-in-motion footage that would appear in \"No Home Movie\". \n\nIn 2018, the Jewish Museum presented her final video installation \"NOW\" (2015) in the exhibition \"Scenes from the Collection\", and acquired her work for the collection.\n\nAkerman's cinematography is characterized by the dryness of language, the lack of metaphorical associations, the composition in a series of discontinuous blocks, the interest in putting a poor, withered syntax and reduced vocabulary at the service of a new intensity. Many directors have cited Akerman's films as an influence on their work. Kelly Reichardt, Gus Van Sant, and Sofia Coppola have noted their exploration of filming in real time as a tribute to Akerman.\n\nTerrie Sultan, art historian, claims that Akerman's \"narrative is marked by an almost Proustian attention to detail and visual grace\". Similarly, Akerman's visual language resists easy categorization and summarization: the filmmaker creates narrative through filmic syntax instead of plot development.\n\nAkerman was influenced by European art cinema, as well as structuralist film. Structuralist film used formalist experimentation to propose a reciprocal relationship between image and viewer. Akerman cites Michael Snow as a structuralist inspiration, especially his film Wavelength, which is composed of a single shot of a photograph of a sea on a loft wall, with the camera slowly zooming in. Akerman was drawn to the perceived dullness of structuralism because it rejected the dominant cinema's concern for plot. As a teenager in Brussels, Akerman skipped school in order to see movies, including films from the experimental festival in Knokke-le-Zoute.\n\nAkerman addresses the voyeurism that is always present within cinematic discourse by often playing a character within her films, thus placing herself on both sides of the camera simultaneously. The filmmaker used the boredom of structuralism in order to generate a bodily feeling in the viewer, accentuating the passage of time.\n\nAkerman's filming style relies on capturing ordinary life. By encouraging viewers to have patience for a slower pace, her films emphasize the humanity of the everyday. Kathy Halbreich states that the filmmaker \"creates a cinema of waiting, of passages, of resolutions deferred\". \n\nMany of Akerman's films portray the movement of people across distances or their absorption with claustrophobic spaces.

It was built on the earthen pyramid mound on top of the Liburnian prehistoric tomb. The church is the only surviving example of early Romanesque architecture in all of Dalmatia. It was built at the beginning of the 12th century and is dedicated to Saint Nicholas.\n\nChurch of St. Nicholas was built in form of a fortress. It has a trefoil plan with four branches arranged around a central circular core, three of which form the apse, and the fourth the input branch. Its dome-shaped vault is reinforced with circular-ribbed arches above which 8 small towers with battlement as a lookout were built in the 16th or 17th century during Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War. Flanges that are resting on pilasters that are abutting onto the pylons between the apses are placed under the dome. Input branch is rectangular and roofed with a mezzanine leaning on squinch, while three other branches of semicircular conch are translated with semi calotte. The church was built of small stones and has a smooth outer surface. It has very small dimensions; \"length\": 5.90m, \"width\": 5.70m, \"height\"= 6m.\n\nIn 1603, Church of St. Nicholas was visited by Priul who found neatly kept Glagolitic registers of baptisms and marriages, as well as two Glagolitic missals. At the time of his visit, \"Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit\" with 28 members was active in the parish. Priul ordered brotherhood to write its rules that had to be approved by the local bishop. \n\nSince the Church was constructed, Mass was celebrated in it on the feast of St. Nicholas on December 6. In recent times, Mass is celebrated on the day of Saint Mark on April 25.\n\n"}

Croquis drawings are usually made in a few minutes, after which the model changes pose or leaves and another croquis is drawn.\n\nThe short duration of the pose benefits models because they do not need to keep still for a long time; this also benefits the artists because it helps them concentrate on the essential elements of the pose, or the most important parts of the drawing. An artist does not have time to draw all the details, so they learn to concentrate on the important elements. Croquis is also a good method of drawing subjects that generally do not stand still and pose, such as insects, animals, and children.\n\nAfter the initial sketch, croquis drawing can be used as a foundation for another work of art such as a painting or may be used as a work of art itself.\n\nThe word \"croquis\" comes from French and means simply \"sketch\".\n\nIn fashion, the term refers to a quick sketch of a figure (typically nine heads tall as this is the accepted proportions for fashion illustration) with a loose drawing of the clothes that are being designed.

{"id": "21438345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21438345", "title": "Design knowledge", "text": "Design knowledge\n\nThere is a large body of knowledge that designers call upon and use during the design process to match the ever-increasing complexity of design problems. Design knowledge can be classified into two categories: product knowledge and design process knowledge.\n\nProduct knowledge has been fairly studied and a number of modeling techniques have been developed. Most of them are tailored to specific products or specific aspects of the design activities. For example, geometric modeling is used mainly for supporting detailed design, while knowledge modeling is working for supporting conceptual designs. Based on these techniques, a design repository project at NIST attempts to model three fundamental facets of an artifact representation: the physical layout of the artifact (form), an indication of the overall effect that the artifact creates (function), and a causal account of the operation of the artifact (behavior). The recent NIST research effort towards the development of the basic foundations of the next generation of CAD systems suggested a core representation for design information called the NIST core product model (CPM) and a set of derived models defined as extensions of the CPM (e.g.). The NIST core product model has been developed to unify and integrate product or assembly information. The CPM\nprovides a base-level product model that is: not tied to any vendor software; open; non-proprietary; expandable; independent of any one product development process; capable of capturing the engineering context that is most commonly shared in product development activities. The core model focuses on artifact representation including function, form, behavior, material, physical and functional decompositions, and relationships among these concepts. The entity-relationship data model influences the model heavily; accordingly, it consists of two sets of classes, called object and relationship, equivalent to the UML class and association class, respectively.\n\nDesign process knowledge can be described in two levels: design activities and design rationale. The importance of representation for design rationale has been recognized but it is a more complex issue that extends beyond artifact function. The design structure matrix (DSM) has been used for modeling design process (activities) and some related research efforts have been conducted. For example, a web-based prototype system for modeling the product development process using a multi-tiered DSM is developed at MIT. However, few research endeavors have been found on design rationale.\n\nIn terms of representation scenarios, design knowledge can also be categorized into off-line and on-line knowledge. Design process knowledge can be categorized into ontologies.\n\nOffline Knowledge refers to existing knowledge representation, including design knowledge in handbook and design ‘‘know-how’’, etc.; the latter refers to the new design knowledge created in the course of design activities by designers themselves. For the off-line knowledge, there are two representation approaches. One is to highly abstract and categorize existing knowledge including experiences into a series of design principles, rationales and constraints. TRIZ is a good instance of this approach. The other is to represent a collection of design knowledge into a certain case for description. Case-based design is an example of this approach. The key issue is on the computerization of the\ndesign knowledge representation. For instance, researchers at the Engineering Design Centre at Lancaster University, UK established a unique knowledge representation methodology and knowledge base vocabulary based on the theory of domains, design principles and computer modeling. They developed a software tool for engineering knowledge management. The tool provides an engineering system designer with the capability to search a knowledge base of past solutions, and other known technologies to explored viable alternatives for product design.\n\nOn-line knowledge representation is capturing the dynamic design knowledge in a certain format for design re-use and archive. A few research efforts have been found in this area. Blessing proposes the process-based support system (PROSUS) based on a model of the design process rather than the product. It uses a design matrix to represent the design process as a structured set of issues and activities. Together with the common product data model (CPDM), PROSUS supports the capture of all outputs of the design activity.\n\nOntologies are being used for product representation (e.g.). Research suggests that there is a need to provide computer support that will supply clear and complete design knowledge and also facilitate designer intervention and customization during the decision-making activities in the design process. For example, WebCADET is a design support system that uses distributed Web-based AI tools. It uses the AI as text approach, where knowledge-based systems (KBSs) can be seen as a medium to facilitate the communication of design knowledge between designers. The system can provide support for designers when searching for design knowledge.\n"}
{"id": "52797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52797", "title": "Digital camera", "text": "Digital camera\n\nA digital camera or digicam is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory. Most cameras produced today are digital, and while there are still dedicated digital cameras, many more are now incorporated into devices ranging from mobile devices to vehicles. However, high-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals.\n\nDigital and movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device. The diaphragm and shutter admit the correct amount of light to the imager, just as with film but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.\n\nThe history of the digital camera began with Eugene F. Lally of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His 1961 idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts' position. As with Texas Instruments employee Willis Adcock's filmless camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972, the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.\n\nThe Cromemco Cyclops was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of \"Popular Electronics\" magazine, and it used a 32×32 Metal Oxide Semiconductor sensor.\n\nSteven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak, invented and built the first self-contained electronic camera that used a charge-coupled device image sensor in 1975. Early uses were mainly military and scientific; followed by medical and news applications.\n\nIn 1986, Japanese company Nikon introduced the first digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera, the Nikon SVC. In the mid-to-late 1990s, DSLR cameras became common among consumers. By the mid-2000s, DSLR cameras had largely replaced film cameras.\n\nIn 2000, Sharp introduced the world's first digital camera phone, the J-SH04 J-Phone, in Japan. By the mid-2000s, higher-end cell phones had an integrated digital camera. By the beginning of the 2010s, almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera.\n\nThe two major types of digital image sensor are CCD and CMOS. A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS active-pixel sensor has its own amplifier. Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power. Cameras with a small sensor use a back-side-illuminated CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. Overall final image quality is more dependent on the image processing capability of the camera, than on sensor type.\n\nThe resolution of a digital camera is often limited by the image sensor that turns light into discrete signals. The brighter the image at a given point on the sensor, the larger the value that is read for that pixel.\nDepending on the physical structure of the sensor, a color filter array may be used, which requires demosaicing to recreate a full-color image.\nThe number of pixels in the sensor determines the camera's \"pixel count\".\nIn a typical sensor, the pixel count is the product of the number of rows and the number of columns. For example, a 1,000 by 1,000 pixel sensor would have 1,000,000 pixels, or 1 megapixel.\n\nFinal quality of an image depends on all optical transformations in the chain of producing the image. Carl Zeiss points out that the weakest link in an optical chain determines the final image quality. In case of a digital camera, a simplistic way of expressing it is that the lens determines the maximum sharpness of the image while the image sensor determines the maximum resolution. The illustration on the right can be said to compare a lens with very poor sharpness on a camera with high resolution, to a lens with good sharpness on a camera with lower resolution.\n\nSince the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.\n\n\"Single-shot\" capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the primary additive colors red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter (see Three-CCD camera).\n\n\"Multi-shot\" exposes the sensor to the image in a sequence of three or more openings of the lens aperture. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed in front of the sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another multiple shot method is called Microscanning. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.\n\nThe third method is called \"scanning\" because the sensor moves across the focal plane much like the sensor of an image scanner. The \"linear\" or \"tri-linear\" sensors in scanning cameras utilize only a single line of photosensors, or three lines for the three colors. Scanning may be accomplished by moving the sensor (for example, when using color co-site sampling) or by rotating the whole camera. A digital rotating line camera offers images of very high total resolution.\n\nThe choice of method for a given capture is determined largely by the subject matter. It is usually inappropriate to attempt to capture a subject that moves with anything but a single-shot system. However, the higher color fidelity and larger file sizes and resolutions available with multi-shot and scanning backs make them attractive for commercial photographers working with stationary subjects and large-format photographs.\n\nImprovements in single-shot cameras and image file processing at the beginning of the 21st century made single shot cameras almost completely dominant, even in high-end commercial photography.\n\nMost current consumer digital cameras use a Bayer filter mosaic in combination with an optical anti-aliasing filter to reduce the aliasing due to the reduced sampling of the different primary-color images.\nA demosaicing algorithm is used to interpolate color information to create a full array of RGB image data.\n\nCameras that use a beam-splitter single-shot 3CCD approach, three-filter multi-shot approach, color co-site sampling or Foveon X3 sensor do not use anti-aliasing filters, nor demosaicing.\n\nFirmware in the camera, or a software in a raw converter program such as Adobe Camera Raw, interprets the raw data from the sensor to obtain a full color image, because the RGB color model requires three intensity values for each pixel: one each for the red, green, and blue (other color models, when used, also require three or more values per pixel).\nA single sensor element cannot simultaneously record these three intensities, and so a color filter array (CFA) must be used to selectively filter a particular color for each pixel.\n\nThe Bayer filter pattern is a repeating 2x2 mosaic pattern of light filters, with green ones at opposite corners and red and blue in the other two positions. The high proportion of green takes advantage of properties of the human visual system, which determines brightness mostly from green and is far more sensitive to brightness than to hue or saturation. Sometimes a 4-color filter pattern is used, often involving two different hues of green. This provides potentially more accurate color, but requires a slightly more complicated interpolation process.\n\nThe color intensity values not captured for each pixel can be interpolated from the values of adjacent pixels which represent the color being calculated.\n\nCameras with digital image sensors that are smaller than the typical 35mm film size have a smaller field or angle of view when used with a lens of the same focal length. This is because angle of view is a function of both focal length and the sensor or film size used.\n\nThe crop factor is relative to the 35mm film format. If a smaller sensor is used, as in most digicams, the field of view is cropped by the sensor to smaller than the 35mm full-frame format's field of view. This narrowing of the field of view may be described as crop factor, a factor by which a longer focal length lens would be needed to get the same field of view on a 35mm film camera. Full-frame digital SLRs utilize a sensor of the same size as a frame of 35mm film.\n\nCommon values for field of view crop in DSLRs using active pixel sensors include 1.3x for some Canon (APS-H) sensors, 1.5x for Sony APS-C sensors used by Nikon, Pentax and Konica Minolta and for Fujifilm sensors, 1.6 (APS-C) for most Canon sensors, ~1.7x for Sigma's Foveon sensors and 2x for Kodak and Panasonic 4/3-inch sensors currently used by Olympus and Panasonic. Crop factors for non-SLR consumer compact and bridge cameras are larger, frequently 4x or more.\n\nDigital cameras come in a wide range of sizes, prices and capabilities. In addition to general purpose digital cameras, specialized cameras including multispectral imaging equipment and astrographs are used for scientific, military, medical and other special purposes.\n\nCompact cameras are intended to be portable (pocketable) and are particularly suitable for casual \"snapshots\".\n\nMany incorporate a retractable lens assembly that provides optical zoom. In most models, an auto actuating lens cover protects the lens from elements. Most ruggedized or water-resistant models do not retract, and most with superzoom capability do not retract fully.\n\nCompact cameras are usually designed to be easy to use. Almost all include an automatic mode, or \"auto mode\", which automatically makes all camera settings for the user. Some also have manual controls. Compact digital cameras typically contain a small sensor which trades-off picture quality for compactness and simplicity; images can usually only be stored using lossy compression (JPEG). Most have a built-in flash usually of low power, sufficient for nearby subjects. A few high end compact digital cameras have a hotshoe for connecting to an external flash. Live preview is almost always used to frame the photo on an integrated LCD. In addition to being able to take still photographs almost all compact cameras have the ability to record video.\n\nCompacts often have macro capability and zoom lenses, but the zoom range (up to 30x) is generally enough for candid photography but less than is available on bridge cameras (more than 60x), or the interchangeable lenses of DSLR cameras available at a much higher cost. Autofocus systems in compact digital cameras generally are based on a contrast-detection methodology using the image data from the live preview feed of the main imager. Some compact digital cameras use a hybrid autofocus system similar to what is commonly available on DSLRs. \n\nTypically, compact digital cameras incorporate a nearly silent leaf shutter into the lens but play a simulated camera sound for skeuomorphic purposes.\n\nFor low cost and small size, these cameras typically use image sensor formats with a diagonal between 6 and 11 mm, corresponding to a crop factor between 7 and 4. This gives them weaker low-light performance, greater depth of field, generally closer focusing ability, and smaller components than cameras using larger sensors. Some cameras use a larger sensor including, at the high end, a pricey full-frame sensor compact camera, such as Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1, but have capability near that of a DSLR.\n\nA variety of additional features are available depending on the model of the camera. Such features include GPS, compass, barometers and altimeters. \n\nStarting in 2011, some compact digital cameras can take 3D still photos. These 3D compact stereo cameras can capture 3D panoramic photos with dual lens or even single lens for play back on a 3D TV.\n\nIn 2013, Sony released two add-on camera models without display, to be used with a smartphone or tablet, controlled by a mobile application via WiFi.\n\nRugged compact cameras typically include protection against submersion, hot and cold conditions, shock and pressure. Terms used to describe such properties include waterproof, freezeproof, heatproof, shockproof and crushproof, respectively. Nearly all major camera manufacturers have at least one product in this category. Some are waterproof to a considerable depth up to 82 feet (27 m); others only 10 feet (3m), but only a few will float. Ruggeds often lack some of the features of ordinary compact camera, but they have video capability and the majority can record sound. Most have image stabilization and built-in flash. Touchscreen LCD and GPS do not work under water.\n\nGoPro and other brands offer action cameras which are rugged, small and can be easily attached to helmet, arm, bicycle, etc. Most have wide angle and fixed focus, and can take still pictures and video, typically with sound.\n\nThe rising popularity of action cameras is in line with many people desiring to share photos or videos in social media. Many competitive manufacturers of action cameras results in many options and lowered, competitive prices, and nowadays, cameras are sold bundled with waterproof housings, accessories, and mountings compatible with the popular GoPro.\n\nThe 360-degree camera can take picture or video 360 degrees using two lenses back-to-back and shooting at the same time. Some of the cameras are Ricoh Theta S, Nikon Keymission 360 and Samsung Gear 360. Nico360 was launched in 2016 and claimed as the world's smallest 360-degree camera with size 46 x 46 x 28 mm (1.8 x 1.8 x 1.1 in) and price less than $200. With virtual reality mode built-in stitching, Wifi, and Bluetooth, live streaming can be done. Due to it also being water resistant, the Nico360 can be used as action camera.\n\nThere are tend that action cameras have capabilities to shoot 360 degrees with at least 4K resolution.\n\nBridge cameras physically resemble DSLRs, and are sometimes called DSLR-shape or DSLR-like. They provide some similar features but, like compacts, they use a fixed lens and a small sensor. Some compact cameras have also PSAM mode. Most use live preview to frame the image. Their usual autofocus is by the same contrast-detect mechanism as compacts, but many bridge cameras have a manual focus mode and some have a separate focus ring for greater control.\n\nBig physical size and small sensor allow superzoom and wide aperture. Bridge cameras generally include an image stabilization system to enable longer handheld exposures, sometimes better than DSLR for low light condition.\n\nAs of 2014, bridge cameras come in two principal classes in terms of sensor size, firstly the more traditional 1/2.3\" sensor (as measured by image sensor format) which gives more flexibility in lens design and allows for handholdable zoom from 20 to 24mm (35mm equivalent) wide angle all the way up to over 1000 mm supertele, and secondly a 1\" sensor that allows better image quality particularly in low light (higher ISO) but puts greater constraints on lens design, resulting in zoom lenses that stop at 200mm (constant aperture, e.g. Sony RX10) or 400mm (variable aperture, e.g. Panasonic Lumix FZ1000) equivalent, corresponding to an optical zoom factor of roughly 10 to 15.\n\nSome bridge cameras have a lens thread to attach accessories such as wide-angle or telephoto converters as well as filters such as UV or Circular Polarizing filter and lens hoods. The scene is composed by viewing the display or the electronic viewfinder (EVF). Most have a slightly longer shutter lag than a DSLR. Many of these cameras can store images in a raw format in addition to supporting JPEG. The majority have a built-in flash, but only a few have a hotshoe.\n\nIn bright sun, the quality difference between a good compact camera and a digital SLR is minimal but bridge cameras are more portable, cost less and have a greater zoom ability. Thus a bridge camera may better suit outdoor daytime activities, except when seeking professional-quality photos.\n\nIn late 2008, a new type of camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC), which uses various sensors and offers lens interchangeability. These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system. MILC camera models are available with various sensor sizes including: a small 1/2.3 inch sensor, as is commonly used in bridge cameras such as the original Pentax Q (more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger 1/1.7 inch sensor); a 1-inch sensor; a Micro Four Thirds sensor; an APS-C sensor such as the Sony NEX series, Fujifilm X series, Pentax K-01, and Canon EOS M; and some, such as the Sony α7, use a full frame (35 mm) sensor and even Hasselblad X1D is the first medium format MILC. Some MILC cameras have a separate electronic viewfinder. In other cameras the back display is used as a viewfinder in same way as in compact cameras. A disadvantage of MILC compared to DSLR is battery life due to the energy consumption of the electronic viewfinder.\n\nOlympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses which are fully compatible each other without any adapter, while the others have proprietary mounts. In 2014, Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera.\n\n, MILC cameras are available which appeal to both amateurs and professionals.\n\nWhile most digital cameras with interchangeable lenses feature a lens-mount of some kind, there are also a number of modular cameras, where the shutter and sensor are incorporated into the lens module.\n\nThe first such modular camera was the Minolta Dimâge V in 1996, followed by the Minolta Dimâge EX 1500 in 1998 and the Minolta MetaFlash 3D 1500 in 1999. In 2009, Ricoh released the Ricoh GXR modular camera.\n\nAt CES 2013, Sakar International announced the Polaroid iM1836, an 18 MP camera with 1\"-sensor with interchangeable sensor-lens. An adapter for Micro Four Thirds, Nikon and K-mount lenses was planned to ship with the camera.\n\nThere are also a number of add-on camera modules for smartphones called lens-style cameras (lens camera). They contain all components of a digital camera in a module, but lack a viewfinder, display and most of the controls. Instead they can be mounted to a smartphone and use its display and controls. Lens-style cameras include:\n\nDigital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) use a reflex mirror that can reflect the light and also can swivel from one position to another position and back to initial position. By default, the reflex mirror is set 45 degree from horizontal, blocks the light to the sensor and reflects light from the lens to penta-mirror/prism at the DSLR camera and after some reflections arrives at the viewfinder. The reflex mirror is pulled out horizontally below the penta-mirror/prism when shutter release is fully pressed, so the viewfinder will be dark and the light/image can directly strike the sensor at the time of exposure (speed setting).\n\nAutofocus is accomplished using sensors in the mirror box. Some DSLRs have a \"live view\" mode that allows framing using the screen with image from the sensor.\n\nThese cameras have much larger sensors than the other types, typically 18 mm to 36 mm on the diagonal (crop factor 2, 1.6, or 1). The larger sensor permits more light to be received by each pixel; this, combined with the relatively large lenses provides superior low-light performance. For the same field of view and the same aperture, a larger sensor gives shallower focus.\nThey use interchangeable lenses for versatility. Usually some lenses are made for digital SLR use only, but recent trend the lenses can also be used in detachable lens video camera with or without adapter.\n\nA DSLT uses a fixed translucent mirror instead of a moving reflex mirror as in DSLR. A translucent mirror or transmissive mirror or semi-transparent mirror is a mirror which reflects the light to two things at the same time. It reflects it along the path to a pentaprism/pentamirror which then goes to an optical view finder (OVF) as is done with a reflex mirror in DSLR cameras. The translucent mirror also sends light along a second path to the sensor. The total amount of light is not changed, just some of the light travels one path and some of it travels the other. The consequences are that DSLT cameras should shoot a half stop differently from DSL. One advantage of using a DSLT camera is the blind moments a DSLR user experiences while the reflecting mirror is moved to send the light to the sensor instead of the viewfinder do not exist for DSLT cameras. Because there is no time at which light is not traveling along both paths, DSLT cameras get the benefit of continuous auto-focus tracking. This is especially beneficial for burst mode shooting in low-light conditions and also for tracking when taking video.\n\nUntil early 2014, only Sony had released DSLT cameras. By March 2013, Sony had released more DSLTs than DSLRs with a relatively complete lenses line-up.\n\nA rangefinder is a device to measure subject distance, with the intent to adjust the focus of a camera's objective lens accordingly (open-loop controller). The rangefinder and lens focusing mechanism may or may not be coupled. In common parlance, the term \"rangefinder camera\" is interpreted very narrowly to denote manual-focus cameras with a visually-read out optical rangefinder based on parallax. Most digital cameras achieve focus through analysis of the image captured by the objective lens and distance estimation, if it is provided at all, is only a byproduct of the focusing process (closed-loop controller).\n\nA line-scan camera traditionally has a single row of pixel sensors, instead of a matrix of them. The lines are continuously fed to a computer that joins them to each other and makes an image. This is most commonly done by connecting the camera output to a frame grabber which resides in a PCI slot of an industrial computer. The frame grabber acts to buffer the image and sometimes provide some processing before delivering to the computer software for processing.\n\nMultiple rows of sensors may be used to make colored images, or to increase sensitivity by TDI (Time delay and integration).\nMany industrial applications require a wide field of view. Traditionally maintaining consistent light over large 2D areas is quite difficult. With a line scan camera all that is necessary is to provide even illumination across the “line” currently being viewed by the camera. This makes possible sharp pictures of objects that pass the camera at high speed.\n\nSuch cameras are also commonly used to make photo finishes, to determine the winner when multiple competitors cross the finishing line at nearly the same time. They can also be used as industrial instruments for analyzing fast processes.\n\nLinescan cameras are also extensively used in imaging from satellites (see push broom scanner). In this case the row of sensors is perpendicular to the direction of satellite motion. Linescan cameras are widely used in scanners. In this case, the camera moves horizontally.\n\nStand alone cameras can be used as remote camera. One kind weighs 2.31 ounces (65.5 g), with a periscope shape, IPx7 water-resistance and dust-resistance rating and can be enhanced to IPx8 by using a cap. They have no viewfinder or LCD. Lens is a 146 degree wide angle or standard lens, with fixed focus. It can have a microphone and speaker, And it can take photos and video. As a remote camera, a phone app using Android or iOS is needed to send live video, change settings, take photos, or use time lapse.\n\nMany devices have a built-in digital camera, including, for example, smartphones, mobile phones, PDAs and laptop computers. Built-in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format.\n\nMobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 camera phones outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.\n\nSales of traditional digital cameras have declined due to the increasing use of smartphones for casual photography, which also enable easier manipulation and sharing of photos through the use of apps and web-based services. \"Bridge cameras\", in contrast, have held their ground with functionality that most smartphone cameras lack, such as optical zoom and other advanced features. DSLRs have also lost ground to Mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC)s offering the same sensor size in a smaller camera. A few expensive ones use a full-frame sensor as DSLR professional cameras.\n\nIn response to the convenience and flexibility of smartphone cameras, some manufacturers produced \"smart\" digital cameras that combine features of traditional cameras with those of a smartphone. In 2012, Nikon and Samsung released the Coolpix S800c and Galaxy Camera, the first two digital cameras to run the Android operating system. Since this software platform is used in many smartphones, they can integrate with services (such as e-mail attachments, social networks and photo sharing sites) as smartphones do, and use other Android-compatible software as well.\n\nIn an inversion, some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras. Nokia released the 808 PureView and Lumia 1020 in 2012 and 2013; the two devices respectively run the Symbian and Windows Phone operating systems, and both include a 41-megapixel camera (along with a camera grip attachment for the latter). Similarly, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 Zoom, having a 16-megapixel camera and 10x optical zoom, combining traits from the Galaxy S4 Mini with the Galaxy Camera. Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1 is an Android KitKat 4.4 smartphone with 20MP, 1\" sensor, the largest sensor for a smartphone ever, with Leica fixed lens equivalent of 28mm at F2.8, can take RAW image and 4K video, has 21mm thickness. Furthermore, in 2018 Huawei P20 Pro is an android Oreo 8.1 has triple Leica lenses in the back of the smartphone with 40MP 1/1.7\" RGB sensor as first lens, 20MP 1/2.7\" monochrome sensor as second lens and 8MP 1/4\" RGB sensor with 3x optical zoom as third lens. Combination of first lens and second lens will produce bokeh image with larger high dynamic range, whereas combination of mega pixel first lens and optical zoom will produce maximum 5x digital zoom without loss of quality by reducing the image size to 8MP.\n\nLight-field cameras were introduced in 2013 with one consumer product and several professional ones.\n\nAfter a big dip of sales in 2012, consumer digital camera sales declined again in 2013 by 36 percent. In 2011, compact digital cameras sold 10 million per month. In 2013, sales fell to about 4 million per month. DSLR and MILC sales also declined in 2013 by 10–15% after almost ten years of double digit growth.\nWorldwide unit sales of digital cameras is continuously declining from 148 million in 2011 to 58 million in 2015 and tends to decrease more in the following years.\n\nFilm camera sold got the peak at 36.671 million units in 1997 and digital camera sold began in 1999. In 2008, film camera market was dead and digital camera sold got the peak by 121.463 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phone with camera has been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with camera sold 80 million units per year. In 2011 the cell phone with camera sold hundreds of millions per year, when digital camera sold initialized to decline. In 2015, digital camera sold is 35.395 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sold number in a peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number in a peak.\n\nMany digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:-\n\n\n\nA common alternative is the use of a card reader which may be capable of reading several types of storage media, as well as high speed transfer of data to the computer. Use of a card reader also avoids draining the camera battery during the download process. An external card reader allows convenient direct access to the images on a collection of storage media. But if only one storage card is in use, moving it back and forth between the camera and the reader can be inconvenient. Many computers have a card reader built in, at least for SD cards.\n\nMany modern cameras support the PictBridge standard, which allows them to send data directly to a PictBridge-capable computer printer without the need for a computer.\n\nWireless connectivity can also provide for printing photos without a cable connection.\nAn \"instant-print camera\", is a digital camera with a built-in printer. This confers a similar functionality as an instant camera which uses instant film to quickly generate a physical photograph. Such non-digital cameras were popularized by Polaroid in 1972.\n\nMany digital cameras include a video output port. Usually sVideo, it sends a standard-definition video signal to a television, allowing the user to show one picture at a time. Buttons or menus on the camera allow the user to select the photo, advance from one to another, or automatically send a \"slide show\" to the TV.\n\nHDMI has been adopted by many high-end digital camera makers, to show photos in their high-resolution quality on an HDTV.\n\nIn January 2008, Silicon Image announced a new technology for sending video from mobile devices to a television in digital form. MHL sends pictures as a video stream, up to 1080p resolution, and is compatible with HDMI.\n\nSome DVD recorders and television sets can read memory cards used in cameras; alternatively several types of flash card readers have TV output capability.\n\nCameras can be equipped with a varying amount of environmental sealing to provide protection against splashing water, moisture (humidity and fog), dust and sand, or complete waterproofness to a certain depth and for a certain duration. The latter is one of the approaches to allow underwater photography, the other approach being the use of waterproof housings. Many waterproof digital cameras are also shockproof and resistant to low temperatures.\n\nSome waterproof cameras can be fitted with a waterproof housing to increase the operational depth range. The Olympus 'Tough' range of compact cameras is an example.\n\nMany digital cameras have preset modes for different applications. Within the constraints of correct exposure various parameters can be changed, including exposure, aperture, focusing, light metering, white balance, and equivalent sensitivity. For example, a portrait might use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content.\n\nMany camera phones and most stand alone digital cameras store image data in flash memory cards or other removable media. Most stand-alone cameras use SD format, while a few use CompactFlash or other types. In January 2012, a faster XQD card format was announced. In early 2014, some high end cameras have two hot-swapable memory slots. Photographers can swap one of the memory card with camera-on. Each memory slot can accept either Compact Flash or SD Card. All new Sony cameras also have two memory slots, one for its Memory Stick and one for SD Card, but not hot-swapable.\n\nA few cameras used other removable storage such as Microdrives (very small hard disk drives), CD single (185 MB), and 3.5\" floppy disks. Other unusual formats include:\nMost manufacturers of digital cameras do not provide drivers and software to allow their cameras to work with Linux or other free software. Still, many cameras use the standard USB storage protocol, and are thus easily usable. Other cameras are supported by the gPhoto project.\n\nThe Joint Photography Experts Group standard (JPEG) is the most common file format for storing image data. Other file types include Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) and various Raw image formats.\n\nMany cameras, especially high-end ones, support a raw image format. A raw image is the unprocessed set of pixel data directly from the camera's sensor, often saved in a proprietary format. Adobe Systems has released the DNG format, a royalty-free raw image format used by at least 10 camera manufacturers.\n\nRaw files initially had to be processed in specialized image editing programs, but over time many mainstream editing programs, such as Google's Picasa, have added support for raw images. Rendering to standard images from raw sensor data allows more flexibility in making major adjustments without losing image quality or retaking the picture.\n\nFormats for movies are AVI, DV, MPEG, MOV (often containing motion JPEG), WMV, and ASF (basically the same as WMV). Recent formats include MP4, which is based on the QuickTime format and uses newer compression algorithms to allow longer recording times in the same space.\n\nOther formats that are used in cameras (but not for pictures) are the Design Rule for Camera Format (DCF), an ISO specification, used in almost all camera since 1998, which defines an internal file structure and naming. Also used is the Digital Print Order Format (DPOF), which dictates what order images are to be printed in and how many copies. The DCF 1998 defines a logical file system with 8.3 filenames and makes the usage of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.\n\nMost cameras include Exif data that provides metadata about the picture. Exif data may include aperture, exposure time, focal length, date and time taken, and location.\n\nDigital cameras have become smaller over time, resulting in an ongoing need to develop a battery small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time.\n\nDigital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries. , most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available.\n\nThe most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats. These are built to a manufacturer's custom specifications. Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion. In addition to being available from the OEM, aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models.\n\nDigital cameras that utilize off-the-shelf batteries are typically designed to be able to use both single-use disposable and rechargeable batteries, but not with both types in use at the same time. The most common off-the-shelf battery size used is AA. CR2, CR-V3 batteries, and AAA batteries are also used in some cameras. The CR2 and CR-V3 batteries are lithium based, intended for a single use. Rechargeable RCR-V3 lithium-ion batteries are also available as an alternative to non-rechargeable CR-V3 batteries.\n\nSome battery grips for DSLRs come with a separate holder to accommodate AA cells as an external power source.\n\nWhen digital cameras became common, many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be converted to digital. The answer was yes and no. For the majority of 35 mm film cameras the answer is no, the reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.\n\nMany early professional SLR cameras, such as the Kodak DCS series, were developed from 35 mm film cameras. The technology of the time, however, meant that rather than being digital \"backs\" the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large, bulky digital units, often bigger than the camera portion itself. These were factory built cameras, however, not aftermarket conversions.\n\nA notable exception is the Nikon E2 and Nikon E3, using additional optics to convert the 35mm format to a 2/3 CCD-sensor.\n\nA few 35 mm cameras have had digital camera backs made by their manufacturer, Leica being a notable example. Medium format and large format cameras (those using film stock greater than 35 mm), have a low unit production, and typical digital backs for them cost over $10,000. These cameras also tend to be highly modular, with handgrips, film backs, winders, and lenses available separately to fit various needs.\n\nThe very large sensor these backs use leads to enormous image sizes. For example, Phase One's P45 39 MP image back creates a single TIFF image of size up to 224.6 MB, and even greater pixel counts are available. Medium format digitals such as this are geared more towards studio and portrait photography than their smaller DSLR counterparts; the ISO speed in particular tends to have a maximum of 400, versus 6400 for some DSLR cameras. (Canon EOS-1D Mark IV and Nikon D3S have ISO 12800 plus Hi-3 ISO 102400 with the Canon EOS-1Dx's ISO of 204800)\n\nIn the industrial and high-end professional photography market, some camera systems use modular (removable) image sensors. For example, some medium format SLR cameras, such as the Mamiya 645D series, allow installation of either a digital camera back or a traditional photographic film back.\n\n\nLinear array cameras are also called scan backs.\n\n\nMost earlier digital camera backs used linear array sensors, moving vertically to digitize the image. Many of them only capture grayscale images. The relatively long exposure times, in the range of seconds or even minutes generally limit scan backs to studio applications, where all aspects of the photographic scene are under the photographer's control.\n\nSome other camera backs use CCD arrays similar to typical cameras. These are called single-shot backs.\n\nSince it is much easier to manufacture a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts. For example, you could buy an (albeit expensive) camera back with over 7,000 pixel horizontal resolution in the mid-1990s. However, , it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution. Rotating line cameras, with about 10,000 color pixels in its sensor line, are able, , to capture about 120,000 lines during one full 360 degree rotation, thereby creating a single digital image of 1,200 Megapixels.\n\nMost modern digital camera backs use CCD or CMOS matrix sensors. The matrix sensor captures the entire image frame at once, instead of incrementing scanning the frame area through the prolonged exposure. For example, Phase One produces a 39 million pixel digital camera back with a 49.1 x 36.8 mm CCD in 2008. This CCD array is a little smaller than a frame of 120 film and much larger than a 35 mm frame (36 x 24 mm). In comparison, consumer digital cameras use arrays ranging from 36 x 24 mm (full frame on high end consumer DSLRs) to 1.28 x 0.96 mm (on camera phones) CMOS sensor.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17557746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17557746", "title": "Fascinus", "text": "Fascinus\n\nIn ancient Roman religion and magic, the fascinus or fascinum was the embodiment of the divine phallus. The word can refer to the deity himself (Fascinus), to phallus effigies and amulets, and to the spells used to invoke his divine protection. Pliny calls it a \"medicus invidiae\", a \"doctor\" or remedy for envy (\"invidia\", a \"looking upon\") or the evil eye.\n\nThe English word \"fascinate\" ultimately derives from Latin \"fascinum\" and the related verb \"fascinare\", \"to use the power of the \"fascinus\"\", that is, \"to practice magic\" and hence \"to enchant, bewitch\" Catullus uses the verb at the end of \"Carmen 7\", a hendecasyllabic poem addressing his lover Lesbia; he expresses his infinite desire for kisses that cannot be counted by voyeurs nor \"fascinated\" (put under a spell) by a malicious tongue; such bliss, as also in \"Carmen\" 5, potentially attracts \"invidia\".\n\nFescennine Verses, the satiric and often lewd songs or chants performed on various social occasions, may have been so-named from the \"fascinum\"; ancient sources propose this etymology along with an alternative origin from Fescennia, a small town in Etruria.\n\nThe Vestal Virgins tended the cult of the \"fascinus populi Romani\", the sacred image of the phallus that was one of the tokens of the safety of the state \"(sacra Romana)\". It was thus associated with the Palladium. Roman myths, such as the begetting of Servius Tullius, suggest that this phallus was an embodiment of a masculine generative power located within the hearth, regarded as sacred. When a general celebrated a triumph, the Vestals hung an effigy of the \"fascinus\" on the underside of his chariot to protect him from \"invidia\".\n\nAugustine, whose primary source on Roman religion was the lost theological works of Marcus Terentius Varro, notes that a phallic image was carried in procession annually at the festival of Father Liber, the Roman god identified with Dionysus or Bacchus, for the purpose of protecting the fields from \"fascinatio\", magic compulsion:\n\nAs a divinized phallus, Fascinus shared attributes with Mutunus Tutunus, whose shrine was supposed to date from the founding of the city, and the imported Greek god Priapus.\n\nPhallic charms, often winged, were ubiquitous in Roman culture, appearing as objects of jewellery such as pendants and finger rings, relief carvings, lamps, and wind chimes (\"tintinnabula\"). \"Fascinus\" was thought particularly to ward off evil from children, mainly boys, and from conquering generals. The protective function of the phallus is usually related to the virile and regenerative powers of an erected phallus, though in most cases the emotion, shame, or laughter created by obscenity is the power that diverts the evil eye.\n\nThere are very few Roman images of people wearing a phallic charm. Varro notes the custom of hanging a phallic charm on a baby's neck, and examples have been found of phallus-bearing rings too small to be worn except by children. A 2017 experimental archaeology project suggested that some types of phallic pendant were designed to remain pointing outwards, in the direction of travel of the wearer, in order to face towards any potential danger or bad luck and nullify it before it could affect the wearer. Other symbols may have been interchangeable with the phallus, such as the club of Hercules.\n\nThe victory of the phallus over the power of the evil eye may be represented by the phallus ejaculating towards a disembodied eye. This motif is shown in several examples of Roman art. For example, the motif is known from multiple relief sculptures from Leptis Magna in present-day Libya, as well as several instances on Hadrian's Wall. A 1st-century BC terracotta figurine shows \"two little phallus-men sawing an eyeball in half.\"\n\nThe \"fist and phallus\" amulet was prevalent amongst soldiers. These are phallic pendants with a representation of a (usually) clenched fist at the bottom of the shaft, facing away from the glans. Several examples show the fist making the \"manus fica\" or \"fig sign\", a symbol of good luck. The largest known collection comes from Camulodunum. Some examples of the fist-and-phallus amulets incorporate vulvate imagery as well as an extra apotropaic device.\n\n"}

Although credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was written by John Lennon.\n\nAccording to Lennon, the title came from a magazine cover that producer George Martin showed him: \"I think he showed me a cover of a magazine that said 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun.' It was a gun magazine. I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something.\" The gun magazine derived the phrase from the bestselling book by \"Peanuts\" cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, \"Happiness is a Warm Puppy\".\n\nLennon said he \"put together three sections of different songs ... it seemed to run through all the different kinds of rock music...\" and described it as a miniature \"history of rock and roll.\" This results in a three-part through-composed structure. The song begins with surreal imagery allegedly taken from an acid trip that Lennon and Derek Taylor experienced, with Taylor contributing the opening lines. The three sections of the song were described by Lennon as \"the dirty old man...the junkie...and the gunman.\"\n\n\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\" reportedly is Paul McCartney's and was George Harrison's favourite song on the White Album. Although tensions were high among the band during the album's recording sessions, they reportedly collaborated as a close unit to work out the song's challenging rhythmic and metre issues. Recording of the song began at 7 pm in Studio Two at EMI Studios in London on 23 September 1968, continued over the following two nights, with daytime breaks, and was completed at 5 am on 26 September. Piano, electronic organ and tuba parts in this recording are unattributed; the tuba was all but removed through mixing. George Martin was on holiday while this song was recorded, and had left a note asking Chris Thomas to take over as producer.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\nMany different interpretations of the song have been offered. Some writers have suggested that the \"warm gun\" could refer to Lennon's sexual desire for Yoko Ono. In his 1980 \"Playboy\" interview Lennon admitted to the double meaning of guns and sexuality but denied that the song had anything to do with drugs: \"that was the beginning of my relationship with Yoko and I was very sexually oriented then.\" American and British censors were unhappy with the song, and it was banned by the BBC.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6324050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6324050", "title": "Hellfire (song)", "text": "Hellfire (song)\n\n\"Hellfire\" is a song from Disney's 1996 animated feature \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\". The song is sung by the film's main antagonist, Judge Claude Frollo, who is voiced by Tony Jay.\n\nWhen sinful thoughts regarding the beautiful Romani woman Esmeralda enter Frollo's mind, he \"panics and seeks to rid himself of [its] source\". This internal struggle prompts \"Hellfire\", which has been described as \"one of the best Disney villain songs of all time\". Frollo \"confronts his lusting for Esmeralda, blaming her for turning towards darkness, and pleading to be saved\". He sings \"destroy Esmeralda, and let her taste the fires of hell, or else let her be mine and mine alone\" while the image of Esmeralda \"provocatively dances in front of him\".\n\nThis \"scene of lust and longing\" that the song is centered on received much press coverage at the time of the film's release, along with the alterations made to give the film a \"G\" rating.\n\nThe song was intended to contrast with the song \"Heaven's Light\", which was sung by Quasimodo moments earlier, expressing his desire for love and hope that Esmeralda may love him, while \"Hellfire\" focuses on Frollo's internal conflict between his feelings of lust for her and his piety and hatred of the Gypsies.\n\nBoth songs, which are sometimes referred to collectively as \"Heaven's Light\"/\"Hellfire\" (for example on the soundtrack, in which it is track 7), describe two opposing views towards the same woman. Quasimodo sees love as \"Heaven's Light\" and expresses a pure hope for Esmeralda, while Frollo feels only lust for her and therefore views her as a \"Hellfire\".\n\nSimon Brew of \"Den of Geek!\" argues that throughout the song Frollo goes through a similar kind of torture that Quasimodo puts himself through in \"Heaven's Light\".\n\nUnderlining the strong link between the two songs, the Norwegian version enclosed them in one track, giving only one title: \"Himmel og Helvete\" meaning \"Heaven and Hell\".\nIt begins in B flat major, before turning to its relative minor G. It soon modulates briefly into C minor, then F major, has a spoken intersection where the bass lies on A, dominant of D minor, the key in which the song finally ends.\n\n\"Hellfire\" contains parts of the Confiteor, a Latin prayer of confession used by the Roman Catholic Church. This prayer begins directly after \"Heaven's Light\" and serves as the introduction to \"Hellfire\". It also provides counterpoint material throughout the song, whose ending also contains the \"Kyrie Eleison\".\n\nThe instrumental accompaniment to the song serves as a musical motif that alters in tone depending on the action. As well as some variations heard early on (such as in \"The Bells of Notre Dame\"), this motif \"informs much of the score that chronologically follows in the film.\" Reviewer Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks.com adds that \"both 'Paris Burning' and 'Sanctuary!' explicitly continue the instrumental backdrop and Latin chanting of 'Hellfire', a sound that becomes more general in 'And He Shall Smite the Wicked'.\" Also, \"the opening fanfare is also reintroduced at the end of 'Heaven's Light', makes up the melody during the chorus of 'Hellfire', and plays in the instrumental 'Sanctuary!'\"\n\nThe beginning of the song starts with the Archdeacon swinging the incense-filled thurible, as he and his altar servers walk through Notre Dame, chanting the beginning of the Confiteor. The camera pans upwards to the famous rose window, and flies through it and over Paris, revealing that all the lights in the city are going out as people are turning in for the night. The only light that remains is the light in the Palace of Justice where Frollo looks out at Notre Dame from his window, singing to the Virgin Mary (whom he addresses as \"Beata Maria\", in Latin) about how she knows he is \"a righteous man\" and purer than \"the common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd\". Frollo walks to the fireplace and fearfully asks Mary to tell him why he lusts for Esmeralda if he is pure. During this, a fire apparition of Esmeralda dances provocatively in the flames.\n\nDuring the second verse, Frollo steps back from the fireplace, revealing a piece of silk that Esmeralda had used to tease him earlier in the film. Frollo sings about how he lusts for her and resents her for it. He accuses her of turning him to sin and denies his own culpability as red-hooded figures rise from the floor, chanting \"mea culpa\" (\"my fault\"). Frollo runs through the chamber, with the cloaked figures standing on either side of him. He desperately pleads with them for forgiveness, claiming that Esmeralda had cast a spell on him and tempted him. He asks if it is in a part of God's plan that God made the Devil stronger than \"a man,\" though in reality this refers to (Frollo) himself. The hooded figures turn into flames, wrapping Frollo as they return to the fireplace as if he was being dragged down into Hell, thereby foreshadowing his fate.\n\nFrollo continues singing, pleading to Mary to rescue him from Esmeralda's voluptuous temptations that would lead to his eternal damnation. He holds out the scarf and clenches it angrily, stating that Esmeralda must choose him or burn. The fire apparition of Esmeralda reappears, but her provocative dancing is replaced by her shriek-filled writhing as she is about to burn. A smoke apparition of Esmeralda emerges from the fireplace (pictured above), and as it and Frollo embrace passionately, there is a knock at the door. The apparition disappears as a guard enters, informing Frollo that Esmeralda escaped from the Cathedral of Notre Dame where Frollo had \"imprisoned\" her. Frollo vows to find her, even if it involves burning down all of Paris. The guard then leaves, and Frollo continues singing, claiming that he will give Esmeralda an ultimatum: she must choose to be his lover or she will burn. Frollo then throws Esmeralda's scarf into the fireplace, symbolically burning her as well.\n\nIn the final verse, Frollo backs up against a wall, and asks God to have mercy on both him and Esmeralda, implying that he ultimately knows that his actions are against God's will. As he sings, shadowy figures holding crucifixes emerge from the light of the fireplace and fly past Frollo, who then drops to his knees, saying that Esmeralda will be his lover or she will burn. Finishing the song, Frollo passes out and falls face down on the floor in the shape of a crucifix as the fire fades.\n\nThe producers of Disney's adaptation of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" stated that they felt that the \"Hellfire\" scene was important in portraying Frollo as he was in Victor Hugo's original novel. They hoped that this sequence would be one of the greatest animated sequences ever produced. Frollo was animated by Kathy Zielinski and the sequence was storyboarded by French animators Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi, who were the heads of the Walt Disney Feature Animation satellite studio in Montreuil, France. The elements of fire, smoke, and shadows in the sequence required significant support from the Feature Animation visual effects department. According to one of the film's directors, Kirk Wise, Frollo's song \"Hellfire\" needed a visual sequence more meaningful and powerful than past Disney animated features, akin to the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence in Disney's \"Fantasia\" (1940), which depicted the devil Chernabog rallying his demons for a single night.\n\nIn the audio commentary on \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" DVD, Wise described his fear that he would have to plead with Feature Animation chairman Roy E. Disney and Walt Disney Company CEO Michael Eisner to let them do the sequence. The two executives ended up enjoying the idea, and no plea was needed.\n\nWise also indicated that he and visual effects artistic supervisor Chris Jenkins wanted to make sure the \"fire-spirit\" shots of Esmeralda in the sequence would not endanger the film's possibilities of earning a \"G\" rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Thus, they went through every frame to ensure that Esmeralda's figure was fully clothed at all times, despite her provocative dancing.\n\nThe Latin Chant in the background is the Confiteor, which is a Catholic penitential prayer recited during Mass as an \"admission of guilt and wrongdoing\". There is a sense of dramatic irony throughout the song as Frollo sings \"It's not my fault / I'm not to blame / It is the gypsy girl / The witch who sent this flame / It's not my fault / If in God's plan / He made the devil so much / Stronger than a man\", to which the priests (at this point of the song represented by ominous red-hooded figures) reply in a counterpoint melody with \"Mea culpa\", Latin for \"My fault\", or \"Mea maxima culpa\", meaning \"My most grievous fault\".\n\nAn analysis at \"Disney and the Seven Deadly Sins\" suggests that the Confiteor chant \"manifest[s] as his conscience\", and reveals to Frollo \"the truth of his actions in regard to lust,\" which is \"a craving for sexual intimacy,\" leading him to self-indulgence. This \"desire for the flesh of another\" is a sin, which Frollo struggles over until the very end of his life. Even \"when Frollo prepares to burn Esmeralda at the stake in front of the cathedral he offers Esmeralda a chance to live if she agrees to be his lover.\" The article \"\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\": The House of the Lord\" in \"The Gospel According to Disney\" suggests that \"Frollo is tortured by his lust for Esmeralda, an unrequited passion that curdles into obsessive hatred\", and argues that Frollo \"prays to be delivered from his sin, prostrating himself before a roaring fire, with a cross above it,\" and while being presented with two paths, he ultimately chooses lust which leads to his downfall. This sin of the villain is compared to Jafar's greed for power at the end of \"Aladdin\". When Frollo is about to kill Quasimodo and Esmeralda, he quotes a biblical verse (supporting the notion that he justifies his wrongdoings as God's will): \"And He shall smite the wicked and plunge them into the fiery pit!\" \"The Gospel According to Disney\" describes what happens next as follows, \"Just then, the judge falls to his own death [a pit of fire], in an act of divine intervention.\"\n\nJim Miles of Laughingplace.com analyses \"Hellfire\" by saying that the song marks the turning point when \"Frollo's hate for the gypsies has taken on a new dimension\", and is \"no longer about ending vice and sin [but] about fulfilling his own desires\". The scarf he takes from Esmeralda \"symboli[zes] the physical manifestation of his desire for [her]\", and the resulting internal struggle is illustrated in the song. His life's work involves making the city of Paris \"pure and righteous\", and no matter how much he wants to be too, he sees a \"flame...burning within him\" and so turns to God (represented by Mary in the song, notable that in his lust he prays to the Holy Virgin) to \"help him overcome those feelings\". However throughout his pleading, he holds onto the scarf, thereby holding onto the sin. He tries to rationalize the sin before the \"judges of his heart\", and seems to be returned to purity, but after the judges disappear the temptation returns. Though he sings \"Protect me, Maria\" with \"repentant agony on his face\", he stares into the fireplace and holds onto the scarf, giving into temptation. After being \"interrupted by the soldier, he makes a decision within his heart to hold on to the sin\". Because the \"desire [is now] firmly rooted [within him], he is able to throw away the scarf - the external representation of his inner feelings - into the fire as he has fully accepted this persona. After doing this, he \"realizes his mistake, and visually, we see the spiritual battle for his soul--crosses rising above shadowy spiritual figures--but even then, he reconfirms his resolution and proclaims that \"she will be mine or she will burn.\"\n\nSean Griffin in his work \"Tinker Belles and Evil Queens: The Walt Disney Company from the Inside Out\" says that Frollo's hate for Esmeralda seems to stem from his hatred of his own feelings. His shame of \"turning to sin\" overwhelms him, and he turns to blaming and punishing others. He says that although Frollo's lust for Esmeralda is strictly heterosexual, his behaviour \"mirrors conclusions from studies about homophobia...unconscious conflicts about one's own sexuality or gender identity.\" He argues that \"Frollo's grim determinations to punish Esmeralda [throughout 'Hellfire']\" are sparked from his own denial that he has \"'urges' that fall outside the rigid parameters of social acceptance.\"\n\nMiles argues that the \"Archdeacon acts as a foil for Frollo\" because through his \"caring for Quasimodo's dead mother, he exhibits the kindness and love that God calls all Christians to, which is what Frollo fails to understand\". He shows Esmeralda compassion while Frollo only feels contempt towards her. He also \"does what Frollo should have done\" by \"direct[ing] her attention to God.\" The climax of this is when \"he leads a prayer in Latin that calls upon God, Mary, the archangel Michael, the apostles, the saints, and...the Father, for forgiveness of sin in thought, word, and deed.\" This leads straight into \"Hellfire\". Miles says that \"while the Archdeacon turns from sin, Frollo chooses to toy with sin.\"\n\nThere is a juxtaposition of imagery between Heaven and Hell between the two parts of \"Heaven's Lights\"/\"Hellfire\".\n\nThe LaserDisc provided the song demo for \"Hellfire\", as well as for \"The Bells of Notre Dame\" and \"Out There\".\n\nThe song was universally acclaimed, and it is considered to be one of the highlights of the soundtrack to \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" which in turn received mixed reviews. The general consensus is that if the direction taken with \"Hellfire\" had been taken for the other songs, the film as a whole would have been substantially better.\n\nIn a review of the film's soundtrack, Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks.com stated that \"the darkest depths of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" exist in 'Hellfire', one of the most stunning visual and aural combinations in animation history.\" Though the film was aimed at children as well as adults, Clemmensen comments that the \"constantly frightening Latin chants and a heavy string, timpani, and choral bass\" scared the younger demographic (despite attempts at lighthearted music and humour to dilute the film). He argues that if Disney had fully embraced the dark nature of the source material by building the soundtrack upon numbers like \"Hellfire\" and \"Sanctuary!\", \"the film could have been a brilliant adult feature.\" He says the \"spattering of comedy pieces\", which include three \"silly songs\", are \"a significant detriment to the gains of the aforementioned themes and performances\", and ultimately cause both the film and soundtrack to be a \"mixed bag.\" Pieces such as \"Hellfire\" are \"serious, dramatically brilliant [and among] some of Menken's very best work.\" Later on in his review, Clemmensen notes the Latin mass which leads into \"[Tony] Jay's hauntingly deep performance of Frollo's torment,\" and adds that it \"produc[es] a song so overwhelmingly compelling in an evil sense that it alone was worth the cost of admission (and the album).\"\n\nJim Miles of Laughingplace.com says that \"Frollo's passionate pleading\" is \"visually astounding, masterfully conceived and animated,\" and the \"standout\" of the film. He adds that \"accompanied by intense music of agony and complex lyrics of psychological revelation, 'Hellfire' is everything a musical scene aspires to be.\" Reviewer Kenneth E. Rathburn said the song's \"grandeur... contributes and fulfills\" more than other songs, such as \"A Guy Like You\", making it one of the better tracks. Jack Smith of the BBC describes the tone (set by the opening number) as \"an unholy marriage of the Tridentine Mass and Les Mis.\" He says the score, \"driven by hysterical choirs and crashing percussion\" is most effective in \"Hellfire\". The \"San Antonio Express-News\" described it as \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\"s \"true show-stopping tune.\" Simon Brew of \"Den of Geek!\" says the suffering Frollo goes through in this song makes him a \"far more rounded villain.\" He describes \"Hellfire\" as \"a stunning piece of work, with the visuals and music working in complete tandem.\"\n\nInternet comedian Doug Walker, a fan of the movie, named it the No. 1 villain song on his list of the top 11 villain songs.\n\nThe song is considered to be one of the darkest in any Disney film, depicting Hell, sin, damnation, and lust; examples of subject matter that would generally be considered inappropriate for children. This song and visual sequence prompted the ratings board to consider a PG rating for the film. In its defense, Disney claimed that its adaptation of \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" was intended to play as much to adult audiences as it would to children. The studio attempted to produce an animated film with an audience broader than only children: the main target audience of Disney animated features.\n\nIn \"Film Genre 2000: New Critical Essays\", film critic Marc Miller said that \"Hellfire\" \"was too much for many adults,\" which prompted reviewers such as Mark Silver of \"The Los Angeles Times\" to say things like: \"[\"Hunchback\" is] a beautiful powerful film that I would not recommend to children under eight or nine years old.\"\n\nAnimator Floyd Norman recalled the pitching session for the musical, in which Menken and Schwartz were \"on hand to perform the songs that would grace the production.\" He recalls \"Hellfire\" \"clearly ha[ving] the executives squirming nervously,\" wondering if this material could be in a Disney film.\n\nThe \"Hellfire\" subplot, \"involving the villain’s need to desire to screw and/or murder the heroine because of his guilt-ridden lustings for her,\" which was described as \"a cross between \"Schindler’s List\" and \"Sweeney Todd\"\" by Scott Mendelson of HollywoodNews.com, was also referred to by him as one of the Disney events such as Mufasa being killed onscreen in \"The Lion King\", that surprisingly were given \"G-ratings from the MPAA back in the 1990s,\" which Mendelson uses as context when discussing \"Tangled\"s PG rating.\n\nReligious conservatives boycotted \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" due to this song, which they said was \"a suggestive rejection of purity amplified by imagery of a half-naked Esmeralda dancing in a fire.\"\n\n"}

As a child, he would put on puppet shows as a creative outlet. Cranko received his early ballet training in Cape Town under the leading South African ballet teacher and director, Dulcie Howes, of the University of Cape Town Ballet School. In 1945 he choreographed his first work (using Stravinsky's Suite from \"The Soldier's Tale\") for the Cape Town Ballet Club. He then moved to London, studying with the Sadler's Wells Ballet School in 1946 and dancing his first role with the Sadler's Wells Ballet in November 1947.\n\nCranko collaborated with the designer John Piper on \"Sea Change\", performed at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin in July 1949. They collaborated again for Sadler's Wells Ballet on \"The Shadow\", which opened on 3 March 1953. This period marked a transition in Cranko's career from dancer to full-time choreographer, with his last performance for the Sadler's Wells Ballet taking place in April 1950. At 23 years old, he was appointed as resident choreographer for Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet's 1950–51 season.\n\nFor the company's Festival of Britain season in 1951 Cranko choreographed the comic ballet \"Pineapple Poll\", to the music of Arthur Sullivan (newly out of copyright) arranged by the conductor Charles Mackerras. Another collaboration with Mackerras followed in 1954 with \"The Lady and the Fool\", to music by Verdi. In January 1954 Sadler's Wells Ballet announced that Cranko was collaborating with Benjamin Britten to create a ballet. Cranko devised a draft scenario for a work he originally called \"The Green Serpent\", fusing elements drawn from \"King Lear\", \"Beauty and the Beast\" (a story he had choreographed for Sadler's Wells in 1948) and the oriental tale published by Madame d'Aulnoy as \"Serpentin Vert\". Creating a list of dances, simply describing the action and giving a total timing for each, he passed this to Britten and left him to compose what eventually became \"The Prince of the Pagodas\".\n\nCranko wrote and developed a musical revue \"Cranks\", which opened in London in December 1955, moved to a West End theatre the following March, and ran for 223 performances. With music by John Addison, its cast of four featured the singers Anthony Newley, Annie Ross, Hugh Bryant and the dancer Gilbert Vernon; it transferred to Broadway at the Bijou Theatre. An original cast CD has been released. Cranko followed the format of \"Cranks\" with a new revue \"New Cranks\" opening at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith on 26 April 1960 with music by David Lee and a cast including Gillian Lynne, Carole Shelley and Bernard Cribbins, but it failed to have the same impact.\n\nIn 1960, Cranko directed the first production of Benjamin Britten's opera \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", at the Aldeburgh Festival. When the work had its London premiere the following year at Covent Garden, Cranko was not invited to direct, and Sir John Gielgud was brought in.\n\nProsecuted for homosexual activity, Cranko left the UK for Stuttgart, and in 1961 was appointed director of the Stuttgart Ballet, where he assembled a group of talented performers such as Marcia Haydée, Egon Madsen, Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil and Suzanne Hanke. Among his following choreographies were \"Romeo and Juliet\" by William Shakespeare in 1962, set to music by Prokofiev, \"Onegin\" in 1965, an adaptation of the verse novel \"Eugene Onegin\" by Alexander Pushkin, set to music by Tchaikovsky (mainly \"The Seasons\"), orchestrated by Kurt-Heinz Stolze, \"The Taming of the Shrew\" by Shakespeare in 1969, \"Brouillards\" in 1970, \"Carmen\" in 1971 (music by Wolfgang Fortner and Wilfried Steinbrenner) and \"Spuren (Traces)\" in 1973.\n\nCranko's work was a major contribution to the international success of German ballet beginning with a guest performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1969. At Stuttgart, Cranko invited Kenneth MacMillan to work with the company, for whom MacMillan created four ballets in Cranko's lifetime and a fifth, \"Requiem\", as a tribute after Cranko's death. At Cranko's instigation the company established its own ballet school in 1971; it was renamed the John Cranko Schule in his honour in 1974. His assistant and choreologist Georgette Tsinguirides preserved his works in Benesh Movement Notation.\n\nCranko choked to death after suffering an allergic reaction to a sleeping pill he took during a transatlantic charter flight from Philadelphia to Stuttgart two days after the company completed a successful tour of the United States at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. The flight made an emergency landing in Dublin where Cranko was pronounced dead upon arrival at a hospital. His mother, Grace, who was divorced from Herbert and lived in what was then Rhodesia, heard about his death from a radio broadcast. Cranko was buried at a small cemetery near Castle Solitude in Stuttgart.\n\nIn 2007, the Stuttgart Ballet celebrated what would have been Cranko's 80th birthday with the Cranko Festival. The ballet \"Voluntaries\" by Glen Tetley was created in his memory. The John Cranko Society in Stuttgart, founded in 1975, promotes knowledge of ballet and Cranko's work, supports performances and talented dancers, and every year presents the John Cranko Award.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19178289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19178289", "title": "Libro de Alexandre", "text": "Libro de Alexandre\n\nThe Libro de Alexandre is a medieval Spanish epic poem about Alexander the Great written between 1178 and c. 1250 in the \"mester de clerecía\". It is largely based on the \"Alexandreis\" of Walter of Châtillon, but also contains many fantastical elements common to the Alexander romance. It consists of 2,675 stanzas of \"cuaderna vía\" and 10,700 lines. \nThe \"Libro\" is preserved in two manuscripts, called \"P\" and \"O\", neither of which appears to be an original. There are as well three fragments preserved in separate manuscripts. Manuscript \"O\" is the earlier, copied around 1300, and includes 2,510 stanzas of \"cuaderna vía\" and two epistles. It was once owned by the Duke of Osuna (whence \"O\") and was known to the Marqués de Santillana. \"P\", from Paris, was copied in the fifteenth century and contains 2,639 stanzas. It is generally more reliable and together the two manuscripts make a coherent whole. R. S. Willis, Jr., produced an edition of both manuscripts where a page from \"O\" faces the corresponding page from \"P\", with fragments noted at the bottom, so that one reading can readily be corrected by the other text. \"O\" is generally considered to be from eastern Castile, while \"P\" was copied in western Castile. The fragment \"G′\" is named after Gutierre Díez de Gamés, who included stanzas from the first part of the \"Libro\" in his early fifteenth-century \"Victorial\". \n\nThe date of composition is uncertain. However, it must postdate 1178, the earliest year when Walter completed the \"Alexandreis\", and predate 1250, the approximate date of the \"Poema de Fernán González\", which it influences. Some scholars have fixed the date as between 1202 and 1207. Besides the \"Alexandreis\", the author of the \"Libro\" claimed many sources. In his own words: \"el uno que leyemos, el otro que oyemos / de las mayores cosas Recabdo vos daremos\" (\"the one that we read, the other that we hear / of the greatest things collected we give you\"). These sources include the \"Historia de proeliis\" of Leo of Naples and several ancient authorities, including Leo's source, Quintus Curtius, Flavius Josephus, and the \"Pindarus Thebanus\". The work of Isidore of Seville and the Old French \"Roman d'Alexandre\" were also consulted. \n\nStructurally the \"Libro\" is a chronological story of Alexander's life set between an introduction in six stanzas and a conclusion in seven. There are digressions and authorial displays of erudition, but the narrative, from birth to death, is logical and smooth. The problem of authorship is unresolved. It has been variously attributed to Juan Lorenzo de Astorga (sometimes thought to be merely a scribe), Alfonso X of Castile, and Gonzalo de Berceo.\n\nFollowing is a sample text from the \"Libro\", with translations in Modern Spanish and English. This fragment sums up the fall of Alexander because of his pride.\n\n"}

It was released by Knopf in 2005. It was the first book written by Ellis to use past tense narrative. The title bears no relation to the public amusement locations known as Luna Park.\n\nThe novel begins with an inflated and parodic but reasonably accurate portrayal of Ellis's early fame. It details incidents of his rampant drug use and his publicly humiliating book tours to promote \"Glamorama\". The novel dissolves into fiction as Ellis describes a liaison with an actress named Jayne Dennis, whom he later marries, and with whom he conceives a child. From this point, the fictional Ellis' life reflects the real writer's only in some descriptions of the past and possibly in his general sentiments.\n\nEllis and Jayne move to fictional Midland, an affluent suburban town outside New York City, which they no longer consider safe due to pervasive terrorist acts in a post-9/11 America. Fictional incidents include suicide bombings in Wal-Marts and a dirty bomb detonated in Florida. Strange incidents start happening on a Halloween night, some involving a Terby doll belonging to Ellis's fictional stepdaughter Sarah.\n\nAs the novel progresses, the haunting of Ellis's house and questions over the death of his father become increasingly prominent. With his history of drug use and alcoholism, his wife, children and housekeeper are understandably skeptical of his claims that the house is haunted. Unfolding events only very gradually reveal a much more complicated situation than a simple haunting. There is a dynamic interplay between the author's dead father, the house itself and specific negative associations buried within the author's own subconscious mind. Added to all of this is the very late-breaking and almost gratuitous insinuation that Robby, the narrator's young son, may somehow be at the epicenter of all these events.\n\nSeveral of the characters are fictionalized portrayals of real people. Most notable among these is Ellis himself, but others include friend and fellow author Jay McInerney and Ellis's late father.\n\n\nEllis finished writing the novel in the summer of 2004. Ellis said the book was an homage to Stephen King and the comic books he loved as a child.\n\nEllis told the \"Manchester Evening News\" that the Terby \"is based on a Furby but also there was this bird-like doll that my older sister had and I wrote a short story about it when I was 7 or 8. She used to scare me with it, I'd go to my bedroom and get into bed and it'd be there, she'd hide it there just to scare me. Or I'd be walking up the stairs and she'd chase me with it. And I think that's what I was channelling and it fitted in to all the other things that I was haunted by.” The revelation that 'Terby' is in fact 'Y Bret' (Why, Bret?) spelt backwards is an homage to the \"redrum\" (murder spelt backwards) plot device in King's \"The Shining\".\n\nThe book carries an epigraph from Hamlet 1.v.98. This connects with the theme of haunting by a father as well as the names in the book (e.g. Elsinore, Osric, Fortinbras).\n\nThe novel was nominated for a World Fantasy Award in the Best Novel category in 2004.\n\n"}

{"id": "928523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=928523", "title": "Miniature (illuminated manuscript)", "text": "Miniature (illuminated manuscript)\n\nThe word miniature, which is derived from the Latin verb \"miniare\" (\"to colour with \"minium\",\" a red lead) is a small illustration used to decorate an ancient or medieval illuminated manuscript; the simple illustrations of the early codices having been miniated or delineated with that pigment. The generally small scale of the medieval pictures has led secondly to an etymological confusion of the term with minuteness and to its application to small paintings, especially portrait miniatures, which did however grow from the same tradition and at least initially used similar techniques.\n\nApart from the Western and Byzantine traditions, there is another group of Asian traditions, which is generally more illustrative in nature, and from origins in manuscript book decoration also developed into single-sheet small paintings to be kept in albums, which are also called miniatures, as the Western equivalents in watercolor and other mediums are not. These include Persian miniatures, and their Mughal, Ottoman and other Indian offshoots.\n\nThe earliest extant miniatures are a series of colored drawings or miniatures cut from the Ambrosian Iliad, an illustrated manuscript of the \"Iliad\" from the 3rd century. They are similar in style and treatment with the pictorial art of the later Roman classical period. In these pictures there is a considerable variety in the quality of the drawing, but there are many notable instances of fine figure-drawing, quite classical in sentiment, showing that the earlier art still exercised its influence. Such indications, too, of landscape as are to be found are of the classical type, not conventional in the sense of medieval conventionalism, but still attempting to follow nature, even if in an imperfect fashion; just as in the Pompeian and other frescoes of the Roman age.\n\nOf even greater value from an artistic point of view are the miniatures of the Vatican manuscript of Virgil, known as the Vergilius Vaticanus, of the early 5th century. They are in a more perfect condition and on a larger scale than the Ambrosian fragments, and they therefore offer better opportunity for examining method and technique. The drawing is quite classical in style, and the idea is conveyed that the miniatures are direct copies from an older series. The colors are opaque: indeed, in all the miniatures of early manuscripts the employment of body color was universal. The method followed in placing the different scenes on the page is highly instructive of the practice followed, as we may presume, by the artists of the early centuries. It seems that the background of the scene was first painted in full, covering the whole surface of the page; then, over this background were painted the larger figures and objects; and over these again the smaller details in front of them were superimposed. (The painter's algorithm.) Again, for the purpose of securing something like perspective, an arrangement of horizontal zones was adopted, the upper ones containing figures on a smaller scale than those below.\n\nIt was reserved for the Byzantine school to break away more decidedly from the natural presentment of things and to develop artistic conventions. Yet in the best early examples of this school the classical sentiment still lingers, as the relics of the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis, and the best of the miniatures of the Vienna Dioscurides testify; and in the miniatures of the later Byzantine manuscripts, which were copied from earlier examples, the reproduction of the models is faithful. But on comparing the miniatures of the Byzantine school generally with their classical predecessors, one has a sense of having passed from the open air into the cloister. Under the restraint of ecclesiastical domination Byzantine art became more and more stereotyped and conventional. The tendency grows to paint the flesh-tints in swarthy hues, to elongate and emaciate the limbs, and to stiffen the gait. Browns, blue-greys and neutral tints are in favor. Here we first find the technical treatment of flesh-painting which afterwards became the special practice of Italian miniaturists, namely the laying on of the actual flesh-tints over a ground of olive, green or other dark hue. Landscape, such as it was, soon became quite conventional, setting the example for that remarkable absence of the true representation of nature which is such a striking attribute of the miniatures of the Middle Ages.\n\nAnd yet, while the ascetic treatment of the miniatures obtained so strongly in Byzantine art, at the same time the Oriental sense of splendour shows itself in the brilliancy of much of the coloring and in the lavish employment of gold. In the miniatures of Byzantine manuscripts are first seen those backgrounds of bright gold which afterwards appear in such profusion in the productions of every western school of painting.\n\nThe influence of Byzantine art on that of medieval Italy is obvious. The early mosaics in the churches of Italy, such as those at Ravenna and Venice, also afford examples of the dominating Byzantine influence. But the early Middle Ages provide but few landmarks to guide the student; and it is only when he emerges into the 12th century, with its frescoes and miniatures still bearing the impress of the Byzantine tradition, that he can be satisfied that the connection has always existed during the intervening centuries.\n\nIn the native schools of illumination of Western Europe, decoration only was the leading motive. In the manuscripts of the Merovingian period, in the school which connected Frankland and northern Italy, and which is known as Lombardic or Franco-Lombardic, in the manuscripts of Spain, in the productions of the Insular art of the British Isles, figure-drawing was scarcely known, serving rather as a feature of decoration than as a representation of the human form.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon school, developed especially at Canterbury and Winchester, which probably derived its characteristic free-hand drawing from classical Roman models, scarcely influenced by the Byzantine element. The highest qualities of the miniatures of the 10th and 11th century of this school lie in fine outline drawing, which had a lasting influence on the English miniature of the later centuries. But the southern Anglo-Saxon school rather stands apart from the general line of development of the western medieval miniature.\n\nUnder the Carolingian monarchs there developed a school of painting derived from classical models, chiefly of the Byzantine type. In this school, which owed its origin to the encouragement of Charlemagne, it is seen that the miniature appears in two forms. First, there is the truly conventional miniature following the Byzantine model, the subjects being generally the portraits of the Four Evangelists, or portraits of the emperors themselves: the figures formal; the pages brilliantly colored and gilded, generally set in architectural surroundings of a fixed type, and devoid of landscape in the real sense of the word. Accompanied as it was with profuse decoration in border and initial, it set the pattern for the later Continental schools of the West. On the other hand, there is also the miniature in which there is an attempt at illustration, as, for example, the depicting of scenes from the Bible. Here there is more freedom; and we trace the classical style which copies Roman, as distinguished from Byzantine, models.\n\nThe influence which the Carolingian school exercised on the miniatures of the southern Anglo-Saxon artists shows itself in the extended use of body-color and in the more elaborate employment of gold in the decoration. Such a manuscript as the Benedictional of St. Æthelwold, bishop of Winchester, 963 to 984, with its series of miniatures drawn in the native style but painted in opaque pigments, exhibits the influence of the foreign art. But the actual drawing remained essentially national, marked by its own treatment of the human figure and by the disposition of the drapery with fluttering folds. The style was refined, tending to exaggeration and disproportion of the limbs. With the Norman Conquest this remarkable native school died.\n\nWith the awakening of art in the 12th century the decoration of manuscripts received a powerful impulse. The artists of the time excelled in the border and the initial, but in the miniature also there was vigorous drawing, with bold sweeping lines and careful study of the draperies. The artists grew more practiced in figure-drawing, and while there was still the tendency to repeat the same subjects in the same conventional manner, individual effort produced in this century many miniatures of a very noble character.\n\nThe Norman Conquest had brought England directly within the fold of Continental art; and now began that grouping of the French and the English and the Flemish schools, which, fostered by growing intercourse and moved by common impulses, resulted in the magnificent productions of the illuminators of north-western Europe from the latter part of the 12th century onwards.\n\nBut of natural landscape there is nothing, unless rocks and trees of a stereotyped character can be so regarded. Hence the background of the miniature of the 12th and immediately succeeding centuries became the field for decoration to throw into stronger relief the figures in the scene. And thus arose the practice of filling in the entire space with a sheet of gold, often burnished: a brilliant method of ornament which we have already seen practiced in the Byzantine school. We have also to notice the conventional treatment of the sacred figures, which continue henceforward, from a sense of veneration, to be clad in the traditional robes of the early centuries, while the other figures of the scene wear the ordinary dress of the period.\n\nUnder the patronage of Pala Dynasty miniature painting was introduced in India by painting on buddhist palm leaf manuscripts. One of the earliest surviving examples of Buddhist illustrated palm leaf manuscripts is Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā dated to 985 AD preserved in the University of Cambridge library. The art of Pala illuminated manuscripts developed in Buddhist centers of Bihar and Bengal. The Pala miniature paintings not only inspired Nepalese and Tibetan miniature paintings but also inspired hinduism and jainism to develop their own miniature painting traditions in the later period.\n\nEntering the 13th century, we reach the period when the miniature may be said to justify the modern false etymology which has connected the title with minuteness. The broad, bold style of the 12th century gives place to the precise and minute. Books in general exchanged their form from the large folio to the octavo and smaller sizes. There was a greater demand for books; and vellum was limited in quantity and had to go further. Handwriting grew smaller and lost the roundness of the 12th century. Contractions and abbreviations in the texts largely increased in number. Everywhere there is an effort to save space. And so with the miniature. Figures were small, with delicate strokes in the features and with neat slim bodies and limbs. The backgrounds blaze with color and burnished gold; and delicate diaper patterns of alternate gold and color abound. Frequently, and especially in English manuscripts, the drawings are merely tinted or washed with transparent colors. In this century, too, the miniature invades the initial. Whereas in the earlier periods bold flowering scrolls are the fashion, now a little scene is introduced into the blank spaces of the letter.\n\nTo compare the work of the three schools, the drawing of the English miniature, at its best, is perhaps the most graceful; the French is the neatest and the most accurate; the Flemish, including that of western Germany, is less refined and in harder and stronger lines. As to colors, the English artist affects rather lighter tints than those of the other schools: a partiality is to be observed for light green, for grey-blue, and for lake. The French artist loved deeper shades, especially ultramarine. The Fleming and the German painted, as a rule, in less pure colors and inclined to heaviness. A noticeable feature in French manuscripts is the red or copper-hued gold used in their illuminations, in strong contrast to the paler metal of England and the Low Countries.\n\nIt is remarkable how the art of the miniature throughout the 13th century maintains its high quality both in drawing and color without any very striking change. Throughout the century the Bible and the Psalter were in favor; and naturally the same subjects and the same scenes ran through the period and were repeated by artist after artist; and the very character of those sacred books would tend to restrain innovation. But towards the close of the period such secular works as the romances were growing in popularity, and afforded a wider field for the invention of the illustrating artist. Therefore, with the opening of the 14th century a palpable change of style supervenes. We pass to more flowing lines; not to the bold sweeping strokes and curves of the 12th century, but to a graceful, delicate, yielding style which produced the beautiful swaying figures of the period. In fact the miniature now begins to free itself from the role of an integral member of the decorative scheme of illumination and to develop into the picture, depending on its own artistic merit for the position it is to hold in the future. This is shown by the more prominent place that the miniature now assumes, and by its growing independence of the decorative border and initial.\n\nBut, at the same time, while the miniature of the 14th century thus strives to dissociate itself from the rest of the illuminated details of the manuscript, within itself it flourishes in decoration. Besides the greater elasticity of the figuredrawing, there is a parallel development in the designs of the backgrounds. The diapers become more elaborate and more brilliant; the beauty of the burnished gold is enhanced by the stippled patterns which are frequently worked upon it; the gothic canopies and other architectural features which it became the practice to introduce naturally followed the development of the architecture of the period. In a word, the great expansion of artistic sentiment in decoration of the best type, which is so prominent in the higher work of the 14th century, is equally conspicuous in the illuminated miniature.\n\nIn the early part of the century, English drawing is very graceful, the figures bending with a waving movement which, if they were not so simple, would be an affectation. Both in the outline specimens, washed with transparent color, and in the fully. painted examples, the best English work of this time is unsurpassed. French art still maintains its neat precision, the colors more vivid than those of England and the faces delicately indicated without much modelling. The productions of the Low Countries, still keeping to the heavier style of drawing, appear coarse beside the works of the other schools. Nor does German miniature art of this period hold a high position, being generally mechanical and of a rustic character. As time advances the French miniature almost monopolizes the field, excelling in brilliancy of coloring, but losing much of its purity of drawing although the general standard still remains high. The English school gradually retrogrades and, owing no doubt to political causes and to the wars with France, appears to have produced no work of much value. It is only towards the end of the 14th century that there is a revival.\n\nThis revival has been attributed to a connection with the flourishing school of Prague, a school which in the scheme of coloring suggests a southern influencefollowing on the marriage of Richard II with Anne of Bohemia in 1382. The new style of English miniature painting is distinguished by richness of color, and by the careful modelling of the faces, which compares favorably with the slighter treatment by the contemporary French artists. Similar attention to the features also marks the northern Flemish or Dutch school at this period and in the early 15th century; and it may therefore be regarded as an attribute of Germanic art as distinguished from the French style.\n\nThe promise of the new development in English miniature painting, however, was not to be fulfilled. In the first quarter of the 15th century, examples of great merit were produced, but at a standstill in drawing and fettered by medieval convention. The native art practically came to a close about the middle of the century, just when the better appreciation of nature was breaking down the old conventional representation of landscape in European art, and was transforming the miniature into the modern picture. Whatever miniature painting was to be produced in England after that time was to be the work of foreign artists or of artists imitating a foreign style. The condition of the country during the Wars of the Roses sufficiently accounts for the abandonment of art. Thus the history of the miniature in the 15th century must be sought in the manuscripts of the Continental schools.\n\nFirst we have to consider northern France and the Low Countries. As it passes out of the 14th and enters the 15th century, the miniature of both schools begins to exhibit greater freedom in composition; and there is a further tendency to aim rather at general effect by the coloring than neatness in drawing. This was encouraged by the wider field opened to the miniaturist. Books of all kinds were illustrated, and sacred books, Bibles and Psalters and liturgical books, were no longer the chief, if not the only, manuscripts which were illuminated. And yet there was one class of manuscript which came into the greatest prominence and which was at the same time liturgical. This was the \"Horae\", or Book of Hours, devotional books for individual use, which were multiplied in vast numbers and contained some of the finest work of the miniaturists. The decoration of these little volumes escaped in great measure from the conventional restraints which their religious character might have imposed. Furthermore, the demand for illuminated manuscripts had by this time established a regular trade; and their production was not confined, as formerly, to the cloister. Notable secular illuminated manuscript artists include Master Honoré of the Parisian school.\n\nEarly in the century the old conventional treatment of landscape still held its own; nor did the diapered and gilded background pass out of use. Indeed, in some of the finest French specimens of the time the diapered patterns are more brilliant than ever. But natural scenery in the second quarter of the century asserts itself more decidedly, although with faults in perspective. It was not until another generation had arisen that there was a true appreciation of the horizon and of atmospheric effect.\n\nThe miniatures of the French and Flemish schools run fairly parallel for a time, but after the middle of the century national characteristics become more marked and divergent. The French miniature began to deteriorate, though some very fine examples were produced by the more gifted artists of the school. The figure-drawing was more careless, and the painting tended to hardness without depth, which the artist endeavoured to relieve by an excess of gilt shading.\n\nThe Flemish school in the latter part of the 15th century attained to its highest excellence. The Flemish miniature affected extreme softness and depth of color; also an ever-increasing carefulness in the treatment of details, of the draperies, of the expression of the features: the Flemish type of the Virgin's face, for example, with its full, high forehead, can never be mistaken. In the best Flemish miniatures of the period the artist succeeds in presenting a wonderful softness and glow of color; nor did the high standard cease with the 15th century, for many excellent specimens still remain to attest the favor in which it was held for a few decades longer.\n\nIn the foregoing remarks what has been said in regard to the careful treatment of details applies still more to the miniatures executed in grisaille, in which the absence of color invited an even stronger accentuation of that treatment. This is perhaps most observable in the grisaille miniatures of northern Flanders, which often suggest, particularly in the strong angular lines of the draperies, a connection with the art of the wood engraver.\n\nThe Flemish miniature did not, however, hold the favor of western Europe without a rival. That rival had arisen in the south, and had come to perfection concurrently with the miniature of the Low Countries in the 15th century. This was the Italian miniature, which passed through the same stages as the miniatures of England and France and the Low Countries. Intercommunication between the countries of Europe was too well established for the case to be otherwise. In Italian manuscripts of the normal type the influence of Byzantine art is very manifest during the 13th and 14th centuries. The old system of painting the flesh tints upon olive green or some similar pigment, which is left exposed on the lines of the features, thus obtaining a swarthy complexion, continued to be practiced in a more or less modified form into the 15th century. As a rule, the pigments used are more opaque than those employed in the northern schools; and the artist trusted more to color alone to obtain the desired effect than to the mixture of color and gold which gave such brilliant results in the diapered patterns of France. The vivid scarlet of the Italian miniaturists is peculiarly their own. The figure-drawing is less realistic than the contemporary art of English and French manuscripts, the human form being often thick-set. In general, the Italian miniature, before its great expansion in the 14th century, is far behind the miniatures of the north. But with the 15th century, under the influence of the Renaissance, it advanced into the front rank and rivalled the best work of the Flemish school. The use of thicker pigments enabled the miniaturist to obtain the hard and polished surface so characteristic of his work, and to maintain sharpness of outline, without losing the depth and richness of color which compare with the same qualities in the Flemish school.\n\nThe Italian style was followed in the manuscripts of Provence in the 14th and 15th centuries. It had its effect, too, on the school of northern France, by which it was also influenced in turn. In the manuscripts of southern Germany it is also in evidence. But the principles which have been reviewed as guiding the development of the miniature in the more important schools apply equally to all. Like the miniature of the Flemish school, the Italian miniature was still worked to some extent with success, under special patronage, even in the 16th century; but with the rapid displacement of the manuscript by the printed book the miniaturist's occupation was brought to a close.\n\nPersian art has a long tradition of the use of miniatures.\n\nReza Abbasi (1565–1635), considered one of the most renowned Persian painters of all time, specialized in the Persian miniature, with a preference for naturalistic subjects. Today his surviving works can be found in many of the major museums of the Western world, such as the Smithsonian, the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nMughal painting developed during the period of the Mughal Empire (16th - 18th centuries) and was generally confined to miniatures either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums. It emerged from the Persian miniature painting tradition introduced to India by Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad in the mid 16th century. It soon moved away from its Safavid origins; with the influence of Hindu artists, colors became brighter and compositions more naturalistic. The subject matter was predominantly secular, mainly consisting of illustrations to works of literature or history, portraits of court members and studies of nature. At its height the Mughal painting style represented an elegant marriage of Persian, European, and Hindi art.\n\nMedieval miniatures have been forged to deceive collectors by various persons, most notably including the Spanish Forger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.\n\nA motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from filmmaking or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. \n\nPopular use of motion graphic design is used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction more entertaining. The graphics used in television show introductions will usually represent the tone of the program. For example, high action television shows will contain fast-paced and bold graphics in the openings.\n\nTechnological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as computer programs for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period.

An independent organization that promotes the development of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other fine arts, it is one of several Swedish Royal Academies. The Royal Institute of Art, an art school that was once an integral part of the Academy, was broken out in 1978 as an independent entity directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.\n\nIn 1735, Carl Gustaf Tessin set up a drawing school at Stockholm Castle, naming it the Royal Drawing Academy. It was modeled after French academies of the day as a gathering place for established artists and art connoisseurs. The painters Guillaume Taraval, Johan Henrik Scheffel, and Olof Arenius and the architect Carl Hårleman taught there, and the first group of students included Johan Pasch. \n\nIn 1766, the academy expanded its activities following a parliamentary decree. In 1768, its name was changed to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In 1773, King Gustav III wrote the first statutes for the academy's organization. At the time, the curriculum spanned architecture, graphics, anatomy, theory of perspective, and cultural history. The late 18th century is considered the first golden age of the Royal Academy, when great artists of the time such as Johan Tobias Sergel were elected as members and also taught there. In 1810, it was renamed again to Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (Swedish: \"Kungliga Akademien för de fria konsterna\"), the name it still bears today. \n\nBy the 1830s, there was beginning to be opposition to the Royal Academy's commitment to traditional academic art. In addition, while both men and women could be elected as members of the academy, at the time women could only study art by special permission before 1864, when women students where accepted. The Stockholm Art Association was formed to offer exhibition alternatives, and an Impressionist artist's group known as \"The Opponents\" arose as well.\n\nIn 1780, the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture moved from Stockholm Castle into a 17th palace designed by the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder on Fredsgatan street in the city center. In the years 1842–46 it was redesigned by the architect Fredrik Blom and an extension was added in 1893–96.\n\n\n"}

They are unusually large and elaborate examples of the type and are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and a scheduled monument.\n\nThe most recent and authoritative dating places the larger cross from the early part of the 9th century, and the smaller from about the middle of that century. Older theories, now outdated, included the view that they were erected to commemorate the conversion to Christianity of Peada of Mercia about 653. Other sources date them to the 9th century. The original site of the crosses is unknown and it is believed that they were brought to Sandbach in the Middle Ages. The earliest documentary evidence is by William Smith, the Rouge-Dragon Pursuivant at Arms of Elizabeth I, who was from Nantwich. In 1585 he wrote 'two square crosses of stone, on steps, with certain images and writings thereon graven <nowiki>[standing]</nowiki> hard together. Either after the Reformation or during the Civil War they were thrown down and their parts were scattered over a wide area. Larger pieces of the crosses were found as far away as Oulton and Tarporley while smaller pieces were found on various sites in Sandbach. In the early 19th century they were collected together and in 1816 were reassembled and erected under the direction of George Ormerod, the Cheshire historian.\n\nThe crosses now consist of two upright columns set in sockets on a base of three stepped stones. The northern cross is the taller and has a mutilated head. The southern cross is truncated and has a mutilated head from a different cross. The crosses have always been a pair and were carved by the same hand. They depict religious scenes, doll-like heads and beasts in panels, together with vine-scrolls, course interlace patterns and some dragons.\n\nOne of the Crosses (before restoration in 1816) appears in a watercolour by William Alexander, from which they were engraved by John Byrne and published in \"Britannia Depicta, Part III, Buckinghamshire and Cheshire\" (1810). Examples were sold at Sotheby's on 22 February 1977, and now appear in the UK's Government Art Collection. Prints and engravings are also found at the Cheshire Records Office.\n\nIn 2011, Foden's Band commissioned their Composer in Residence, Andy Scott, to write a piece for brass band called \"To the Ancient Crosses\", \"a vigorous and rhythmic description of the Saxon stone carved crosses in Sandbach market square\", and dedicated to Sandbach Town Council for their support of the band.\n\n\n"}

They are a concern in the process of typography and pagination, where it may be desirable to have a page break follow a section break for the sake of aesthetics or readability.\n\nIn fiction, sections often represent scenes, and accordingly the space separating them is sometimes also called a scene break.\n\nIn written narrative such as fiction, sections are not usually numbered or named. Section breaks are used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, point-of-view character, mood, tone, emotion, and pace. As a fiction-writing mode, the section break can be considered a transition, similar to a chapter break.\n\nSome documents, especially legal documents, may have numbered sections, such as \"Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" or \"Internal Revenue Code section 183\". The section sign (§) may be used to reference sections and subsections. Subsections are often written in lowercase Roman numerals, e.g. Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution.\n\nA document may also be considered to be divided into sections by its headings and subheadings, which may be used for a table of contents. For example, the hierarchical sections used in Wikipedia can be compiled into a table of contents for an article. Many books, however, only have chapter headings in the table of contents.\n\nWhile a chapter may be divided by section breaks, a group of chapters is conventionally called a \"part\", often identified with a Roman numeral, e.g. \"Part II\".\n\nReference material may be divided into sections. The section headers of a Chinese dictionary are one example.\n\nSpace between paragraphs in a section break is sometimes accompanied by an asterism (either proper ⁂ or manual * * *), a horizontal rule, fleurons, or other ornamental symbols. An ornamental symbol used as section break does not have a generally accepted name. Such a typographic device can be specifically referred to as \"dinkus\", \"space break symbol\", \"paragraph separator\", \"paragraph divider\", \"horizontal divider\", \"thought break\", or as an instance of \"filigree\" or \"flourish\". Ornamental section breaks can be created using glyphs, rows of lozenges, dingbats, or other miscellaneous symbols. Fonts such as Webdings and Wingdings include many such glyphs.\n\nIn HTML, horizontal rules can be generated using the codice_1 tag, which generates a paragraph-level thematic break. For more ornate presentation, CSS can be used to replace the line with an image.\n\n"}

{"id": "83076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83076", "title": "Sphinx", "text": "Sphinx\n\nA sphinx ( , Boeotian: , plural sphinxes or sphinges) is a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion.\n\nIn Greek tradition, it has the head of a human, the haunches of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a bird. It is mythicised as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its riddle suffer a fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten by this ravenous monster. This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of Oedipus. Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman, the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man (an androsphinx ()). In addition, the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.\n\nIn European decorative art, the sphinx enjoyed a major revival during the Renaissance. Later, the sphinx image, something very similar to the original Ancient Egyptian concept, was exported into many other cultures, albeit often interpreted quite differently, due to translations of descriptions of the originals and the evolution of the concept in relation to other cultural traditions.\n\nSphinxes depictions are generally associated with architectural structures such as royal tombs or religious temples. The oldest known sphinx was found near Gobekli Tepe at another site, Nevali Çori, or possibly 195 kilometres (120 mi) to the east at Kortik Tepe, Turkey, and was dated to 9,500 B.C.\n\nThe largest and most famous sphinx is the Great Sphinx of Giza, situated on the Giza Plateau adjacent to the Great Pyramids of Giza on the west bank of the Nile River and facing east (). The sphinx is located southeast of the pyramids. Although the date of its construction is uncertain, the head of the Great Sphinx now is believed to bear the likeness of the pharaoh Khafra.\n\nWhat names their builders gave to these statues is not known. At the Great Sphinx site, a 1400 B.C. inscription on a stele belonging to the 18th dynasty pharaoh Thutmose IV lists the names of three aspects of the local sun deity of that period, \"Khepera–Rê–Atum\". Many pharaohs had their heads carved atop the guardian statues for their tombs to show their close relationship with the powerful solar deity Sekhmet, a lioness. Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh Hatshepsut, with her likeness carved in granite, which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the alabaster sphinx of Memphis, Memphis, Egypt, currently located within the open-air museum at that site. The theme was expanded to form great avenues of guardian sphinxes lining the approaches to tombs and temples as well as serving as details atop the posts of flights of stairs to very grand complexes. Nine hundred sphinxes with ram heads, representing Amon, were built in Thebes, where his cult was strongest.\n\nThe Great Sphinx has become an emblem of Egypt, frequently appearing on its stamps, coins, and official documents.\n\nIn the Bronze Age, the Hellenes had trade and cultural contacts with Egypt. Before the time that Alexander the Great occupied Egypt, the Greek name, \"sphinx\", was already applied to these statues. The historians and geographers of Greece wrote extensively about Egyptian culture. Herodotus called the ram-headed sphinxes Criosphinxes and called the hawk-headed ones Hieracosphinxes.\n\nIn Greek mythology, a sphinx is represented as a monster with a head of a woman, the body of a lioness, the wings of an eagle, and a serpent-headed tail.\n\nThe word \"sphinx\" comes from the Greek Σφίγξ, apparently from the verb σφίγγω (\"sphíngō\"), meaning \"to squeeze\", \"to tighten up\". This name may be derived from the fact that, in a pride of lions, the hunters are the lionesses, and kill their prey by strangulation, biting the throat of prey and holding them down until they die. However, the historian Susan Wise Bauer suggests that the word \"sphinx\" was instead a Greek corruption of the Egyptian name \"shesepankh\", which meant \"living image\", and referred rather to the \"statue\" of the sphinx, which was carved out of \"living rock\" (rock that was present at the construction site, not harvested and brought from another location), than to the beast itself.\n\nThere was a single \"sphinx\" in Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck. According to Hesiod, she was a daughter of Orthrus and either Echidna or the Chimera, or perhaps even Ceto; according to others, she was a daughter of Echidna and Typhon. All of these are chthonic figures from the earliest of Greek myths, before the Olympians ruled the Greek pantheon. The Sphinx is called Phix (Φίξ) by Hesiod in line 326 of the Theogony, the proper name for the Sphinx noted by Pierre Grimal's \"The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology\".\n\nThe sphinx was the emblem of the ancient city-state of Chios, and appeared on seals and the obverse side of coins from the 6th century B.C. until the 3rd century CE.\n\nThe Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to the Greek city of Thebes, asking a riddle to travellers to allow them passage. The exact riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the myth, and was not standardized as the one given below until late in Greek history.\nIt was said in late lore that Hera or Ares sent the Sphinx from her Aethiopian homeland (the Greeks always remembered the foreign origin of the Sphinx) to Thebes in Greece where she asked all passersby the most famous riddle in history: \"Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?\" She strangled and devoured anyone who could not answer. Oedipus solved the riddle by answering: \"Man—who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age\". By some accounts (but much more rarely), there was a second riddle: \"There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?\" The answer is \"day and night\" (both words—\"ἡμέρα\" and \"νύξ\", respectively—are feminine in Ancient Greek). This second riddle is also found in a Gascon version of the myth and could be very ancient.\n\nBested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. In both cases, Oedipus can therefore be recognized as a \"liminal\" or threshold figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, Olympian gods.\n\nIn Jean Cocteau's retelling of the Oedipus legend, \"The Infernal Machine\", the Sphinx tells Oedipus the answer to the riddle in order to kill herself so that she did not have to kill anymore, and also to make him love her. He leaves without ever thanking her for giving him the answer to the riddle. The scene ends when the Sphinx and Anubis ascend back to the heavens.\n\nThere are mythic, anthropological, psychoanalytic and parodic interpretations of the Riddle of the Sphinx, and of Oedipus's answer to it. Sigmund Freud describes \"the question of where babies come from\" as a riddle of the Sphinx.\n\nNumerous riddle books use the Sphinx in their title or illustrations.\n\nMichael Maier, in his book the \"Atalanta Fugiens\" (1617) writes the following remark about the Sphinx's riddle, in which he states that its solution is the Philosopher's Stone:\nSphinx is indeed reported to have had many Riddles, but this offered to Oedipus was the chief, \"What is that which in the morning goeth upon four feet; upon two feet in the afternoon; and in the Evening upon three?\" What was answered by Oedipus is not known. But they who interpret concerning the Ages of Man are deceived. For a Quadrangle of Four Elements are of all things first to be considered, from thence we come to the Hemisphere having two lines, a Right and a Curve, that is, to the White Luna; from thence to the Triangle which consists of Body, Soul and Spirit, or Sol, Luna and Mercury. Hence Rhasis in his Epistles, \"The Stone,\" says he, \"is a Triangle in its essence, a Quadrangle in its quality.\"\n\nA composite mythological being with the body of a lion and the head of a human being is present in the traditions, mythology and art of South and Southeast Asia. Variously known as \"purushamriga\" (Sanskrit, \"man-beast\"), \"purushamirugam\" (Tamil, \"man-beast\"), \"naravirala\" (Sanskrit, \"man-cat\") in India, or as \"nara-simha\" (Sanskrit, \"man-lion\") in Sri Lanka, \"manusiha\" or \"manuthiha\" (Pali, \"man-lion\") in Myanmar, and \"norasingh\" (from Pali, \"man-lion\", a variation of the Sanskrit \"nara-simha\") or \"thep norasingh\" (\"man-lion deity\"), or \"nora nair\" in Thailand.\n\nIn contrast to the sphinxes in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece, of which the traditions largely have been lost due to the discontinuity of the civilization, the traditions related to the \"Asian sphinxes\" are very much alive today. The earliest artistic depictions of \"sphinxes\" from the South Asian subcontinent are to some extent influenced by Hellenistic art and writings. These hail from the period when Buddhist art underwent a phase of Hellenistic influence. Numerous sphinxes can be seen on the gateways of Bharhut stupa, dating to the 1st Century B.C.\n\nIn South India, the \"sphinx\" is known as \"purushamriga\" (Sanskrit) or \"purushamirugam \" (Tamil), meaning \"human-beast\". It is found depicted in sculptural art in temples and palaces where it serves an apotropaic purpose, just as the \"sphinxes\" in other parts of the ancient world. It is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. It is therefore often found in a strategic position on the gopuram or temple gateway, or near the entrance of the Sanctum Sanctorum.\nThe \"purushamriga\" plays a significant role in daily as well as yearly ritual of South Indian Shaiva temples. In the shodhasha-upakaara (or sixteen honors) ritual, performed between one and six times at significant sacred moments through the day, it decorates one of the lamps of the diparadhana or lamp ceremony. And in several temples the \"purushamriga\" is also one of the \"vahana\" or vehicles of the deity during the processions of the Brahmotsava or festival.\n\nIn Kanya Kumari district, in the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, during the night of Shiva Ratri, devotees run 75 kilometres while visiting and worshiping at twelve Shiva temples. This Shiva Ottam (or Run for Shiva) is performed in commemoration of the story of the race between the Sphinx and Bhima, one of the heroes of the epic \"Mahabharata\".\n\nThe Indian conception of a sphinx that comes closest to the classic Greek idea is in the concept of the \"Sharabha\", a mythical creature, part lion, part man and part bird, and the form of Sharabha that god Shiva took on to counter Narasimha's violence.\n\nIn Sri Lanka the sphinx is known as \"narasimha\" or man-lion. As a sphinx, it has the body of a lion and the head of a human being, and is not to be confused with Narasimha, the fourth reincarnation of the deity Vishnu; this avatar or incarnation is depicted with a human body and the head of a lion. The \"sphinx\" narasimha is part of the Buddhist tradition and functions as a guardian of the northern direction and also was depicted on banners.\n\nIn Burma, the sphinx is known as \"manussiha\" (\"manuthiha\"). It is depicted on the corners of Buddhist stupas, and its legends tell how it was created by Buddhist monks to protect a new-born royal baby from being devoured by ogresses.\n\nNora Nair, Norasingh and Thep Norasingh are three of the names under which the \"sphinx\" is known in Thailand. They are depicted as upright walking beings with the lower body of a lion or deer, and the upper body of a human. Often they are found as female-male pairs. Here, too, the sphinx serves a protective function. It also is enumerated among the mythological creatures that inhabit the ranges of the sacred mountain Himapan.\n\nThe revived Mannerist sphinx of the late 15th century is sometimes thought of as the \"French sphinx\". Her coiffed head is erect and she has the breasts of a young woman. Often she wears ear drops and pearls as ornaments. Her body is naturalistically rendered as a recumbent lioness. Such sphinxes were revived when the \"grottesche\" or \"grotesque\" decorations of the unearthed \"Domus Aurea\" of Nero were brought to light in late 15th-century Rome, and she was incorporated into the classical vocabulary of arabesque designs that spread throughout Europe in engravings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sphinxes were included in the decoration of the \"loggia\" of the Vatican Palace by the workshop of Raphael (1515–20), which updated the vocabulary of the Roman \"grottesche\".\n\nThe first appearances of sphinxes in French art are in the School of Fontainebleau in the 1520s and 1530s and she continues into the Late Baroque style of the French Régence (1715–1723). From France, she spread throughout Europe, becoming a regular feature of the outdoors decorative sculpture of 18th-century palace gardens, as in the Upper Belvedere Palace in Vienna, Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, La Granja in Spain, Branicki Palace in Białystok, or the late Rococo examples in the grounds of the Portuguese Queluz National Palace (of perhaps the 1760s), with ruffs and clothed chests ending with a little cape.\n\nSphinxes are a feature of the neoclassical interior decorations of Robert Adam and his followers, returning closer to the undressed style of the \"grottesche\". They had an equal appeal to artists and designers of the Romanticism and subsequent Symbolism movements in the 19th century. Most of these sphinxes alluded to the Greek sphinx and the myth of Oedipus, rather than the Egyptian, although they may not have wings.\n\nThe sphinx image also has been adopted into Masonic architecture. Among the Egyptians, sphinxes were placed at the entrance of the temples to guard their mysteries, by warning those who penetrated within that they should conceal a knowledge of them from the uninitiated. Champollion said that the sphinx became successively the symbol of each of the gods. The placement of the sphinxes expressed the idea that all the gods were hidden from the people, and that the knowledge of them, guarded in the sanctuaries, was revealed to initiates only. As a Masonic emblem, the sphinx has been adopted in its Egyptian character as a symbol of mystery, and as such often is found as a decoration sculptured in front of Masonic temples, or engraved at the head of Masonic documents. It cannot, however, be properly called an ancient, recognized symbol of the order. Its introduction has been of comparatively recent date, and rather as a symbolic decoration than as a symbol of any particular dogma. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar hybrid creatures\n\n\n\n"}

Variant forms such as \"Regio-Ducal Teatro\" and \"Teatro Regio Ducale\" are also seen. \n\nThe atmosphere in opera houses at the time was very sociable and congenial, and the Teatro Regio Ducal was no exception.

They are significant as revealing the development of linear perspective in early Italian Renaissance painting, and are unusual as a major secular commission. The paintings are in egg tempera on wooden panels, each over 3 metres long. According to the National Gallery, London, the panels were commissioned by a member of the Bartolini Salimbeni family in Florence sometime between 1435 and 1460. The paintings were much admired in the 15th century; Lorenzo de' Medici so coveted them that he purchased one and had the remaining two forcibly removed to the Palazzo Medici. They are now divided between three collections, the National Gallery, the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence, and the Musée du Louvre, Paris.\n\nThe three paintings are:\n\nThe Uffizi panel was probably designed to be the central painting of the triptych and is the only one signed by the artist. The sequence most widely agreed among art historians is: London, Uffizi, Louvre, although others have been proposed. They may represent different times of day: dawn (London), mid-day (Florence) and dusk (Paris) – the battle lasted eight hours. \n\nIn the London painting, Niccolò da Tolentino, with his large gold and red patterned hat, is seen leading the Florentine cavalry. He had a reputation for recklessness, and doesn't even wear a helmet, though he sent two messengers (the departure of the two messengers, depicted centre, top) to tell his allied army of Attendolo to hurry to his aid as he is facing a superior force. In the foreground, broken lances and a dead soldier are carefully aligned into orthogonals, so as to create an impression of perspective. Similar to that of a tapestry, the landscape rises up in a picture plane as opposed to receding deeply into space. This illusion of a backdrop and a perspective theme resembling a stage, depicts the war as a theatrical ceremony. The three paintings were designed to be hung high on three different walls of a room, and the perspective designed with that height in mind, which accounts for many apparent anomalies in the perspective when seen in photos or at normal gallery height.\n\nMany areas of the paintings were covered with gold and silver leaf. While the gold leaf, such as that found on the decorations of the bridles, has remained bright, the silver leaf, found particularly on the armour of the soldiers, has oxidized to a dull grey or black. The original impression of the burnished silver would have been dazzling. All of the paintings, especially that in the Louvre, have suffered from time and early restoration, and many areas have lost their modelling.\n\nThe panels were a subject in the BBC series \"The Private Life of a Masterpiece\", 2005.\n\nThe dark horse in the Louvre panel, mounted by Micheletto Attendolo, can be seen painted in a tapestry, in the first segment (\"Metzengerstein\") of the 1968 omnibus film \"Spirits of the Dead\".\nIn the 4th Episode (Lucrezia's Wedding) of the 2011 TV Series \"The Borgias\", the London and Louvre panel is shown adorning the dining hall walls of the Florentine Prince when cardinal Della Rovere visits him in Florence.\n\n\n"}

Published in 1995 by Faber and Faber, the novel was adapted for the stage in 2009 and explores Muslim fundamentalism, youth culture, sex, drugs, and alienation in a young British-Pakistani man’s world that is being pulled in different directions by a modern lifestyle of London and traditional Muslim culture.\n\nKureishi, a British-Pakistani novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and filmmaker, premiered the adaptation at the Royal National Theatre in July 2009 and was awarded the second Asia House Literature Award on the closing night of Asia House Festival of Asian Literature.\n\n\nAlthough only having been staged recently, the reception to \"The Black Album\" has been neutral when compared to the Kureishi's novel. Many felt that the stage adaptation left out many of the details that made the novel memorable and powerful, instead feeling that the adaptation lost many of the details that readers felt were so elegantly explained in the novel.\n\n\"But the stage version does scant justice to the book's panoramic portrait of late-1980s London with its pubs, clubs and ecstasy-filled raves. In a nutshell, one misses the heady exuberance of Kureishi's descriptive writing.\" -\"The Guardian\"\n\nThe reception to the timing of the adaptation of the novel was positive as it came in the post-9/11 era of the world view. Kureishi had thought, back in the Nineties, of turning his novel into a film but it never happened. But a decade and a half on, in the wake of 9/11, 7/7 and the \"war on terror\", the relevance of the story became even greater. In an interview with production team, it was asked: \"Was it easy ... transforming the tale from page to stage? \"The novel had a kaleidoscopic view of London,\" he says, \"moving quickly from episode to episode. The play maintains that episodic sense. Hanif has retained a lot of the language of the original. The novel is full of deft wit. The play is too. It moves between the real and the absurd. Hanif calls it 'hyper-real'.\" \n"}

Haskell.\n\nThe book is divided in 43 short chapters ordered by date and roughly covering a whole year. In each of them the author, which visits almost every day a single square meter randomly chosen of an old-growth forest of Cumberland Plateau (Tennessee), describes what happens to plants, animals and insects living there. These observations give him the opportunity to write not only about the small-scale forest ecology but also on worldwide natural processes. He often calls his small observation field \"mandala\", inspired by the paintings of sand created by Tibetan as a support for meditation.\n\nAs far as late 2017 \"The Forest Unseen\" has been translated into ten languages.\n"}
