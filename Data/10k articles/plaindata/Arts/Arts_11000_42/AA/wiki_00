{"id": "9881864", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9881864", "title": "All the Young Men", "text": "All the Young Men\n\nAll the Young Men is a 1960 Korean War feature film starring Alan Ladd and Sidney Poitier dealing with desegregation in the United States Marine Corps. Poitier plays a sergeant unexpectedly placed in command of the survivors of a platoon in the Korean War. The film explores the racial integration of the American military, centering on the African-American sergeant's struggle to win the trust and respect of the men in his unit.\n\nWhen a lieutenant is mortally wounded in a winter ambush that decimates his platoon, he passes command to the highest ranking survivor, Sergeant Towler (Sidney Poitier). However, with the exception of African-American Towler, all of the men left alive are white. Towler feels Private Kincaid (Alan Ladd), an ex-sergeant with eleven years experience (demoted for doing things his way), is better suited for command, but the lieutenant orders him to take charge and complete their vital mission: to take and hold a farmhouse strategically positioned in a mountain pass for the advance of their battalion. After the lieutenant dies, Southerner Private Bracken (Paul Richards) initially refuses to take orders from Towler, but Towler forces him, at gunpoint, to back down. \n\nWith their radio not working, Towler leads ten healthy survivors and a badly wounded Private Casey on a stretcher to their objective. As they warily approach the farmhouse, one soldier spots someone inside and throws a grenade, which wounds a Korean woman. The only other occupants are her young son and her adult, part-French daughter Maya. Kincaid and some of the others want to leave before the enemy attacks, but Towler keeps them there.\n\nThey repel an attack later that night. Hunter, a Navajo, volunteers to scout the area in place of Towler. They agree on a password. Hunter is captured, but despite being hit repeatedly, refuses to say the password when he is forced toward the outpost manned by Towler and Kincaid. After his challenges are not answered, Towler fires, striking Hunter and some enemy soldiers. After the enemy is repelled, Hunter gives the password. Towler and Kincaid find him; he talks to Towler before dying.\n\nBracken tries to force himself on Maya. Her scream brings Towler, but Bracken ignores Towler's order to leave and strikes him. Towler knocks him down, but Bracken remains defiant.\n\nLazitech, manning the outpost, is the next casualty. At his own request, Casey is carried to a gunport to fight; he dies in the next assault. Towler and Kincaid start brawling when Towler catches Kincaid slacking off afterward, but they break off when they hear a tank approaching. After driving off the accompanying infantrymen with a machine gun, Towler and Kinkaid use kerosene and torches to set the tank on fire. When a tank man opens the hatch, Kinkaid tosses in a grenade. The tank runs over his leg when he jumps off; Corpsman Wade has to amputate it, but the only man who has the right type blood for a transfusion is Towler. The operation is a success, despite Wade's lack of training.\n\nWhen a column of tanks is spotted, Towler sends his men and the civilians up the pass, while he goes back and carries Kinkaid to the outpost. Fortunately, friendly aircraft appear and bombard the enemy infantry as they advance, signalling the approach of the battalion.\n\n\nHall Bartlett designed a film as a vehicle for Sidney Poitier, based on the integration of the military in the Korean War. Bartlett came up with the original story with Gene Coon and wrote the script himself. He aimed to make the film independently, though the exact start date was going to be dependent on Poitier's success in \"A Raisin in the Sun\".\n\nColumbia Pictures agreed to finance on the proviso that Bartlett rewrite the script for a white co-star. Bartlett found the only major star willing to do the movie was Alan Ladd who co-produced the film. Bartlett:\nI could have done it [the film] on a shoestring in some canyon in the Hollywood Hills, but I felt that now is the time for me to prove myself with a picture in the million-plus category. I realized that I could not stay in my ivory tower forever, making nice, small, critically praised films. You don't go very far here if you're not successful when the right time comes.\nThe film features an unusual cast who works well together. In addition to Ladd and Poitier, the cast includes comedian Mort Sahl, who does a comedy routine, James Darren who sings the title song (he was meant to sing three songs in all) and boxer Ingemar Johansson in his American film debut. Bartlett cast his Argentine wife Ana María Lynch/Ana St. Clair as a French Korean, Mario Alcalde as an American Indian, Hollywood born Paul Richards as a bigoted Southerner, and local Blackfoot Indians as North Koreans.\n\n\"I just play myself,\" said Johansson.\n\n\"All the Young Men\" was filmed in Glacier National Park in Montana and Mount Hood, Oregon. Poitier's commitment to make the film meant he had to leave the run of \"A Raisin in the Sun\" early.\n\nColumbia planned two separate advertising campaigns for the film to white and black audiences. Columbia also used Quentin Reynolds to promote the film in advertising campaigns. A paperback novelisation of the film was written by Marvin Albert.\n\nThe Marine Corps provided Lieutenant Colonel Clement J. Stadler, who had been awarded the Navy Cross in World War II as a technical advisor; a function he also performed in \"Hell to Eternity\", \"The Outsider\", \"Ambush Bay\" and \"The Lieutenant\" television series. The United States Marine Corps had disbanded separate black Marine units and bases since 18 November 1949.\n\nBosley Crowther, critic for \"The New York Times\", wrote, \"Racial integration in the United States Marines is sluggishly celebrated in a variation on a well-used Western plot in the picture that opened at the Forum yesterday.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "11870490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11870490", "title": "Chinese furniture", "text": "Chinese furniture\n\nThe forms of Chinese furniture evolved along three distinct lineages which dates back to 1000 BC, based on \"frame and panel\", \"yoke and rack\" (based on post and rail seen in architecture) and \"bamboo\" construction techniques. Chinese home furniture evolved independently of Western furniture into many similar forms including chairs, tables, stools, cupboards, cabinets, beds and sofas. Until about the 10th century CE the Chinese sat on mats or low platforms using low tables, in typical Asian style, but then gradually moved to using high tables with chairs. \n\nChinese furniture is mostly in plain polished wood, but from at least the Song dynasty the most luxurious pieces often used lacquer to cover the whole or parts of the visible areas. All the various sub-techniques of Chinese lacquerware can be found on furniture, and become increasingly affordable down the social scale, and so widely used, from about the Ming dynasty onwards. carved lacquer furniture was at first only affordable by the imperial family or the extremely rich, but by the 19th century was merely very expensive, and mostly found in smaller pieces or as decorated areas on larger ones. It was especially popular on screens, which were common in China. Lacquer inlaid with mother of pearl was especially a technique used on furniture.\n\nChinese furniture is usually light where possible, anticipating Europe by several centuries in this respect. Practical fittings in metal such as hinges, lock plates, drawer handles and protective plates at edges or feet are used, and often given considerable emphasis, but compared to classic fine European furniture purely decorative metal mounts were rare. From the Qing dynasty furniture made for export, mostly to Europe, became a distinct style, generally made in rather different shapes to suit the destination markets and highly decorated in lacquer and other techniques. \n\nChinese furniture for sitting or lying on was very often used with cushions, but textiles and upholstery are not, until very late historical periods, incorporated into the piece itself in the Western manner. Openwork in carved wood or other techniques is very typical for practical purposes such as chair-backs, and also for decoration. The Ming period is regarded as the \"golden age\" of Chinese furniture, though very few examples of earlier pieces survive. Ming styles have largely set the style for furniture in traditional Chinese style in subsequent periods, though as in other areas of Chinese art, the 18th and 19th centuries saw increasing prosperity used for sometimes excessively elaborated pieces, as wider groups in society were able to imitate court styles.\n\nWhat is now considered the Chinese aesthetic had its origins in China as far back as 1500–1000 BC. The furniture present in some of the artwork from that early period shows woven mats on elevated floors, sometimes accompanied by arm rests, providing seating accompanied by low tables. In this early period both unadorned and intricately engraved and painted pieces were already developing. High chairs, usually single ones, had existed as status symbols, effectively thrones, since at least the Eastern Zhou period (771–256 BCE), but were not used with tables at the same level. \n\nBuddhism, entering China around AD 200, brought with it the idea of (the Buddha) sitting upon a raised platform instead of simply mats. The platform was adopted as an honorific seat for special guests and dignitaries or officials. Longer versions were then used for reclining as well, which eventually evolved into the bed and daybed. Taller versions evolved into higher tables as well. The folding stool also proliferated similarly, after it was adapted from designs developed by nomadic tribes to the North and West, who used them for both their convenience and light weight in many applications such as mounting horses. Later, woven hourglass-shaped stools evolved; a design still in use today throughout China.\n\nSome of the styles now widely regarded as Chinese began appearing more prominently in the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). It is here that evidence of early versions of the round and yoke back chairs are found, generally used by the elite. By the next two Dynasties (the Northern and Southern Song) the use of varying types of furniture, including chairs, benches, and stools was common throughout Chinese society. Two particular developments were recessed legs and waisted tables. Newer and more complex designs were generally limited to official and higher class use.\n\nIt was from this basis that more modern Chinese furniture developed its distinguishing characteristics. Use of thick lacquer finish and detailed engraving and painted decoration as well as pragmatic design elements would continue to flourish. Significant foreign design influence would not be felt until increased contact with the West began in the 19th century, due to efforts on the part of the ruling elite to limit trade.\n\nDuring the Ming and Qing dynasties previous bans on imports were lifted, allowing for larger quantities and varieties of woods to flood in from other parts of Asia. The use of denser wood led to much finer work, including more elaborate joinery. A Ming Imperial table entirely covered in carved lacquer, now in London, is one of the finest survivals of the period.\n\nChinese furniture traditionally consisted of four distinct categories, all formed by the mid Qing dynasty, but each with its own unique characteristics.\n\nClassic Chinese furniture is typically made of a class of hardwoods, known collectively as \"rosewood\" (紅木, literally \"red wood\"). These woods are denser than water, fine grained, and high in oils and resins. These properties make them dimensionally stable, hardwearing, rot and insect resistant, and when new, highly fragrant. The density and toughness of the wood also allows furniture to be built without the use of glue and nail, but rather constructed from joinery and doweling alone. According to the Chinese industry standards the woods are grouped into eight classes:\n\nFurniture and carving made from these woods are typically referred to, in the market, as \"hongmu furniture\" (紅木家具, literally \"rosewood furniture\"). Due to overlogging for the said furniture, most of the species are either threatened or endangered.\n\nConstruction of traditional wooden Chinese furniture is based primarily of solid wood pieces connected solely using woodworking joints, and rarely using glue or metallic nails. The reason was that the nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia. Further, the oily and resinous woods used in Chinese furniture generally do not glue well, even when pre-cleaned with modern industrial solvents.\n\nPlatform construction is based on box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods. While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, different parts of the construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction. First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets. Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two mitered vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached to the bottom of the feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way mitered corners. Unlike European-derived styles, table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the mitered joints, especially the 3-way mitered joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.\n\nThe Yoke and Rack construction differs critically in the way that the legs of the piece are joined to the horizontal portion (be it tabletop, seat or cabinet carcass) using a type of wedged mortise-and-tenon joint where the end grain of the leg is visible as a circle in the frame of the tabletop. The cross-pieces (stretchers in the western equivalent) are joined through mortise-and-tenon joinery as well. The legs and stretchers are commonly round rather than square or curvilinear. The simplest pieces are simply four splayed legs attached to a solid top, but more complicated pieces contain decorative brackets, drawers and metal latches. Cabinets in this style typically have an overhanging top similar to western-style cabinetry.\n\nBamboo construction style, although historically rooted in pieces made from bamboo, later saw many pieces made from hardwood with patterning to imitate the look of bamboo, or simply in the style of previous pieces made from bamboo. The construction is more similar to the Yoke and Rack style with some apparent crossover.\n\n\n\n"}

It stars Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried in the title role. Its screenplay was written by Erin Cressida Wilson, based on the earlier French film, written by Anne Fontaine.\n\nDespite its mixed critical reception, \"Chloe\" made more money than any of Egoyan's previous films.\n\nIn a voice-over, Chloe discusses her business as a call girl. Catherine is a gynecologist and her husband David is a college professor. Catherine suspects David of having an affair after she sees a cell-phone picture of him with a female student.\n\nCatherine stops by the hotel bar where Chloe waits for clients, telling Chloe that she wants to hire her to test David's loyalty. Chloe later tells Catherine that David asked her if he could kiss her, which he did. Catherine is angered but insists that Chloe meet with David again.\n\nOver the next few days, Catherine and Chloe meet multiple times, and Chloe describes in explicit detail her encounters with David, which arouses Catherine during one meeting; Chloe kisses Catherine, and Catherine, surprised by this, abruptly leaves. Later, when meeting with David at a get-together, she is taken aback by his awareness of the scent of her lotion; it is the same lotion that Chloe wears. Upset by this, Catherine leaves and meets with Chloe at a hotel. The two go into a hotel room, where Catherine starts undressing Chloe before asking Chloe to tell her how David touches her, visibly aroused. Chloe then dominates Catherine and has erotic sex with her.\n\nAfter having sex with Chloe, Catherine arrives home later than usual, leading David to ask her if she has been unfaithful. Catherine tells him she thinks he has been unfaithful as well, and the two argue, stopping after being interrupted by their son, Michael.\n\nCatherine meets with Chloe and calls off their relationship but later asks her to meet her at a coffee house frequented by David. While there, she demands that David admit that he is having an affair. Chloe walks in, and David does not recognize her. Chloe leaves quickly, and Catherine realizes that Chloe made up her encounters with David.\n\nDavid admits that he has fantasized about other women, and expects Catherine to make a similar admission with regard to men. When she does not, David becomes agitated. Catherine then confesses her passionate sexual encounter with Chloe. She apologizes, saying that she felt she became invisible to David as she aged, while David became more attractive to her, and that this got in the way of their sex life. The couple reconciles.\n\nChloe goes to Catherine and David's house and seduces Michael before having sex with him in Catherine's bed. Catherine arrives home, and Chloe tells Catherine that she is in love with her. She threatens to hurt Catherine with her hairpin.\n\nCatherine asks Chloe what she wants. Chloe requests a kiss, and Catherine complies. Michael sees, startling Catherine and causing her to push Chloe into the bedroom window. Chloe manages to grab hold of the frame, but she intentionally lets go and falls to her death. Sometime later, Catherine attends Michael's graduation party and wears Chloe's hairpin in her hair.\n\nThe film was the first film produced by the director Atom Egoyan which was not written by himself.\n\nThe entire film production time is only 37 days.\n\nThe film was financed solely in France. The film was shot in Toronto and Lake Ontario. Some local restaurants and scenic spots appear in the film under actual names, such as Allan Gardens, Cafe Diplomatico, The Rivoli, the Windsor Arms Hotel, the Royal York Hotel, the Royal Ontario Museum, The Royal Conservatory of Music, the CN Tower, the Art Gallery of Ontario and the Ontario College of Art.\n\nProducer Jason Reitman helped persuade Amanda Seyfried to star in this film. Seyfried accepted the role of Chloe after a friend of hers withdrew from consideration due to discomfort with the nudity. Julianne Moore described Seyfried as a \"very dependable\" acting partner and claimed that they were largely comfortable with the intimacy in the film. In describing her view of Catherine's relationship with Chloe, Moore noted \"an emotional quality to their intimacy that has to do with their conversation and their basic receptivity to one another. Now what they turn into personally obviously is very different. They are having completely subjective experiences, but that doesn't mean [they're] not incredibly receptive to one another and it clearly creates something in-between them. And that's what love and sex and intimacy and all that is. Someone who is listening to you, hearing you, there for you, that's the person you end up having a relationship with, sexual or just emotional or whatever. I don't know if that has to do with gender necessarily\".\n\nLiam Neeson's wife, Natasha Richardson, had a skiing accident during filming. Neeson decided to leave the set to take care of his wife, who died from her injury a few days later. The filmmakers re-arranged the shooting schedule accordingly for Neeson's absence. Just a few days after his wife's death, Neeson returned to the set and filmed the remainder of his scenes in two days.\nCanadian indie rock band Raised by Swans has two songs featured in the movie and the band is mentioned several times by Chloe.\n\nAnne Fontaine (the writer/director of \"Nathalie...\") said that she was interested in Egoyan's take on it. Fontaine also said that she was not happy with \"Nathalie...\" because the two lead actresses of the film objected to her original intention for a lesbian relationship to develop between their characters.\n\nAtom Egoyan studied at the University of Toronto, and Joe Medjuck, one of the film's producers, was a teacher of Egoyan at the University of Toronto.\n\nAfter determining the plan for the remake of the film \"Nathalie...\" directed by Anne Fontaine, the investor StudioCanal believes that it is necessary to find a reliable screenwriter to write a script for the film because it tells a relatively complicated family and emotional story. Producer Ivan Reitman locked Erin Cressida Wilson. This script also took Erin Cressida Wilson a lot of time and energy to create, and many times she couldn't figure out what real life was and what was the story in the script. When Erin Cressida Wilson wrote the script, she always thought she was Chloe, and when the script came back to life, she would think she was Catherine again. Waiting for the script to be finished, but this aftereffect is still there. The characters in the play continue to influence Erin Cressida Wilson.\n\n\"Chloe\"'s director Atom Egoyan insists on using 35 mm film to shoot the film. This is undoubtedly a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, but Atom Egoyan enjoys it. The photographer Paul Sarossy thinks filming this film is obviously symbolic. In this digital age, choosing to use film to shoot a movie is more of a feeling of escape from digital electronics. Although the film eventually uses some digital technology, it is not a digitally produced film.\n\nThe film also took great pains in the art design and costume design. In the movie, mirrors and glass were used as props for reflection and refraction. The costume design of the film also pays attention to the concept of mirroring. In order to complement the artwork, costume designer Debra Hanson specifically uses a layered mirror effect on the costume design. Those repeated laces, laces, structures and decorations are also mirrored images. The effect is the same as showing the heart of a character. In addition, the relationship between clothing and the external environment has also been deliberately taken care of. In the film, Chloe's scene in the greenhouse was decorated with a lot of leaves and patterns on the clothes she wore, which could reflect some of her inner unrest. Similarly, Catherine's clothes are in part echoed by Chloe's clothing, and their relationship in the film is complex and subtle.\n\nStudioCanal fully financed \"Chloe\", and StudioCanal were able to fully recoup the film's budget via international pre-sales. In 2009, the film received award nominations from London Film Festival, San Sebastián International Film Festival, and Toronto International Film Festival under the category of Film Presented.\n\nSony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions Group paid a low seven-figure sum to acquire the United States distribution rights of \"Chloe\", and the group opened this film in limited theatrical release in the United States on March 26, 2010 through Sony Pictures Classics. In the United States, this film grossed $3 million theatrically and became one of the higher-grossing specialty films in 2010 (according to \"Variety\", \"$3 million is the new $10 million\" for specialty films' box office in 2010).\n\nIn the wake of \"Chloe\", Egoyan had since received many scripts of erotic thrillers. Amanda Seyfried's performance in this film also helped her to gain industry acclaim and become considered for more roles.\n\n\"Chloe\" was released in the United States on July 13, 2010 in both DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The disc includes an audio commentary, making-of featurette, and deleted scenes.\n\nSeveral months following the DVD and Blu-ray release of \"Chloe\", Egoyan said that \"Chloe\" had made more money than any of his previous films.\n\nThe film opened in 350 theaters to mixed reviews; on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Chloe\" holds a 51% approval rating based on 151 reviews, with a rating average of 5.8/10. The site's consensus is that \"Despite its promising pedigree and a titillating premise, \"Chloe\" ultimately fails to deliver the heat—or the thrills—expected of a sexual thriller.\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score from major reviewers, gave the film a 48 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, indicating \"Mixed or average reviews.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, while Elizabeth Weitzman of \"New York Daily News\" gave the film 1 out of 5 stars.\n\n"}

It advocates for the sector, aiming to ensure that the creative industries are central to political, economic and social decision-making.\n\nThrough this advocacy and by leveraging the combined influence of its 1,000+ members across all creative sectors, the Federation further seeks to secure the investment required to retain the creative industries' position as the fastest growing sector of the UK economy, currently worth £91.8bn in Gross Value Added to the UK.\n\nThe Federation was the brainchild of Sir John Sorrell, the designer and UK business ambassador, and a team of creative leaders including Sir Peter Bazalgette, Sir Nicholas Serota, Tim Davie of BBC Worldwide, Caroline Rush of the British Fashion Council, Amanda Nevill of the British Film Institute and Darren Henley.\n\nThe ambition of the Federation was to give political clout to a sector that has been the fastest growing part of the UK economy over the previous decade, but had never punched above its weight with government.\n\nOperations commenced in March 2014, with early development of the organisation led by the Federation's founding CEO, John Kampfner, and originally funded by more than 200 founder supporters prior to the launch of its membership scheme.\n\nThe Creative Industries Federation was officially launched in November 2014 with an event at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design. This event was attended by more than 500 people from across the creative industries and featured keynote speeches by George Osborne, Martha Lane Fox and UK President of Warner Bros, Josh Berger.\n\nThe Federation's membership scheme commenced in January 2015.\n\nDuring its first year of operation, the Federation forged working relations with the UK government and political parties of all hues, working closely with eight Whitehall departments as well as devolved and city administrations and local authorities. Its work helped secure a better-than-expected settlement for the arts in the November 2015 spending review.\n\nAfter the Federation's survey prior to the 2016 EU Referendum revealed that 96% of its members backed remaining in the EU, the Federation continued to canvas its members and produce a series of events and reports to help inform UK government policy with regards to Brexit and its potential impact on the creative industries. In February 2017, Creative Industries Federation former CEO, John Kampfner, was invited to present evidence on this issue to a DCMS Select Committee, alongside Sir Peter Bazalgette, then chair of Arts Council England, and Nicola Mendelsohn, Vice President EMEA, Facebook.\n\nIn March 2017, the Federation announced the appointment of its new chair, Rick Haythornthwaite, who succeeded founding chair Sir John Sorrell in April 2017.\n\nIn July 2018, Alan Bishop, former CEO of the Southbank Centre, succeeded John Kampfner as CEO of the Creative Industries Federation.\n\nThe Federation is funded through a membership scheme through which it represents more than 1000 organisations drawn from across sectors including advertising and media, animation, architecture, broadcasting, crafts, creative education, creative tech, design, fashion, film, heritage, museums, galleries and libraries, music, performing arts, photography, publishing, video games, visual arts and visual effects.\n\nMembers include FTSE 100 companies, multinationals, privately owned businesses, SMEs, charities and non-profit organisations, trade associations, universities and further education colleges, and individual practitioners.\n\nThe Federation provides members' benefits including research reports, a calendar of networking events, international trends analysis and discount offers for members.\n\nThe Federation represents the interests of the UK creative industries to the UK government, the media and the general public.\n\nPolicy and research is at the heart of the Federation's work, with its aim being to secure the best possible conditions for growth and continued success for the UK's creative industries, developing policy priorities through consultation with its members. Successes include securing the inclusion of the creative industries in plans for the UK government's industrial strategy, to include an independent review of the sector by Sir Peter Bazalgette to inform an early sector deal.\n\nCurrent focuses include the impact of Brexit on the creative industries, development of a skilled workforce through creative education in schools, measures to diversify the workforce, improved support for working internationally, access to finance through both public and private funding and the necessary infrastructure such as fast broadband and intellectual property rights protection.\n\n\n\nThe UK Council meets three times a year to inform the Federation's policy work. Council members are selected from the Federation membership to give representation to all the arts and creative industries across the commercial, public and education sectors as well as broad representation of the country at large.\n\nThe International Council was launched in July 2016, featuring creative industries leaders from around the world. It identifies emergent opportunities for the sector and examples of innovation and best practice from around the world. These findings inform the Federation's biannual international magazine, C.International.\n"}
{"id": "2402111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2402111", "title": "Cryptomnesia", "text": "Cryptomnesia\n\nCryptomnesia occurs when a forgotten memory returns without it being recognized as such by the subject, who believes it is something new and original. It is a memory bias whereby a person may falsely recall generating a thought, an idea, a tune, or a joke, not deliberately engaging in plagiarism but rather experiencing a memory as if it were a new inspiration.\n\nThe first documented instance of cryptomnesia occurred in 1874 with the medium Stainton Moses.\n\nThe word was first used by the psychiatrist Théodore Flournoy, in reference to the case of medium Hélène Smith (Catherine-Élise Müller) to suggest the high incidence in psychism of \"latent memories on the part of the medium that come out, sometimes greatly disfigured by a subliminal work of imagination or reasoning, as so often happens in our ordinary dreams.\"\n\nCarl Gustav Jung treated the subject in his thesis \"On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena\" (1902) and in an article, \"Cryptomnesia\" (1905), suggested the phenomenon in Friedrich Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\". The idea was studied or mentioned by Géza Dukes, Sándor Ferenczi and Wilhelm Stekel as well as by Sigmund Freud in speaking of the originality of his inventions.\n\nIn the first empirical study of cryptomnesia, people in a group took turns generating category examples (e.g., kinds of birds: parrot, canary, etc.). They were later asked to create new exemplars in the same categories that were not previously produced, and also to recall which words they had personally generated. People inadvertently plagiarized about 3–9% of the time either by regenerating another person's thought or falsely recalling someone's thought as their own. Similar effects have been replicated using other tasks such as word search puzzles and in brainstorming sessions.\n\nResearch has distinguished between two kinds of cryptomnesia, though they are often studied together. The distinction between these two types of plagiarism is in the underlying memory bias responsible—specifically, is it the thought that is forgotten, or the thinker? The first type of bias is one of familiarity. The plagiarizer regenerates an idea that was presented earlier, but believes the idea to be an original creation. The idea that is reproduced could be another's idea, or one's own from a previous time. B. F. Skinner describes his own experience of self-plagiarism:\n\nThe second type of cryptomnesia results from an error of authorship whereby the ideas of others are remembered as one's own. In this case, the plagiarizer correctly recognizes that the idea is from an earlier time, but falsely remembers having been the origin for the idea (or, having lost the specific memory of encountering it in print or conversation, assumes that it \"came to\" the plagiarizer as an original idea).\nVarious terms have been coined to distinguish these two forms of plagiarism — occurrence forgetting vs. source forgetting and generation errors vs. recognition errors. The two types of cryptomnesia appear to be independent: no relationship has been found between error rates and the two types are precipitated by different causes.\n\nCryptomnesia is more likely to occur when the ability to properly monitor sources is impaired. For example, people are more likely to falsely claim ideas as their own when they were under high cognitive load at the time they first considered the idea. Plagiarism increases when people are away from the original source of the idea, and decreases when participants are specifically instructed to pay attention to the origin of their ideas. False claims are also more prevalent for ideas originally suggested by persons of the same sex, presumably because the perceptual similarity of the self to a same-sex person exacerbates source confusion. In other studies it has been found that the timing of the idea is also important: if another person produces an idea immediately before the self produces an idea, the other's idea is more likely to be claimed as one's own, ostensibly because the person is too busy preparing for their own turn to properly monitor source information. \n\nAs explained by Carl Jung,\nin \"Man and His Symbols,\" \"An author may be writing steadily to a preconceived plan, working out an argument or developing the line of a story, when he suddenly runs off at a tangent. Perhaps a fresh idea has occurred to him, or a different image, or a whole new sub-plot. If you ask him what prompted the digression, he will not be able to tell you. He may not even have noticed the change, though he has now produced material that is entirely fresh and apparently unknown to him before. Yet it can sometimes be shown convincingly that what he has written bears a striking similarity to the work of another author — a work that he believes he has never seen.\"\n\nJorge Luis Borges's story, \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote,\" is a meta-fictive enactment of cryptomnesia. This work is written in the form of a review or literary critical piece about (the nonexistent) Pierre Menard. It begins with a brief introduction and a listing of all of Menard's work.\n\nBorges's \"review\" describes this 20th-century French writer who has made an effort to go further than mere \"translation\" of Don Quixote, but to immerse himself so thoroughly as to be able to actually \"re-create\" it, line for line, in the original 16th century Spanish. Thus, \"Pierre Menard\" is often used to raise questions and discussion about the nature of accurate translation or, in this case, the hermeneutics of cryptomnesia.\n\nJung gives the following example in \"Man and His Symbols\". Friedrich Nietzsche's book \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" includes an almost word for word account of an incident also included in a book published about 1835, half a century before Nietzsche wrote. This is considered to be neither purposeful plagiarism nor pure coincidence: Nietzsche's sister confirmed that he had indeed read the original account when he was 11 years old; Nietzsche's youthful intellectual capabilities, his later cognitive degeneration, and his accompanying psychological deterioration (specifically, his increasing grandiosity as manifested in his later behavior and writings) together strengthen the likelihood that he happened to commit the passage to memory upon initially reading it and later, after having lost his memory of encountering it, assumed that his own mind had created it.\n\nIn some cases, the line between cryptomnesia and zeitgeist (compare the concept of multiple discovery in science) may be somewhat hazy. Readers of Lord Byron's closet drama \"Manfred\" noted a strong resemblance to Goethe's \"Faust\". In a review published in 1820, Goethe wrote, \"Byron's tragedy \"Manfred\" was to me a wonderful phenomenon, and one that closely touched me. This singular intellectual poet has taken my Faustus to himself, and extracted from it the strangest nourishment for his hypochondriac humour. He has made use of the impelling principles in his own way, for his own purposes, so that no one of them remains the same; and it is particularly on this account that I cannot enough admire his genius.\" Byron was apparently thankful for the compliment; however, he claimed that he had\nnever read \"Faustus\".\n\nJ. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan, was aware of the occurrence of cryptomnesia. In \"Peter and Wendy\" Wendy sews Peter's shadow back on and this makes him very happy but he immediately thinks he has attached the shadow himself:\n\n“How clever I am,” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”\n\nPeter exhibits a number of other clinically accurate peculiarities of memory suggesting that Barrie regarded Peter's behavior as a memory disorder rather than self-centredness.\n\nHelen Keller compromised her and her teacher's credibility with an incident of cryptomnesia which was misinterpreted as plagiarism. \"The Frost King\", which Keller wrote out of buried memories of a fairy tale read to her four years previously, left Keller a nervous wreck, and unable to write fiction for the rest of her life.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson refers to an incident of cryptomnesia that took place during the writing of \"Treasure Island\", and that he discovered to his embarrassment several years afterward:\n\nThe precedent in United States copyright law, since 1976, has been to treat alleged cryptomnesia no differently from deliberate plagiarism. The seminal case is \"Bright Tunes Music v. Harrisongs Music,\" where the publisher of \"He's So Fine,\" written and composed by Ronald Mack, demonstrated to the court that George Harrison borrowed substantial portions of his song \"My Sweet Lord\" from \"He's So Fine.\" The Court imposed damages despite a claim that the copying was subconscious. The ruling was upheld by the Second Circuit in \"ABKCO Music v. Harrisongs Music,\" and the case \"Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton,\" upheld by the Ninth Circuit, affirmed the principle.\n\nIn 1987, Australian author Colleen McCullough published a novella, \"The Ladies of Missalonghi\". Critics alleged that she had plagiarised \"The Blue Castle\", a 1926 novel by L. M. Montgomery. McCullough acknowledged having read Montgomery's works in her youth, but attributed the similarities to subconscious recollection.\n\nIn \"Interpretation and Overinterpretation\", Umberto Eco describes the rediscovery of an antique book among his large collection, which was eerily similar to the pivotal object in his novel \"The Name of the Rose\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2626651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2626651", "title": "Cyberfeminism", "text": "Cyberfeminism\n\nCyberfeminism is a genre of contemporary feminism which foregrounds the relationship between cyberspace, the Internet and technology. It can be used to refer to a philosophy, methodology or community. The term was coined in the early 1990s to describe the work of feminists interested in theorizing, critiquing, exploring and re-making the Internet, cyberspace and new-media technologies in general. The foundational catalyst for the formation of cyberfeminist thought is attributed to Donna Haraway's The Cyborg Manifesto, third wave feminism, post-structuralist feminism, riot grrrl culture and the feminist critique of the blatant erasure of women within discussions of technology.\n\nCyberfeminism is a sort of alliance that wants to defy any sort of boundaries of identity and definition and rather be truly postmodern in its potential for radical openness. This is seen with the 1997 Old Boys Network's\"100 anti-theses\" which lists the 100 ways \"cyberfeminism is not.\" Cornelia Sollfrank from the Old Boys Network states that: \n\"Cyberfeminism is a myth. A myth is a story of unidentifiable origin, or of different origins. A myth is based on one central story which is retold over and over in different variations. A myth denies one history as well as one truth, and implies a search for truth in the spaces, in the differences between the different stories. Speaking about Cyberfeminism as a myth, is not intended to mystify it, it simply indicates that Cyberfeminism only exists in plural.\"\n\nMia Consalvo defines cyberfeminism as: \n\nThe dominant cyberfeminist perspective takes a utopian view of cyberspace and the Internet as a means of freedom from social constructs such as gender, sex difference and race. It also sees technology as a means to link the body with machines. VNS Matrix member, Julianne Pierce defines cyberfeminism: \"In 1991, in a cozy Australian city called Adelaide, four bored girls decided to have some fun with art and French Feminist theory…with homage to Donna Haraway they began to play around with the idea of cyberfeminism.\"\n\nAuthors Hawthorne and Klein explain the different analyses of cyberfeminism in their book: \"Just as there are liberal, socialist, radical and postmodern feminists, so too one finds these positions reflected in the interpretations of cyberfeminism.\" Cyberfeminism is not just the subject matter, but is the approach taken to examine subject matter. For example: Cyberfeminism can be a critique at equality in cyberspace, challenge the gender stereotype in the cyberspace, examine the gender relationship in cyberspace, examine the collaboration between human and technology, examine the relationship between women and technology and more.\n\nCyberfeminism arose partly as a reaction to \"the pessimism of the 1980s feminist approaches that stressed the inherently masculine nature of techno-science\", a counter movement against the 'toys for boys' perception of new Internet technologies. As cyberfeminist artist Faith Wilding argued: \"If feminism is to be adequate to its cyberpotential then it must mutate to keep up with the shifting complexities of social realities and life conditions as they are changed by the profound impact communications technologies and techno science have on all our lives. It is up to cyberfeminists to use feminist theoretical insights and strategic tools and join them with cybertechniques to battle the very real sexism, racism, and militarism encoded in the software and hardware of the Net, thus politicizing this environment.\"\n\nDonna Haraway is the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\" which was reprinted in \"Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature\" (1991). Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others. Haraway states that the cyborg \"has no truck with pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity.\"\n\nCyberfeminism is considered a predecessor to networked feminism. Cyberfeminism also has a relationship to the field of feminist science and technology studies.\n\nBritish cultural theorist Sadie Plant chose cyberfeminism to describe her recipe for defining the feminizing influence of technology on western society and its inhabitants.\n\nThe term cyberfeminism first came about in 1992, according to Carolyn Guertin, \"at a particular moment in time, 1992, simultaneously at three different points on the globe.\" In Canada, Nancy Paterson wrote an article entitled \"Cyberfeminism\" for EchoNYC.\n\nIn Adelaide, Australia, a four-person collective called VNS Matrix wrote the Cyberfeminist Manifesto and used the term to label their radical feminist acts \"to insert women, bodily fluids and political consciousness into electronic spaces.\" That same year, British cultural theorist Sadie Plant used the term to describe definition of the feminizing influence of technology on western society. Guertin goes on to say that the first Cyberfeminist International, organized by the Old Boys Network in Germany, in 1997, refused to define the school of thought, but drafted the \"100 Anti-Theses of Cyberfeminism\" instead. Guertin says that Cyberfeminism is a celebration of multiplicity.\n\nIn 1996, a special volume of \"Women & Performance\" was devoted to sexuality and cyberspace. It was a compendium of essays on cybersex, online stalking, fetal imaging, and going digital in New York.\n\nIn 2003 the feminist anthology \"\" was published; it includes the essay \"Cyberfeminism: Networking the Net\" by Amy Richards and Marianne Schnall.\n\nUsage of the term cyberfeminism has faded away after the millennium, partly as a result of the dot.com bubble burst that bruised the utopian bent of much of digital culture. Radhika Gajjala and Yeon Ju Oh's \"Cyberfeminism 2.0\" argues that cyberfeminism in the 21st century has taken many new forms and focuses on the different aspects of women's participation online. They find cyberfeminists in women's blogging networks and their conferences, in women's gaming, in fandom, in social media, in online mothers' groups performing pro-breastfeeding activism, and in online spaces developed and populated by marginal networks of women in non-Western countries.\n\nFeminist action and activism online is prevalent, especially by women of colour, but has taken on different intersectional terms. While there are writing on black cyberfeminism which argue that not only is race not absent in our use of the internet, but race is a key component in how we interact with the internet. However, women of colour generally do not associate with cyberfeminism, and rather re-frame afrofuturism in feminist terms.\n\nXenofeminism is an offshoot of cyberfeminism that came into existence through a collective that calls themselves Laboria Cuboniks. In their manifesto, \"Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation\", it argues against nature as natural and immutable for a future where all identities are non-binary and in which feminism destabilizes and uses the master's tools for their own rebuilding of life: \"Xenofeminism is gender-abolitionist. 'Gender abolitionism' is shorthand for the ambition to construct a society where traits currently assembled under the rubric of gender, no longer furnish a grid for the asymmetric operation of power. 'Race abolitionism' expands into a similar formula -- that the struggle must continue until currently racialized characteristics are no more a basis of discrimination than the color of one's eyes. Ultimately, every emancipatory abolitionism must incline towards the horizon of class abolitionism, since it is in capitalism where we encounter oppression in its transparent, denaturalized form: you're not exploited or oppressed because you are a wage labourer or poor; you are a labourer or poor because you are exploited.\"\n\nThe decline in volume of cyberfeminist literature in recent years would suggest that cyberfeminism has somewhat lost momentum as a movement, however, in terms of artists and artworks, not only cyberfeminism is still taking place, but its artistic and theoretical contribution has been of crucial importance to the development of posthuman aesthetics.\n\nMany critiques of cyberfeminism have focused on its lack of intersectional focus, its utopian vision of cyberspace, especially cyberstalking and cyber-abuse, its whiteness and elite community building.\n\nOne of the major critiques of cyberfeminism, especially as it was in its heyday in the 1990s, was that it required economic privilege to get online: \"By all means let [poor women] have access to the Internet, just as all of us have it—like chocolate cake or AIDS,\" writes activist Annapurna Mamidipudi. \"Just let it not be pushed down their throats as 'empowering.' Otherwise this too will go the way of all imposed technology and achieve the exact opposite of what it purports to do.\" Cyberfeminist artist and thinker Faith Wilding also critiques its utopian vision for not doing the tough work of technical, theoretical and political education.\n\nThe practice of cyberfeminist art is inextricably intertwined with cyberfeminist theory. The 100 anti-theses make clear that cyberfeminism is not just about theory, while theory is extremely important, cyberfeminism requires participation. As one member of the cyberfeminist collective the Old Boys Network writes, cyberfeminism is \"linked to aesthetic and ironic strategies as intrinsic tools within the growing importance of design and aesthetics in the new world order of flowing pancapitalism\". Cyberfeminism also has strong connections with the DIY feminism movement, as noted in the seminal text \"DIY Feminism\", a grass roots movement that encourages active participation, especially as a solo practitioner or a small collective.\n\nAround the late nineties several cyberfeminist artists and theorists gained a measure of recognition for their works, including the above-mentioned VNS Matrix and their Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st century, and Faith Wilding and Critical Art Ensemble. Some of the better-known examples of cyberfeminist work include Auriea Harvey's work, Sandy Stone, Linda Dement's \"Cyberflesh Girlmonster\" a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women's body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes; Melinda Rackham's \"Carrier,\" a work of web-based multimedia art that explores the relationship between humans and infectious agents;, Shu Lea Cheang's 1998 work \"Brandon,\" which was the first Internet based artwork to be commissioned and collected by the Guggenheim. A later work of Cheang's, I.K.U. (2001), is a sci-fi pornographic film that imagines a cybersexual post-Blade Runner universe, where sexual encounters with feminine, shapeshifting \"replicants\" are distilled and collected for resale, and ultimately reuse. I.K.U was the first pornographic film to screen at Sundance. Dr. Caitlin Fisher's online hypertext novella “‘These Waves of Girls“ is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. Recent artworks of note include Evelin Stermitz's \"World of Female Avatars\" in which the artist has collected quotes and images from women over the world and displayed them in an interactive browser based format, and Regina Pinto's \"Many Faces of Eve\". O[rphan] D[frift>] (1994-2003) were a 4.5 person collective experimenting with writing, art, music and the internet's potential \"treating information as matter and the image as a unit of contagion.\"\n\nAn important part of the generation of cyberfeminist theory and critique was the emergence of a few critical listserves that served as the basis for the organization of three international cyberfeminist events and several major publications.\n\n\nSusanna Paasonen\n\nSadie Plant\n\nN.

{"id": "8191076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8191076", "title": "Digital dark age", "text": "Digital dark age\n\nThe digital dark age is a lack of historical information in the digital age as a direct result of outdated file formats, software, or hardware that becomes corrupt, scarce, or inaccessible as technologies evolve and data decays. Future generations may find it difficult or impossible to retrieve electronic documents and multimedia, because they have been recorded in an obsolete and obscure file format. The name derives from the term \"Dark Ages\" in the sense that there could be a relative lack of records in the digital age, as documents are transferred to digital formats and original copies are lost. An early mention of the term was at a conference of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) in 1997. The term was also mentioned in 1998 at the Time and Bits conference, which was co-sponsored by the Long Now Foundation and the Getty Conservation Institute.\n\nThe problem is not limited to text documents, but applies equally to photos, video, audio and other kinds of electronic documents. One concern leading to the use of the term is that documents are stored on physical media which require special hardware in order to be read and that this hardware will not be available in a few decades from the time the document was created. For example, it is already the case that disk drives capable of reading 5¼-inch floppy disks are not readily available.\n\nThe digital dark age also applies to the problems which arise due to obsolete file formats. In such a case, it is the lack of necessary software which causes problems when retrieving stored documents. This is especially problematic when proprietary formats are used, in which case it might be impossible to write appropriate software to read the file.\n\nMagnetic tape data storage is a method of storing data on magnetic tape. It is used as a backup method of storage for digital storage and is one way of mitigating a possible digital dark age. For example, in 2011 hundreds of thousands of Google accounts were reset and the data in those accounts went missing. Google was able to restore the data to the email accounts from the data stored on magnetic tape. Magnetic data storage is also used by financial institutions, hospitals, movie studios, and manufacturing companies to backup content. Magnetic tape can hold hundreds of terabytes of data.\n\nThe Internet Archive has stated that one of their goals is to prevent the digital dark age.\n\nEven Vinton Cerf, Vice President of Google, showed his concerns about data preservation in the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science: \"As the way that we store information about ourselves develops, memories stored in files that use older technology are becoming harder to access. That could mean that historians of the future are unable to learn about our lives\". His suggested solution consists of preserving a sample of every piece of software and hardware that has ever existed so that it never becomes obsolete. He proposed taking an X-ray snapshot of the content, the application and the operating system along with a description of the machine. This information should be then stored, instead of in a museum, in servers in the cloud. \n\nA famous example is NASA, whose early space records have suffered from a dark age issue more than once. For over a decade, magnetic tapes from the 1976 Viking Mars landing were unprocessed. When later analyzed, the data was unreadable as it was in an unknown format and the original programmers had either died or left NASA. The images were eventually extracted following many months of puzzling through the data and examining how the recording machines functioned.\n\nAnother example is the BBC Domesday Project in which a survey of the nation was compiled 900 years after the Domesday Book was published. While the original Domesday Book is still readable today, there were great fears that the discs of the Domesday Project would become unreadable as software and disk drives capable of reading the format became rarer and rarer. However, in 2002 the CAMiLEON project migrated the information to a system called DomesEm, allowing it to be accessed on modern computers.\n\nEncryption may exacerbate the problem of preserving data, since decoding adds complexity even when the relevant software is available. Historically, encrypted data is quite rare, but even the very simple means available throughout history have provided many examples of documents that can only be read with great effort. For example, it took the capacity of a distributed computing project to break the mechanically generated code of a single brief World War II submarine tactical message. Modern encryption is being used in many more documents and media due to publishers wanting the promised protections of DRM.\n\nAs more records are stored in digital form, there have been several measures to standardize electronic file formats so software to read them is widely available and can be re-implemented on new platforms if necessary.\n\nPDF/A is an open standard based on Adobe Systems PDF format. It has been widely adopted by governments and archives around the world, such as the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) has been standardized by OASIS in 2005, and by ISO in 2006. Since then, support for OpenDocument has been implemented in a large number of open source and proprietary software. Therefore, using OpenDocument is one option for archiving editable documents from office applications. More broadly, the use of open source software is a prevention measure. Since the source code for reading and writing a file format is open, the code can be used as a base for future implementations.

{"id": "159063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159063", "title": "Fast Food Nation", "text": "Fast Food Nation\n\nFast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal (2001) is a book by investigative journalist Eric Schlosser that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry.\n\nFirst serialized by \"Rolling Stone\" in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to Upton Sinclair's classic muckraking novel \"The Jungle\" (1906). The book was adapted into a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Richard Linklater.\n\nAn investigative journalist with a degree in history from Princeton, Eric Schlosser explores subjects ignored by the mainstream media and tries to give a voice to people at the margins of society. He followed the harvest with migrant farm workers in California, spent time with meatpacking workers in Texas and Colorado, told the stories of marijuana growers and pornographers and the victims of violent crime, gone on duty with the New York Police Department Bomb Squad, and visited prisons throughout the United States. His aim is to shed light on worlds that are too often hidden. He has contributed to many journals including \"The New Yorker\" and \"The New York Times\". \"Fast Food Nation\" was his first book.\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" asked Schlosser to write an article looking at America through fast food in 1997 after reading his article on migrants in \"Atlantic Monthly\". He then spent nearly three years researching the fast-food industry, from the slaughterhouses and packing plants that turn out the burgers to the minimum-wage workers who cook them to the television commercials that entice children to eat them with the lure of cheap toys and colorful playgrounds. The experience enraged and appalled him.\n\nThe book is divided into two sections: \"The American Way\" and \"Meat and Potatoes\". \"The American Way\" takes a historical view of the fast food business by analyzing its beginnings within post-World War II America while \"Meat and Potatoes\" examines the specific mechanisms of the fast-food industry within a modern context as well as its influence.\n\nThe first section of \"Fast Food Nation\" opens with a discussion of Carl N. Karcher and the McDonald brothers, examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of Ray Kroc and Walt Disney's complicated relationship before ending with the consideration of the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits Colorado Springs, CO and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee, learning how fast-food restaurants pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of their employees than any other American industry.\n\nThe second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agricultural world in a new economy. Schlosser's critique is particularly strong when analyzing the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America. Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become increasingly more hazardous since the centralization of the industry due to the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed, providing an ideal setting for E coli to spread. Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War and how the collapse of Soviet Communism allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.\n\nIn the 2012 edition, Schlosser published a revised edition that included an afterword. In the afterword, he looks back at the relevance and criticism of the first edition and how it inspired other works as well as how the fast food industry has evolved in the ten years following the book, including its effects on policy and childhood obesity rates. He concluded that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. The afterword can also be read in an article penned by Schlosser at \"The Daily Beast\".\n\nAn adaptation of \"Fast Food Nation\" for younger readers titled \"Chew on This\" was published in May 2006 by Houghton Mifflin. It is co-authored by journalist Charles Wilson\n\nRob Walker, writing for \"The New York Times\", remarks that \"Schlosser is a serious and diligent reporter\" and that \"Fast Food Nation\" isn't an airy deconstruction but an avalanche of facts and observations as he examines the fast-food process from meat to marketing.\" Walker however does raise concerns over the data which Schlosser bases his claims from. For example, Schlosser cites that hundreds have died from E. coli infections as a result of eating fast food, however, as Walker points out, \"[Schlosser] extrapolated his figures from an annual total in a report on food-related illness, which itself relied on a good deal of extrapolation. Moreover, that report doesn't address fast food specifically (and in fact Schlosser builds his numbers from figures including E. coli cases that are not even food-borne), which is relevant because fast-food outlets are hardly the only places where processed meat is sold.\"\n\n\"The Atlantic's\" Julia Livshin believes \"Schlosser's book is not just a compendium of kitchen horror stories. In clean, sober prose packed with facts, he strips away the carefully crafted feel-good veneer of fast food and shows how the industry's astounding success has been achieved, and is sustained, at an equally astounding cost—to the nation's health, environment, economy, and culture.\"\n\n\"While cataloguing assorted evils with the tenacity and sharp eye of the best investigative journalist, [Schlosser] uncovers a cynical, dismissive attitude to food safety in the fast food industry and widespread circumvention of the government's efforts at regulation enacted after Upton Sinclair's similarly scathing novel exposed the meat-packing industry 100 years ago. By systematically dismantling the industry's various aspects, Schlosser establishes a seminal argument for true wrongs at the core of modern America.\" \n\nTerrie Dort, president of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the trade association representing many of the country's major fast-food chains, released this statement about Schlosser and his book: \"It is unfortunate that Mr. Schlosser's book, 'Fast Food Nation,' categorizes the entire fast-food industry in such a negative light. The restaurant companies that comprise the industry provide employment to hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and offer consumers a wide variety in menu options and prices. We take exception to the characterization in this book.\"\n\n\"[Schlosser] is trying to paint a picture of 1906 in order to scare people. Unfortunately, fear and graphic stories sell,\" said Janet Riley, vice president of public affairs for the American Meat Institute, the trade association that represents most of the nation's meat packers and processors. \"There is no doubt in our minds that our food today is safer than it's ever been because there is so much more science and technology in our plants to ensure that safety. Our families eat from the same food supply that everyone else does. Of course we want safe food.\"\n\nLester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University and a former meat inspector for the USDA, says he has read only \"snippets\" of Schlosser's book but calls it \"well-intentioned criticism.\"\n\n\n"}

The flag used to represent the church was the St George's Cross, the same as the Church of England. Following the Welsh Church Act 1914, the Church in Wales was disestablished and separated from the Church of England. In the 1930s, the Church of England started to fly flags of England with the coat of arms of the respective diocese in the upper left of the flag. This practice became popular and was adopted by the Church in Wales unofficially using a flag of St David with the colours reversed in place of the St George's Cross.\n\nIn 1954 the Church in Wales' governing body passed a motion for an official flag to represent the church. Following negotiations with the College of Arms, it was decided that the new flag would consist of a blue cross with a white background with a gold celtic cross in the centre. The flag gained official status on 9 December 1954.\n\nThe official grant of arms defines the flag as \"Argent, on a Cross Azure a Celtic Cross Or\". There have been differences in the celtic cross in the flag with versions where the cross has the spaces within it filled with gold rather than showing the blue of the cross. As a flag for the Welsh made separate from England, the flag of the Church in Wales is viewed as a uniquely Welsh flag. Churches can use the flag, or the flag of their diocese.\n"}

{"id": "2444439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2444439", "title": "Garrick Theatre", "text": "Garrick Theatre\n\nThe Garrick Theatre is a West End theatre, located on Charing Cross Road, in the City of Westminster, named after the stage actor David Garrick. It opened in 1889 with \"The Profligate\", a play by Arthur Wing Pinero, and another Pinero play, \"The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith\", was an early success at the theatre. In its early years, the Garrick appears to have specialised in the performance of melodrama. The theatre later became associated with comedies, including \"No Sex Please, We're British\", which played for four years from 1982 to 1986.\n\nThere was previously another theatre that was sometimes called the Garrick in London, on Leman Street, opened in 1831 and demolished in 1881. The new Garrick Theatre was financed in 1889 by the playwright W. S. Gilbert, the author of over 75 plays, including the Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. It was designed by Walter Emden, with C. J. Phipps brought in as a consultant to help with the planning on the difficult site after an underground river was discovered in the excavation. Originally the theatre had 800 seats on four levels, but the gallery (top) level has since been closed and the seating capacity reduced to 656.\n\nThe theatre's first manager was Gilbert's friend John Hare. The first play at the theatre, \"The Profligate\", by Arthur Wing Pinero and starring Hare, opened on 24 April 1889. Sydney Grundy's long-running French-style comedy \"A Pair of Spectacles\" opened here in February 1890. Mrs Patrick Campbell starred five years later in Pinero's \"The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith\". Afterwards, the theatre suffered a short period of decline until it was leased by Arthur Bourchier for six years, whose wife, Violet Vanbrugh, starred in a series of successful productions ranging from farce to Shakespeare. In 1900, the theatre hosted J. M. Barrie's \"The Wedding Guest\". Rutland Barrington presented several stage works at the Garrick, including his popular \"fairy play\" called \"Water Babies\" in 1902, based on Charles Kingsley's book, with music by Alfred Cellier, among others. The only piece actually premiered by W. S. Gilbert here was \"Harlequin and the Fairy's Dilemma\" (retitled \"The Fairy's Dilemma\" after a few days), a \"Domestic Pantomime\" (1904). In 1921, Basil Rathbone played Dr. Lawson in \"The Edge o' Beyond\" at the Garrick, and the following year Sir Seymour Hicks appeared in his own play, \"The Man in Dress Clothes\". In 1925 Henry Daniell played there as Jack Race in \"Cobra\" and appeared there again as Paul Cortot in \"Marriage by Purchase\" in March 1932.\n\nA proposed redevelopment of Covent Garden by the GLC in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Vaudeville, Adelphi, Lyceum and Duchess theatres. An active campaign by Equity, the Musicians' Union, and theatre owners under the auspices of the \"Save London Theatres Campaign\" led to the abandonment of the scheme. The gold-leaf auditorium was restored in 1986 by the stage designer Carl Toms, and in 1997 the front façade was renovated.\n\nThe theatre has mostly been associated with comedies or comedy-dramas. More recent productions are listed below and include \"No Sex Please, We're British\" (1982), which played for four years at the theatre before transferring to the Duchess Theatre in 1986. In 1995, the Royal National Theatre's multi-award-winning production of J. B. Priestley's \"An Inspector Calls\" opened here, having played successful seasons at the Royal National Theatre's Lyttelton and Olivier theatres as well as the Aldwych Theatre and a season on Broadway.\n\nIn 1986, the Garrick was acquired by the Stoll Moss Group, and in 2000 it became a \"Really Useful Theatre\" when Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and Bridgepoint Capital purchased Stoll Moss Theatres Ltd. In October 2005, Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the Garrick Theatre, and it became one of five playhouses operating under their company name of Nimax Theatres Ltd, alongside the Lyric Theatre, Apollo Theatre, Vaudeville Theatre and Duchess Theatre.\n\nThe interior retains many of its original features, and was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in September 1960.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1050706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1050706", "title": "Gundestrup cauldron", "text": "Gundestrup cauldron\n\nThe Gundestrup cauldron is a richly decorated silver vessel, thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD, or more narrowly between 150 BC and 1 BC. This places it within the late La Tène period or early Roman Iron Age. The cauldron is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work (diameter: ; height: ). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891 in a peat bog near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the Aars parish of Himmerland, Denmark (). It is now usually on display in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, with replicas at other museums; during 2015-16 it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called \"The Celts\". \n\nThe cauldron is not complete, and now consists of a rounded cup-shaped bottom making up the lower part of the cauldron, usually called the base plate, above which are five interior plates and seven exterior ones; a missing eighth exterior plate would be needed to encircle the cauldron, and only two sections of a rounded rim at the top of the cauldron survive. The base plate is mostly smooth and undecorated inside and out, apart from a decorated round medallion in the centre of the interior. All the other plates are heavily decorated with repoussé work, hammered from beneath to push out the silver. Other techniques were used to add detail, and there is extensive gilding and some use of inlaid pieces of glass for the eyes of figures. Other pieces of fittings were found. Altogether the weight is just under 9 kilograms. \n\nDespite the fact that the vessel was found in Denmark, it was probably not made there or nearby; it includes elements of Gaulish and Thracian origin in the workmanship, metallurgy, and imagery. The techniques and elements of the style of the panels relate closely to other Thracian silver, while much of the depiction, in particular of the human figures, relates to the Celts, though attempts to relate the scenes closely to Celtic mythology remain controversial. Other aspects of the iconography derive from the Near East.\n\nHospitality on a large scale was probably an obligation for Celtic elites, and although cauldrons were therefore an important item of prestige metalwork, they are usually much plainer and smaller than this. This is an exceptionally large and elaborate object with no close parallel, except a large fragment from a bronze cauldron also found in Denmark, at Rynkeby; however the exceptional wetland deposits in Scandinavia have produced a number of objects of types that were probably once common but where other examples have not survived. It has been much discussed by scholars, and represents a fascinatingly complex demonstration of the many cross-currents in European art, as well as an unusual degree of narrative for Celtic art, though we are unlikely ever to fully understand its original meanings.\n\nThe Gundestrup cauldron was discovered by peat cutters in a small peat bog called Rævemose (near the larger Borremose bog) on 28 May 1891. The Danish government paid a large reward to the finders, who subsequently quarreled bitterly amongst themselves over its division. Palaeobotanical investigations of the peat bog at the time of the discovery showed that the land had been dry when the cauldron was deposited, and the peat gradually grew over it. The manner of stacking suggested an attempt to make the cauldron inconspicuous and well-hidden. Another investigation of Rævemose was undertaken in 2002, concluding that the peat bog may have existed when the cauldron was buried.\n\nThe cauldron was found in a dismantled state with five long rectangular plates, seven short plates, one round plate (normally termed the \"base plate\"), and two fragments of tubing stacked inside the curved base. In addition, there is a piece of iron from a ring originally placed inside the silver tubes along the rim of the cauldron. It is assumed that there is a missing eighth plate because the circumference of the seven outer plates is smaller than the circumference of the five inner plates.\n\nA set of careful full-size replicas have been made. One is in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin, and several are in France, including the Musée gallo-romain de Fourvière at Lyon and the Musée d'archéologie nationale at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\n\nSince the cauldron was found in pieces, it had to be reconstructed. The traditional order of the plates was determined by Sophus Müller, the first of many to analyze the cauldron. His logic uses the positions of the trace solder located at the rim of the bowl. In two cases, a puncture mark penetrating the inner and outer plates also helps to establish the order. In its final form, the plates are arranged in an alternation of female-male depictions, assuming the missing eighth plate is of a female. Not all analysts agree with Müller's ordering, however. Taylor has pointed out that aside from the two cases of puncturing, the order cannot be determined from the solder alignments. His argument is that the plates are not directly adjacent to each other, but are separated by a 2 cm gap; thus, the plates in this order cannot be read with certainty as the true narrative, supposing one exists.\n\nThe Gundestrup cauldron is composed almost entirely of silver, but there is also a substantial amount of gold for the gilding, tin for the solder and glass for the figures' eyes. According to experimental evidence, the materials for the vessel were not added at the same time, so the cauldron can be considered as the work of artisans over a span of several hundred years. The quality of the repairs to the cauldron, of which there are many, is inferior to the original craftsmanship.\n\nSilver was not a common material in Celtic art, and certainly not on this scale. Except sometimes for small pieces of jewellery, gold or bronze were more usual for prestige metalwork. At the time that the Gundestrup cauldron was created, silver was obtained through cupellation of lead/silver ores. By comparing the concentration of lead isotopes with the silverwork of other cultures, it has been suggested that the silver came from multiple ore deposits, mostly from Celtic northern France and western Germany in the pre-Roman period. The lead isotope studies also indicate that the silver for manufacturing the plates was prepared by repeatedly melting ingots and/or scrap silver. Three to six distinct batches of recycled silver may have been used in making the vessel. Specifically, the circular \"base plate\" may have originated as a phalera, and it is commonly thought to have been positioned in the bottom of the bowl as a late addition, soldered in to repair a hole. By an alternative theory, this phalera was not initially part of the bowl, but instead formed part of the decorations of a wooden cover.\n\nThe gold can be sorted into two groups based on purity and separated by the concentration of silver and copper. The less pure gilding, which is thicker, can be considered a later repair, as the thinner, purer inlay adheres better to the silver. The adherence of the overall gold is quite poor. The lack of mercury from the gold analysis suggests that a fire-gilding technique was not used on the Gundestrup cauldron. The gilding appears to have instead been made by mechanical means, which explains the function of closely spaced punch marks on the gilded areas.\n\nAn examination of lead isotopes similar to the one used on the silver was employed for the tin. All of the samples of tin soldering are consistent in lead-isotope composition with ingots from Cornwall in western Britain. The tin used for soldering the plates and bowl together, as well as the glass eyes, is very uniform in its high purity.\n\nFinally, the glass inlays of the Gundestrup cauldron have been determined through the use of X-ray fluorescence radiation to be of a soda-lime type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of the glass to between the second century BC and first century AD.\n\nThe workflow of the manufacturing process consisted of a few steps that required a great amount of skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates. For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high repoussé; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.\n\nIt is generally agreed that the Gundestrup cauldron was the work of multiple silversmiths. Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct tool sets. No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this fits with previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths. Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.\n\nThe silverworking techniques used in the cauldron are unknown from the Celtic world, but are consistent with the renowned Thracian sheet-silver tradition. The scenes depicted are not distinctively Thracian, but certain elements of composition, decorative motifs, and illustrated items (such as the shoelaces on the antlered figure) identify it as Thracian work.\n\nTaylor and Bergquist have postulated that the Celtic tribe known as the Scordisci commissioned the cauldron from native Thracian silversmiths. According to classical historians, the Cimbri, a Teutonic tribe, went south from the lower Elbe region and attacked the Scordisci in 118 BC. After withstanding several defeats at the hands of the Romans, the Cimbri retreated north, possibly taking with them this cauldron to settle in Himmerland, where the vessel was found.\n\nNielsen believes that the question of origin is the wrong one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, it is highly unlikely that only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.\n\nThe decorated medallion on the circular base plate depicts a bull. Above the back of the bull is a female figure wielding a sword; three dogs are also portrayed, one over the bull's head and another under its hooves. Presumably all of these figures are in combat; the third dog beneath the bull and near its tail seems to be dead, and is only faintly shown in engraving, and the bull may have been brought down. Below the bull is scrolling ivy that draws from classical Greco-Roman art. The horns of the bull are missing, but there is a hole right through the head where they were originally fitted; they were perhaps gold. The head of the bull rises entirely clear of the plate, and the medallion is considered the most accomplished part of the cauldron in technical and artistic terms.\n\nEach of the seven exterior plates centrally depicts a bust. Plates a, b, c, and d show bearded male figures, and the remaining three are female.\n\n\n\nFor many years, some scholars have interpreted the cauldron's images in terms of the Celtic pantheon, and Celtic mythology as it is presented in much later literature in Celtic languages from the British Isles. Others regard the latter interpretations with great suspicion. Much less controversially, there are clear parallels between details of the figures and Iron Age Celtic artefacts excavated by archaeology. \n\nOther details of the iconography clearly derive from the art of the ancient Near East, and there are intriguing parallels with ancient India and later Hindu deities and their stories. Scholars are mostly content to regard the former as motifs borrowed purely for their visual appeal, without carrying over anything much of their original meaning, but despite the distance some have attempted to relate the latter to wider traditions remaining from Proto-Indo-European religion.\n\nAmong the most specific details that are clearly Celtic are the group of carnyx players. The carnyx war horn was known from Roman descriptions of the Celts in battle and Trajan's Column, and a few pieces are known from archaeology, their number greatly increased by finds at Tintignac in France in 2004. Diodorus Siculus wrote around 60-30 BC (Histories, 5.30):\n\nAnother detail that is easily matched to archaeology is the torc worn by several figures, clearly of the \"buffer\" type, a fairly common Celtic artefact found in Western Europe, most often France, from the period the cauldron is thought to have been made.\n\nOther details with more tentative Celtic links are the long swords carried by some figures, and the horned and antlered helmets or head-dresses and the boar crest worn on their helmet by some warriors. These can be related to Celtic artefacts such as a helmet with a raptor crest from Romania, the Waterloo Helmet, Torrs Pony-cap and Horns and various animal figures including boars, of uncertain function. The shield bosses, spurs and horse harness also relate to Celtic examples.\n\nThe antlered figure in plate A has been commonly identified as Cernunnos, who is named (the only source for the name) on the 1st-century Gallo-Roman Pillar of the Boatmen, where he is shown as an antlered figure with torcs hanging from his antlers. Possibly the lost portion below his bust showed him seated cross-legged as the figure on the cauldron is. Otherwise there is evidence of a horned god from several cultures. \n\nThe figure holding the broken wheel in plate C is more tentatively thought to be Taranis, the solar or thunder \"wheel-god\" named by Lucian and represented in a number of Iron Age images; there are also many wheels that seem to have been amulets.\n\nThe many animals depicted on the cauldron include elephants, a dolphin, leopard-like felines, and various fantastic animals, as well as animals that are widespread across Eurasia, such as snakes, cattle, deer, boars and birds. Celtic art often includes animals, but not often in fantastic forms with wings and aspects of different animals combined. There are exceptions to this, some when motifs are clearly borrowed, as the boy riding a dolphin is borrowed from Greek art, and others that are more native, like the ram-headed horned snake who appears three times on the cauldron. The art of Thrace often shows animals, most often powerful and fierce ones, many of which are also very common in the ancient Near East, or the Scythian art of the Eurasian steppe, whose mobile owners provided a route for the very rapid transmission of motifs and objects between the civilizations of Asia and Europe.\n\nIn particular, the two figures standing in profile flanking the large head on exterior plate F, each with a bird with outstretched wings just above their head clearly resemble a common motif in ancient Assyrian and Persian art, down to the long garments they wear. Here the figure is usually the ruler, and the wings belong to a symbolic representation of a deity protecting him. Other plates show griffins borrowed from Ancient Greek art of that of the Near East. On several of the exterior plates the large heads, probably of deities, in the centre of the exterior panels, have small arms and hands, either each grasping an animal or human in a version of the common Master of Animals motif, or held up empty at the side of the head in a way suggesting inspiration from this motif.\n\nApart from Cernunnos and Taranis, discussed above, there is no consensus regarding the other figures, and many scholars reject attempts to tie them in to figures known from much later and geographically distant sources. Some Celticists have explained the elephants depicted on plate B as a reference to Hannibal's crossing of the Alps. \n\nBecause of the double-headed wolfish monster attacking the two small figures of fallen men on plate b, parallels can be drawn to the Welsh character Manawydan or the Irish Manannán, a god of the sea and the Otherworld. Another possibility is the Gaulish version of Apollo, who was not only a warrior, but one associated with springs and healing besides.\n\nOlmsted relates the scenes of the cauldron to those of the Táin Bó Cuailnge, where the antlered figure is Cú Chulainn, the bull of the base plate is Donn Cuailnge, and the female and two males of plate e are Medb, Ailill, and Fergus mac Róich. Olmsted also toys with the idea that the female figure flanked by two birds on plate f could be Medb with her pets or Morrígan, the Irish war goddess who often changes into a carrion bird.\n\nBoth Olmsted and Taylor agree that the female of plate f might be Rhiannon of the Mabinogion. Rhiannon is famous for her birds, whose songs could \"awaken the dead and lull the living to sleep\". In this role, Rhiannon could be considered the Goddess of the Otherworld.\n\nTaylor presents a more pancultural view of the cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate f, with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, he points to the similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and Vishnu, a god from Hinduism.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8738430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8738430", "title": "Hindu views on evolution", "text": "Hindu views on evolution\n\nHinduism includes a range of viewpoints about the origin of life, creationism and evolution. There is no single story of creation, due to dynamic diversity of Hinduism, and these are derived from various sources like Vedas, some from the Brahmanas, some from Puranas; some are philosophical, based on concepts, and others are narratives. The Rigveda mentions the \"Hiranyagarbha\" (\"golden embryo\") as the source of the creation of the Universe, similar to the world egg motif found in the creation myths of many other civilizations. It also contains a myth of proto-Indo-European origin, in which the creation arises out of the dismemberment of a cosmic being (the Purusha) who is sacrificed by the gods. As for the creation of the primordial gods themselves, the Nasadiya Sukta of Rigveda takes a near-agnostic stand, stating that the Gods came into being after the world's creation, and nobody knows when the world first came into being. In the later Puranic texts, the creator god Brahma is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe'. Some texts consider him equivalent to the Hiranyagarbha or the Purusha, while others state that he arose out of these. Brahma is a part of the trinity of gods that also includes Vishnu and Shiva, who are responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively. \n\nMany Hindu texts mention the cycle of creation and destruction. The Shatapatha Brahmana states that the current human generation descends from Manu, the only man who survived a great deluge after being warned by the God. This legend is comparable to the other flood legends, such as the story of the Noah's Ark mentioned in the Bible and the Quran.\n\nHindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in scriptures. For example, the concept of Dashavatara can be seen as having some similarities to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.The first incarnation of Vishnu in the form of a fish resembles the evolutionary origin of fish in the Silurian Period.\n\nIn a survey of 909 people, 77% of its respondents in India agreed that enough scientific evidence exists to support Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, and 85% of God-believing people said they agree with evolution as well. According to the survey conducted by Pew Forum in the United States, 80% of Hindus agree that evolution is the best explanation for the origin of human life on earth. However, in India, there were minimal references to Darwinism in the 1800s. Elements of Victorian England opposed the idea of Darwinism. Hindus already had present notion of common ancestry between humans and animals. The Hindu dharma believes that the gods have animal features, showing a theory that humans can be reborn again as animals or with their features.\n\nAccording to Hindu creationism all species on earth including humans have \"devolved\" or come down from a high state of pure consciousness. Hindu creationists claim that species of plants and animals are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths. Ronald Numbers says that: \"Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago.\" Hindu creationism is a form of old earth creationism. According to Hindu creationists the universe may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the Vedas which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the earth.\n\nHinduism is a conglomeration of distinct intellectual or philosophical points of view, rather than a rigid common set of beliefs. As a result, the Hindu texts do not provide a single canonical account of the creation; they mention a range of theories of the creation of the world, some of which are contradictory.\n\nThe Purusha Sukta of the earliest Hindu text Rigveda mentions Purusha, primeval cosmic being. Purusha is described as all that has ever existed and will ever exist. This being's body was the origin of four different kinds of people: the Brahmin, the Rajanya, the Vaishya, and the Shudra. Viraj, variously interpreted as the mundane egg (see Hiranyagarbha) or the twofold male-female energy, was born from Purusha, and the Purusha was born again from Viraj. The gods then performed a yajna with the Purusha, leading to the creation of the other things in the manifested world from his various body parts and his mind. These things included the animals, the Vedas, the Varnas, the celestial bodies, the air, the sky, the heavens, the earth, the directions, and the Gods Indra and Agni. It is likely that this myth has proto-Indo-European origins, as it is similar to other myths found in the Indo-European cultures, in which the creation arises out of the dismemberment of a divine being (cf. Ymir of the Norse mythology).\n\nThe concept of Purusha is similar to the concept of Brahman described in the later texts. As for the creation of the primordial beings (such as the gods who performed the sacrifice of the Purusha), the Nasadiya Sukta states:\n\nRigveda (10.121) also mentions the Hiranyagarbha (literally, golden embryo/womb/egg) that existed before the creation. This metaphor has been interpreted differently by the various later texts. The Samkhya texts state that Purusha and the Prakriti made the embryo, from which the world emerged. In another tradition, the creator god Brahma emerged from the egg and created the world, while in yet another tradition the Brahma himself is the Hiranyagarbha. The nature of the Purusha, the creation of the gods and other details of the embryo creation myth have been described variously by the later Hindu texts.\n\nThe early hymns of Rigveda also mention Tvastar as the first born creator of the human world.\n\nRecounting the creation of gods, the Rig Veda does seem to affirm ‘’creatio ex nihilo’’. Rig Veda 10.72 states:\n\nThe Shatapatha Brahmana mentions a story of creation, in which the Prajapati performs tapas to reproduce himself. He releases the waters and enters them in the form of an egg that evolves into the cosmos. The Prajapati emerged from the golden egg, and created the earth, the middle regions and the sky. With further tapas, he created the devas. He also created the asuras, and the darkness came into the being. It also contains a story similar to the other great flood stories. After the great flood, Manu the only surviving human, offers a sacrifice from which Ida is born. From her, the existing human race comes into the being.\n\nThe Aitareya Upanishad (3.4.1) mentions that only the \"Atman\" (the Self) existed in the beginning. The Self created the heaven (\"Ambhas\"), the sky (\"Marikis\"), the earth (\"Mara\") and the underworld (\"Ap\"). He then formed the Purusha from the water. He also created the speech, the fire, the prana (breath of life), the air and the various senses, the directions, the trees, the mind, the moon and other things.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (1.4) mentions that in the beginning, only the Atman existed as the Purusha. Feeling lonely, the Purusha divided itself into two parts: male (\"pati\") and female (\"patni\"). The men were born when the male embraced the female. The female thought \"how can he embrace me, after having produced me from himself? I shall hide myself.\" She then became a cow to hide herself, but the male became a bull and embraced her. Thus the cows were born. Similarly, everything that exists in pairs, was created. Next, the Purusha created the fire, the soma and the immortal gods (the devas) from his better part. He also created the various powers of the gods, the different classes, the dharma (law or duty) and so on. The Taittiriya Upanishad states that the being (\"sat\") was created from the non-being. The Being later became the \"Atman\" (2.7.1), and then created the worlds (1.1.1). The Chhandogya states that the Brahma creates, sustains and destroys the world.\n\nBelief in evolution is among the Samkhya philosophy. In the Samkhya philosophy, evolution is symbolized by the Sanskrit term parinama. Many Hindu reformers compare this term and philosophy with Darwinism. The prominent Vivekananda, based most of his cosmological and biological ideas off of the Samkhya. The Samkhya texts state that there are two distinct fundamental eternal entities: the Purusha and the Prakriti. The Prakriti has three qualities: \"sattva\" (purity or preservation), \"rajas\" (creation) and \"tamas\" (darkness or destruction). When the equilibrium between these qualities gets broken, the act of creation starts. \"Rajas\" quality leads to creation.\n\nThe later texts such as the Puranas identify the Purusha with the God. In many Puranic notes, Brahma is the creator god. However, some Puranas also identify Vishnu, Shiva or Devi as the creator.\n\nIn Garuda Purana, there was nothing in the universe except the Brahman. The universe became an expanse of water, and in that Vishnu was born in the golden egg. He created Brahma with four faces. Brahma then created the devas, asuras, pitris and manushas. He also created the rakshasas, yakshas, gandharvas. Other creatures came from the various parts of his body (e.g. snakes from his hair, sheep from his chest, goats from his mouth, cows from his stomach, others from feet). His body hair became the herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths. He created several sons from his mind, Daksha, Daksha's wife, Manu Svaymbhuva, his wife Shatarupta and the rishi Kashypa. Kashypata married thirrteen of Daksha's daughter and all the devas and the createures were born through them. Other Puranas and the Manu Smriti mention several variations of this theory.\n\nIn Vishnu Purana, the Purusha is same as the creator deity Brahma, and is a part of Vishnu. The Shaivite texts mention the Hiranyagarbha as a creation of Shiva. According to the Devi-Bhagavata Purana Purusha and Prakriti emerged together and formed the Brahman, the supreme universal spirit that is the origin and support of the universe.\n\nThe Advaita Vedanta states that the creation arises from Brahman, but it is illusory and has no reality. (Vivarta)\n\nMany Hindu philosophies mention that the creation is cyclic. According to the Upanishads, the universe and the Earth, along with humans and other creatures, undergo repeated cycles (\"pralaya\") of creation and destruction. A variety of myths exist regarding the specifics of the process, but in general the Hindu view of the cosmos is as eternal and cyclic. The later puranic view also asserts that the universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. In Hindu cosmology, a universe endures for about 4,320,000,000 years (one day of Brahma, the creator or \"kalpa\") and is then destroyed by fire or water elements. At this point, Brahma rests for one night, just as long as the day. This process, called \"pralaya\" (cataclysm), repeats for 100 Brahma years (311 trillion, 40 billion human years) that represents Brahma's lifespan.\n\nMost Hindus accept the theory of biological evolution. They either regard the scriptural creation theories as allegories and metaphors, or reconcile these legends with the modern theory of evolution.\n\nThe order of the Dashavatara (ten principal avatars of the god Vishnu) is interpreted to convey Darwin's evolution. British geneticist and evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane opined that they are a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of evolution. Like the evolutionary process itself, the first avatar of God is a fish - Matsya, then comes the aquatic reptile turtle, Kurma, then a mammal - the boar Varaha, then Narasimha, a man-lion being, Vamana, the dwarf then the rest four are humans; Kalki is not yet born. Various thinkers and authors like Helena Blavatsky, Monier Monier-Williams, Nabinchandra Sen, C. D. Deshmukh have associated the Dashavatara with evolution.\n\nThe Sanskrit epics of the Hindus mention several exotic creatures including ape-like humanoids. Some Hindus see this as a proof of the historicity of their mythological characters and as support for the theory of evolution in their texts. The Ramayana speaks of the Vanaras, an ape-like species with human intelligence, that existed millions of years ago. According to the Ramayana alongside these ape-men existed modern humans. Thus, according to these ancient writings, the status of such creatures was a state of coexistence rather than evolution.\n\nWhile the Creation–evolution controversy has seen much debate in the US and other countries, it is an insignificant issue in India, because of its Hindu-majority population. Hindus are among many faiths that have expressed apprehension about efforts to teach Christian creationism in public schools in the US. One objection to the teaching of creationism based on the religious texts of a particular faith is that in a pluralistic society this can result in the imposition of one religion.\n\n\nHinduism and Science\n\nHare Krishna\n"}

Various types of information and data can be, and have been, \"leaked\" to the Internet, the most common being personal information, computer software and source code, and artistic works such as books or albums. For example, a musical album is leaked if it has been made available to the public on the Internet before its official release date; and is still intended to be confidential.\n\nSource code leaks are usually caused by misconfiguration of software like CVS or FTP which allow people to get source files by exploiting, by software bugs, or by employees that have access to the sources of part of them revealing the code in order to harm the company.\n\nThere were many cases of source code leaks in the history of software development.\n\nFor instance, as Fraunhofer IIS released in 1994 only a low quality version of their MP3 encoding software (l3enc), a hacker named SoloH gathered the source code from the unprotected servers of the University of Erlangen and developed a higher quality version, which started the MP3 revolution on the internet.\n\nAround 1996 Electronic Arts accidentally put the source code of FIFA 97 on a demo disc.\n\nIn 2003 a hacker exploited a security hole in Microsoft's Outlook to get the complete source of the video game \"Half-Life 2\", which was under development at the time. The complete source was soon available in various file sharing networks. This leak was rumored to be the cause of the game's delay, but later was stated not to be.\n\nAlso in 2003, source code to Diebold Election Systems Inc. voting machines was leaked. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Rice University published a damning critique of Diebold's products, based on an analysis of the software. They found, for example, that it would be easy to program a counterfeit voting card to work with the machines and then use it to cast multiple votes inside the voting booth.\n\nIn 2003 a Chinese Hacker acquired the Lineage II source code, and sold it to someone who set up alternative servers. Shutdown by FBI in 2007.\n\nIn 2003, one year after 3dfx was bought by Nvidia and support ended, the source code for their drivers leaked, resulting in fan-made, updated drivers.\n\nIn 2004, a large portion of Windows NT 4.0's source code and a small percentage (reportedly about 15%) of Windows 2000's were leaked online. The Windows 2000 source code leak was analysed by a writer for (now defunct) website Kuro5hin who noted that while the code was generally well written, allegedly \"there are a dozen or so 'fucks' and 'shits', and hundreds of 'craps'.\" The writer also noted that there were a lot of code hacks, with the \"uglier\" ones mostly being for compatibility with older programs and some hardware. It was feared that because of the leak, the number of security exploits would increase due to wider scrutiny of the source code. It was later discovered that the source of the leak originated from Mainsoft.\n\nAlso in 2004, partial (800 MB) proprietary source code that drives Cisco Systems' networking hardware was made available in the internet. The site posted two files of source code written in the C programming language, which apparently enables some next-generation IPv6 functionality. News of the latest source code leak appeared on a Russian security site.\n\nIn 2006, Anonymous hackers stole source code (about 1 GiB) for Symantec's pcAnywhere from the company's network. While confirmed in January 2012, it is still unclear how the hackers accessed the network.\n\nIn late 2007, the source code of Norton Ghost 12 and a Norton Anti-Spyware version were available via BitTorrent.\n\nIn December 2007 and January 8, a Pirate Bay user published the sources of five Idera SQL products via BitTorrent.\n\nIn January 2011 the \"stolen source code\" of Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2008 was published on the Pirate Bay.\n\nOn May 20, 2011, EVE Online's source code was published by someone on a GitHub repository. After being online for four days CCP issued a DMCA take-down request which was followed by GitHub.\n\nIn 2011 the source code of v1.5 became available online.\n\nIn December 2011, the source code of the Solaris 11 operating system's kernel was leaked via BitTorrent.\n\nIn August 2014 's X-Ray Engine source code (and its successor) became available on GitHub under a non-open-source license.\n\nOn December 29, 2015 the AmigaOS 3.1 source code leaked to the web, confirmed by the rights holder Hyperion Entertainment.\n\nIn January 2017 the source code of Opera's Presto Browser engine was leaked to GitHub. The source code was shortly after taken down with a DMCA notice.\n\nIn June 2017 part of Microsoft's Windows 10 source code leaked to the public.\n\nSometimes software developers themselves will leak their source code in an effort to prevent a software product from becoming abandonware after it has reached its end-of-life, allowing the community to continue development and support. Reasons for leaking instead of a proper release to public domain or as open-source can include scattered or lost intellectual property rights. An example is the video game \"Falcon 4.0\" which became available in 2000; another one is \"Dark Reign 2\", which was released by an anonymous former Pandemic Studios developer in 2011. Another notable example is an archive of Infocom's video games source code which appeared from an anonymous Infocom source and was archived by the Internet Archive in 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

She was best known for her play \"Possum Paddock\" in 1919. The talented Howarde also played a part in numerous roles as playwright in over 10 plays from 1914-1938. She was the first Australian woman to direct a feature film.\n\nHowarde, was born on 28 July 1864 to parents Edward George Jones and Harriett Hannah in England before migrating to New Zealand as a child.\n\nKate married her first husband William Henry de Saxe who was a musician, the pair married in Christchurch, New Zealand on 28 April 1884, the couple gave birth to a little girl Florence Adrienne born 5 December 1884. Years went by and Saxe and Howarde separated. The registry has no exact dates when she separated from her first husband. On 26 November 1904, the Kate Howarde Dramatic Theatre company opened for a season at Perth's Theatre Royal, the line up included Scottish comedian and singer Elton Black, the pair hit it off and the two were later married. Records do not show how long Black had been in the country prior to the pair getting married. Shortly after, in May 1905, the pair set their sights for America and remained overseas for some four and a half years. Howarde later died from cerebral thrombosis on 18 February 1939.\n\nThe late 1890s saw big things for Howarde when she adopted the stage name Kate Howarde; she began touring Australia and performing in different settings such as tents and halls. She formed a company which consisted of her two younger brothers and her sister. Kate Howarde and her company continued touring Australia and New Zealand up until 1905. The company was involved in such things as occasionally staged pantomimes and burlesques some of which included \"Sinbad the Sailor\" (1897), \"Little Jack Sheppard\", \"Aladdin\" and \"Diavolo\".\n\nHowarde's big break came with the play \"Possum Paddock\" which was released in 1919. The play was written, produced and presented by Howarde. The play brought such success she decided to turn it into a film, which she also starred in, produced, co-directed and co-scripted along with Charles Villiers. This was the first Australian feature film to be co-directed by a woman, making Howarde a female pioneer within the emerging Australian film industry. The film was set to be released on 29 January 1921.\n\nThe success of \"Possum Paddock\" gained her stardom in the business which led to a 10-month tour across several companies. Howarde did not make any more films but continued to write many more plays with her company which were also great success, the last play she wrote was \"Judgement of jean Calvert\" before her death in 1939.\n\n\n"}

For instance, he placed a ton of ice in the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires and named it Placebo. He also caused controversy by publicly projecting on the chest and backs of six half naked ballerinas two video spots: one a popular Coca-Cola TV ad in which a polar bear played with a baby seal and shared a Coke with it while in the opposite one a polar bear hunts and bloodily devours a baby seal, he named the piece Bearshit.\n\nSince December 2015, Tenembaum leads a morning radio show called \"El Observador Internacional\", in which he analyses the landscape of international politics. It is delivered by Radio Jai, an Argentine-Jewish radio station.\n\nHe attended Law School at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and specialized in Anthropology at Temple University of Philadelphia. As a lawyer, he also worked as a city attorney of the city of Jerusalem. During the 90s he decided that some of his ideas could only be created and developed through art, specially art related to new technologies. Therefore, during the past years, Mookie has concentrated specifically on reflecting on the different problems related to the State by means of creating new-media works. Currently, Mookie is working on pieces having to do with the different social and ideological problems of the state, developing projects such as \"Genesis\", which by means of an on-line system which generates \"trusts\" with the status of juridical persons, it reveals how the State presents \"traps\" in their formulation and efficiency, which are not easily readable for most citizens. With this type of projects, Mookie makes them visible, strongly criticizing the State apparatus ruling Latin America. Chasing utopian goals, with his projects Mookie proposes social reinvention and, as a consequence, refoundation. His compasses in this goal are George Orwell, J.J. Rousseau, and John Locke's theories, as well as Minarchist ideas. An expert on the Internet and new technologies, Mookie is a member of FiRE (Future in Review) an annual event that gathers one hundred people from all over the world to discuss the likely penetration of the latest technological innovations and their impact on a not so far away future. He also founded United Virtualities, a company of on-line systems, and created over twenty on-line technologies, such as Ooqa Ooqa (Explorer's enhanced native toolbar), Schvitzer (an intelligent text highlighter), and Yachne (a 3D animated messenger).\n\nHis art piece \"Paranoia\" was awarded the highest prize in 2008 official Salón Nacional de Bellas Artes the most prestigious award in Argentina.\n\nRecently he was featured on CNN's \"Cala\".\n\nHis works have been the object of numerous individual and collective in his native Argentina, and abroad.\n\nConcurrently, Tenembaum's philosophical work started with a virulent critique of \"Illusions\", which is the term he uses to dub States, Religions, Families and other such juridical persons. His, is a deconstructive critique revolving around the fundamental claim that these Illusions are nothing but onerous fever phantasms spawned by each physical person's terror of death, or ATD (after its Ancient Greek initials Auto-Thanatos-Deimia).\n\nAs of late, Tenembaum's system of Disillusionism has expanded into a wider discussion of human ethology. According to him, behavioral modernity, depends not only upon ATD and Illusions, but also upon the neuro-physiology that explains pain, relief, pleasure, memory, anticipation and other rival contenders for the very limited attentional span of human animals. Furthermore, Disillusionism relies heavily upon negativity and discarding as driving forces behind both human evolution and common sense.\n\nOn a practical note, Tenembaum's philosophy also distinguishes animal aptitude from each individual's actual willingness to apply the abilities it possesses. Drawing a parallel with the ancestral packs, in which a division of attention and tasks was biologically enforced amongst individuals, Disillusionism attempts to make sense of the exchanges and relationships inside each human individual's Egosphere, and discuses the part Common Sense might play in optimizing such organization.\n\nTenembaum is the father of five children and the eldest son of Baruch Tenembaum, founder of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation and is a resident of Paraguay.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended the Thomas School and went on to study art history at the Universities of Leipzig, Munich, Berlin, and Frankfurt/Main, completing a PhD in 1924 on the baroque merchant houses of Leipzig. In 1923, he married Carola (\"Lola\") Kurlbaum, the daughter of distinguished Leipzig lawyer Alfred Kurlbaum. He worked as an assistant keeper at the Dresden Gallery (1924–28).\n\nDuring this period he became interested in establishing the supremacy of German modernist architecture after becoming aware of Le Corbusier's Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau at the Paris Exhibition of 1925.\n\nIn 1928 he contributed the volume on Italian baroque painting to the \"Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft\", a multi-volume series providing an overview of the history of European art. He taught at the University of Göttingen (1929–33), offering a specialist course on English art and architecture.\nAccording to biographer Stephen Games, Pevsner welcomed many of the economic and cultural policies of the early Hitler regime. However, due to Nazi race laws he was forced to resign his lectureship in 1933. Later that year he moved to England, settling in Hampstead, where poet Geoffrey Grigson was his neighbour in Wildwood Terrace. Pevsner's first post was an 18-month research fellowship at the University of Birmingham, found for him by friends in Birmingham and partly funded by the Academic Assistance Council. A study of the role of the designer in the industrial process, the research produced a generally critical account of design standards in Britain which he published as \"An Enquiry into Industrial Art in England\" (Cambridge University Press, 1937). He was subsequently employed as a buyer of modern textiles, glass and ceramics for the Gordon Russell furniture showrooms in London.\n\nBy this time Pevsner had also completed \"Pioneers of the Modern Movement: from William Morris to Walter Gropius\", his influential pre-history of what he saw as Walter Gropius's dominance of contemporary design. \"Pioneers\" ardently championed Gropius's first two buildings (both pre–First World War) on the grounds that they summed up all the essential goals of 20th-century architecture; in England, however, it was widely taken to be the history of England's contribution to international modernism, and a manifesto for Bauhaus (i.e. Weimar) modernism, which it was not. In spite of that, the book remains an important point of reference in the teaching of the history of modern design, and helped lay the foundation of Pevsner's career in England as an architectural historian. Since its first publication by Faber & Faber in 1936, it has gone through several editions and been translated into many languages. The English-language edition has also been renamed \"Pioneers of Modern Design\".\n\nPevsner was \"more German than the Germans\" to the extent that he supported \"Goebbels in his drive for 'pure' non-decadent German art\". He was reported as saying of the Nazis (in 1933) \"I want this movement to succeed. There is no alternative but chaos... There are things worse than Hitlerism\". Nonetheless he was included in the Nazi Black Book as hostile to the Hitler regime.\n\nIn 1940, Pevsner was interned as an enemy alien in Huyton, Liverpool. Geoffrey Grigson wrote in his \"Recollections\": \"When at last two hard-faced Bow Street runners arrived in the eary hours of the morning to take [him] ... I managed, clutching my pyjama trousers, to catch them up with the best parting present I could quickly think of, which was an elegant little edition, a new edition, of Shakespeare's Sonnets.\" Pevsner was released after three months on the intervention of, among others, Frank Pick, then Director-General of the Ministry of Information. He spent some time in the months after the Blitz clearing bomb debris, and wrote reviews and art criticism for the Ministry of Information's \"Die Zeitung\", an anti-Nazi publication for Germans living in England. He also completed for Penguin Books the Pelican paperback \"An Outline of European Architecture\", which he had begun to develop while in internment. \"Outline\" would eventually go into seven editions, be translated into 16 languages, and sell more than half a million copies.\n\nIn 1942, Pevsner finally secured two regular positions. From 1936 onwards he had been a frequent contributor to the \"Architectural Review\" and from 1943 to 1945 he stood in as its acting editor while the regular editor J. M. Richards was on active service. Under the \"AR\"s influence, Pevsner's approach to modern architecture became more complex and more moderate. Early signs of a lifelong interest in Victorian architecture, also influenced by the \"Architectural Review\", appeared in a series written under the pseudonym of \"Peter F. R. Donner\": Pevsner's \"Treasure Hunts\" guided readers down selected London streets, pointing out architectural treasures of the 19th century. He was also closely involved with the \"Review\"s proprietor, H. de C. Hastings, in evolving the magazine's theories on picturesque planning.\n\nIn 1942, Pevsner was also appointed a part-time lecturer at Birkbeck College, London; he would eventually retire from the college in 1969 as its first professor of art history. He lectured at Cambridge for almost 30 years, having been Slade professor there for a record six years from 1949 to 1955, and would also hold the Slade professorship at Oxford in 1968.\n\nFraming all this was his career as a writer and editor. After moving to England, Pevsner had found that the study of architectural history had little status in academic circles, and the amount of information available, especially to travellers wanting to inform themselves about the architecture of a particular district, was limited. Invited by Allen Lane, founder of Penguin Books, for whom he had written his \"Outline\" and also edited the King Penguin series, to suggest ideas for future publications, he proposed a series of comprehensive county guides to rectify this shortcoming.\n\nWork on the \"Buildings of England\" series began in 1945, and the first volume was published in 1951. Pevsner wrote 32 of the books himself and 10 with collaborators, with a further four of the original series written by others. Since his death, work has continued on the series, which has been extended to cover the rest of the United Kingdom, under the title Pevsner Architectural Guides (now published by Yale University Press). After updating and correcting \"London 1: the Cities of London and Westminster\" for its reissue in 1962, Pevsner delegated the revision and expansion of further volumes to others, beginning with Enid Radcliffe for \"Essex\" (1965). The gazetteer descriptions of revised volumes do not routinely distinguish between Pevsner's original text and any new writing, but more recent books sometimes supply his words in quotation when the revising author's judgement differs, where a building has since been altered, or where the old text is no longer topical.\n\nAs well as \"The Buildings of England\", Pevsner proposed the \"Penguin the Pelican History of Art\" series (1953– ), a multi-volume survey on the model of the German \"Handbuch der Kunstwissenschaft\", which he would himself edit. Many individual volumes are regarded as classics.\n\nIn 1946, Pevsner made the first of several broadcasts on the BBC Third Programme, presenting nine talks in all up to 1950, examining painters and European art eras. By 1977 he had presented 78 talks for the BBC, including the Reith Lectures in 1955 – a series of six broadcasts, entitled \"The Englishness of English Art\", for which he explored the qualities of art which he regarded as particularly English, and what they said about the English national character. His A. W. Mellon Lectures in Fine Art at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., were published in 1976 as \"A History of Building Types\".\n\nPevsner was a founding member in 1957 of the Victorian Society, the national charity for the study and protection of Victorian and Edwardian architecture and other arts. In 1964 he was invited to become its chairman, and steered it through its formative years, fighting alongside John Betjeman, Hugh Casson and others to save houses, churches, railway stations and other monuments of the Victorian age. He served for ten years (1960–70) as a member of the National Advisory Council on Art Education (or Coldstream Committee), campaigning for art history to be a compulsory element in the curriculum of art schools. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1965 and awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1967.\n\nHaving assumed British citizenship in 1946, Pevsner was appointed a CBE in 1953 and was knighted in 1969 \"for services to art and architecture\".\n\nPevsner also received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1975.\n\nPevsner died at home in Wildwood Terrace, Hampstead, London, in August 1983. His wife predeceased him by 20 years.\n\nHis memorial service was held at the Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury, the following December, with the memorial address being given by Alec Clifton-Taylor, a friend of 50 years. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter, Clyffe Pypard, in Wiltshire. His elder son, Dieter, was an editor at Penguin Books. His younger son, Tom, was a film producer and director who went on to work on several James Bond films.\n\nAlthough Pevsner oversaw the publication of the initial volumes of the Scottish, Welsh and Irish counterparts of \"The Buildings of England\" (and in each was credited as \"Editor-in-Chief\", \"Founding Editor\" and \"Editorial Adviser\" respectively) he did not write any of them. As with the revisions of his earlier works, many of these volumes were the work of several contributors. Coverage of the whole of Great Britain was completed in 2016, with the Irish series still in progress.\n\nA fictionalised Pevsner appears in the 1998 novel \"The Spell\" by Alan Hollinghurst.\n\n\nIn 1984 the Getty Research Institute acquired the Nikolaus Pevsner Papers, an archive that includes 143 boxes of typed and handwritten notes, clippings, photographs, books, lecture notes, and manuscripts.\n\n\n\nPapers relating to Pevsner's departure from Germany and efforts to obtain work in England are contained within the archives of the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning (now the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics) in the Bodleian Library.

Set in the US around the turn of the 21st century, it gently pokes fun at life, manners, morals as well as the tensions within the modern LGBT and liberal communities. It stars lesbian actress Cathy DeBuono.\n\nThe story follows the main characters Rose a comfortably out woman who identifies as lesbian and Anthony a decent progressive heterosexual man who serendipitously meet and then unexpectedly find themselves falling for each other. Rose has to navigate the reaction of her friends (they aren't thrilled) and her family (they are) while Anthony too has to deal with his friends who are equally nonplussed.\n\nThe story was written and produced by Kyle Schickner, who is a bisexual rights activist as well as being a film producer, writer, director and actor. It began as a successful Off-Off-Broadway Production in 1996 at New York City's Sanford Meisner Theater which was turned into a well received 1997 Indie film by Schickner's FenceSitter Films. In 2008/2009 FenceSitter Films began working with an American Cable TV Network to spin-off \"Rose by Any Other Name ...\" into a weekly TV series.\n\nAccording to Schickner after production had gotten underway \"at the 11th hour as they were setting up to shoot the pilot the network expressed concern over how the cutting-edge social theme might play with some of their core viewership and decided to look at more data to see what kind of response the show might get\". So with the assistance of American Institute of Bisexuality the project was turned into a Web series with each Webisode being posted on the FenceSitter Films YouTube channel. Episodes 7–9 and 11 are no longer available on said channel due to a successful copyright claim.\n\n"}
{"id": "1672429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1672429", "title": "Scythian art", "text": "Scythian art\n\nScythian art is art, primarily decorative objects, such as jewellery, produced by the nomadic tribes in the area known to the ancient Greeks as Scythia, which was centred on the Pontic-Caspian steppe and ranged from modern Kazakhstan to the Baltic coast of modern Poland and to Georgia. The identities of the nomadic peoples of the steppes is often uncertain, and the term \"Scythian\" should often be taken loosely; the art of nomads much further east than the core Scythian territory exhibits close similarities as well as differences, and terms such as the \"Scytho-Siberian world\" are often used. Other Eurasian nomad peoples recognised by ancient writers, notably Herodotus, include the Massagetae, Sarmatians, and Saka, the last a name from Persian sources, while ancient Chinese sources speak of the Xiongnu or Hsiung-nu. Modern archaeologists recognise, among others, the Pazyryk, Tagar, and Aldy-Bel cultures, with the furthest east of all, the later Ordos culture a little west of Beijing. The art of these peoples is collectively known as steppes art.\n\nIn the case of the Scythians the characteristic art was produced in a period from the 7th to 3rd centuries BC, after which the Scythians were gradually displaced from most of their territory by the Sarmatians, and rich grave deposits cease among the remaining Scythian populations on the Black Sea coast. Over this period many Scythians became sedentary, and involved in trade with neighbouring peoples such as the Greeks.\n\nIn the earlier period Scythian art included very vigorously modelled stylised animal figures, shown singly or in combat, that had a long-lasting and very wide influence on other Eurasian cultures as far apart as China and the European Celts. As the Scythians came in contact with the Greeks at the Western end of their area, their artwork influenced Greek art, and was influenced by it; also many pieces were made by Greek craftsmen for Scythian customers. Although we know that goldsmith work was an important area of Ancient Greek art, very little has survived from the core of the Greek world, and finds from Scythian burials represent the largest group of pieces we now have. The mixture of the two cultures in terms of the background of the artists, the origin of the forms and styles, and the possible history of the objects, gives rise to complex questions. Many art historians feel that the Greek and Scythian styles were too far apart for works in a hybrid style to be as successful as those firmly in one style or the other. Other influences from urbanized civilizations such as those of Persia and China, and the mountain cultures of the Caucasus, also affected the art of their nomadic neighbours.\n\nScythian art especially Scythian gold jewellery is highly valued by museums and many of the most valuable artefacts are in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. Their Eastern neighbours, the Pazyryk culture in Siberia produced similar art, although they related to the Chinese in a way comparable to that of the Scythians with the Greek and Iranian cultures. In recent years, archeologists have made valuable finds in various places within the area.\n\nThe Scythians worked in a wide variety of materials such as gold, wood, leather, bone, bronze, iron, silver and electrum. Clothes and horse-trappings were sewn with small plaques in metal and other materials, and larger ones, including some of the most famous, probably decorated shields or wagons. Wool felt was used for highly decorated clothes, tents and horse-trappings, and an important nomad mounted on his horse in his best outfit must have presented a very colourful and exotic sight. As nomads, the Scythians produced entirely portable objects, to decorate their horses, clothes, tents and wagons, with the exception in some areas of kurgan stelae, stone stelae carved somewhat crudely to depict a human figure, which were probably intended as memorials. Bronze-casting of very high quality is the main metal technique used across the Eurasian steppe, but the Scythians are distinguished by their frequent use of gold at many sites, though large hoards of gold objects have also been found further east, as in the hoard of over 20,000 pieces of \"Bactrian Gold\" in partly nomadic styles from Tillya Tepe in Afghanistan.\nEarlier pieces reflected animal style traditions; in the later period many pieces, especially in metal, were produced by Greek craftsmen who had adapted Greek styles to the tastes and subject-matter of the wealthy Scythian market, and probably often worked in Scythian territory. Other pieces are thought to be imports from Greece.\n\nAs the Scythians prospered through trade with the Greeks, they settled down and started farming. They also established permanent settlements such as a site in Belsk, Ukraine believed to the Scythian capital Gelonus with craft workshops and Greek pottery prominent in the ruins. The Pazyryk burials (east of Scythia proper) are especially important because the frozen conditions have preserved a wide variety of objects in perishable materials that have not survived in most ancient burials, on the steppes or elsewhere. These include wood carvings, textiles including clothes and felt appliqué wall hangings, and even elaborate tattoos on the body of the so-called Siberian Ice Maiden. These make it clear that important ancient nomads and their horses, tents, and wagons were very elaborately fitted out in a variety of materials, many brightly coloured. Their iconography includes animals, monsters and anthropomorphic beasts, and probably some deities including a \"Great Goddess\", as well as energetic geometric motifs. Archaeologists have uncovered felt rugs as well as well-crafted tools and domestic utensils. Clothing uncovered by archaeologists has also been well made many trimmed by embroidery and appliqué designs. Wealthy people wore clothes covered by gold embossed plaques, but small gold pieces are often found in what seem to be relatively ordinary burials. Imported goods include a famous carpet, the oldest to survive, that was probably made in or around Persia.\n\nSteppes jewellery features various animals including stags, cats, birds, horses, bears, wolves and mythical beasts. The gold figures of stags in a crouching position with legs tucked beneath its body, head upright and muscles tight to give the impression of speed, are particularly impressive. The \"looped\" antlers of most figures are a distinctive feature, not found in Chinese images of deer. The species represented has seemed to many scholars to be the reindeer, which was not found in the regions inhabited by the steppes peoples at this period. The largest of these were the central ornaments for shields, while others were smaller plaques probably attached to clothing. The stag appears to have had a special significance for the steppes peoples, perhaps as a clan totem. The most notable of these figures include the examples from:\n\nAnother characteristic form is the openwork plaque including a stylized tree over the scene at one side, of which two examples are illustrated here. Later large Greek-made pieces often include a zone showing Scythian men apparently going about their daily business, in scenes more typical of Greek art than nomad-made pieces. Some scholars have attempted to attach narrative meanings to such scenes, but this remains speculative.\n\nAlthough gold was widely used by the ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the predominant material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse harness, leather belts & personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins & belts, helped to act as armour.\n\nThe use of the animal form went further than just ornament, these seemingly imbuing the owner of the item with similar prowess & powers of the animal which was depicted. Thus the use of these forms extended onto the accoutrements of warfare, be they swords, daggers, scabbards, or axes.\n\nThe primary weapon of this horse riding culture was the bow, & a special case had been developed to carry the delicate but very powerful composite bow. This case, \"the gorytus\", had a separate container on the outside which acted as a quiver, & the whole was often decorated with animal scenes or scenes depicting daily life on the steppes. There was a marked following of Grecian elements after the 4th century BC, when Greek craftsmen were commissioned to decorate many of the daily use articles.\n\nScythian art has become well known in the West thanks to a series of touring loan exhibitions from Ukrainian and Russian museums, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nKurgans are large mounds that are obvious in the landscape and a high proportion have been plundered at various times; many may never have had a permanent population nearby to guard them. To counter this, treasures were sometimes deposited in secret chambers below the floor and elsewhere, which have sometimes avoided detection until the arrival of modern archaeologists, and many of the most outstanding finds come from such chambers in kurgans that had already been partly robbed.\n\nElsewhere the desertification of the steppe has brought once-buried small objects to lie on the surface of the eroded land, and many Ordos bronzes seem to have been found in this way.\n\nRussian explorers first brought Scythian artworks recovered from Scythian burial mounds to Peter the Great in the early 18th century. These works formed the basis of the collection held by the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Catherine the Great was so impressed from the material recovered from the kurgans or burial mounds that she ordered a systematic study be made of the works. However, this was well before the development of modern archaeological techniques.\n\nNikolai Veselovsky (1848-1918) was a Russian archaeologist specializing in Central Asia who led many of the most important excavations of kurgans in his day. One of the first sites discovered by modern archaeologists were the kurgans Pazyryk, Ulagan district of the Altay Republic, south of Novosibirsk. The name Pazyryk culture was attached to the finds, five large burial mounds and several smaller ones between 1925 and 1949 opened in 1947 by a Russian archeologist, Sergei Rudenko; Pazyryk is in the Altay Mountains of southern Siberia. The kurgans contained items for use in the afterlife. The famous Pazyryk carpet discovered is the oldest surviving wool pile oriental rug.\nThe enormous hoard of \"Bactrian gold\" discovered at Tillya Tepe in northern Afghanistan in 1978 comes from the fringes of the nomadic world, and the objects reflect the influence of many cultures to the south of the steppes as well as steppes art. The six burials come from the early 1st century AD (a coin of Tiberius is among the finds) and though their cultural context is unfamiliar, it may relate to the Indo-Scythians who had created an empire in north India.\n\nRecent digs in Belsk, Ukraine uncovered a vast city believed to be the Scythian capital Gelonus described by Herodotus. Numerous craft workshops and works of pottery have been found. A kurgan or burial mound near the village of Ryzhanovka in Ukraine, south of Kiev, found in the 1990s has revealed one of the few unlooted tombs of a Scythian chieftain, who was ruling in the forest-steppe area of the western fringe of Scythian lands. There at a late date in Scythian culture (c. 250 - 225 BC), a recently nomadic aristocratic class was gradually adopting the agricultural life-style of their subjects. Many items of jewellery were also found in the kurgan.\n\nA discovery made by Russian and German archaeologists in 2001 near Kyzyl, the capital of the Russian republic of Tuva in Siberia is the earliest of its kind and predates the influence of Greek civilisation. Archaeologists discovered almost 5,000 decorative gold pieces including earrings, pendants and beads. The pieces contain representations of many local animals from the period including panthers, lions, bears and deer.\n\nEarlier rich kurgan burials always include a male, with or without a female consort, but from the 4th and 3rd centuries there are number of important burials with only a female.\n\nThe finds from the most important nomad burials remain in the countries where they were found, or at least the capitals of the states in which they were located when found, so that many finds from Ukraine and other countries of the former Soviet Union are in Russia. Western European and American museums have relatively small collections, though there have been exhibitions touring internationally. The Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg has the longest standing and the best collection of Scythian art. Other museums including several local ones in Russia, in Budapest and Miskolc in Hungary, Kiev in Ukraine, the National Museum of Afghanistan and elsewhere have important holdings. The \"Scythian Gold\" exhibition came from a number of Ukrainian exhibitions including the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, the Institute of Archaeology in Kiev and the State Historical Archaeological Preserve at Pereiaslav-Khmel'nyts'kyi.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3786100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3786100", "title": "Sensation (art exhibition)", "text": "Sensation (art exhibition)\n\nSensation was an exhibition of the collection of contemporary art owned by Charles Saatchi, including many works by Young British Artists, (YBAs), which first took place 18 September – 28 December 1997 at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and later toured to the Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin and the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. A proposed showing at the National Gallery of Australia was cancelled when the gallery's director decided the exhibition was \"too close to the market.\"\n\nThe show generated controversy in London and New York City due to the inclusion of images of Myra Hindley and the Virgin Mary. It was criticised by New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and others for attempting to boost the value of the work by showing it in institutions and public museums.\n\nThe artworks in \"Sensation\" were from the collection of Charles Saatchi, a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. Norman Rosenthal, the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists. Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, Damien Hirst's shark suspended in formaldehyde titled \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\", Tracey Emin's tent titled \"Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995\"), Marc Quinn's self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and Sarah Lucas's explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from Gillian Wearing's photographs. \"Sensation\" was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\nThe opening of \"Sensation\" at the Royal Academy of Arts caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both broadsheet and tabloid journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about. Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory. They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by Jake and Dinos Chapman, which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.\n\nHowever, the biggest media controversy was over \"Myra\", an image of the murderer Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey.\n\nThe Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group picketed the show, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley's victims. They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings. Along with supporters she picketed the show's first day. Myra Hindley sent a letter from jail suggesting that her portrait be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was \"a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim.\" Despite all the protest the painting remained hanging. Windows at Burlington House, the Academy's home, were smashed and two demonstrators hurled ink and eggs at the picture as a result, requiring it to be removed and restored. It was put back on display behind Perspex and guarded by security men.\n\nIn a press conference on 16 September 1997, David Gordon, Secretary of the Royal Academy commented on the controversial portrait: \"The majority view inside the Academy was that millions and millions of images of Myra Hindley have been reproduced in newspapers and magazines. Books have been written about the murders. Television programmes have been made. Hindley’s image is in the public domain; part of our consciousness; an awful part of our recent social history; a legitimate subject for journalism – and for art.\"\n\nThe show was extremely popular with the general public, attracting over 300,000 visitors during its run, helped by the media attention which the strong subject matter had received. The BBC described it as \"gory images of dismembered limbs and explicit pornography\".\n\n\"Sensation\" was shown at the Berlin's Hamburger Bahnhof museum (30 September 1998 – 30 January 1999) and proved so popular that it was extended past its original closing date of 28 December 1998. For art critic Nicola Kuhn from \"Der Tagesspiegel\", there was \"no sensation about Sensation\". She claimed that the Berlin audience found the yBa's work \"more sad and serious than irreverent, funny and dazzling\"\n\nThe exhibition was shown in New York City at the Brooklyn Museum from 2 October 1999 to 9 January 2000. The New York City show was met with instant protest, centring on \"The Holy Virgin Mary\" by Chris Ofili, which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was \"smeared\", \"splattered\" or \"stained\" with elephant dung, Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collaged images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional cherubim.\n\nNew York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it \"sick stuff\" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the Brooklyn Museum hosting the show, because \"You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion.\" Cardinal John O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, said, \"one must ask if it is an attack on religion itself,\" and the president of America's biggest group of Orthodox Jews, Mandell Ganchrow, called it \"deeply offensive\". William A. Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, said the work \"induces revulsion\". Giuliani started a lawsuit to evict the museum, and Arnold Lehman, the museum director, filed a federal lawsuit against Giuliani for a breach of the First Amendment.\n\nHillary Clinton spoke up for the museum, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union. The editorial board of \"The New York Times\" said, Giuliani's stance \"promises to begin a new Ice Age in New York's cultural affairs.\" The paper also carried a full-page advertisement in support signed by over 100 actors, writers and artists, including Susan Sarandon, Steve Martin, Norman Mailer, Arthur Miller, Kurt Vonnegut and Susan Sontag. Ofili, who is Roman Catholic, said, \"elephant dung in itself is quite a beautiful object.\"\n\nThe United States House of Representatives passed a nonbinding resolution to end federal funding for the museum on 3 October 1999, and New York City did stop funding to the Brooklyn Museum. On 1 November, federal judge Nina Gershon ordered the City not only to restore the funding that was denied to the Museum, but also to refrain from continuing its ejectment action. On 16 December 1999, a 72-year-old man was arrested for criminal mischief after smearing the Ofili painting with white paint, which was soon removed.\nThe museum produced a yellow stamp, saying the artworks on show \"may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety.\" and Ofili's painting was shown behind a Plexiglass screen, guarded by a museum attendant and an armed police officer. Jeffrey Hogrefe, art critic for the \"New York Observer\", commented about the museum, \"They wanted to get some publicity and they got it. I think it was pretty calculated.\" The editor-in-chief of the New York City \"Art & Auction\" magazine, Bruce Wolmer,said: \"When the row eventually fades the only smile will be on the face of Charles Saatchi, a master self-promoter.\"\n\nThe show was scheduled to open in June 1999 at the National Gallery of Australia, but was cancelled with the director, Brian Kennedy, saying that, although it was due to be funded by the Australian government, it was \"too close to the market\" since finance for the Brooklyn exhibition included $160,000 from Saatchi, who owned the work; $50,000 from Christie's, who had sold work for Saatchi; and $10,000 from dealers of many of the artists. Kennedy said he was unaware of this when he accepted the show. Saatchi's contribution, the largest single one, was not disclosed by the Brooklyn Museum, until it appeared in court documents. Similarly, when the show opened in London at the Royal Academy, there had been criticisms that it would raise the value of the work.\n\n\n"}

It treats Holmes and Watson as real people and uses aspects of the canonical stories combined with the history of the era of the tales' settings to construct fanciful biographies of the pair.\n\nThe game of examining the stories as if they were non-fiction began in the early twentieth century. There are early examples of Sherlockian essays by Arthur Bartlett Maurice and Frank Sidgwick, both published in 1902, but neither of these essays received much notice at first. Notable early scholars of the canon included Ronald Knox in Britain and Christopher Morley (founder of The Baker Street Irregulars) in New York. Dorothy L. Sayers, creator of the detective Lord Peter Wimsey, also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later published in \"Unpopular Opinions\". In the foreword to this book, Sayers notes that\n\nThe game of applying the methods of the \"Higher Criticism\" to the Sherlock Holmes canon was begun, many years ago, by Ronald Knox, with the aim of showing that, by those methods, one could disintegrate a modern classic as speciously as a certain school of critics have endeavoured to disintegrate the Bible. Since then, the thing has become a hobby among a select set of jesters here and in America.\n\nSayers also said that the Game \"must be played as solemnly as a county cricket match at Lord's; the slightest touch of extravagance or burlesque ruins the atmosphere.\"\n\nWhen a student at Oxford, Knox issued \"Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes\", an essay which is regarded as the founding text of \"Holmesian scholarship\". That essay was re-printed, among others, in 1928 and the following year, Sydney Roberts, then a professor at Cambridge University, issued a reply to Knox's arguments, in a booklet entitled \"A Note on the Watson Problem\". S.C. Roberts issued then a complete Watson biography. A book by T.S. Blakeney followed and the \"Holmesian\" game (commonly referred to simply as \"the game\") was born. Early Holmesians of note include the bibliographer and book collector Vincent Starrett and the archaeologist Harold Wilmerding Bell.\n\nOne aspect of the Game in its traditional form is the effort to resolve or explain away contradictions in the Holmes canon, such as the location of Watson's war wound, which is described as being in his shoulder in \"A Study in Scarlet\" and in his leg in \"The Sign of Four\", or his first name, given as John in \"A Study in Scarlet\" and \"The Problem of Thor Bridge\" but James in \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\".\n\nWhile Dorothy Sayers and many of the early \"Holmesians\" used the works of Conan Doyle as the chief basis for their speculations, a more fanciful school of playing the historical-Holmes game is represented by William S. Baring-Gould, author of \"Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street\" (1962), a personal \"biography\" of Holmes.\n\nA more recent \"biography\" is Nick Rennison's \"\" (Atlantic Books, 2005) and, since 1998, Leslie S. Klinger has edited \"The Sherlock Holmes Reference Library\" (Gasogene Books, Indianapolis), which sums up the available Holmesian \"scholarship\" alongside the original \"canonical\" texts.\n\nMark Frost's 1993 novel \"The List of Seven\" presents a fictionalized account of Sherlock Holmes' literary origins. In the story, Arthur Conan Doyle, an aspiring but struggling author, is caught up in an assassination attempt and is saved by a man exhibiting many of the prototypical characteristics of Holmes. Frost wrote a follow-up novel called \"The Six Messiahs\".\n\nA particularly rich area of \"research\" is the \"uncovering\" of details about Holmes' family history and early life, of which almost nothing is said in Conan Doyle's stories. In \"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\", Watson states: \"I had never heard him refer to his relations, and hardly ever to his early life.\" But in that story, as well as introducing his brother, Holmes mentions the only facts about his family that are in any of the stories — \"My ancestors were country squires... [M]y grandmother... was the sister of Vernet, the French artist\" (presumably Horace Vernet). Beyond this, all familial statements are speculation. For example, there is a certain belief that his mother was named Violet, based on Conan Doyle's fondness for the name and the four strong Violets in the canon; however, as Baring-Gould noted, in Holmes' Britain, Violet was a very common name.\nIt is clear from references to \"the university\" in \"The Adventure of the \"Gloria Scott\"\", \"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\", and to some degree \"The Adventure of the Three Students\", that Holmes attended Oxford or Cambridge, although the question of which one remains a topic of eternal debate. Baring-Gould believed textual evidence indicated that Holmes attended both.\n\nThe most influential \"biography\" of Holmes is \"Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street\" by Baring-Gould. Faced with Holmes' reticence about his family background and early life, Baring-Gould invented one for him. According to Baring-Gould, Sherlock Holmes was born in Yorkshire, the youngest of three sons of Siger Holmes and Violet Sherrinford. The middle brother, Mycroft, appears in the canon, but the eldest, Sherrinford Holmes, was invented by Baring-Gould to free Mycroft and Sherlock from the obligation of following Siger as a country squire. In reality, \"Sherrinford Holmes\" was one of the names Arthur Conan Doyle considered for his hero before settling on \"Sherlock\". Siger Holmes' name is derived from \"The Adventure of the Empty House\", in which Sherlock tells Watson that he spent some time pretending to be a Norwegian called Sigerson, which Baring-Gould reads literally as meaning \"son of Siger.\"\n\nSherrinford had a significant role in the \"Doctor Who\" crossover novel \"All-Consuming Fire\" by Andy Lane, which also featured a cameo by Siger.\n\nSome other notable versions of Holmes' parentage:\n\nBased originally on the writings of Philip José Farmer, the concept of the Wold Newton family is the construction of a giant genealogical tree which connects many fictional characters to each other and to a number of historical figures. Additions to this tree are based on the writings of the original creators, pastiche writers, and \"Wold Newton scholars\". Sherlock Holmes has been one of the central characters of this tree. The Holmes family and its various generations have been the subject of many Wold Newton articles.\n\n"}

{"id": "1546216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1546216", "title": "Spirit of place", "text": "Spirit of place\n\nSpirit of place (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in folk tales, festivals and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture (stories, art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place (monuments, boundaries, rivers, woods, architectural style, rural crafts styles, pathways, views, and so on) or its interpersonal aspects (the presence of relatives, friends and kindred spirits, and the like).\n\nOften the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place — whereas the very similar term sense of place would tend to be more domestic, urban, or suburban in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the architecture, the width of the roads and pavements, the plantings, the style of the shop-fronts, the street furniture, and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in children's street culture.\n\nThe Roman term for spirit of place was Genius loci, by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian animal or a small supernatural being (puck, fairy, elf, and the like) or a ghost. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around ley lines, feng shui and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.\n\nThe western cultural movements of Romanticism and Neo-romanticism are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.\n\nModern earth art (sometimes called environment art) artists such as Andy Goldsworthy have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.\n\nMany indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their landscape. Spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: Shinto has its Kami which may incorporate spirits of place; Christianity has spirits of place in the Angelic Choirs of Dominions and Principalities, Hinduism, Vajrayana and Bonpo traditions.\n\nBetween 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, Steven Halpern, and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, \"The Power of Place\" (Quest, 1991) and \"Dialogues with the Living Earth\" (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.\n\n\n"}

Privately constructed, it was inaugurated as the Teatro Nuovo to replace the smaller 800-seat \"Cesareo Regio Teatro di San Pietro\" on 21 April 1801 with a performance of Johann Simon Mayr's \"Ginevra di Scozia\". Initially, the Nuovo had 1,400 seats. In 1821, it became known as the Teatro Grande.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the need for a new theatre in Trieste became evident. Its main theatre, the Teatro di San Pietro, had become increasingly inadequate and finally closed its doors in 1800. A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others. Gian Antonio Selva, the architect of the La Fenice in Venice, was engaged, and he designed a classic horseshoe-shaped auditorium. However, his exterior designs were considered to be too plain for the Austrians who then engaged another architect, Matteo Pertsch, to solve the problem, which was accomplished by incorporating elements of Milan's La Scala opera house. The \"Nuovo\" became a mixture of La Fenice on the inside and La Scala on the exterior.\n\nSeveral name changes have occurred during the theatre's lifetime, the first in 1821 when it became the \"Teatro Grande\" and it was under this name that the theatre was the site of two Verdi opera premieres: \"Il corsaro\" in 1848 (featuring the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi, who Verdi married in 1859, in the leading role) and \"Stiffelio\", a production which Verdi supervised - not without controversy - in 1850. However, before these premieres, Verdi's operas had begun to dominate the Teatro Grande's stage, followed, as the century progressed, by all the major works of the opera repertoire, including those by Puccini and Wagner.\n\nA further name change followed in 1861 due to a change from private to public ownership. Thus it became the \"Teatro Comunale\" and existed as such throughout the latter years of the 19th century. By 1881, seating capacity had been increased to 2,000 through the use of existing standing room spaces; but, by that December, the theatre was declared to be unsafe and it was closed for renovations, during which electricity replaced gas lighting for the reopening in 1889 with 1,000 seats.\n\nWithin hours of his death in January 1901, the theatre was once again renamed, this time to honour the memory of Giuseppe Verdi. It was extensively restored between 1992 and 1997 and re-opened with about 1,300 seats and with a \"Viva Verdi\" concert which included excerpts from many of the composer's operas. (Like the restoration of La Scala between 2001 and 2004, a temporary alternative venue was quickly created in Trieste and the \"Sala Tripcovich\" continues to offer space for chamber opera and operettas.)\n\nA major feature of the Teatro Verdi's programming in the past 40 years, which stems from the original Austrian occupation of the city in the 19th century and the fact that Trieste did not become part of Italy until 1918, is the \"International Festival of Operetta\" which takes place every summer.\n\nThe theatre has seen the world premieres of the following operas:\n\n\n\n"}

(Latin upper captions translated)\n\nLibavius' illustration and the marble sculpture of the Layer Quaternity share an identical pairing including a naked figure (lower pair), a bare-legged royal male and a regal draped female (upper pair) as well as the titled captions \"Gloria\" and \"Labor\", along with the symbols of palm branch, \"rotundum\", and moon. \n\nThe similarities between the captioned phrases of Libavius' illustration to those of the single-word titles of the Layer Quaternity suggest that in time sequence, the Layer monument was based upon and installed before 1606, the publication date of Libavius' illustration.\n\nBiblical verse which parallels the symbolism of each captioned entity includes for the lower and mortal pair – \"Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the Labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was Vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun\". Ecclesiastes 2.v.11 With an antithetical response from the upper, immortal, \"Heavenly\" pair – Glory \"to God in the highest, and on earth Peace, goodwill to all men.\" Luke 2 v.14\n\nThe Layer Quaternity also corresponds to the alchemical 'deities' Apollo, Luna, Mercurius and Vulcan as named in emblem XVII of Atalanta Fugiens (1617) by the German alchemist-physician Michael Maier.\n\nThe four figurines housed in the monument's pilasters, \"Pax\" and \"Gloria\", \"Vanitas\" and \"Labor\", (Peace, Glory, Vanity, Labor) are relatively rare examples of Northern Mannerist sculpture extant in Britain. Collectively they exemplify how Christian iconography during the era of Elizabeth I, in tandem with Renaissance Europe, integrated symbolism from the western esoteric traditions of alchemy and astrology into works of art, including the funerary monument. The Layer Quaternity in their totality are a unique alchemical mandala. Through polarised symbolism they delineate essential coordinates associated with mandala art, namely Space (Heaven and Earth) and Time (Young and Old). They also represent fundamental aspects of the human condition, namely, gender, youth and age, as well as pleasure and suffering. In essence, the Layer Quaternity, not unlike the \"Scaiolae\" of Paracelsus (which are discussed by Libavius in \"Alchemia\") are a quaternity of differentiated virtues or psychic entities which represent a complete wholeness or totality in sum.\n\nThe role of the Quaternity in religious symbolism is discussed at length by Carl Gustav Jung. Much of his in-depth study and observations upon the function and role of the quaternity in religious symbolism is applicable to the Layer Quaternity. To Jung the quaternity was a natural expression of differentiation which always represents a totality, citing the four elements, the four seasons, the ancient Greek schemata of the four humours, and the four temperaments, as well as the four Evangelists with their respective emblems in the form of the tetramorph in Christian iconography, as examples. \n\nThe symbolism of the four entities of the Layer Quaternity exemplify Jung's observation that individuation develops through psychic qualities consisting of two pairs of opposites, which are often polarised to each other.\n\nAs such, the Layer Quaternity may be viewed as exemplary of Renaissance-era psychology. Its four highly-symbolic figurine entities are simultaneously, a 'map' of the psyche, and a highly-original alchemical mandala in western funerary art.\n"}

{"id": "43236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43236", "title": "Unicorn", "text": "Unicorn\n\nThe unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian. The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some versions translate as \"unicorn\".\n\nIn European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard). In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.\n\nA number of seals seemingly depicting unicorns have been found from the Indus Valley Civilisation. These have also been interpreted as representations of aurochs—a type of large wild cattle that formerly inhabited Europe, Asia and North Africa—or derivatives of aurochs, because the animal is always shown in profile, indicating there may have supposed to have been another horn, which is not seen.\n\nUnicorns are not found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book \"Indika\" (\"On India\") described them as wild asses, fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half () in length, and colored white, red and black. Ctesias got his information while living in Persia. Unicorns on a relief sculpture found at the ancient Persian capital of Persepolis in Iran. Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one-horned animals, the oryx (a kind of antelope) and the so-called \"Indian ass\". Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one-horned horses with stag-like heads.\nPliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox (perhaps a rhinoceros) as one-horned beasts, as well as \"a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead, two cubits [] in length.\" In \"On the Nature of Animals\" (\"Περὶ Ζῴων Ἰδιότητος\", \"De natura animalium\"), Aelian, quoting Ctesias, adds that India produces also a one-horned horse (iii. 41; iv. 52), and says (xvi. 20) that the \"monoceros\" () was sometimes called \"cartazonos\" (), which may be a form of the Arabic \"karkadann\", meaning \"rhinoceros\".\n\nCosmas Indicopleustes, a merchant of Alexandria who lived in the 6th century, made a voyage to India and subsequently wrote works on cosmography. He gives a description of a unicorn based on four brass figures in the palace of the King of Ethiopia. He states, from report, that \"it is impossible to take this ferocious beast alive; and that all its strength lies in its horn. When it finds itself pursued and in danger of capture, it throws itself from a precipice, and turns so aptly in falling, that it receives all the shock upon the horn, and so escapes safe and sound\".\n\nA one-horned animal (which may be just a bull in profile) is found on some seals from the Indus Valley Civilisation. Seals with such a design are thought to be a mark of high social rank.\n\nMedieval knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from biblical and ancient sources, and the creature was variously represented as a kind of wild ass, goat, or horse.\n\nThe predecessor of the medieval bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as \"Physiologus\" (\"Φυσιολόγος\"), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of religious art. Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe unicorn also figured in courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and Richard de Fournival, the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of humanism, the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in Petrarch's \"Triumph of Chastity\", and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca's portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted \"c\" 1472-74), Bianca's triumphal car is drawn by a pair of unicorns.\n\nThe Throne Chair of Denmark is made of \"unicorn horns\" – almost certainly narwhal tusks. The same material was used for ceremonial cups because the unicorn's horn continued to be believed to neutralize poison, following classical authors.\n\nThe unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as \"scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead... They have a head like a wild boar's… They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime. They are very ugly brutes to look at. They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions.\" It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros. In German, since the 16th century, \"Einhorn\" (\"one-horn\") has become a descriptor of the various species of rhinoceros.\n\nThe horn itself and the substance it was made of was called alicorn, and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties. The Danish physician Ole Worm determined in 1638 that the alleged alicorns were the tusks of narwhals. Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir Thomas Browne in his \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\".\n\nFalse alicorn powder, made from the tusks of narwhals or horns of various animals, has been sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741. The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make \"cures\" and sell them. Cups were made from alicorn for kings and given as a gift; these were usually made of ivory or walrus ivory. Entire horns were very precious in the Middle Ages and were often really the tusks of narwhals.\n\nOne traditional method of hunting unicorns involved entrapment by a virgin.\n\nIn one of his notebooks Leonardo da Vinci wrote:\n\nThe unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control itself, for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel and go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.\n\nThe famous late Gothic series of seven tapestry hangings \"The Hunt of the Unicorn\" are a high point in European tapestry manufacture, combining both secular and religious themes. The tapestries now hang in the Cloisters division of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against \"mille-fleur\" backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, \"The Unicorn in Captivity\", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a pomegranate tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the Low Countries, probably Brussels or Liège, for an unknown patron. A set of six engravings on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist Jean Duvet in the 1540s.\n\nAnother famous set of six tapestries of \"Dame à la licorne\" (\"Lady with the unicorn\") in the Musée de Cluny, Paris, were also woven in the Southern Netherlands before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love (\"A mon seul desir\" the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in Stirling Castle, Scotland, to take the place of a set recorded in the castle in a 16th-century inventory.\n\nA rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the \"hortus conclusus\" in religious art combined the Annunciation to Mary with the themes of the \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" and \"Virgin and Unicorn\", so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many \"prima facie\" secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction, partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.\n\nShakespeare scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations of Timon of Athens, Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: \"wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury\".)\n\nIn heraldry, a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, as can be seen from the following gallery). Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.\n\nIn heraldry the unicorn is best known as the symbol of Scotland. The unicorn was chosen because it was seen as a proud and haughty beast which would rather die than be captured, just as Scots would fight to remain sovereign and unconquered. Two unicorns supported the royal arms of the King of Scots, and since the 1707 union of England and Scotland, the royal arms of the United Kingdom have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a crown, whereas the version used in England and elsewhere gives the English elements more prominence.\n\nGolden coins known as the unicorn and half-unicorn, both with a unicorn on the obverse, were used in Scotland in the 15th and 16th century. In the same realm, carved unicorns were often used as finials on the pillars of Mercat crosses, and denoted that the settlement was a royal burgh. Certain noblemen such as the Earl of Kinnoull were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an augmentation of honour. The crest for Clan Cunningham bears a unicorn head.\n\nUnicorns as heraldic charges:\nUnicorns as supporters:\nAn animal called the \"re’em\" () is mentioned in several places in the Hebrew Bible, often as a metaphor representing strength. \"The allusions to the \"re'em\" as a wild, un-tamable animal of great strength and agility, with mighty horn or horns (Job xxxix. 9–12; Ps. xxii. 21, xxix. 6; Num. xxiii. 22, xxiv. 8; Deut. xxxiii. 17; comp. Ps. xcii. 11), best fit the aurochs (\"Bos primigenius\"). This view is supported by the Assyrian \"rimu,\" which is often used as a metaphor of strength, and is depicted as a powerful, fierce, wild mountain bull with large horns.\" This animal was often depicted in ancient Mesopotamian art in profile, with only one horn visible.\n\nThe translators of the Authorized King James Version of the Bible (1611) followed the Greek Septuagint (\"monokeros\") and the Latin Vulgate (\"unicornis\") and employed \"unicorn\" to translate \"re'em\", providing a recognizable animal that was proverbial for its un-tamable nature. The American Standard Version translates this term \"wild ox\" in each case.\n\n\nThe classical Jewish understanding of the Bible did not identify the \"Re'em\" animal as the unicorn. However, some rabbis in the Talmud debate the proposition that the \"Tahash\" animal (Exodus 25, 26, 35, 36 and 39; Numbers 4; and Ezekiel 16:10) was a domestic, single-horned kosher creature that existed in Moses' time, or that it was similar to the \"keresh\" animal described in Morris Jastrow's Talmudic dictionary as \"a kind of antelope, unicorn\".\n\nThe \"qilin\" (), a creature in Chinese mythology, is sometimes called \"the Chinese unicorn\", and some ancient accounts describe a single horn as its defining feature. However, it is more accurately described as a that looks less unicorn than chimera, with the body of a deer, the head of a lion, green scales and a long forwardly-curved horn. The Japanese version (\"kirin\") more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese \"qilin\". The Quẻ Ly of Vietnamese myth, similarly sometimes mistranslated \"unicorn\" is a symbol of wealth and prosperity that made its first appearance during the Duong Dynasty, about 600 CE, to Emperor Duong Cao To, after a military victory which resulted in his conquest of Tây Nguyên. In November 2012 the History Institute of the DPRK Academy of Social Sciences, as well as the Korea News Service, reported that the Kiringul had been found, which is associated with a kirin ridden by King Dongmyeong of Goguryeo.\n\nBeginning in the Ming Dynasty, the \"qilin\" became associated with giraffes, after Zheng He's voyage to East Africa brought a pair of the long-necked animals and introduced them at court in Nanjing as \"qilin\". The resemblance to the \"qilin\" was noted in the giraffe's ossicones (bony protrusions from the skull resembling horns), graceful movements, and peaceful demeanor.\n\nShanhaijing (117) also mentioned \"Bo\"-horse (), a chimera horse with ox tail, single horn, white body, and its sound like person calling. The creature is lived at Honest-head Mountain. Guo Pu in his \"jiangfu\" said that \"Bo\"-horse able to walk on water. Another similar creature also mentioned in Shanhaijing (80) to live in Mount Winding-Centre as \"Bo\" (), but with black tail, tiger's teeth and claws, and also devour leopards and tigers.\n\n"}

The growing number of commissions and projects eventually prompted the organization to open an office in London to meet the demand.\n\nEight departments were initially formed: Design, Architectural Production, Structural Engineering, Civil Engineering, HVAC, Specifications, and Quantity Surveying departments. However, the demand for professional management and supervision of large scale projects led to the creation of the Project Management and Construction Management departments to effectively monitor and control all contractors and subcontractors' work on any construction project.\n\nIn 1991, the organization launched its Information Technology division to provide clients with software and hardware solutions. The division handled the software integration of Maintenance Management Systems (MMS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and Facilities Management Systems (FMS) into a single Graphical User Interface (GUI). In the same year, the Engineering Information Systems division was formed and is responsible for on-site implementation and provision of GIS, MMS, and FMS based on the clients' needs and requirements.\n\nZuhair Fayez Partnership's Quality Assurance department was formed in 1993. On the 16th of January, ZFP acquired ISO 9001 + TickIT certification, the first ever awarded to a consultancy firm of their scope of work in the Middle East.\n\nZFP partnered with Avaya in May 2011 to create a virtual computing environment (VCE). The purpose is to enable the organization to provide virtual services in a cloud-based environment that would serve 3000 users in 5 branches and 20 remote sites and maximize the efficiency of its existing IT resources.\n\nIn July 2012, SNC-Lavalin acquired ZFP's industrial division in Khobar to form SNC-Lavalin Fayez Engineering, a joint-venture with ZFP, in response to Saudi Aramco's General Engineering Services Plus (GES+) initiative.\n\nIn 2014, Zuhair Fayez Partnership was assigned to build a new campus for the American International School of Jeddah to accommodate 1,700 students. The announcement was made at ZFP's main headquarters during the groundbreaking ceremony.\n\nSaudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Madinah, Makkah, Dammam\n\nMiddle East: Cairo (closed)\n\nAsia Pacific: Philippines (closed)\n\n"}
