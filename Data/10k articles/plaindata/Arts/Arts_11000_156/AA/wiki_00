{"id": "33436515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33436515", "title": "An Uncommon Story", "text": "An Uncommon Story\n\nAn Uncommon Story () is an autobiographical literary memoir by Ivan Goncharov, written in 1875–1876 (with an 1878 addendum) and first published in 1924. Parts of it were later included into \"The Complete Goncharov\" (1978–1980, Vol VII).\n\nAccording to the \"Gale Encyclopedia of Biography\", \"An Uncommon Story\" \"…confirmed the psychopathic side of [its author's] personality; it is an account of imagined plots against him and imagined attempts by others to plagiarize his work.\" Many researchers disagreed, finding there was much more veracity to Goncharov's claims than had previously been reported.\n\n\"An Uncommon Story\" had one single agenda: to prove that Ivan Turgenev has not only borrowed major ideas, character types, and conflicts from Goncharov's \"The Precipice\" to use in his \"Home of the Gentry\", but also (in the author's words) \"infused the best European literature with them.\" \n\n\"An Uncommon Story\" caused much debate; that it was published at all caused some controversy, for according to its author's special request, these memoirs were to be issued only in case plagiarism accusations were brought against him after his death. Since no such allegations have ever been made, Goncharov's book was formally published contrary to his will. In this same note, however, the author mentioned that he wished for future \"historians of Russian literature\" to take hold of it. \n\nIt was the latter who deemed the publication advisable since (according to scholar N. F. Budanova) \"it shed an important light upon Goncharov and Turgenev's relations,\" and also provided researchers with \"valuable material for making a comparative analysis of both classic novels which, indeed, had striking similarities.\"\n\nIn the mid-1850s, Ivan Goncharov and Ivan Turgenev were on friendly terms. Goncharov, who'd launched his career in a spectacular fashion and was declared by some a \"true Nikolay Gogol heir\", had no serious rival as a novelist on the Russian literary scene until the late 1850s; Fyodor Dostoyevsky was still in exile, Leo Tolstoy was writing novelets and short stories, and Turgenev was considered a master of miniatures. \n\nThe success of \"Home of the Gentry\" must have come as a surprise to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: \"Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but you seem to be eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama. Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.\n\nLiterary historians argued later that Turgenev's overnight success might have seemed totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, felt like he was the only master of his field. Goncharov produced one novel in a decade, but his new rival did it in a seemingly fleeting manner, which must have made the injustice look even more gross. \n\nOf all the possible explanations for the improbable manner in which Turgenev, a master of miniatures, could have suddenly re-invented himself as a novelist, only one for Goncharov looked plausible: the younger man must have nicked his own ideas, structures, conflicts, and character types, and \"with these pearls started to play his own lyre.\" \n\nSome commentators later dismissed such claims as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general hypochondria. Others argued that this would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were not altogether groundless. At least one fact was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.\nIn 1887, four years after Turgenev's death, Goncharov attached a note to this novel's original text, which read: \"This manuscript contains the material for a novel which in 1869, as \"Vestnik Evropy\" was about to publish it, I gave the title \"The Precipice\". Before that I used to refer to is as \"Raisky, the Artist\" and was freely expounding upon it to my fellow writers, mostly to Turgenev. It was to him that in 1855, soon after returning from my around-the-world journey, I recounted in detail, in the course of several meetings, all the details of it [...] because he, being a perceptive and sensitive man of art, seemed to be most sympathetic to those of my works that he promised a great future for.\"\n\nJudging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two men were very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an impeccable literary taste. In \"An Uncommon Story\" he wrote: \"Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, \"Oblomov\" will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes.\" \n\nTellingly, Turgenev even prompted minor detail to \"Oblomov\", namely, in the scene where Olga and Schtoltz converse in Switzerland. Goncharov acknowledged Turgenev's priority in \"discovering nihilism\", and admitted there was historical and artistic authenticity to Bazarov's character. In the late 1850s relations between the two apparently deteriorated, and in March 1860 things came to a head.\n\nPrior to the publication of \"Home of the Gentry\", Goncharov took an opportunity to get acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from \"The Precipice\", the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: \"Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar [to that of mine]; you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied.\" In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in \"The Precipice\"), which, being \"a weak one\", had been \"magnanimously sacrificed\" by Turgenev. The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of \"Home of the Gentry\", but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, \"it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this.\"\n\nOn March 29, 1860, in the critic Stepan Dudyshkin's flat an \"arbitrary court\" took place, with Pavel Annenkov, Alexander Druzhinin and Aleksandr Nikitenko present. The court's verdict was conciliatory: \"Since both Turgenev's and Goncharov's novels have had for their ground the very same soil of Russian reality, similarities and coincidences, in ideas and even phraseology, would only be natural and for both writers excusable.\" After that Goncharov and Turgenev stopped communicating. In 1864, at Druzhinin's funeral, they made peace but never became friends again, even if Turgenev in one of his letters mentioned his feeling \"very close to Goncharov.\" As Turgenev's new novels were appearing one after another, Goncharov was becoming more and more resentful, apparently seeing his worst suspicions confirmed.\n\nThe original manuscript, a notebook, consisting of 53 pages, held in the Russian National Library, according to N.Budanova, looks very much like a rough copy that's never been revisited by the author, with lots of edits, some fragments blotted out so as to be unreconstructable. The notebook consists of two parts, written in different times. Part 1, \"Uncommon Story (True Facts)\", pages 1–50, is dated December 1875 and January 1876. The author's commentary to it reads: \nPart 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, had another note attached to it: \"I've sealed the previous fifty pages in an envelope as finished. But in the course of the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue...\" There is an inscription on the envelope: \"These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883\".\n\n\"An Uncommon Story\" was first published in 1924 by the Russian Public Library archives, with a foreword by D. I. Abramovich. It was preceded by the publication in 1923 of the whole of the Goncharov-Turgenev correspondence by Boris Engelgardt, who accompanied it with a thorough analysis of the two authors' relations. For decades, the issue lay dormant. \n\nThen in 1972, A. Batyuto suggested Goncharov might have been a major influence on early Turgenev, after all. Having drawn the comparative analysis of Turgenev's \"On the Eve\" and Goncharov's \"The Precipice\", the author came to the conclusion: the former most obviously used \"methods of novel-structuring he'd borrowed from other writers, Goncharov included\". According to Batyuto, when it came to the art of building up a novel, Turgenev in his early days was certainly taking cues from Goncharov. \n\nIn 1976, O. Demikhovskaya in an article called \"I.A. Goncharov and I.S. Turgenev\" criticized the 'biased approach' to the problem demonstrated by Engelgardt, who in 1923 made an emphasis on Goncharov's personal idiosyncrasies as being the major factor behind the conflict. She presented Turgenev as the guilty party and recounted numerous quarrels he had with Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nAccording to V. Nezdvedtsky, the reason behind the two writers' conflict was \"the typological resemblances of both and Goncharov's jealousy of his more fortunate rival.\" The author poined out that, while working on a completely new type of Russian novel (and leaving behind Grigorovich and Pisemsky with their traditionalism), both Goncharov (who first came up with the idea of plotline's \"poetisation\") and Turgenev were up against common challenges and were therefore keenly aware of each other's works. This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in \"An Uncommon Story\" drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences. N. Budanova thought such thing would have been impossible at the time for it would have been perceived by the public as a confession of plagiarism. \n\nWhile the fact that \"The Precipice\" and \"Home of the Gentry\" had a lot in common, Goncharov's other allegations have been unanimously dismissed by literary historians as groundless. Parallels he's drawn between \"The Precipice\" and Turgenev's \"Fathers and Sons\" were proved to be far-fetched, as was his claim that \"Torrents of Spring\", was 'an improvisation' on \"The Precipice\" part I. Goncharov's claims that some European authors started to use his ideas and character types through Turgenev's influence are seen to be void, although Budanova noted that some contemporary critics might have prompted such an idea to the author who in his later life grew to be highly impressionable and suspicious. For example, Aleksey Suvorin in his article \"The French Society in Gustave Flaubert's new novel\" suggested that the \"Sentimental Education\" main character Frédéric Moreau was \"akin to the so-called 'people of the 1840s' in Russia and that he was \"similar to Raisky... its just that Flaubert has treated his character more objectively than our respected novelist.\" Some similarities between Goncharov's characters and those of Madame Bovary have been mentioned by Russian critics too.\n\nGoncharov's allegations, made in \"An Uncommon Story\", that Turgenev did a lot of harm to Russian literature in the West, have been proved invalid. On the contrary, Turgenev has been praised by many as an avid a promoter of Russian classics: his own translations of the works by Pushkin, Lermontov and Gogol into French did a lot to popularize them in Europe. Several translations of important Russian works have been made through his recommendations. \"We have every reason to insist that Turgenev preached Russian literature to the West. Forms and methods of such popularization have been different, and it is upon Turgenev's great authority that Western views on many Russian novels are still being based upon,\" wrote Soviet scholar Mikhail Alekseev in 1948.\n"}

The church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption () and is a Roman Catholic parish church in the Diocese of Roermond. The church is often referred to as the \"Star of the Sea\" (), after the church's main devotion, Our Lady, Star of the Sea.\n\nThe present-day church is probably not the first church that was built on this site. However, since no archeological research has ever been carried out inside the building, nothing certain can be said about this. The church's site, inside the Roman castrum and adjacent to a religious shrine dedicated to the god Jupiter, suggests that the site was once occupied by a Roman temple. It is not unlikely that the town's first church was built here and that this church in the 4th or 5th century became the cathedral of the diocese of Tongeren-Maastricht. \n\nSome time before the year 1100 the church became a collegiate church, run by a college of canons. The canons were appointed by the prince-bishop of Liège. The provosts were chosen from the chapter of St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège. The chapter of Our Lady's had around 20 canons, which made it a middle-sized chapter in the diocese of Liège. Until the end of the chapter in 1798 it maintained its strong ties with Liège. Parishioners of Our Lady's were identified in old documents as belonging to the \"Familia Sancti Lamberti\". It is clear that the chapter of Saint Servatius was the more powerful institution in Maastricht, with strong ties to the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, but throughout the Middle Ages the two churches remained rivals.\nMost of the present church was built in the 11th and 12th centuries. Construction of the imposing westwork started shortly after 1000 AD. In the 13th century the nave received Gothic vaults. Around 1200 the canons abandoned their communal lifestyle, after which canons' houses were built in the vicinity of the church. In the 14th century a parish church was built next to the collegiate church, so the main building could be reserved for the canons' religious duties. Of this parish church, dedicated to Saint Nicolas, very little remains as it was demolished in 1838. Apart from Saint Nicholas Church, the parish made use of three other chapels dedicated to Saint Hilarius, Saint Evergislus, and Saint Mary Minor. In the mid-16th century the present late Gothic cloisters replaced the earlier cloisters.\n\nAfter the incorporation of Maastricht in the French First Republic in 1794, the town's religious institutions were dissolved (1798). Many of the church treasures were lost during this period. The church and cloisters were used as a blacksmith shop and stables by the military garrison. This situation continued until 1837 when the church was restored to the religious practice. This coincided with the demolishing of Saint Nicholas Church and the transfer of the parish to Our Lady's.\n\nFrom 1887 to 1917 the church was thoroughly restored by well-known Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers. Cuypers basically removed everything that did not fit his ideal of a Romanesque church. Parts of the east choir, the two choir towers, and the south aisle were almost entirely rebuilt.\n\nThe church was elevated to the rank of minor basilica by Pope Pius XI on 20 February 1933.\n\nThe building is largely Romanesque in style and is considered an important example of the Mosan group of churches that are characterized by massive westworks and pseudo-transepts. Our Lady's in Maastricht indeed has a tall, massive westwork and two pseudo-transepts on each side. The westwork, built of carbonic sandstone, dates from the early 11th century and is flanked by two narrow towers with marlstone turrets. Some spolia, probably from the former Roman castrum of Maastricht, were used on the lower parts of the westwork. The nave with its transept and pseudo-transepts largely dates from the second half of the 11th century.\n\nThe church has two choirs and two crypts. The east choir dates from the 12th century and is decorated with carved Romanesque capitals (several of which are 19th-century copies). The east crypt is a century older. During the building campaign the original plan for the eastern part of the church was abandoned and a new scheme, based on the newly finished choir of St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège, adopted. The current, heavily-restored choir towers are roofed with Rhenish helms of stone rather than shingling. One of the towers, named after Saint Barbara, was used for storage of the city archives and the church treasury.\n\nA 13th-century Gothic portal, rebuilt in the 15th century, provides access to the church from Onze Lieve Vrouweplein. It is also the entrance of the so-called \"Mérode chapel\" (or \"Star of the Sea chapel\").\nAlthough the interior of the church underwent many changes throughout the centuries, it has an 'authentic' Romanesque feel to it. This is largely due to the restoration ideas of the architect Pierre Cuypers, who had several of the larger Gothic windows replaced by small Romanesque windows, thus creating a darker, 'mystical' atmosphere. Cuypers also removed the white plastering of the late Baroque period and had several altars built in a Romanesque or Gothic Revival style. Despite all these changes, the turbulent history of the building is still legible. Some murals dating from the Middle Ages have survived (including one of Saint Catherine from the 14th century). A mural on a pillar of Saint Christopher and the Infant Jesus dates from 1571. The large ceiling painting in the choir is Neo-Romanesque and dates from the Cuypers restoration. All stained glass windows are from the 19th or 20th century.\nThe furnishing of the church interior has followed the fashion of the time but suffered badly during the years of desecration (1798-1837). In 1380 the church had 33 altars but most of the medieval church inventory got lost in the turbulence that followed the arrival of the French in 1794. A precious baptismal font by the Maastricht metalworker Aert van Tricht (c. 1500) survived but was stripped of most of its ornaments. Several Baroque confessionals and a richly carved pulpit were taken over from a former nearby Jesuit church. The 18th-century Baroque altar, now in the southern transept, is from the former Church of Saint Nicholas. The large pipe organ was built in 1652 by André Severin.\n\nAmong the works of art owned by the church are a wood panel of \"The dream of Jacob\" (Flemish, c. 1500-1550), a large canvas with the Holy Family (Southern Netherlands, c. 1600), a large painting of the Crucifixion (Southern Netherlands, 17th century), two paintings attributed to Erasmus Quellinus II, one of Saint Cecilia and one of Saint Agnes (17th century), a 14th-century German Pieta, two 15th-century statues of the Virgin Mary (including the famous one in the Star of the Sea chapel), an Anna selbdritt and a Saint Christopher, both attributed to the Maastricht sculptor Jan van Steffeswert (c. 1500).\n\nThe architectural sculpture in the interior of the Basilica of Our Lady belongs to the highlights of Mosan art. The 20 highly symbolic capitals in the choir ambulatory depict scenes from the Old Testament, as well as various kinds of animals, monsters, birds, naked or scarcely dressed humans entangled in foliage, and humans fighting with animals. One capital in particular is famous as it was signed 'Heimo', probably by its maker who may also be represented on it, handing over a capital to the virgin Mary. The carved capitals and corbels of the choir gallery, as well as the capitals in the nave, are of a slightly later date and less vivid, depicting mainly foliage with some human and animal figures. Most of the carved capitals, as well as some important reliefs elsewhere in the church, date from the second half of the 12th century. A close relationship has been established between the Romanesque sculpture in Our Lady's and that in the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht, the Church of St Peter in Utrecht and the Schwarzrheindorf double chapel in Bonn.\n\nAccess to the cloisters, which enclose a garden, is through the church. The current cloisters were built in marlstone in late Gothic style with some Renaissance elements in 1558/59. They replaced the older Romanesque cloisters, of which some capitals have survived in the collection of the Bonnefantenmuseum. The floor of the cloisters is paved with monumental grave stones, some of them from the demolished Saint Nicholas Church. In 1910 a tower of the Roman castrum was found in the cloister garden.\n\nFor many people the main attraction of the Basilica of Our Lady is the miraculous statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea. This 15th-century wooden statue was originally housed in a nearby Franciscan monastery. In 1801 it was moved to the former parish church of Saint Nicholas, adjacent to Our Lady's. After the closure of that church in 1837, the statue moved to Our Lady's. In 1903 it was placed in a Gothic chapel near the main entrance where it remains today and where it is daily visited by hundreds of worshipers. Twice a year it is being carried around town in the city's religious processions.\nThe Basilica of our Lady possesses an important historical church treasure consisting of relics, reliquaries, textiles and liturgical objects. From the 14th century onwards it had a separate treasury room (Dutch: \"schatkamer\"), which at one point was located in the Tower of Saint Barbara (also the church's archives). It is believed that the choir gallery of Our Lady's was specifically built in the 12th century for the public showing of the recently acquired relics from Constantinople. During the Middle Ages great rivalry existed between Maastricht's two religious chapters. At several occasions the chapter of Saint Servatius complained about the fact that the canons at Our Lady's showed their relics in the open air, which only St Servatius' was allowed to do. The relics display, especially at the time of the Septennial Pilgrimage (Dutch: \"Heiligdomsvaart\"), drew large numbers of pilgrims from all over Europe, bringing in revenue for the churches.\n\nToday the church treasure is only a fraction of what it once was. Many gold and silver objects were melted down in order to pay for war taxes during the tumultuous period after the French conquest of Maastricht in 1794. Other pieces were sold for personal gain or given away. Even as late as 1837, the church lost two of its most precious possessions out of ignorance. A 10th-century reliquary in the shape of a patriarchal cross, allegedly containing the largest particle of the True Cross, and the so-called \"pectoral cross of Constantine\" (both originating from Constantinople and probably taken to Maastricht by crusaders) were given away by a former canon and are now in the treasury of the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Two copper-gilt reliefs depicting angels are now in the Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius. In some cases the reliquaries were lost but the content (the relics) was saved. This is the case with the so-called \"Virgin's Girdle\". Of the original silver statues of the Virgin and two angels only a silver tube with the girdle survived.\n\nThe treasure of the basilica of Our Lady as it is today consists of reliquary boxes, cases or busts made of (gilded) silver or copper, silvered lead, brass, ivory, horn, bone and wood; chalices, patens, monstrances and other liturgical implements made of silver, silver-gilt, brass or tin; ecclesiastical vestments and ancient fabrics used for wrapping relics; antique books and manuscripts; paintings, prints and sculptures; and some archeological finds. The highlights are:\nForthermore, the treasury is home to a collection of devotional objects (crucifixes, statuettes, rosaries, scapulars, pilgrim badges, and In memoriam cards) belonging to the foundation \"Santjes en Kantjes\".\n\n\n"}

Merovingian abbeys of the diocese of Langres, after Moûtiers-Saint-Jean, Saint-Bénigne and Saint-Seine.\nThe abbey was founded by Amalgaire, Duke of Lower Burgundy, brother of Waldalenus, Duke of Upper Burgundy and father of Saint Donatus of Besançon.\nAmalgaire founded the abbey in the reign of Chlothar II (r. 613–629) in the autumn of 629.\nThe abbey's location was called the \"Fountain of Bèze\", after a karst spring that is the source of the Bèze river.\nThe \"Chronique de Bèze\" from the first 3rd of the 12th century, describes foundation of the abbey on an unoccupied site.\nThe Chronicle says:\nAmalgaire's wife Aquilina gave him two sons and one daughter, born between 595 and 605.\nHis son Adalric would succeed him while his son Waldelene was educated as a monk at the Luxeuil Abbey under the Rule of Saint Columbanus.\nHis daughter Adalsinde also became a nun.\nWaldelene became the first abbot at Bèze.\nAmalgaire also founded a monastery at Bregille on the right bank of the Doubs for his daughter Adalsinde, who became its first abbess. \nThis monastery was given the existing Church of Saint Martin at Bregville.\nAmalgaire gave the Bèze Abbey a rich endowment of 31 domains with forests, vineyards and buildings, cultivators and winegrowers.\nHe gave it vineyards in the Gevrey-Chambertin region that today are the source of the famous Chambertin-Clos de Bèze red Burgundy wine.\n\nThe monks of Bèze followed the Rule of Saint Columbanus, which Waldalène brought from Luxeuil Abbey.\nThe first buildings were a rectangular stone structure surrounded by wood and earth outbuildings with thatched roofs.\nAfter the death of Amalgaire around 655 civil war raged in Burgundy and the country was ravaged by rival bands of Neustrian and Austrasian Franks.\nThe reign of Chlothar III (r. 657–673), son of Clovis II (r. 639–657), had just started in Austrasia in late 657 when civil disturbances made Brégille untenable.\nAdalsinde and her brother Adalric begged her brother Waldelène and his monks to give her and her nuns refuge in Bèze, and in return transferred to him the priests of Saint Martin.\n\nBèze was also ruined, its property titles destroyed and its monks scattered.\nWhen peace was restored Waldalene made haste to repair the losses of his monastery.\nTo proceed faster he used credit from the new Duke of Burgundy, Sichelm.\nA diploma was issued by Chlothar III in 658 or 664 that confirmed the donations made by Amalgaire.\nDuke Adalric lost his duchy some time between 658 and 664.\nThe king entrusted the lord Gengoul with the protection of the abbey.\nThe duke, or his son Adalrich, Duke of Alsace, was restored to possession of the monastery of Bèze by the royal precept of 665.\nAdalric abused his authority to ransack the abbey.\nLater Adalric deserted King Theuderic III of Neustria (r. 673–691) and joined his enemies, who chose Dagobert II (r. 676–679) as King of Austrasia.\nThe war between Theuderic of Neustria and Dagobert of Austrasia once more devastated Bèze.\nWaldalène had to rebuild the abbey from ruins.\nIn 676 Theuderic, now victorious, gave Waldalène all of Adalric's property.\nAdalric settled permanently in Alsace after the troubles of 675–676.\nWaldalène died in 680.\nThe abbey flourished under the three abbots that followed, Bercand or Bercang, around 680, Ferréol around 700 and Syranne around 720.\n\nThe Saracens, who had conquered Spain in 714, crossed the Pyrennees and devastated the south of France.\nThey penetrated up the Rhône, the Saône and the Loire until finally defeated by Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732.\nThe Saracens sacked the abbey of Bèze around 730.\nDom Jean Mabillon relates that they destroyed Autun, pulled down the Abbey of Bèze (\"monasterium Besuense\"), were repulsed from Sens when they attacked it in 732, but then massacred Saint Mellin and the monks of Luxeuil Abbey.\nThe anthropologist Gustave Lagneau considered that some of the present population of the region showed signs of Saracen descent.\n\nBetween 751 and 754 King Pepin the Short (r. 751–768) gave the abbey to his concubine, Angla or Anglais wife of Théodard, to be desecrated or dilapidated by her according to her caprice.\nPepin also dismissed the bishop of Langres at this time, and replaced him by his brother Remi.\nAfter this the abbey was entrusted to the bishops of Langres, but due to the difficulties of the times it was only rebuilt under the Emperor Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), when Bishop Albéric restored the buildings and reintroduced discipline.\n\nAlbéric was made Bishop of Langres by Louis the Pious around 820.\nThe Chronicle of Bèze relates that Albéric was afflicted by a violent colic that made him despair of his life.\nAn old man appeared to him in a dream and told him he would recover if he promised to reestablish the monastery.\nHe made the promise and regained his health.\nAlbéric gave Bèze the church of Saint Laurent in Beurey in 830.\nLouis the Pious visited Langres in 830 with his son Lothair and held a provincial council.\nThis council and other synods seem to have resulted in the general reform that reestablished the common life of the canons and caused all the monasteries to restore their original rules.\nAt Albéric's request Louis issued a charter that confirmed all the property of the abbey.\nAlbéric repaired the church of Saint-Mammès at the abbey.\nAlberic died in 839 and his body was taken to Bèze on 22 December 839.\nOn 6 October 883 Geilon, bishop of Langres, gave the abbey of Bèze the relics of Saint Prudent de Narbonne, which he had brought back from a chapel in Narbonne after his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.\nIn 887, when marauding Normans approached the monks of Bèze transported the body of Saint Prudent to Saint-Etienne de Dijon. \nWhen the invasion was over the monks rebuilt the ruins of the abbey and asked for the saint's body from Dijon.\nThe canons of Dijon at first refused, then at the command of Bishop Gauthier of Langres pretended to comply, but in fact gave the monks the body of Saint Silvin.\nEventually the ruse was discovered, and the body of Saint Prudent was carried with great ceremony from Dijon to Bèze in 931.\n\nThe abbey was destroyed twice during the Hungarian invasions of Europe. It was burned in July 936 when the Hungarians came from Burgundy, and again the next year when the Hungarians had spread through France, Burgundy and Aquitaine, plundering and ravaging everywhere.\nThe Hungarians caused so much damage to the monastery that it could not be restored for eleven years.\n\nAt the end of the 10th century Bruno de Roucy, Bishop of Langres, asked Majolus of Cluny to send monks to rebuild the abbeys of the Langres diocese.\nAmong them was William of Volpiano, who became abbot of Saint-Bénigne at Dijon, and was also abbot of Bèze from 990 until his death in 1031.\nWilliam introduced the customs of Cluny to both abbeys.\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict is first mentioned in the Chronicle of Beze when it comes to the William, an Italian who became abbot in 990.\nUnlike Saint-Bénigne, the properties of the abbey were concentrated in the immediate vicinity, towards Champlitte and the Saône.\nThanks to William's reforms Bèze attracted gifts from local nobles such as the Fouvents, descendants of the counts of Atuyer, the Beaumonts and Montsaugeons towards Langres and the Beaujeus on the Saône.\nThe property included serfs. For example, in the 11th century the abbey received the serf Arnulf and \"one half of the sons or daughters of the said Arnulf\" for the benefit of Sir Henri de Ferté's soul.\n\nRaoul le Blanc, Viscount of Dijon, became a monk at Saint-Bénigne, then was made grand-prior of Bèze under abbot William and played a major role in the restoration of the abbey.\nRaoul dedicated his immense fortune to entirely rebuilding the abbey, including executing two ossuaries in the chapel of the Virgin and replacing the remains of the old destroyed tombs. \nHe rebuilt the church on a larger scale, and it was dedicated in 1016 or 1018 in a ceremony arranged by Lambert de Vignory, Brunon's successor as bishop in a ceremony attended by many bishops and clergy from various provinces of France.\nIn 1018 the lord of Fouvent founded the priory of Saint-Sépulcre beside his castle, subordinate to Bèze abbey.\n\nUlger or Olger 1, former prior of Beze, was abbot from 1031 to 1052.\nHe died on return from a pilgrimage to Jersusalem. \nIn October 1050 Pope Leo IX visited Langres, where he settled a dispute between the Bèze monks and the Langres canons over tithes from one of the monks' vineyards. He said that \"By the authority of the Holy Fathers who preceded me in the see of Rome, it was permitted that no church founded in honour of St Peter, the prince of the Apostles, should pay a rent of tithes to another church.\" This silenced the canons. \nIn 1066 a solemn assembly of bishops, abbots and local lords was held at the abbey of Bèze to settle difference between the abbot of Saint-Benigne and the officers of Robert, Duke of Burgundy.\nIn 1083 Ponce, lord of the Château de Beaujeu, gave the abbey a chapel built in honour of Saint Vallier with lands and various rights.\n\nÉtienne de Joinville was the son and grandson of counts on his father's side, and grandson of Arnoul, count of Reynel on his mother's side.\nHe served as a soldier before becoming a monk.\nHe was a monk at the Priory of Saint-Oyan-de-Bar and then at Cluny, where his uncle Widon was Grand Prior.\nHe was appointed prior at Sainte-Germaine de Bar-sur-Aube, then of Bar-sur-Seine.\nIn 1088 he was chosen as abbot of Bèze by bishop Robert.\nUnder the abbot Étienne de Jonvelle (c. 1088–1124) the grants multiplied, particularly in the form of restitution of churches.\nHumbert de Fouvent, who had been killed in the service of the Bishop of Langres around 1085–87, was buried at Bèze.\nHis widow gave the abbey the chapel of his castle, the church of Lavoncourt and two silver \"cyphes\".\nIn 1093 Irmuin de Seveux gave the abbey the churches of Saint-Denis and Saint-Laurent.\nPope Paschal II stayed at the abbey in 1107.\nHe was accompanied by Henry, Abbot of Saint-Jean-d'Angély.\nÉtienne doubled the size of the abbey's domain by restitution and donations, and expanded the abbey buildings, extending the church to the river.\n\nThere are still remains of an axial chapel from the early 12th century.\nThis is all that is left of Étienne's buildings.\nThe chapels would have extended towards the Bèze river from the apse of the church.\nUnder Étienne's rule the number of monks grew to about 50 living in the abbey and another 50 in subordinate priories.\nThe monk Jean (died 1120) wrote the \"Chronicon Besuense\", a history of the abbey from its foundation to the start of the 12th century.\nThe monk Teobaudus (died 1130) wrote the \"Miracula Sancti Prudentii\", which described the miraculous cures that had been effected by the relics of Saint Prudent. \nThe monk Raoul the Bald wrote the \"Libri Quinque Historiae\", a history of events from 900 to 1044.\nHe famously wrote of the period, \"At that time the kingdom of France was covered with a white cloak of churches.\"\nIn 1198 the abbey was accidentally burned.\n\nIn 1215 the abbot Albert received a letter from Pope Innocent III on the subject of damages caused by a fire which had forced the abbot to send the monks to Cluny.\nIn 1219 the abbey finally accepted an offer that had first been made in 1049 and sold its Clos de Bèze vineyard to the canons of Langres. \nOver time the rule was relaxed and the monks became more concerned with temporal than spiritual matters.\nIn 1253 the abbot Geoffroy II was the first to hold the feudal title \"Baron de Bèze\".\nAround 1280 the abbot Girard III built a school outside the village for children who were not destined for the church.\nThe building on the Place de Verdun still stands.\nThe archives tell of disputes between the abbot and the bishop of Langres, disputes between the monks and the people of Bèze, disputes with the local lords, disputes over feudal dues and rights of use.\nIn 1307 a dispute between the Bèze Abbey and some burgesses of the abbey was heard first by the Jours de Troyes, then escalated to the king's Parlement.\n\nThe Hundred Years' War began in 1337.\nThe Black Death appeared in Marseille, then spread throughout France in 1348–49.\nSome thought the world was ending, and others thought God was punishing France for her sins.\nGuillaume de Chanac became abbot in 1352. \nHe later became bishop of Chartres and a cardinal.\nIn 1389 a complaint was lodged by 15 officers and monks of the abbey against the abbot Thiéry de Charmes concerning maladministration of the neighboring school. \nThe award, issued by the court of Langes on the Saturday before Pentecost, meticulously itemized the rights and duties of the abbot.\nThese included the requirement to supply wine to the master and clerics of Bèze to drink after vigils.\nSimon de Torcenay was abbot from 1423 until his death in 1444.\nHe repaired the buildings and strengthened the fortifications.\nIn 1425 he built the first forges on the Bèze.\nHe was a \"warrior monk\" and fortified the abbey with walls surrounded by a moat and accessed over a drawbridge\nHe built a second line of walls to fortify the village.\nAround 1428 Claus de Werve made a polychromed limestone statue of the \"Virgin and Child\" for the abbey, which was installed in the Church of Saint-Martin at Bézouotte and has survived.\nConstruction of the fortified enclosure began in 1429.\nThe Chaux tower in the south and the Oysel tower in the north still stand, and carry the arms of Simon de Torcenay.\nIn 1433 there was a risk of rebellion by the lords of Château-Vilain, Grancey and Vergy against the Duke of Burgundy.\nOn 10 May 1433 the duke addressed letters patent to the monks and people of Bèze telling them to remain faithful to the king of France and refuse entry to any stranger or enemy. \nThat year he invited the abbot Simon de Torcenay, his councilor and chamberlain, to attend a solemn ceremony of a chapter of the Order of the Golden Fleece.\n\nBèze was devastated by the war between the Duchy of Burgundy and Franche-Comté, in which the Swiss invaded in 1513.\nDuring the French Wars of Religion the Bishop of Langres supported Henry IV of France but Bèze was occupied by forces of the Catholic League.\nIn 1592 there were only six monks and two novices left.\nWith the introduction of the \"commende\" system the abbot was appointed by the king and had sole responsibility for managing the property.\nAbbots, living outside the abbey, kept most of the income and granted the monks the bare minimum.\nIn 1615 the lay lord Charles de Ferrières was appointed abbot.\n\nIn 1636, as a precaution, the relics of the Abbey of Bèze were deposited with the Abbey of Saint-Bénigne in Dijon.\nThey were brought back from there 22 years later.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War in 1636 the Austrian army of Matthias Gallas ravaged the Vingeanne valley.\nSwedish mercenaries, nominally allies of France, destroyed what was left.\nThe abbey was ruined, with only a few monks left, each living in a small house they had built for themselves.\n\nIn 1662 a final revival of the monastery began with the arrival of 12 monks of the Congregation of Saint-Maur.\nThe Congregation of St Maur had been granted letters patent by Louis XIII of France in 1618 to manage the reformed monasteries of France.\nIt contained more than 180 monasteries by the end of the 17th century.\nThe congregation enforced a return to the strict Rule of Saint Benedict.\nIt is best known for its scholarship, including historical research, biblical studies, chronology and liturgy.\nThe abbey was probably partially rebuilt in the 17th century.\nIn 1731 the abbey and its revenues were transferred to the newly created Bishopric of Dijon. \nIt was now administered by a simple \"prior\" rather than an abbot, and depended on the bishop for funding.\n\nThe Congrégation de Saint-Maur planned a reconstruction program for the abbey, with plans that provided more southern light and air to the monks' cells.\nThe buildings and Saint Peter and Paul church were destroyed and rebuilt from 1738, using materials from the old building.\nThe initial plans were changed in 1769 under the direction of the architect Charles Saint-Père, who conceived a large building south of the church.\nIt had a central section holding the refectory and the dormitory, with two wings.\nOf the long \"monastic palace\", the wings have survived but the main building, which held the cells of the monks on the first floor, has been destroyed.\n\nThe buildings included an infirmary, guest rooms for distinguished visitors, a library that had 4,175 volumes according to the May 1790 inventory and apartments for the Cellerier and Sous-Cellerier, who looked after the material life of the abbey.\nThe west wing held a large library on the second floor.\nA cloister gallery runs along the central north side.\nThere is a storehouse arranged symmetrically with the west wing.\nThe church was roughly the same as the former church, but somewhat shortened and no longer extending to the river.\n\nAt the start of the French Revolution, on 2 November 1789 the Constituent Assembly decreed nationalization of the lands of the church and the religious houses.\nThe monks were turned out of the abbeys and left to look after themselves.\nIn May 1790 the municipality of Bèze made an inventory of the monks' property. \nThe last three monks left in January 1791.\nThe municipality acquired the storehouse to hold the town hall and the school.\n\nIn August 1791 a Langres paper maker named Faitout obtained possession of the other buildings.\nAfter a failed spinning project the abbey church began to be destroyed around 1796 and the stones sold.\nThe central part of the buildings was demolished in 1805.\nThe former \"convent house\" was sold in 1804 to Frédéric Rochet, an ironmaster. \nThe property then passed through several hands before being acquired by the Dijon industrialist Philippe Breuil in 1872, whose descendants owned the property as of 2014.\nThe forges on the Belle Ile en Bèze operated until the end of the 19th century, when they were replaced by a hydroelectric power station, which operated until the 1960s.\nSheds, stables and an orangerie in the southwest were built after 1845 and a park laid out.\nThe English-style park was planted with many unusual trees in the 19th century and includes a flower garden with old roses.\n\nThe site has a total area of .\nThere are two 4-level horseshoe towers from the old enclosure.\nThe Oysel tower to the north has had its internal divisions destroyed.\nThe Chaix tower to the west has a vaulted ground floor and 2nd and 3rd floors reached by a stairway in the thickness of the wall.\nOf the main structure what remains are two symmetrical buildings with basements and two floors.\nThere is an elongated building to the east and remains of other structures including a barrel-vaulted chapel.\nThe axial chapel survives with two pilasters and their capitals.\nThe east and west wings of the 18th century convent building, the Chaux and Oysel towers including the washhouse, the floor of the old church and the axial chapel, facades, roofs and cellar structure were registered as \"Monuments Historiques\" on 15 September 2010.\nThe property is privately owned. Both the park and gardens are open to visitors, for a small fee.\n\n"}

A chapter book may have multiple chapters and these can be referred to by the things that may be the main topic of that specific chapter. In each case, chapters can be numbered or titled or both. An example of a chapter that has become well known is \"Down the Rabbit-Hole\", which is the first chapter from \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n\nMany novels of great length have chapters. Non-fiction books, especially those used for reference, almost always have chapters for ease of navigation. In these works, chapters are often subdivided into sections. Larger works with a lot of chapters often group them in several 'parts' as the main subdivision of the book.\n\nThe chapters of reference works are almost always listed in a table of contents. Novels sometimes use a table of contents, but not always. If chapters are used they are normally numbered sequentially; they may also have titles, and in a few cases an epigraph or prefatory quotation. In older novels it was a common practice to summarise the content of each chapter in the table of contents and/or in the beginning of the chapter.\n\nIn works of fiction, authors sometimes number their chapters eccentrically, often as a metafictional statement. For example:\n\nIn ancient civilizations, books were often in the form of papyrus or parchment scrolls, which contained about the same amount of text as a typical chapter in a modern book. This is the reason chapters in recent reproductions and translations of works of these periods are often presented as \"Book 1\", \"Book 2\" etc.\n\nIn the early printed era, long works were often published in multiple volumes, such as the Victorian triple decker novel, each divided into numerous chapters. Modern omnibus reprints will often retain the volume divisions. In some cases the chapters will be numbered consecutively all the way through, such that \"Book 2\" might begin with \"Chapter 9\", but in other cases the numbering might reset after each part (i.e., \"Book 2, Chapter 1\"). Even though the practice of dividing novels into separate volumes is rare in modern publishing, many authors still structure their works into \"Books\" or \"Parts\" and then subdivide them into chapters. A notable example of this is The Lord of the Rings which consists of six 'Books', each with a recognizable part of the story, although it is usually published in three volumes.\n\n"}

{"id": "38062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38062", "title": "Die Entführung aus dem Serail", "text": "Die Entführung aus dem Serail\n\nThe company that first sponsored the opera was the \"Nationalsingspiel\" (\"national Singspiel\"), a pet project (1778–1783) of the Austrian emperor Joseph II. The Emperor had set up the company to perform works in the German language (as opposed to the Italian opera style widely popular in Vienna). This project was ultimately given up as a failure, but along the way it produced a number of successes, mostly a series of translated works. Mozart's opera emerged as its outstanding original success.\n\nThe inspector of the \"Nationalsingspiel\" was Gottlieb Stephanie. When the 25-year-old Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781, seeking professional opportunity, one of the first tasks to which he addressed himself was to become acquainted with Stephanie and lobby him for an opera commission. To this end, he brought a copy of his earlier opera \"Zaide\" and showed it to Stephanie, who was duly impressed. Mozart also made a strong impression on the manager of the theater, Count Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg, when in the home of Mozart's friend and patroness Maria Wilhelmine Thun the Count heard him play excerpts from his opera \"Idomeneo\", premiered with great success the previous year in Munich. With this backing, it was agreed that Stephanie would find appropriate material and prepare a libretto for Mozart. Stephanie complied by preparing an altered version of an earlier work \"Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" without attributing or seeking permission from its original author Christoph Friedrich Bretzner. Bretzner later complained loudly and publicly about the theft.\n\nMozart received the libretto from Stephanie on 29 July 1781. He had few opportunities to compose professionally during the summer and he set to work on the libretto at a very rapid pace, finishing three major numbers in just two days. A letter to his father Leopold indicates he was very excited about the prospect of having his opera performed in Vienna, and worked enthusiastically on his project.\n\nAt first Mozart thought he needed to finish his opera in only two months, because tentative plans were made to perform it at the September visit of the Russian Grand Duke Paul (son of Catherine the Great and heir to the Russian throne). However, it was ultimately decided to perform operas by Gluck instead, giving Mozart more time.\n\nIt was around this time that Mozart articulated his views about the role of the composer and the librettist in the preparation of an opera. He wrote to his father (13 October 1781):\nIt would seem that something along these lines did happen—that is, Mozart decided to play a major role in the shaping of the libretto, insisting that Stephanie make changes for dramatic and musical effect. On 26 September Mozart wrote:\nMozart was evidently quite pleased to have in Stephanie a librettist who would listen to him. The September 26 letter also says:\nWith the delays for rewriting, the composition took several more months. The premiere took place on 16 July 1782, at the Burgtheater in Vienna.\n\n\"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" is in the genre of \"Singspiel\", thus the music lacks recitatives and consists entirely of set numbers. As Hughes notes, the action is mostly carried forward by the spoken dialogue, so the libretto gave Mozart little opportunity to display an achievement for which his later operas are celebrated, namely the construction of scenes in which the plot is both reflected in and driven forward by the music.\n\n\"Die Entführung\" is lighthearted and frequently comic, with little of the deep character exploration or darker feelings found in Mozart's later operas. The opera was inspired by a contemporary interest in the exotic culture of the Ottoman Empire, a nation which had only recently ceased to be a military threat to Austria. Mozart's opera includes a Westernized version of Turkish music, based very loosely on the Turkish Janissary band music.\n\nCertain aspects of the opera conform to an eighteenth-century European view of orientalism. The Pasha's titular harem, for example, reprised themes of sexual libertinage. And the comically sinister overseer, Osmin, is a send-up of earlier stereotypes of Turkish despotism. However, the opera also defies the stereotype of despotic Turkish culture, since its climax entails a selfless act of forgiveness on the part of the Pasha.\n\nThe music includes some of the composer's most spectacular and difficult arias. Osmin's act 3 aria \"O, wie will ich triumphieren\" includes characteristic 18th century coloratura passage work, and twice goes down to a low D (D), one of the lowest notes demanded of any voice in opera. Perhaps the most famous aria in the opera is the long and elaborate \"Martern aller Arten\" (\"Tortures of all kinds\") for Konstanze, an outstanding challenge for sopranos. Konstanze sings in a kind of sinfonia concertante with four solo players from the orchestra; the strikingly long orchestral introduction, without stage action, also poses problems for stage directors.\n\nThe virtuosity of these roles is perhaps attributable to the fact that when he took up the task of composing the opera, Mozart already knew the outstanding reputations of the singers for whom he was writing, and he tailored the arias to their strengths. The first Osmin was Ludwig Fischer, a bass noted for his wide range and skill in leaping over large intervals with ease. Similarly, Mozart wrote of the first Konstanze, Caterina Cavalieri, \"I have sacrificed Konstanze's aria a little to the flexible throat of Mlle. Cavalieri.\"\n\n The opera was a huge success. The first two performances brought in the large sum of 1200 florins, three times what Mozart's salary had been for his old job in Salzburg. The work was repeatedly performed in Vienna during Mozart's lifetime, and throughout German-speaking Europe. In 1787, Goethe wrote (concerning his own efforts as a librettist):\nAlthough the opera greatly raised Mozart's standing with the public as a composer, it did not make him rich: he was paid a flat fee of 100 Imperial ducats (about 450 florins) for his work, and made no profits from the many subsequent performances.\n\nThe opera reached Paris in November 1801, when Frédéric Blasius conducted Ellmenreich's company in performances at the Théâtre de la Gaîté.\n\nThis opera is firmly ensconced in the repertoire today. \n\nThe complexity of Mozart's work noted by Goethe also plays a role in a well-known tale about the opera which appeared in the early (1798) biography of Mozart by Franz Xaver Niemetschek. In the version of the anecdote printed in \"Bartlett's Book of Anecdotes\", a reference work, the story is told like this:\n\nThe authenticity of this story is not accepted by all scholars. Moreover, the version given by the Bartlett reference (and many other places) includes a translation of the original German that is dubious. The original reads as follows:\n\n\"Too many notes\" is not a plausible translation of the German phrase \"gewaltig viel Noten\". Mautner (1956:33), translating Niemetschek, renders this as \"an extraordinary number of notes\", while Branscombe (2006) translates it simply as \"very many notes\". The anecdote, which is often repeated, is considered by some scholars to unfairly give the Emperor a bad reputation concerning both his own musical abilities and his appreciation and support of Mozart.\n\nThe singers perform with a Classical-era orchestra: pairs of flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, a set of two timpani, and strings. They are augmented with the instruments needed for \"Turkish\" music: bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and piccolo. The aria, \"\", is augmented by a basset horn.\n\nThe orchestra for the premiere included a number of eminent musicians of the day: first cellist Joseph Franz Weigl, first oboist Josef Triebensee, second horn Joseph Leutgeb, and the clarinettist brothers Anton and Johann Stadler. In the first violin section was Franz de Paula Hofer, who later became Mozart's brother-in-law. The four musicians who played the \"Turkish\" instruments remain anonymous, though it is known that they were recruited for this purpose by one Franz Tyron, Kapellmeister of the Austrian Second Field Artillery Regiment.\n\nAfter a lively overture, Belmonte enters, looking for his betrothed, Konstanze, who with her English servant Blonde has fallen into the hands of pirates and been sold to Pasha Selim (Aria: \"Hier soll ich dich denn sehen\" – \"Here surely I must find her\"). Osmin, the Pasha's bad-tempered servant, comes to pluck figs in the garden and contemptuously ignores Belmonte's questions (Aria: \"Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden\" – \"You may think, you've found a maiden\"). Belmonte tries to obtain news of his servant, Pedrillo, who has been captured with the women and is serving as a servant in the Pasha's palace. Osmin replies with insults and abuse (Duet: \"Verwünscht seist du samt deinem Liede!\" – \"The devil take you and your song, sir\"). Belmonte leaves in disgust. Pedrillo enters and Osmin rages at him, vowing to get him tortured and killed in many different ways (Aria: \"Solche hergelaufne Laffen\" – \"These young men who go a-spying\"). Osmin leaves and Belmonte enters and happily reunites with Pedrillo. Together they resolve to rescue Konstanze and Blonde, who is Pedrillo's fiancée (Aria: \"Konstanze, Konstanze, dich wiederzusehen … O wie ängstlich\" – \"Konstanze, Konstanze, to see thee again … Oh what trembling\").\n\nAccompanied by a chorus of Janissaries (\"Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder\" – \"Sing to the mighty Pasha Selim\"), Pasha Selim appears with Konstanze, for whose love he strives in vain (Aria of Konstanze: \"Ach ich liebte\" – \"How I loved him\"). Pedrillo tricks the Pasha into hiring Belmonte as an architect. When Belmonte and Pedrillo try to enter the palace, Osmin bars their way, but they hurry past him anyway (Terzett: \"Marsch! Marsch! Marsch! Trollt euch fort!\" – \"March! March! March! Clear off!\").\n\nThe Pasha has given Blonde to Osmin, to be his slave; however, she defiantly rebuffs her new master's rough lovemaking attempts (Aria: \"Durch Zärtlichkeit und Schmeicheln\" – \"With smiles and kind caresses\"), threatens to scratch out his eyes, and chases him out of the room (Duet: \"Ich gehe, doch rate ich dir\" – \"I'm going, but mark what I say\"). Konstanze enters and greets Blonde in distress (Aria: \"Welcher Wechsel herrscht in meiner Seele … Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose\" – \"Oh what sorrow overwhelms my spirit … Endless grief tortures my spirit\"). The Pasha enters, demands her love, and threatens to use force, but she resolutely rejects him. (Aria: \"Martern aller Arten\" – \"Tortures unrelenting\") Left alone, he muses on her determination to remain chaste, which increases his desire for her.\n\nPedrillo informs Blonde that Belmonte has come and is planning to rescue them. Blonde is filled with joy. (Aria: \"Welche Wonne, welche Lust\" – \"Oh, the happy, happy day\"). After singing a short ditty to boost his courage (Aria: \"Frisch zum Kampfe\" – \"Now Pedrillo, now for battle!\"), Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink (Duet: \"Vivat Bacchus! Bacchus lebe!\" – \"Here's to Bacchus, long live Bacchus\"). Despite his religious prohibition against alcoholic beverages, Osmin drinks heavily and falls asleep. Konstanze joins Belmonte who declares his love (Aria: \"Wenn der Freude Tränen fließen\" – \"When tears of joy flow\"). The two couples reunite (Quartet, Belmonte, Konstanze, Pedrillo, Blonde: \"Ach Belmonte! Ach, mein Leben\" – \"Ah, Belmonte, ah my dear one!\"). After their initial expressions of love and joy, Belmonte and Pedrillo both question anxiously whether their respective fiancees have remained faithful during their forced separation; to their delight the women respond with indignation and dismay, and Blonde slaps Pedrillo's face. The two men apologize for their failure of confidence; the women forgive them for the offensive questions.\n\nBelmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: \"Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke\" – \"Love, only love, can now direct me\"). Pedrillo gets the attention of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: \"In Mohrenland gefangen war\" – \"In Moorish lands a maiden fair\"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle. Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: \"O, wie will ich triumphieren\" – \"My triumphant hour's approaching\"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish Grandee and Governor of Oran, named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: \"Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben\" – \"What dreadful fate conspires against us... Woe, you will die because of me\"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to see them all brutally executed (Finale: \"Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen\" – \"Your noble mercy passes measure\").\n\nThe Finnish composer Aulis Sallinen wrote an opera called \"The Palace\" (first performed 1995); it contains characters whose names are adapted from \"Abduction\" and loosely uses elements of the plot of Mozart's opera as the starting point of a satirical fantasy.\n\nMusic professor, composer, and humorist Peter Schickele claims to have \"discovered\" P. D. Q. Bach's \"The Abduction of Figaro\", a pastiche of the \"Entführung\" and Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\".\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "42526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42526", "title": "Etching", "text": "Etching\n\nEtching is traditionally the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio (incised) in the metal. In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of printmaking, it is, along with engraving, the most important technique for old master prints, and remains in wide use today. In a number of modern variants such as microfabrication etching and photochemical milling it is a crucial technique in much modern technology, including circuit boards.\n\nIn traditional pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy ground which is resistant to acid. The artist then scratches off the ground with a pointed etching needle where he or she wants a line to appear in the finished piece, so exposing the bare metal. The échoppe, a tool with a slanted oval section, is also used for \"swelling\" lines. The plate is then dipped in a bath of acid, technically called the \"mordant\" (French for \"biting\") or \"etchant\", or has acid washed over it. The acid \"bites\" into the metal (it dissolves part of the metal) where it is exposed, leaving behind lines sunk into the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate. The plate is inked all over, and then the ink wiped off the surface, leaving only the ink in the etched lines.\n\nThe plate is then put through a high-pressure printing press together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it). The paper picks up the ink from the etched lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the plate shows much sign of wear. The work on the plate can also be added to by repeating the whole process; this creates an etching which exists in more than one state.\n\nEtching has often been combined with other intaglio techniques such as engraving (e.g., Rembrandt) or aquatint (e.g., Francisco Goya).\n\nEtching by goldsmiths and other metal-workers in order to decorate metal items such as guns, armour, cups and plates has been known in Europe since the Middle Ages at least, and may go back to antiquity. The elaborate decoration of armour, in Germany at least, was an art probably imported from Italy around the end of the 15th century—little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Printmakers from the German-speaking lands and Central Europe perfected the art and transmitted their skills over the Alps and across Europe. \n\nThe process as applied to printmaking is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hopfer (circa 1470–1536) of Augsburg, Germany. Hopfer was a craftsman who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking, using iron plates (many of which still exist). Apart from his prints, there are two proven examples of his work on armour: a shield from 1536 now in the Real Armeria of Madrid and a sword in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of Nuremberg. An Augsburg horse armour in the German Historical Museum, Berlin, dating to between 1512 and 1515, is decorated with motifs from Hopfer's etchings and woodcuts, but this is no evidence that Hopfer himself worked on it, as his decorative prints were largely produced as patterns for other craftsmen in various media. The oldest dated etching is by Albrecht Dürer in 1515, although he returned to engraving after six etchings instead of developing the craft.\n\nThe switch to copper plates was probably made in Italy, and thereafter etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular medium for artists in printmaking. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving where the difficult technique for using the burin requires special skill in metalworking, the basic technique for creating the image on the plate in etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing. On the other hand, the handling of the ground and acid need skill and experience, and are not without health and safety risks, as well as the risk of a ruined plate.\n\nPrior to 1100 AD, the New World Hohokam independently utilized the technique of acid etching in marine shell designs.\n\nJacques Callot (1592–1635) from Nancy in Lorraine (now part of France) made important technical advances in etching technique. He developed the échoppe, a type of etching-needle with a slanting oval section at the end, which enabled etchers to create a swelling line, as engravers were able to do.\nCallot also appears to have been responsible for an improved, harder, recipe for the etching ground, using lute-makers' varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be more deeply bitten, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of \"foul-biting\", where acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been at the back of an etcher's mind, preventing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined in the biting process. Now etchers could do the highly detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made full use of the new possibilities.\n\nCallot also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple \"stoppings-out\" than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid bite lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep light in tone by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small—up to about six inches or 15 cm on their longest dimension, but packed with detail.\n\nOne of his followers, the Parisian Abraham Bosse, spread Callot's innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.\n\nThe 17th century was the great age of etching, with Rembrandt, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and many other masters. In the 18th century, Piranesi, Tiepolo and Daniel Chodowiecki were the best of a smaller number of fine etchers. In the 19th and early 20th century, the Etching revival produced a host of lesser artists, but no really major figures. Etching is still widely practiced today.\n\nAquatint uses acid-resistant resin to achieve tonal effects.\n\nSoft-ground etching uses a special softer ground. The artist places a piece of paper (or cloth etc. in modern uses) over the ground and draws on it. The print resembles a drawing.\nRelief etching was invented by William Blake in about 1788, and he has been almost the only artist to use it in its original form. However, from 1880–1950 a photo-mechanical (\"line-block\") variant was the dominant form of commercial printing for images. A similar process to etching, but printed as a relief print, so it is the \"white\" background areas which are exposed to the acid, and the areas to print \"black\" which are covered with ground. Blake's exact technique remains controversial. He used the technique to print texts and images together, writing the text and drawing lines with an acid-resistant medium.\n\nCarbograph etching was invented in 2006 and yields an image like that of a charcoal drawing:\n\nwww.randhuebsch.com/carbograph.html\n\nA waxy acid-resist, known as a ground, is applied to a metal plate, most often copper or zinc but steel plate is another medium with different qualities. There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground.\n\nHard ground can be applied in two ways. Solid hard ground comes in a hard waxy block. To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a hot-plate (set at 70 degrees C), a kind of metal worktop that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as possible using a roller. Once applied the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool which hardens the ground.\n\nAfter the ground has hardened the artist \"smokes\" the plate, classically with 3 beeswax tapers, applying the flame to the plate to darken the ground and make it easier to see what parts of the plate are exposed. Smoking not only darkens the plate but adds a small amount of wax. Afterwards the artist uses a sharp tool to scratch into the ground, exposing the metal.\n\nThe second way to apply hard ground is by liquid hard ground. This comes in a can and is applied with a brush upon the plate to be etched. Exposed to air the hard ground will harden. Some printmakers use\noil/tar based asphaltum or bitumen as hard ground, although often bitumen is used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging.\n\nSoft ground also comes in liquid form and is allowed to dry but it does not dry hard like hard ground and is impressionable. After the soft ground has dried the printmaker may apply materials such as leaves, objects, hand prints and so on which will penetrate the soft ground and expose the plate underneath.\n\nThe ground can also be applied in a fine mist, using powdered rosin or spraypaint. This process is called aquatint, and allows for the creation of tones, shadows, and solid areas of color.\n\nThe design is then drawn (in reverse) with an etching-needle or échoppe. An \"echoppe\" point can be made from an ordinary tempered steel etching needle, by grinding the point back on a carborundum stone, at a 45–60 degree angle. The \"echoppe\" works on the same principle that makes a fountain pen's line more attractive than a ballpoint's: The slight swelling variation caused by the natural movement of the hand \"warms up\" the line, and although hardly noticeable in any individual line, has a very attractive overall effect on the finished plate. It can be drawn with in the same way as an ordinary needle.\n\nThe plate is then completely submerged in a solution that eats away at the exposed metal. Ferric chloride may be used for etching copper or zinc plates, whereas nitric acid may be used for etching zinc or steel plates. Typical solutions are 1 part FeCl to 1 part water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water. The strength of the acid determines the speed of the etching process.\nDuring the etching process the printmaker uses a bird feather or similar item to wave away bubbles and detritus produced by the dissolving process, from the surface of the plate, or the plate may be periodically lifted from the acid bath. If a bubble is allowed to remain on the plate then it will stop the acid biting into the plate where the bubble touches it. Zinc produces more bubbles much more rapidly than copper and steel and some artists use this to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within their prints for a Milky Way effect.\n\nThe detritus is powdery dissolved metal that fills the etched grooves and can also block the acid from biting evenly into the exposed plate surfaces. Another way to remove detritus from a plate is to place the plate to be etched face down within the acid upon plasticine balls or marbles, although the drawback of this technique is the exposure to bubbles and the inability to remove them readily.\n\nFor aquatinting a printmaker will often use a test strip of metal about a centimetre to three centimetres wide. The strip will be dipped into the acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds. The metal strip will then be removed and the acid washed off with water. Part of the strip will be covered in ground and then the strip is redipped into the acid and the process repeated. The ground will then be removed from the strip and the strip inked up and printed. This will show the printmaker the different degrees or depths of the etch, and therefore the strength of the ink color, based upon how long the plate is left in the acid.\n\nThe plate is removed from the acid and washed over with water to remove the acid. The ground is removed with a solvent such as turpentine. Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits since turpentine is greasy and can affect the application of ink and the printing of the plate.\n\nSpit-biting is a process whereby the printmaker will apply acid to a plate with a brush in certain areas of the plate. The plate may be aquatinted for this purpose or exposed directly to the acid. The process is known as \"spit\"-biting due to the use of saliva once used as a medium to dilute the acid, although gum arabic or water are now commonly used.\nA piece of matte board, a plastic \"card\", or a wad of cloth is often used to push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as \"tarlatan\" and then wiped with newsprint paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.\n\nA damp piece of paper is placed over the plate and it is run through the press.\n\nGrowing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents led to the development of less toxic etching methods in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using acrylic polymers as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.\n\nThe traditional aquatint, which uses either powdered rosin or enamel spray paint, is replaced with an airbrush application of the acrylic polymer hard ground. Again, no solvents are needed beyond the soda ash solution, though a ventilation hood is needed due to acrylic particulates from the air brush spray.\n\nThe traditional soft ground, requiring solvents for removal from the plate, is replaced with water-based relief printing ink. The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists the ferric chloride etchant, yet can be cleaned up with warm water and either soda ash solution or ammonia.\n\nAnodic etching has been used in industrial processes for over a century. The etching power is a source of direct current. The item to be etched (anode) is connected to its positive pole. A receiver plate (cathode) is connected to its negative pole. Both, spaced slightly apart, are immersed in a suitable aqueous solution of a suitable electrolyte. The current pushes the metal out from the anode into solution and deposits it as metal on the cathode. Shortly before 1990, two groups working independently developed different ways of applying it to creating intaglio printing plates.\n\nIn the patented Electroetch system, invented by Marion and Omri Behr, in contrast to certain nontoxic etching methods, an etched plate can be reworked as often as the artist desires The system uses voltages below 2 volts which exposes the uneven metal crystals in the etched areas resulting in superior ink retention and printed image appearance of quality equivalent to traditional acid methods. With polarity reversed the low voltage provides a simpler method of making mezzotint plates as well as the \"steel facing\" copper plates.\n\nSome of the earliest printmaking workshops experimenting with, developing and promoting nontoxic techniques include Grafisk Eksperimentarium, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Edinburgh Printmakers, in Scotland, and New Grounds Print Workshop, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nLight sensitive polymer plates allow for photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist. Light is projected onto the plate as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on the plate, or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once the plate has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using drypoint, further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.\n\nCopper is a traditional metal, and is still preferred, for etching, as it bites evenly, holds texture well, and does not distort the color of the ink when wiped. Zinc is cheaper than copper, so preferable for beginners, but it does not bite as cleanly as copper does, and it alters some colors of ink. Steel is growing in popularity as an etching substrate. Increases in the prices of copper and zinc have steered steel to an acceptable alternative. The line quality of steel is less fine than copper, but finer than zinc. Steel has a natural and rich aquatint.\n\nThe type of metal used for the plate impacts the number of prints the plate will produce. The firm pressure of the printing press slowly rubs out the finer details of the image with every pass-through. With relatively soft copper, for example, the etching details will begin to wear very quickly, some copper plates show extreme wear after only ten prints. Steel, on the other hand, is incredibly durable. This wearing out of the image over time is one of the reasons etched prints created early in a numbered series tend to be valued more highly. An artist thus takes the total number of prints he or she wishes to produce into account whenever choosing the metal.\n\nEtching is also used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices, and in the preparation of metallic specimens for microscopic observation.\n\nThere are many ways for the printmaker to control the acid's effects.\n\nMost typically, the surface of the plate is covered in a hard, waxy 'ground' that resists acid. The printmaker then scratches through the ground with a sharp point, exposing lines of metal which the mordant acid attacks.\n\nAquatint is a variation in which particulate resin is evenly distributed on the plate, then heated to form a screen ground of uniform, but less than perfect, density. After etching, any exposed surface will result in a roughened (i.e., darkened) surface. Areas that are to be light in the final print are protected by varnishing between acid baths. Successive turns of varnishing and placing the plate in acid create areas of tone difficult or impossible to achieve by drawing through a wax ground.\n\nHere designs in a syrupy solution of sugar or Camp Coffee are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When later the plate is placed in hot water the sugar dissolves and lifts off leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.\n\nA mixture of nitric acid and Gum Arabic (or almost never – saliva) which can be dripped, spattered or painted onto a metal surface giving interesting results. A mixture of nitric acid and rosin can also be used.\n\n Printing the plate is done by covering the surface with printing ink, then rubbing the ink off the surface with \"tarlatan\" cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper is placed on the plate, and both are run through a printing press; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (\"c.f.\", chine-collé). Unfortunately, the pressure also subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a copper plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly etched imaged before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be electro-plated before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. Zinc is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.\n\n\"Foul-bite\" or \"over-biting\" is common in etching, and is the effect of minuscule amounts of acid leaking through the ground to create minor pitting and burning on the surface. This incidental roughening may be removed by smoothing and polishing the surface, but artists often leave faux-bite, or deliberately court it by handling the plate roughly, because it is viewed as a desirable mark of the process.\n\nThe phrase \"Want to come up and see my etchings?\" is a romantic euphemism by which a person entices someone to come back to their place with an offer to look at something artistic, but with ulterior motives. The phrase is a corruption of some phrases in a novel by Horatio Alger, Jr. called \"The Erie Train Boy\", which was first published in 1891. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century—especially with young people—and his books were widely quoted. In chapter XXII of the book, a woman writes to her boyfriend, \"I have a new collection of etchings that I want to show you. Won't you name an evening when you will call, as I want to be certain to be at home when you really do come.\" The boyfriend then writes back \"I shall no doubt find pleasure in examining the etchings which you hold out as an inducement to call.\"\n\nThis was referenced in a 1929 James Thurber cartoon in which a man tells a woman in a building lobby: \"You wait here and I'll bring the etchings down\". It was also referenced in Dashiell Hammett's 1934 novel \"The Thin Man\", in which the narrator answers his wife asking him about a lady he had wandered off with by saying: \"She just wanted to show me some French etchings.\"\n\nThe phrase was given new popularity in 1937: in a well publicized case, violinist David Rubinoff was accused of inviting a young woman to his hotel room to view some French etchings, but instead seducing her.\n\nAs early as 1895, Hjalmar Söderberg used the reference in his \"decadent\" début novel \"Delusions\" (swe: \"Förvillelser)\", when he lets the dandy Johannes Hall lure the main character's younger sister Greta into his room under the pretence that they browse through his etchings and engravings (e.g., \"Die Sünde\" by Franz Stuck).\n\n\n"}

The film is also often referred to as the first Chinese mainland film to broach the topic of lesbian relationships in China.\n\nThe story follows the elephant keeper in the Beijing Zoo who maintains an aquarium of fish in her home (hence the two-animal title), and her lesbian lover, a fabric saleswoman in an outdoor market. Her relationship is tested, however, when her recently divorced mother returns to town in the hope of setting her daughter up in marriage. Further complicating matters is one of Xiaoqun's ex-lovers also returning to her life with the law in pursuit.\n\nThe film was produced by Cheng Yong Productions and was an \"underground\" production (in that it was not made with official support). Moreover, the film was cast entirely with non-professional actors and actresses.\n\n\nFilmed on an almost-square 16 mm format, \"Fish and Elephant\" was the first feature film by Li Yu, who had previously directed several documentaries, including 1997's \"Sisters\", a film which had run into state interference.\n\nCasting by Li Yu was done entirely with non-professionals. The two leads, Xiaoqun (Pan Yi) and Xiaoling (Shitou), were cast after Li began visiting various lesbian bars in Beijing. Similarly, several of the film's \"blind dates\" were based on actual dates set up by Li through classified ads. The men's reactions upon Xiaoqun revealing her sexual orientation therefore are entirely natural and accurate. Some have reported that this focus on amateurs was only partially by choice, in that Li had been unable to sign on established talent due to the controversial script and story.\n\nOnce the film's production was complete, it faced several challenges before it could be seen by audiences. Due to its underground status, Li Yu did not have the support of the Chinese authorities. An attempt to deliver a print to the Venice Film Festival in 2001 led to it being lost. Later screenings, therefore, like at the Toronto Film Festival, for example, had to be on videotape instead of a film reel. Fortunately for Li, copies of \"Fish and Elephant\" eventually managed to screen at over 70 different film festivals around the world.\n\nHowever, it was shown only once in Mainland China at a LGBT film festival that was quickly shut down by authorities.\n\n\"Fish and Elephant\" was released on DVD in the United States by the LGBT-focused distributor, Ariztical Entertainment on May 23, 2006. The edition features the original Mandarin-language dialogue and includes English subtitles.\n\nUpon its dissemination to international audiences, \"Fish and Elephant\" was praised for being groundbreaking in subject matter, but mediocre in execution. \"Time Out New York\", for example,\nthough generally positive in its praise also noted that there was \"nothing here to surprise western viewers.\" Chinese film critic Shelly Kraicer, meanwhile, analyzed the film and concluded, \"[\"Fish and Elephant's\"] flaws are those, entirely forgivable, of a first film, of a novice director who really wants to try to cram all of her ideas into one work.\" The film's release was similarly noted by the film criticism website \"Senses of Cinema\", which stated that, \"\"Fish and Elephant\" might be overlooked by film festivals in favour of other more glossy underground Chinese films produced this year...\", but the author would nonetheless \"recommend it and will keep an eye out for [Li Yu's] future works.\"\n\n\n\n"}

One of the first recipients of the Royal Designers for Industry distinction in 1937, he is remembered for his work for the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company.\n\nSheringham was born in London, the son of an Anglican clergyman. He was educated at the King’s School, Gloucester, the Slade School of Art (1899–1901), and the Sorbonne, Paris (1904–06).\n\nHe first exhibited in Paris and later in Venice, Brussels, and Berlin. His one-man exhibitions included one in Paris in 1905, in London at the Ryder Gallery the same year, one in Melbourne, one in New York and seven more in London. He exhibited with the International Society from 1922.\nThough best known as a stage designer and decorative artist, Sheringham also illustrated books by Max Beerbohm (including \"The Happy Hypocrite\" (1915)) and Edmond Rostand (\"La Princesse Lointaine\", 1919). In 1917, he illustrated \"Canadian Wonder Tales\" by Cyrus MacMillan. In 1921, he collaborated with his brother Hugh on a book about fishing, \"The Book of the Fly Rod\". He wrote \"Drawing in Pen and Pencil\" (1922), with James Laver, \"Design in the Theatre\" (1927). and with Rupert Mason and R. Boyd Morrison he edited \"Robes of Thespis, Costume Designs by Modern Artists\" (1928).\n\nAs a decorator, Sheringham designed the music room at 40 Devonshire House, London; a series of paintings for Seaford House, London, for the 8th Baron Howard de Walden (also Baron Seaford) to illustrate his Celtic poem, \"The Cauldron of Anwn\"; the ballroom at Claridge's Hotel; and the Paris Exhibition of 1937.

Following initial discussions at a tea room above a baker’s shop in Candleriggs, Glasgow, on the proposal to form a club, the first formal meetings of the club were held at the Waverley Temperance Hotel, on Buchanan Street, Glasgow, with Dennistoun elected the club’s first president. Membership was to grow during the 1870s, with professional artists joining and exhibitions being held and in 1875 the club moved to another hotel called the Waverley, this time one on the city’s Sauchiehall Street. From there the club was to relocate to the Royal Hotel on the city’s George Square, renting rooms for six months at a time, where life and sketching classes were held.\n\nMembership of the club began to be extended beyond painters (in 1881 the pioneering photographer James Craig Annan was admitted as a ‘’photographic artist’’ and in 1903 John M. Crawford (another former pupil of Hamilton Academy), Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, became the first architect to be elected President of Glasgow Art Club.) \"\n\nIn 1878 the club moved to rented premises at 62 Bothwell Street and the need to raise funds led to a change in the club’s constitution and the admission in 1886 of male lay members with an interest in the arts (admission of women not extended until 1982. ) With membership burgeoning new premises were rented at 151 Bath Street, these formally opened on 12 November 1886 but soon afterwards two adjacent town houses on Bath Street were purchased, these converted by the architect John Keppie, a member of the club, creating also an exhibition gallery in what were the back gardens of the adjacent houses. It has recently been discovered that the young Charles Rennie Mackintosh was involved in the decorative details of the renovations and created a mural. The club’s new premises were formally opened on 14 June 1893. The club has recently embarked on a major programme of renovation of its historic category A Listed building on Bath Street, Glasgow.\n\nThe club first admitted women as members in 1984, and elected its first female president, Efric McNeil, in 2015.\n\nThe club’s stature in Glasgow was confirmed when on the occasion of the official opening by the Prince of Wales of the Glasgow International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry in 1888, the Lord Provost of Glasgow presented the Prince and Princess of Wales with an album of paintings by members of the Glasgow Art Club. In the succeeding years the club has played host to many events, including, on the evening of 28 October 1932 a dinner honouring Dr. Pittendrigh Macgillivray RSA, King’s Sculptor in Ordinary for Scotland a member of the Club for some fifty years, and club member James B. Anderson ARSA.\n\nInitially the Club’s exhibitions were open only to members, in later years admission extended also to the general public. In 2008 Glasgow Art Club exhibited the jewelled panel \"The White Rose and The Red Rose\" by Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, wife of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, before its sale for £1.7 million at Christie's on 30 April 2008. Since 2010 the club has opened its exhibition spaces and collections to the public on a regular basis (i.e. not just when specific exhibitions are being held.) \n\nMany notable member artists have exhibited at the club’s exhibitions, including:\n\nThe club's Winter exhibition of 1909 included works by: Sir James Guthrie, E A Hornel, Muirhead Bone (Britain’s first official War Artist, knighted 1937) Sir David Murray RA\n\nThe club's Spring exhibition of 1923 included works by: E A Hornel, Sir David Murray RA, James Kay \n\nThe club's Memorial Exhibition of 1935 included works by: E A Walton, Sir James Guthrie, W Y Macgregor, James Paterson, Maurice William Greiffenhagen, Leslie Hunter, Stuart Park, E A Hornel \n\nThe club’s exhibition April 1939 included works by: Sir John Lavery (exhibiting his \"The Lake at Ranelagh\",) and J W Ferguson, who submitted a portrait \n\nNotable members have included/include:\n\n"}

The group is directed by founder, writer and director Azeem Hamid, who was soon joined with designer Danyaal Syed. It is the youngest theatre company in continuous production to have performed both internationally and domestically from Pakistan. Since their inception, the group has performed over twenty theatrical productions.\n\nThe group primarily performs in Urdu language but has also done theatrical productions in English and Punjabi languages. They have extensively focused on the revival of Urdu literature in Pakistan.\n\nIndependent Theatre Pakistan have produced original theatrical productions such as \"Awaaz\" (literal translation: \"Voice\"), a psychological thriller play and the satirical short-play \"Kuttay\" (literal translation: \"Dogs\"). Also, they have adapted the works of progressive South Asian writers like Saadat Hassan Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Krishan Chander, Imtiaz Ali Taj, Ashfaq Ahmed and Meerza Adeeb.\n\nThe company was founded in 2012 by Azeem Hamid and Danyaal Syed and now operates all across theatres in Lahore: Alhamra Arts Council and Ali Auditorium (for classical Urdu & Broadway plays and musicals) and different educational institutes (for theatre workshops & short plays).\n\nTheir first theatrical production \"Hatak\" (literal meaning: \"Insult\"), featured fashion model and actress Zara Peerzada in the lead role, was based on the short-story of famous Urdu writer Saadat Hassan Manto, staged in November 2012 at Alhamra Arts Council and received positive reviews from critics. This was followed by the group collaborating with Beaconhouse School Liberty for a theatrical performance \"Dareecha\", based loosely on the writings of the play \"Qurtaba Ka Qazi\" written by Imtiaz Ali Taj.\n\nIn 2013, the group initiated their year with two short-length plays; \"Dastak (The Knock)\", a play written by Meerza Adeeb and an original, \"Awaaz (Voice)\", in collaboration with Lahore Grammar School, the latter winning two-awards at Colors & Humour 2013 for the best actress & supporting actor roles. This success was later followed by a sold-out performance of Ashfaq Ahmed's tele-play stage adaptation \"Fehmida Ki Kahani, Ustaani Rahat Ki Zubani\" in March, the performance was praised by many literature writers including Ayub Khawar. The group went on to perform Rajinder Singh Bedi's classical satire \"Naql-e-Makani (Moving to a New House)\" from 4th till 6 October, which was well received by critics and the audiences. In the same month, Azeem Hamid directed \"Kuttay\", a satirical performance based on the writings of Nadeem F. Paracha's article \"Dog Gone\" as a mock to society. The performance won the Imtiaz Ali Taj award at a festival held in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nThe following year, it produced several performances, which included \"Jhelum Mein Naupar\" \"(The Sailing Boat in Jhelum)\" featuring stage actress Amtul Baweja and an adaptation of Reginald Rose's famous film \"Twelve Angry Men\" as \"Twelve Angry Jurors\" at different venues in Lahore. In summers, the group went on their first international tour at the 2nd International SPIC MACAY Convention held in Chennai, Madras, India where they collaborated with Koodiyattam master Margi Madhu from the Chakyar clan for the classical Sanskrit theatre performance of \"Anguliyankam (The Golden Ring)\" in June 2014. \nIn December, the company went on to produce their best known theatrical performance \"Kamra No. 9 (Room No. 9)\" a radio play written by Saadat Hasan Manto and directed by Azeem Hamid. The performance was well received by critics and audiences, the \"Daily Times\" wrote \"\"Kamra #9\" ... mystery musical is an example of Urdu theatre at its finest.\" Shoaib Ahmed of \"Dawn Newspaper\" wrote \"The 60-minute three-act play had such a strong production value that it kept glued the audience to their seats till the end. The literary piece was deeply and meaningfully tailored for the play.\", while during an interview to \"The Express Tribune\", director Azeem Hamid said, \"Visualising and creating a 1930s Delhi feel for a radio play was an immense challenge; we walked around Jalander, India to get inspiration for \"Kamra #9’s\" set design.\" The \"Mani-Nama\" blog reviewed the performance saying, \"The set was quite modest- a realistic one with an old radio, telephone and chairs. After sometime I witnessed some quality lighting which was done by Shakeel Siddique, who literally set the pace of play with classic lights.\" and \"The News on Sunday\" wrote, \"\"Kamra #9\" provided insight into human complexities.\" Aleeza Rasool, writer and critic, of \"Youlin Magazine\" reported praising the performance as she wrote, \"Firstly, a radio play by Manto was a refreshing choice, for it is one of the lesser-known genres that Manto composed during his brief lifetime. Secondly, the play was very well-acted, and most importantly, the direction was even-tempered, making the play engaging., adding that, \"It is unusual to come across the genus of anticipation and suspense in Pakistani stage plays, which is why Azeem Hamid, actor and director of the play, deserves a pat on the back for putting up a wonderful performance on Manto’s radio play.\"\n\nAfter the success in Pakistan, the company went on to perform \"Kamra No. 9\" in West Bengal, India to promote peace between the two bordering nations. During an interview with \"The Telegraph\", \"For the past few years, the theatre and cultural activists have been protesting in various ways against fanaticism, trying their best to educate people in rural areas, organising workshops in schools and colleges and staging street theatres. We were hopeful that a peaceful atmosphere would gradually emerge. The Peshawar killings have come as an eye-opener,\" Zoya Uzair, who played the lead role of 'Shireen', said. The company's director Azeem Hamid received an 'Address of Honour' from MLA Ajoy Dey of the Santipur Municipality for staging and directing \"Kamra No. 9\" in West Bengal. \n\nIn 2015, director Azeem Hamid said in an interview to \"My Awesome Journey\" that \"I decided to revamp ITP. I had been scouting a team of professionals that would be useful in creating intelligent theatre.\" The company supported 'The End Polio Now' campaign organized by Rotary International at Alhamra Arts Council, Lahore and performed an original monologue \"Scream\" at the event. In December, the group produced a set of three theatrical performances, \"3 Kahaniyan (Three Stories)\" which featured \"Bu (Odour)\" an original play written by University of Regina graduate Ayesha Mohsin having previously worked with CJTR-FM, a Punjabi language play \"Sammi Di Vaar (Sammi's Life)\" written by Najm Hosain Syed and directed by Mehreen Mir from Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, London which featured famous Pakistani film actor Rashid Mehmood, and a stage adaptation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short-story \"Badshahat Ka Khatma (Kingdom's End)\" by Azeem Hamid. \"The Pakistan Today\" reported that \"3 Kahaniyan\" received a mixed reception from critics, while Faizan Javed of \"The Nation\" praised the performance writing \"The immediate response of the audience determines the quality of play being stage. And when it comes to social message for the audience the impact is everlasting. The play \"3 Kahaniyan\" being staged at Alhamra Hall on Mall Road is an example.\"\n\nIn March, the company produced the theatrical adaptation of Neil Simon's farcical play \"Rumors\", which was praised and supported by well known celebrities and film stars like Agha Ali, Cybil J. Chowdhry, Poonam Anwar, Rachel Gill and comedian Ali Sufian Wasif. The performance was a sold-out show. Soon after, team members from the company participated and lead a delegation to 4th International Convention of SPIC MACAY held in IIT Guwahati, Assam, India. In September, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences hosted a three-days theatrical workshops program called 'Dramaship', which featured lectures from the group team members including Azeem Hamid and Faiz Rasool. The objective of the workshop focused to gather talented students at a single platform and develop their theatrical skills so that they can explore and learn basic concepts of theatre in a new medium to translate their expression.\nOn 20 October, Hamid announced that the company will be directing and producing three full-length comedy theatrical performances which includes \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", \"Run for Your Wife\" and \"Around the World in 80 Days\". In an interview with \"Daily Pakistan\", \"I’m excited and looking forward to November. Rehearsals are in full swing at the Lahore Grammar School Gulberg these days, and after that we will be moving on to The City School. It is going to be a dream come true for theatre lovers, as we keep on working towards the revival of theatre culture in Pakistan\", said Azeem Hamid, creative director of the company. \"The Nation\" reported that the company will be presenting Joseph Kesselring's famous black comedy \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" on 19 November in Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nOn 25 November, Sana Gilani from the \"Daily Pakistan\" published, a review of the performance \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" staged on 19 November, saying \"Independent Theatre put forth an amazingly hilarious play\" while adding that \"Azeem Hamid of Independent Theatre Pakistan put his best foot forward and directed the play’s adaptation.\" A week later, Faiz Rasool directed a re-enactment of a comedy by Ray Cooney, which received applause and appreciation from the audiences and critics, \"Daily Pakistan\" reported calling the play a remarkable success and saying, \"\"Run For Your Wife\" on the 26th and 27th of November, 2016; with a full-house for both days... Jam-packed audiences were delving deeply into the story, and the suspense & humour was one to not have missed.\"\n\nIn December, the group founded the \"ASSITEJ Pakistan National Center\" in alliance with professionals involved in theatre for children and young people in Pakistan, with the aim of hosting a performing arts festival the following year in Lahore.\n\nIndependent Theatre Pakistan team announced that they will be hosting and organizing the biggest children's performing arts festival, \"Tamasha Festival\", to be held on the 7th, 8th and 9th of April at Alhamra Arts Council, in Lahore, Pakistan. On April 7th, \"Dawn\" reported during the opening of the festivity that \"The festival presents theatre performances for young, training workshops from upcoming directors, master workshops from international trainers for local artists and discussion sessions for general public.\" While Faizan Javed from \"The Nation\" reportedly said \"The opening ceremony was attended by special guests and people from the theatre and performing arts such as Salima Hashmi, Bina Jawaad and Information, Culture and Youth Affairs Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman as honorable chief guest.\" Salima Hashmi in an interview with \"The Nation\" in regards to the festivity said, “When I first performed in Alhamra there was no fancy set, props and sound system. There was nothing but a garden with a hut. But then it was a significant experience in my life and I learnt a great deal from it. We should appreciate the young talent because these young people are our future”.\n\n\"The Nation\" newspaper reported on the second day of \"Tamasha Festival\", saying \"thought provoking panel discussions explored the creativity to entertain and educate children...What’s theatre for children? One of the most interesting sessions was with Asaya Fujita and Sue Giles. Moderated by Sarah Zahid the discussion among panelists was remarkable. The session held at Alhamra Arts Council - Hall 1, highlighted the importance of theatre and arts for children. Director of Polyglot Theatre, Sue Giles said that through theatre, we achieve an opportunity to present space and time to subjective experience and nourish the child’s brain power. “The idea of ‘value for money’ is another issue how people perceive the place and power of children in our midst. We neglect our children’s physical freedoms we once had,” Sue added. While the session ‘Society and Drama’ highlighted the issues of theatre industry in both countries Pakistan and Korea. The session was moderated by Azeem Hamid and the panelists were renowned writer Asghar Nadeem Syed and Seok Hong-Kim.\"\n\nOn 19 May, the company produced the theatrical adaptations of Jules Verne's \"Around the World in 80 Days\" and William Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", directed by Syed Shabee-ul-Hassan.\n\nIndependent Theatre Pakistan theatrical workshops use the art of acting and storytelling as a model for creative thinking in general. The company's director, Azeem Hamid in a radio interview to Fifi Haroon from \"BBC Urdu\" said, \"Teaching creative expressions like theatre play an important role in building confidence skills, enhancing leadership qualities and empowering empathy to children. Storytelling methods and techniques are very vital to teach a subject much more creatively to a student.\" The group have collaborated extensively with leading private as well as public educational institutions such as Lahore Grammar School, The City School, Beaconhouse School System, Beaconhouse National University, Institute of Business Administration, Karachi and non-for-profit organizations like Rabtt to promote theatre and literature in Pakistan.\n\nThe group have also worked with Justice Project Pakistan, a non-for-profit organization, campaigning to raise awareness on the fundamental rights of ordinary citizens living in Pakistan with a series of flash performances across the streets of Lahore.\n\nThe company members were featured in a documentary aired on the television show \"Kahani Pakistani\" of \"Voice of America Urdu\", hosted by Ayesha Gilani, where they talked about \"The importance of theatre and how the art of performing arts is a reflection of our lives in Pakistan.\" in January 2016. The company continues to offer several week-long workshops and classes to individuals who wish to excel in theatre production, performance and education; providing a platform for young aspiring Pakistani artists to excel in their creative pursuits.

{"id": "1789504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1789504", "title": "Indian art", "text": "Indian art\n\nIndian art consists of a variety of art forms, including plastic arts (e.g., pottery, sculpture), visual arts (e.g., paintings), performing arts and textile arts (e.g. woven silk). Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.\n\nThe origin of Indian art can be traced to pre-historic settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.\n\nIn historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.\nRock art of India includes rock relief carvings, engravings and paintings. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines. The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by Archibald Carlleyle, twelve years before the Cave of Altamira in Spain, although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899).\n\nDr. V. S. Wakankar discovered several painted rock shelters in Central India, situated around the Vindhya mountain range. Of these, the Bhimbetka rock shelters have been deemed a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The paintings in these sites commonly depicted scenes of human life alongside animals, and hunts with stone implements. Their style varied with region and age, but the most common characteristic was a red wash made using a powdered mineral called \"geru\", which is a form of Iron Oxide (Hematite).\n\nFor further details on the rock art of India, please see South Asian Stone Age.\n\nDespite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of dance. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols. The most famous piece is the bronze \"Dancing Girl\" of Mohenjo-Daro, which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.\n\nSeals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a yoga-like pose. This figure, sometimes known as a \"Pashupati\", has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.\n\nAfter the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era. It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.\n\nThe north Indian Maurya Empire flourished from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, and at its maximum extent controlled all of the sub-continent except the extreme south as well as influences from Indian ancient traditions, and Ancient Persia, as shown by the Pataliputra capital.\n\nThe emperor Ashoka, who died in 232 BCE, adopted Buddhism about half-way through his 40-year reign, and patronized several large stupas at key sites from the life of the Buddha, although very little decoration from the Mauryan period survives, and there may not have been much in the first place. There is more from various early sites of Indian rock-cut architecture. The most famous survivals are the large animals surmounting several of the Pillars of Ashoka, which showed a confident and boldly mature style and craft and first of its kind iron casting without rust until date, which was in use by vedic people in rural areas of the country, though we have very few remains showing its development. The famous detached Lion Capital of Ashoka, with four animals, was adopted as the official Emblem of India after Indian independence. Many small popular terracotta figurines are recovered in archaeology, in a range of often vigorous if somewhat crude styles.\n\nThe major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives after many Hindu, buddhist and jain temples destroyed by mughal rulers time to time. some key sites such as Sanchi, Bharhut and Amaravati, some of which remain \"in situ\", with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved toranas or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing. Mathura was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist. The facades and interiors of rock-cut \"chaitya\" prayer halls and monastic \"viharas\" have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at Ajanta, Karle, Bhaja and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and bodhisattvas, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.\n\nBuddhism developed an increasing emphasis on statues of the Buddha, which was greatly influenced by Hindu and Jain religious figurative art, The figures of this period which were also influenced by the Greco-Buddhist art of the centuries after the defeat of Alexander the Great. This fusion developed in the far north-west of India, especially Gandhara in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Indian Kushan Empire spread from Central Asia to include northern India in the early centuries CE, and briefly commissioned large statues that were portraits of the royal dynasty, Mughal miniature.\n\n\"Main article:\" Shunga Empire\n\nWith the fall of the Maurya Empire, control of India was returned to the older custom of regional dynasties, one of the most significant of which was the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) of central India. During this period, as well as during the Satavahana Dynasty which occurred concurrently with the Shunga Dynasty in south India, some of the most significant early Buddhist architecture was created. Arguably, the most significant architecture of this dynasty is the stupa, a religious monument which usually holds a sacred relic of Buddhism. These relics were often, but not always, in some way directly connected to the Buddha. Due to the fact that these stupas contained remains of the Buddha himself, each stupa was venerated as being an extension of the Buddha's body, his enlightenment, and of his achievement of nirvana. The way in which Buddhists venerate the stupa is by walking around it in a clockwise manner. \n\nOne of the most notable examples of the Buddhist stupa from the Shunga Dynasty is The Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was thought to be founded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE during the Maurya Empire. The Great Stupa was enlarged to its present diameter of 120 feet, covered with a stone casing, topped with a balcony and umbrella, and encircled with a stone railing during the Shunga Dynasty c. 150 BCE - 50 BCE. \n\n\"Main article: Satavahana Dynasty\"\nSatavahana dynasty was originally under the rule in central India, and after 1st century CE, in the south region. During Satavahana dynasty, a great number of significant Buddhist artworks were produced during this period. Stupas and temples are the most typical Buddhist architectures in this period. Stupas are religious monuments built on burial mounds, which contain relics beneath a solid dome. Stupas in different areas of India may vary in structure, size, and design; however, their representational meanings are quite similar. They are designed based on mandala, a graph of cosmos specific to Buddhism. A traditional stupa has a railing that provides a sacred path for Buddhist followers to practice devotional circumambulation in ritual settings. Also, ancient Indians considered caves as sacred places since they were habitants of holy men and monks. The Chaitya was constructed from a cave. \n\"Main article: Kushan Empire\"\n\nOfficially established by Kujula Kadphises, the first Kushan emperor who united the Yuezhi tribes, Kushan empire was a syncretic empire in central Asia. In this period, Kushan art inherited the Greco-Buddhist art, and the depictions of Buddha himself first appeared in art. Wearing a monk’s robe and a long length of cloth draped over the left shoulder and around the body, the Buddha was depicted with 32 major lakshanas (distinguishing marks), including a golden-colored body, an ushnisha (a protuberance) on the top of his head, heavy earrings, elongated earlobes, long arms, the impression of a chakra (wheel) on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, and the urna (a mark between his eyebrows). \n\nThe Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of north Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and Jain \"tirthankara\" figures, these last often on a very large scale. The two great centers of sculpture were Mathura and Gandhara, the latter the center of Greco-Buddhist art.\n\nAlthough the Gupta period marked the \"golden age\" of classical Hinduism, the early architectural style of Hindu temples were sophisticated and scientific in nature, consisting large courtyards, garbh grah, siting area, prayer area a large complex and well planned architecture. This is in stark contrast to the complex plans with multiple \"shikaras\" (towers) and \"mandapas\" (halls) of various utility as stated in veda outlining building of temples.\n\nInscriptions on the Pillars of Ashoka mention coexistence of the northern kingdoms with the triumvirate of Chola, Chera and Pandya Tamil dynasties, situated south of the Vindhya mountains. The medieval period witnessed the rise and fall of these kingdoms, in conjunction with other kingdoms in the area. It is during the decline and resurgence of these kingdoms that Hinduism was renewed. It fostered the construction of numerous temples and sculptures. \n\nThe Shore Temple at Mamallapuram constructed by the Pallavas symbolizes early Hindu architecture, with its monolithic rock relief and sculptures of Hindu deities. They were succeeded by Chola rulers who were prolific in their pursuit of the arts. The Great Living Chola Temples of this period are known for their maturity, grandeur and attention to detail, and have been recognized as a UNESCO Heritage Site. The Chola period is also known for its bronze sculptures, the lost-wax casting technique and fresco paintings. Thanks to the Hindu kings of the Chalukya dynasty, Jainism flourished alongside Islam evidenced by the fourth of the Badami cave temples being Jain instead of Vedic. The kingdoms of South India continued to rule their lands until the Muslim invasions that established sultanates there and destroyed much of the temples and marvel examples of architectures and sculptures\n\nRecognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Khajuraho group of monuments were constructed by the Chandela clan of the Rajput dynasties. Apart from the usual Hindu temples, 10% of the sculptures depict twisted bodies of men and women that shed light on the everyday socio-cultural and religious practices in Medieval India. Ever since their discovery, the degree of sexuality depicted in these sculptures has drawn both negative and positive criticism from scholars, ranging from \"the degeneration of the Hindu mind\"\n\nThe Khajuraho temples were in active use under Hindu kingdoms, until the establishment of the Delhi Sultanates of the 13th century. Under Muslim rule until the 18th century, many of Khajuraho's monuments were destroyed, but a few ruins still remain.\n\nAlthough Islamic footholds in India were made as early as the first half of the 10th century, it wasn't until the Mughal Empire that one observes emperors with a patronage for the fine arts. Emperor Humayun, during his reestablishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1555, brought with him Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad, two of the finest painters from Persian Shah Tahmasp's renowned atelier.\n\nDuring the reign of Akbar (1556—1605), the number of painters grew from around 30 during the creation of the \"Hamzanama\" in the mid-1560s, to around 130 by the mid 1590s. According to court historian Abu'l-Fazal, Akbar was hands-on in his interest of the arts, inspecting his painters regularly and rewarding the best. It is during this time that Persian artists were attracted to bringing their unique style to the empire. Indian elements were present in their works from the beginning, with the incorporation of local Indian flora and fauna that were otherwise absent from the traditional Persian style. The paintings of this time reflected the vibrancy and inclusion of Akbar's kingdom, with production of Persian miniatures, the Rajput paintings (including the Kangra school) and the Pahari style of Northern India. They also influenced the Company style watercolor paintings created during the British rule many years later.\n\nWith the death of Akbar, his son Jahangir (1605–1627) took the throne. He preferred each painter work on a single piece rather than the collaboration fostered during Akbar's time. This period marks the emergence of distinct individual styles, notably Bishan Das, Manohar Das, Abu al-Hasan, Govardhan, and Daulat. The \"Razmnama\" (Persian translation of the Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\") and an illustrated memoir of Jahangir, named \"Tuzuk-i Jahangiri\", were created under his rule. Jahangir was succeeded by Shah Jahan (1628–1658), whose most notable architectural contribution is the Taj Mahal. Paintings under his rule were more formal, featuring court scenes, in contrast to the personal styles from his predecessor's time. Aurangzeb (1658–1707), who held increasingly orthodox Sunni beliefs, forcibly took the throne from his father Shah Jahan. With a ban of music and painting in 1680, his reign saw the decline of Mughal patronage of the arts.\n\nMughal art influenced the Rajput, Pahari, Deccan, Kangra and various other local styles of art. \n\nIn South-Central India, during the late fifteenth century after the Middle kingdoms, the Bahmani sultanate disintegrated into the Deccan sultanates centered at Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar. They used vedic techniques of metal casting, stone carving, and painting, as well as a distinctive architectural style with the addition of citadels and tombs from Mughal architecture. For instance, the Baridi dynasty (1504–1619) of Bidar saw the invention of \"bidri\" ware, which was adopted from Vedic and Maurya period ashoka pillars of zinc mixed with copper, tin, and lead and inlaid with silver or brass, then covered with a mud paste containing sal ammoniac, which turned the base metal black, highlighting the color and sheen of the inlaid metal. Only after the Mughal conquest of Ahmadnagar in 1600 did the Persian influence patronized by the Turco-Mongol Mughals begin to affect Deccan art.\n\nBritish colonial rule had a great impact on Indian art. Old patrons of art became less wealthy and influential, and Western art more ubiquitous as the British Empire established schools of art in major cities, e.g. the Bombay Art Society in 1888. The Company style of paintings became common, created by Indian artists working for European patrons of the East India Company. The style was mainly Romanticized, with watercolor the primary medium used to convey soft textures and tones. By 1858, the British government took over the task of administration of India under the British Raj. The fusion of Indian traditions with European style at this time is evident from Raja Ravi Varma's oil paintings of sari-clad women in a graceful manner.\n\nWith the Swadeshi Movement gaining momentum by 1905, Indian artists attempted to resuscitate the cultural identities suppressed by the British, rejecting the Romanticized style of the Company paintings and the mannered work of Raja Ravi Varma and his followers. Thus was created what is known today as the Bengal School of Art, led by the reworked Asian styles (with an emphasis on Indian nationalism) of Abanindranath Tagore (1871—1951), who has been referred to as the father of Modern Indian art. Other artists of the Tagore family, such as Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) and Gaganendranath Tagore (1867–1938) as well as new artists of the early 20th century such as Amrita Sher-Gil (1913–1941) were responsible for introducing Avant-garde western styles into Indian Art. Many other artists like Jamini Roy and later S.H. Raza took inspiration from folk traditions. In 1944, K.C.S. Paniker founded the Progressive Painters' Association (PPA) thus giving rise to the \"madras movement\" in art.\n\nIn 1947, India became independent of British rule. A group of six artists - K. H. Ara, S. K. Bakre, H. A. Gade, M.F. Husain, S.H. Raza and Francis Newton Souza - founded the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group in the year 1952, to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, Manishi Dey, V. S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna, Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta, K. G. Subramanyan, A. Ramachandran, Devender Singh, Akbar Padamsee, John Wilkins, Himmat Shah and Manjit Bawa. Present-day Indian art is varied as it had been never before. Among the best-known artists of the newer generation include Bose Krishnamachari and Bikash Bhattacharya. Another prominent Pakistani modernist was Ismail Gulgee, who after about 1960 adopted an abstract idiom that combines aspects of Islamic calligraphy with an abstract expressionist (or gestural abstractionist) sensibility.\n\nPainting and sculpture remained important in the later half of the twentieth century, though in the work of leading artists such as Nalini Malani, Subodh Gupta, Narayanan Ramachandran, Vivan Sundaram, Jitish Kallat, they often found radical new directions. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.\n\nThe increase in discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, changed the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous; critics like Geeta Kapur, R. Siva Kumar,Shivaji K. Panikkar, Ranjit Hoskote, amongst others, contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India.\n\nThe year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the influential Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included Vivan Sundaram, Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, Bhupen Khakhar, and Nalini Malani—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition “Place for People”—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian R. Siva Kumar's benchmark exhibition and related publication, A Contextual Modernism, restored the Santiniketan artists—Rabindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee, and Ramkinkar Baij—to their proper place as the originators of an indigenously achieved yet transcultural modernism in the 1930s, well before the Progressives composed their manifesto in the late 1940s. Of the Santiniketan artists, Siva Kumar observed that they “reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity.”\n\nThe idea of Contextual Modernism emerged in 1997 from R. Siva Kumar's as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of an alternative modernism in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.\n\nSeveral terms including Paul Gilroy's \"counter culture of modernity\" and Tani Barlow's \"Colonial modernity\" have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because “the colonial in \"colonial modernity\" does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”\n\nAccording to R. Siva Kumar \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\" He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. \"This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice\".\n\n\"Contextual Modernism\" in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in Architecture.\n\nThe first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization (3300–1700 BC), found in sites at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in modern-day Pakistan. These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted. After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from Daimabad. Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of Ashoka from 270 to 232 BCE, and the Pillars of Ashoka he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive. Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all Sanchi; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood. Indeed, wood continued to be the main sculptural and architectural medium in Kerala throughout all historic periods until recent decades.\n\nDuring the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara from what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.\n\nThe pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture. The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (c. 320-550) which remains a \"classical\" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves, though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later. Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated lost wax bronzes of the Chola dynasty (c. 850–1250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of Shiva as Nataraja, with the massive granite carvings of Mahabalipuram dating from the previous Pallava dynasty.\nThe Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes. Among the existing specimens in the various museums of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi, Siva saints and many more.\n\nThe tradition and methods of Indian cliff painting gradually evolved throughout many thousands of years - there are multiple locations found with prehistoric art. The early caves included overhanging rock decorated with rock-cut art and the use of natural caves during the Mesolithic period (6000 BCE). Their use has continued in some areas into historic times. The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka are on the edge of the Deccan Plateau where deep erosion has left huge sandstone outcrops. The many caves and grottos found there contain primitive tools and decorative rock paintings that reflect the ancient tradition of human interaction with their landscape, an interaction that continues to this day.\n\nThe oldest surviving frescoes of the historical period have been preserved in the Ajanta Caves with Cave 10 having some from the 1st century CE, though the larger and more famous groups are from the 5th century. Despite climatic conditions that tend to work against the survival of older paintings, in total there are known more than 20 locations in India with paintings and traces of former paintings of ancient and early medieval times (up to the 8th to 10th centuries CE), although these are just a tiny fraction of what would have once existed. The most significant frescoes of the ancient and early medieval period are found in the Ajanta, Bagh, Ellora, and Sittanavasal caves, the last being Jain of the 7th-10th centuries. Although many show evidence of being by artists mainly used to decorating palaces, no early secular wall-paintings survive.\n\nThe Chola fresco paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, and are the first Chola specimens discovered. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. During the Nayak period the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescoes lying underneath have an ardent spirit of saivism is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great.\n\nKerala mural painting has well-preserved fresco or mural or wall painting in temple walls in Pundarikapuram, Ettumanoor and Aymanam and elsewhere.\n\nAlthough few Indian miniatures survive from before about 1000 CE, and some from the next few centuries, there was probably a considerable tradition. Those that survive are initially illustrations for Buddhist texts, later followed by Jain and Hindu equivalents, and the decline of Buddhist as well as the vulnerable support material of the palm-leaf manuscript probably explain the rarity of early examples.\n\nMughal painting in miniatures on paper developed very quickly in the late 16th century from the combined influence of the existing miniature tradition and artists trained in the Persian miniature tradition imported by the Mughal Emperor's court. New ingredients in the style were much greater realism, especially in portraits, and an interest in animals, plants and other aspects of the physical world.\n\nMiniatures either illustrated books or were single works for muraqqas or albums of painting and Islamic calligraphy. The style gradually spread in the next two centuries to influence painting on paper in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts, developing into a number of regional styles often called \"sub-Mughal\", including Kangra painting and Rajput painting, and finally Company painting, a hybrid watercolour style influenced by European art and largely patronized by the people of the British raj. From the 19th century Western-style easel paintings became increasingly painted by Indian artists trained in Government art schools.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years. Using jewellery as a store of capital remains more common in India than in most modern societies, and gold appears always to have been strongly preferred for the metal. India and the surrounding areas were important sources of high-quality gemstones, and the jewellery of the ruling class is typified by using them lavishly. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the people of the Indus Valley Civilization. Early remains are few, as they were not buried with their owners.\n\nWood was undoubtedly extremely important, but rarely survives long in the Indian climate. Organic animal materials such as ivory or bone were discouraged by the Dharmic religions, although Buddhist examples exist, such as the Begram ivories, many of Indian manufacture, but found in Afghanistan, and some relatively modern carved tusks. In Muslim settings they are more common.\n\nObscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the Harappans and the definite historic period starting with the Mauryas, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was Buddhism. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references. Soon after the Buddhists initiated rock-cut caves, Hindus and Jains started to imitate them at Badami, Aihole, Ellora, Salsette, Elephanta, Aurangabad and Mamallapuram and Mughals. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the iconography to match the religion commissioning them. Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations.\nBuddhist art first developed during the Gandhara period and Amaravati Periods around the 1st century BCE. It flourished greatly during the Gupta Periods and Pala Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the Pallava, Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagara Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well.\n\nThere is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in the 5th century, while rock-cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the Shore Temple, a part of the Mahabalipuram World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the Bay of Bengal with finely carved granite rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century.\n\nFolk and tribal art in India takes on different manifestations through varied media such as pottery, painting, metalwork, paper-art, weaving and designing of objects such as jewellery and toys. These are not just aesthetic objects but in fact have an important significance in people's lives and are tied to their beliefs and rituals. The objects can range from sculpture, masks (used in rituals and ceremonies), paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen objects, arms and weapons, and the human body itself (tattoos and piercings). There is a deep symbolic meaning that is attached to not only the objects themselves but also the materials and techniques used to produce them.\n\nOften puranic gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals, local heroes (mostly warriors) and local deities play a vital role in these arts (Example: Nakashi art from Telangana or Cherial Scroll Painting).\n\nFolk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads. This is the art of people who are exposed to changing landscapes as they travel over the valleys and highlands of India. They carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The rural, tribal and arts of the nomads constitute the matrix of folk expression. Examples of folk arts are Warli, Madhubani Art, Manjusha Art, Tikuli Art and Gond etc.\n\nWhile most tribes and traditional folk artist communities are assimilated into the familiar kind of civilised life, they still continue to practice their art. Unfortunately though, market and economic forces have ensured that the numbers of these artists are dwindling. A lot of effort is being made by various NGOs and the Government of India to preserve and protect these arts and to promote them. Several scholars in India and across the world have studied these arts and some valuable scholarship is available on them.\n\nThe folk spirit has a tremendous role to play in the development of art and in the overall consciousness of indigenous cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It divides the two mammary complexes that consist of two bodies of fatty pads, glandular tissues of mammary glands, connective tissues, and skin, as well as two duct systems (lactiferous duct of lymphatic vessel) and lobule alveoli emanating from two nipples. Lymph vessels can ventrally extend as far as the intermammary sulcus.\n\nThe International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA) uses the terms \"intermammary sulcus\" or \"intermammary cleft\" when referring to the area between the breasts not including the breasts. In popular usage the area is commonly referred to as a woman's cleavage, especially when exposed by garments with low necklines.\n\nFor legal purposes it was noted by the United States federal courts that \"anal cleft or cleavage\" and \"cleavage of the female breast\" are so imprecise as to provide no guidance in defining them. Medically, the \"width\" of a woman's cleavage is determined by the attachment points of her breast tissue to the periosteal tissue covering her sternum and is also defined somewhat by the medial attachments of the pectoralis major muscle when implants are in the sub-muscular position.\n\nPlastic surgeon Alan Matarasso said, \"Ergonomically speaking, cleavage equals the position of the breasts on the chest wall.\" The skin of the cleavage area is frailer than the skin of the face as it has fewer oil glands, and may show loss of elasticity sooner.\n\nPoikiloderma of Civatte, a condition of dilated blood vessels and red to red-brown spots, is common to the upper part of the cleavage, especially for those who wear a sports bra or push-up bra for prolonged periods, and commonly affects fair skinned middle-aged to elderly women.\n\nIt is characterized by hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, telangiectasias and superficial skin atrophy (occasional itching is reported), is another condition caused by long exposure to sunlight.\n\nIntermammary cleft can get attacked by plaque type psoriasis, which can in turn can cause erythematosus.\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a non-contagious chronic skin disease which affects intertriginous skin of apocrine sweat gland bearing areas like the inframammary fold and intermammary sulcus. It is characterized by clusters of abscesses, epidermoid cysts, sebaceous cysts, pilonidal cysts.\n\nPrurigo pigmentosa is a rare skin condition of unknown cause that affects depressed places on the chest and back like the intermammary area. It is characterized by the sudden onset of erythematous papules that leave a reticulated hyperpigmentation when they heal.\n\nPoikiloderma and Dermatoheliosis are treated by desquamation (skin peeling). There is no single effective treatment for HS. The recommended treatments include antibiotics, antiandrogens, corticosteroids, ciclosporins, and TNF inhibitors.\n"}

Its leader was Rosidor fils, and commonly, the company have therefore been referred to as simply \"The Rosidor Troupe\". The company performed both spoken drama, opera and ballet, and was regarded to have upheld a high quality. The performances were staged at the residences of the royal court, as well as in the Bollhuset in Stockholm.\n\nThe Great Northern War in 1700 caused financial difficulties for the court theater. The queen dowager would not allow the troupe to perform at court after the king had left to serve in the war. The king therefore gave permission to the \"Roi de Suede\" to perform at Bollhuset for the public in the city of Stockholm, and ordered the royal court to visit the performances there. From February 1700, they performed in public. Because of the language barrier, these were not a success among the majority of the public. They also arranged public masquerades with card gambling at Bollhuset, which evidently became popular, though also ill reputed. On at least one occasion, at Thorn in 1703, the troupe, or a part of it, traveled to perform for Charles XII during his war service.\n\nIn 1703, several of the members of the troupe left when the contract was no longer renewed because of costs. A smaller part of the troupe, however, remained, acquired a second contract in 1704, and continued the activity in Stockholm until the end term of the second contract in 1706.\n\n\n\n"}

More specifically, this term refers to a narrow-aisled, multilevel system of iron or steel shelving that evolved in the nineteenth century to meet increasing demands for storage space. An \"open-stack\" library allows its patrons to enter the stacks to browse for themselves; \"closed stacks\" means library staff retrieve books for patrons on request.\n\nFrench architect Henri Labrouste, shortly after making pioneering use of iron in the Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve of 1850, created a four story iron stack for the Bibliothèque nationale de France. In 1857, multilevel stacks with grated iron floors were installed in the British Library. In 1876, William R. Ware designed a stack for Gore Hall at Harvard University. In contrast to the structural relationship found in most buildings, the floors of these bookstacks did not support the shelving, but rather the reverse, the floors being attached to, and supported by, the shelving framework. Even the load of the building's roof, and of any non-shelving spaces above the stacks (such as offices), may be transmitted to the building's foundation through the shelving system itself. The building's external walls act as an envelope but provide no significant structural support.\n\nFor the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress, completed in 1897, Bernard Richardson Green made a number of alterations to the Gore Hall design, including the use of all-metal shelving. The contract was won by the Snead and Company Ironworks, which went on to install its standardized design in libraries around the country. Notable examples include the Widener Library at Harvard and the seven level stack supporting the Rose Reading Room of the New York Public Library.\n\nThe Library of Congress bookstacks were designed and patented by Bernard R. Green (1843-1914), the engineer in charge of the Library of Congress construction, where this type of book storage was first used. Although the structure was of cast iron, the shelves were made from strips of thin U section steel, designed to be as light as an equivalent pine shelf. The top surface of the U section was ground, polished and 'lacquered' (the constituents of the lacquer are not known). Green designed the stacks to be modular, able to be erected several stories high as a single freestanding structural entity incorporating staircases and floors, and even capable of supporting a roof structure. He designed the shelves so that they could adjust to book sizes using a simple lug system without the need for any bolts or fixings. Although the bookstacks were decorated and very simply embellished, they are of machine-age industrial design.\n\nStacks were typically envisioned for access by library staff fetching books for patrons waiting elsewhere, and so were often built in ways making them unsuitable for public access. Increasing concern with opening stacks to the public, the desire to construct buildings adaptable to changing uses, and concerns over the feasibility of storing truly comprehensive collections of books contributed to the decline of the Snead stack. Angus Snead Macdonald, president of the Snead Company from 1915 to 1952, himself advocated for the transition to modular, open plan libraries in the mid twentieth century.\n\nFor closed stacks, mobile shelving may be used to minimize floor space. With computerized indexing, filing by book size saves up to 40% space as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "2682331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2682331", "title": "Neoclassical architecture", "text": "Neoclassical architecture\n\nNeoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.\n\nIn form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings.\n\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as \"Classicism\" (), while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.\n\nIntellectually, neoclassicism was symptomatic of a desire to return to the perceived \"purity\" of the arts of Rome, to the more vague perception (\"ideal\") of Ancient Greek arts and, to a lesser extent, 16th-century Renaissance Classicism, which was also a source for academic Late Baroque architecture.\n\nMany early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to \"architecture parlante\".\n\nA return to more classical architectural forms as a reaction to the Rococo style can be detected in some European architecture of the earlier 18th century, most vividly represented in the Palladian architecture of Georgian Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe baroque style had never truly been to the English taste. Four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture: \"Vitruvius Britannicus\" (Colen Campbell 1715), \"Palladio's Four Books of Architecture\" (1715), \"De Re Aedificatoria\" (1726) and \"The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs\" (1727). The most popular was the four-volume \"Vitruvius Britannicus\" by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio. At first the book mainly featured the work of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. Palladian architecture became well established in 18th-century Britain.\nAt the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic \"architect earl\", Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington; in 1729, he and William Kent, designed Chiswick House. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism. In 1734 William Kent and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with Holkham Hall in Norfolk. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance.\n\nThis classicising vein was also detectable, to a lesser degree, in the Late Baroque architecture in Paris, such as in Perrault's east range of the Louvre. This shift was even visible in Rome at the redesigned façade for S. Giovanni in Laterano.\n\nBy the mid 18th century, the movement broadened to incorporate a greater range of Classical influences, including those from Ancient Greece. The shift to neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir William Hamilton's excavations at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of William Chambers and Robert Adam, was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. The style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia.\n\nAn early centre of neoclassicism was Italy, especially Naples, where by the 1730s, court architects such as Luigi Vanvitelli and Ferdinando Fuga were recovering classical, Palladian and Mannierist forms in their Baroque architecture (a similar aeathetic move can be seen in the later works of the Piedmontese court architect Filippo Juvarra in Turin). Following their lead, Giovanni Antonio Medrano began to build the first truly neoclassical structures in Italy in the 1730s. In the same period, Alessandro Pompei introduced neoclassicism to the Venetian Republic, building one of the first lapidariums in Europe in Verona, in the Doric style (1738). During the same period, neoclassical elements were introduced to Tuscany by architect Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey, the court architect of Francis Stephen of Lorraine. On Jadot's lead, an original neoclassical style was developed by Gaspare Paoletti, transforming Florence into the most important centre of neoclassicism in the peninsula. In the second half of the century, Neoclassicism flourished also in Turin, Milan (Giuseppe Piermarini) and Trieste (Matteo Pertsch). In the latter two cities, just as in Tuscany, the sober neoclassical style was linked to the reformism of the ruling Habsburg enlightened monarchs. Nevertheless, the Rococo style remained very much popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes, which brought a new archaeological classicism, embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.\n\nInternational neoclassical architecture was exemplified in Karl Friedrich Schinkel's buildings, especially the Old Museum in Berlin, Sir John Soane's Bank of England in London and the newly built White House and Capitol in Washington, D.C. of the nascent American Republic. The style was international.\n\nA second neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the Napoleonic Empire. In France, the first phase of neoclassicism was expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\", and the second in the styles called \"Directoire\" or Empire. \n\nIn the decorative arts, neoclassicism is exemplified in French furniture of the Empire style; the English furniture of Chippendale, George Hepplewhite and Robert Adam, Wedgwood's bas reliefs and \"black basaltes\" vases, and the Biedermeier furniture of Austria. The Scottish architect Charles Cameron created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born Catherine II the Great in St. Petersburg.\n\nIndoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of \"Le Antichità di Ercolano\" (\"The Antiquities of Herculaneum\"). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicising interiors of the Baroque, or the most \"Roman\" rooms of William Kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts.\n\nThe new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low frieze-like relief or painted in monotones \"en camaïeu\" (\"like cameos\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or \"bucrania\" or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \"Pompeiian red\" or pale tints, or stone colours. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the \"Goût grec\" (\"Greek style\"), not a court style; when Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \"Louis XVI\" style to court.\n\nHowever, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\".\n\nA new phase in neoclassical design was inaugurated by Robert and James Adam, who travelled in Italy and Dalmatia in the 1750s, observing the ruins of the classical world. On their return to Britain, they published a book entitled \"The Works in Architecture\" in installments between 1773 and 1779. This book of engraved designs made the \"Adam\" repertory available throughout Europe. The Adam brothers aimed to simplify the rococo and baroque styles which had been fashionable in the preceding decades, to bring what they felt to be a lighter and more elegant feel to Georgian houses. \"The Works in Architecture\" illustrated the main buildings the Adam brothers had worked on and crucially documented the interiors, furniture and fittings, designed by the Adams.\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism, the Greek Revival. There was little to no direct knowledge of Greek civilization before the middle of the 18th century in Western Europe, when an expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti in 1751 and led by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett began serious archaeological enquiry. Stuart was commissioned after his return from Greece by George Lyttelton to produce the first Greek building in England, the garden temple at Hagley Hall (1758–59). A number of British architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the Doric from their aristocratic patrons, including Joseph Bonomi and John Soane, but it was to remain the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century.\n\nSeen in its wider social context, Greek Revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in Britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the Act of Union, the Napoleonic Wars, and the clamour for political reform. It was to be William Wilkins's winning design for the public competition for Downing College, Cambridge that announced the Greek style was to be the dominant idiom in architecture. Wilkins and Robert Smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era, including the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (1808–09), the General Post Office (1824–1829) and the British Museum (1823–1848), Wilkins University College London (1826–1830) and the National Gallery (1832–1838). In Scotland, Thomas Hamilton (1784–1858), in collaboration with the artists Andrew Wilson (1780–1848) and Hugh William Williams (1773–1829) created monuments and buildings of international significance; the Burns Monument at Alloway (1818) and the (Royal) High School in Edinburgh (1823–1829).\n\nAt the same time the Empire style in France was a more grandiose wave of neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of Napoleon I in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, the Regency style in Britain, and the \"Napoleonstil\" in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\".\n\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in academic art through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to Romanticism or Gothic revivals—although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles. The centres of several European cities, notably St Petersburg and Munich, came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nHigh neoclassicism was an international movement. Though neoclassical architecture employed the same classical vocabulary as Late Baroque architecture, it tended to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections and recessions and their effects of light and shade were more flat; sculptural bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels. Its clearly articulated individual features were isolated rather than interpenetrating, autonomous and complete in themselves.\nNeoclassicism also influenced city planning; the ancient Romans had used a consolidated scheme for city planning for both defence and civil convenience, however, the roots of this scheme go back to even older civilizations. At its most basic, the grid system of streets, a central forum with city services, two main slightly wider boulevards, and the occasional diagonal street were characteristic of the very logical and orderly Roman design. Ancient façades and building layouts were oriented to these city design patterns and they tended to work in proportion with the importance of public buildings.\n\nMany of these urban planning patterns found their way into the first modern planned cities of the 18th century. Exceptional examples include Karlsruhe and Washington, D.C. Not all planned cities and planned neighbourhoods are designed on neoclassical principles, however. Opposing models may be found in Modernist designs exemplified by Brasília, the Garden city movement, levittowns, and new urbanism.\n\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, exploration and publication changed the course of British architecture towards a purer vision of the Ancient Greco-Roman ideal. James 'Athenian' Stuart's work \"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece\" was very influential in this regard, as were Robert Wood's \"Palmyra\" and \"Baalbec\". A combination of simple forms and high levels of enrichment was adopted by the majority of contemporary British architects and designers. The revolution begun by Stuart was soon to be eclipsed by the work of the Adam Brothers, James Wyatt, Sir William Chambers, George Dance, James Gandon and provincially based architects such as John Carr and Thomas Harrison of Chester.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the writings of Albert Richardson were responsible for a re-awakening of interest in pure neoclassical design. Vincent Harris (compare Harris's colonnaded and domed interior of Manchester Central Reference Library to the colonnaded and domed interior by John Carr and R R Duke), Bradshaw Gass & Hope and Percy Thomas were among those who designed public buildings in the neoclassical style in the interwar period. In the British Raj in India, Sir Edwin Lutyens' monumental city planning for New Delhi marked the sunset of neoclassicism.\nIn Scotland and the north of England, where the Gothic Revival was less strong, architects continued to develop the neoclassical style of William Henry Playfair. The works of Cuthbert Brodrick and Alexander Thomson show that by the end of the 19th century the results could be powerful and eccentric.\n\nThe first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the Louis Quinze style of architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel (Petit Trianon, 1762–68); the second phase, in the styles called Directoire and \"Empire\", might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe (designed in 1806). In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam, the second by those of Sir John Soane. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the \"Goût grec\" (\"Greek style\") not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1774 did Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, bring the Louis XVI style to court.\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism that is called the Greek Revival. Although several European cities — notably St Petersburg, Athens, Berlin and Munich — were transformed into veritable museums of Greek revival architecture, the Greek revival in France was never popular with either the State or the public.\n\nWhat little there was, started with Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's \"Barriere des Bonshommes\" (1785–89). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Laboustre's Neo-Grec of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece in 1832, the architecture of Greece was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first King of Greece, Otto I, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan. The Old Royal Palace was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, Theophil von Hansen and Ernst Ziller took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings. Theophil von Hansen designed his first building, the National Observatory of Athens and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called \"Athens Classical Trilogy\", namely the Academy of Athens (1859) and the National Library of Greece (1888), the third building of the trilogy being the National and Capodistrian University of Athens (1843), which was designed by his brother Christian Hansen. Also he designed the Zappeion Hall (1888). Ernst Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such the mansion of Heinrich Schliemann, Iliou Melathron (1880). The city of Nauplio is also an important example of Neoclassical Architecture along with the island of Poros.\n\nThe earliest examples of neoclassical architecture in Hungary may be found in Vác. In this town the triumphal arch and the neoclassical façade of the baroque Cathedral were designed by the French architect Isidor Marcellus Amandus Ganneval (Isidore Canevale) in the 1760s. Also the work of a French architect Charles Moreau is the garden façade of the Esterházy Palace (1797–1805) in Kismarton (today Eisenstadt in Austria). The two principal architect of Neoclassicism in Hungary was Mihály Pollack and József Hild. Pollack's major work is the Hungarian National Museum (1837–1844). Hild is famous for his designs for the Cathedral of Eger and Esztergom. The Reformed Great Church of Debrecen is an outstanding example of the many Protestant churches that were built in the first half of the 19th century. This was the time of the first iron structures in Hungarian architecture, the most important of which is the Chain Bridge (Budapest) by William Tierney Clark.\n\nNeoclassical architecture was introduced in Malta in the late 18th century, during the final years of Hospitaller rule. Early examples include the Bibliotheca (1786), the De Rohan Arch (1798) and the Hompesch Gate (1801). However, neoclassical architecture only became popular in Malta following the establishment of British rule in the early 19th century. In 1814, a neoclassical portico decorated with the British coat of arms was added to the Main Guard building so as to serve as a symbol of British Malta. Other 19th century neoclassical buildings include the Monument to Sir Alexander Ball (1810), RNH Bighi (1832), St Paul's Pro-Cathedral (1844), the Rotunda of Mosta (1860) and the now-destroyed Royal Opera House (1866).\n\nNeoclassicism gave way to other architectural styles by the late 19th century. Few buildings were built in the neoclassical style during the 20th century, such as the Domvs Romana museum (1922), and the Courts of Justice building in Valletta (1965–71).\n\nThe centre of Polish Neoclassicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski. Vilnius University was another important centre of the Neoclassical architecture in Europe, led by notable professors of architecture Marcin Knackfus, Laurynas Gucevicius and Karol Podczaszyński. The style was expressed in the shape of main public buildings, such as the University's Observatory, Vilnius Cathedral and the town hall.\n\nThe best-known architects and artists, who worked in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were Dominik Merlini, Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer, Szymon Bogumił Zug, Jakub Kubicki, Antonio Corazzi, Efraim Szreger, Chrystian Piotr Aigner and Bertel Thorvaldsen.\n\nIn the Russian Empire at the end of the 19th century, neoclassical architecture was equal to Saint Petersburg architecture because this style was specific for a huge number of buildings in the city.\n\nIn the Soviet Union (1917–1991), neoclassical architecture was very popular among the political elite, as it effectively expressed state power and a vast array of neoclassical building was erected all over the country.\n\nSoviet neoclassical architecture was exported to other socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, as a gift from the Soviet Union. Examples of this include the Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw, Poland and the Shanghai International Convention Center in Shanghai, China.\n\nSpanish Neoclassicism was exemplified by the work of Juan de Villanueva, who adapted Burke's theories of beauty and the sublime to the requirements of Spanish climate and history. He built the Prado Museum, that combined three functions — an academy, an auditorium and a museum — in one building with three separate entrances.\n\nThis was part of the ambitious program of Charles III, who intended to make Madrid the Capital of the Arts and Sciences. Very close to the museum, Villanueva built the Astronomical Observatory. He also designed several summer houses for the kings in El Escorial and Aranjuez and reconstructed the Major Square of Madrid, among other important works. Villanueva´s pupils expanded the Neoclassical style in Spain.\n\nNeoclassical architecture was the preferred style by the leaders of the National Socialist movement in the Third Reich, especially admired by Adolf Hitler himself. Hitler commissioned his favourite architect, Albert Speer, to plan a re-design of Berlin as a city comprising imposing neoclassical structures, which would be renamed as Welthauptstadt Germania, the centrepiece of Hitler's Thousand Year Reich.\n\nThese plans never came to fruition due to the eventual downfall of Nazi Germany and the suicide of its leader.\n\nIn the new republic, Robert Adam's neoclassical manner was adapted for the local late 18th and early 19th-century style, called \"Federal architecture\". One of the pioneers of this style was English-born Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who is often noted as one of the first formally trained America's professional architects and the father of American architecture. The Baltimore Basilica, the first Roman Catholic cathedral in the United States, is considered by many experts to be Latrobe's masterpiece.\n\nThe widespread use of neoclassicism in American architecture, as well as by French revolutionary regimes, and the general tenor of rationalism associated with the movement, all created a link between neoclassicism and republicanism and radicalism in much of Europe. The Gothic Revival can be seen as an attempt to present a monarchist and conservative alternative to neoclassicism.\n\nIn later 19th-century American architecture, neoclassicism was one expression of the American Renaissance movement, \"ca\" 1880–1917. Its last manifestation was in Beaux-Arts architecture (1885–1920), and its very last, large public projects in the United States include the Lincoln Memorial (1922), the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. (1937), and the American Museum of Natural History's Roosevelt Memorial (1936).\n\nToday, there is a small revival of Classical Architecture as evidenced by the groups such as The Institute of Classical Architecture and Classical America. The School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame, currently teaches a fully Classical curriculum.\n\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), neoclassicism has seen somewhat of a resurgence. This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. \nWhile some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully. Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.\n\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism/Revivalism, Traditionalism or simply \"neoclassical architecture\" like the historical style. For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term Traditional Architecture (or \"vernacular\") is mostly used. The Driehaus Architecture Prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize.\n\nIn the United States various contemporary public buildings are built in neoclassical style, with the 2006 Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville being an example.\n\nIn Britain a number of architects are active in the neoclassical style. Two new university Libraries, Quinlan Terry's Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College and ADAM Architecture's Sackler Library illustrate that the approach taken can range from the traditional, in the former case, to the unconventional, in the latter case. Recently, Prince Charles came under controversy for promoting a classically designed development on the land of the former Chelsea Barracks in London. Writing to the Qatari Royal family (who were funding the development through the property development company Qatari Diar) he condemned the accepted modernist plans, instead advocating a classical approach. His appeal was met with success and the plans were withdrawn. A new design by architecture firm Dixon Jones is currently being drafted.\n\n\n\n"}

The company's first product was the Tintenkuli, a stylographic pen—a fountain pen with a narrow steel tube instead of a conventional nib. While stylographic pens were already common in America and in fact pre-dated conventional fountain pens, they had not been previously marketed in Europe, and Rotring would eventually become the name associated with such pens throughout the world.\n\n\"Rot ring\" directly translates to red ring - which is still placed around the barrel of their pens today. The company's name was changed to Rotring in the early 70s to match the trademark.\n\nAlthough stylographs never overtook fountain pens for use in writing, by 1953 the Rotring \"Rapidograph\" became the prototypical technical pen of its age. Its technology virtually replaced the ruling pen and greatly simplified technical drawing. Rapidographs are still made today, both by Rotring and by Koh-i-Noor, its US subsidiary.\n\nThe advent in the 1990s of computer-aided design (CAD) saw the partial demise of the technical drawing pen. To combat this, Rotring diversified its range of graphic pens, pencils and markers.\n\nIn 1998 Rotring was taken over by Sanford, an American company specialising in graphic products and part of Newell Rubbermaid Inc. since 1992 \n\n"}

{"id": "51237904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51237904", "title": "Signum manus", "text": "Signum manus\n\nSignum manus (sometimes also known as \"Chrismon\") refers to the medieval practice, current from the Merovingian period until the 14th century in the Frankish Empire and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of monogram or royal cypher.\n\nThe term \"Chrismon\" was introduced in New Latin specifically as a term for the Chi Rho monogram. As this symbol was used in Merovingian documents at the starting point of what would diversify into the tradition of \"cross-signatures\", German scholarship of the 18th century extended use of the term \"Chrismon\" to the entire field. In medievalist paleography and \"Diplomatik\" (\"ars diplomaticae\", i.e. the study of documents or charters), the study of these signatures or sigils was known as \"Chrismologia\" or \"Chrismenlehre\", while the study of cross variants was known as \"Staurologia\".\n\n\"Chrismon\" in this context may refer to the Merovingian period abbreviation \"I. C. N.\" for \"in Christi nomine\", later (in the Carolingian period) also \"I. C.\" for \"in Christo\", and still later (in the high medieval period) just \"C.\" for \"Christus\".\n\nA cross symbol was often drawn as an invocation at the beginning of documents in the early medieval West. \nAt the end of documents, commissioners or witnesses would sign with a \"signum manus\", often also in the form of a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian documents of the 7th and 8th centuries. A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the \"signum manus\" of the moneyer.\nThe tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were \"box\" monograms. The first \"cruciform\" monogram was used by Justinian I in the 560s. Tiberius III used a cruciform monogram with the letters \"R, M\" for Rome and \"T, B\" for Tiberius; Pope Gregory III used the letters \"G, R, E, O\". \n\nThe earliest surviving Merovingian royal charters, dating to the 7th century, have the box monograms of Chlothar II and Clovis II. Later in the 7th century, the use of royal monograms was abandoned entirely by the Merovingian kings; instead, royal wax seals were first attached to the documents, and the kings would sign their name in full.\n\nThe \"signum manus\" in the form of a modified cross symbol first appears in charters of both Frankish Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th and early 8th century. Charlemagne first used his cruciform monogram, likely inspired by the earlier papal monograms, in 769, and he would continue to use it for the rest of his reign. The monogram spells \"KAROLVS\", with the \nconsonants \"K, R, L, S\" at the ends of the cross-arms, and the vowels \"A, O, V\" displayed in ligature at the center. \nLouis the Pious abandoned the cross monogram, using again a H-type or box monogram.\n\n\n"}

The artists taking on the roles of Kennedy, his wife Jacqueline, and others, rehearsed extensively to ensure verisimilitude, and when they performed the reenactment, it was executed with a striking attention to detail.

Uthco's Jody Procter in his role as a Secret Service agent tells a camera, \"We've always been worried about Dallas–it's a rough city, a gun city\"), ultimately the video shows that the sacred images of the assassination cannot be mocked.

That first year featured Maya Angelou, Toni Cade Bambara, Ruth Stone, Alice Walker, and Ruth Whitman. Since then, it has become the longest-running annual festival of women writers in the nation, showcasing the talents and issues addressed by established and emerging authors.\n\nUK History faculty Nancy Dye had suggested using surplus funds from Undergraduate Studies to bring women writers to campus. A 16-member committee from the departments of English, Honors, Undergraduate Studies, and Special Collections, along with members of the Lexington community, produced the conference. In 1984–1985 the conference was directed by UK English faculty Jane Gentry Vance, who later served as Kentucky's Poet Laureate.\n\nIn 1985–1993, the conference was affiliated with Continuing Education for Women/University Extension and directed by Betty Gabehart. As the conference's longest-running director, Gabehart made significant contributions to its enduring legacy and stability, establishing much of the reputation it enjoys today. In 1994–1996, the conference was affiliated with the Women's Studies Program and directed by Jan Oaks, faculty in English and Gender and Women's Studies. In 1997, former Conference assistant Patti DeYoung served as director.\n\nIn 1998 the conference lost university funding when it was unable to find a sponsoring department, and its advisory board established itself as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Its new home became the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning in downtown Lexington, and it was renamed the Kentucky Women Writers Conference. Its director during those years, 1998–2002, was Jan Isenhour, also director of the Carnegie Center, and its work was carried out by a volunteer board.\n\nIn 2002 President Lee Todd reinstated support for the conference to demonstrate the university's commitment to women's programming and community events. Since then, the Conference leadership has continued cultivating wide community support through many partnerships and the committed efforts of its board and volunteers. UK provides staff salaries, office space, and the majority of KWWC's operating expenses. Financial support from the Kentucky Foundation for Women, LexArts, the Kentucky Arts Council, the Kentucky Humanities Council, businesses, and individual patrons remains critical to our ability to attract writers of the highest caliber.\n\nDirectors since then have been Brenda Weber (2003) and Rebecca Gayle Howell (2004–06). Howell launched several free community events that have become signature offerings of the conference, including the Gypsy Slam, the Sonia Sanchez Series, and the Hardwick/Jones keynote reading on mentorship and collaboration. In 2007, Julie Kuzneski Wrinn became Conference director. The 38th annual conference will be held September 15-16, 2017 in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\n"}
