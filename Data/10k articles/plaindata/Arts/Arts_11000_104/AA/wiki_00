The AACM is devoted \"to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,\" according to its charter. It supports and encourages jazz performers, composers and educators. Although founded in the jazz tradition, the group's outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, \"touched nearly all corners of modern music.\"\n\nBy the 1960s jazz music was losing ground to rock music and the founders of the AACM felt that a proactive group of musicians would add creativity and outlet for new music. The AACM was formed in May 1965 by a group of musicians centered on pianist Muhal Richard Abrams who had organized an Experimental Band since 1962. The musicians were generally steadfast in their commitment to their music, despite a lack of performance venues and sometimes indifferent audiences. From 1969 the AACM organised a music education program for inner-city youths. In the 1960s and 1970s AACM members were among the most important and innovative in all of jazz, though the AACM's contemporary influence has waned some in recent years. Many AACM members have recorded widely: in the early days on the Delmark Records Avant Garde Jazz series and later on the Black Saint/Soul Note and India Navigation labels, and to a lesser extent on the Arista Records and ECM labels.\n\nThe musical endeavors of members of the AACM often include an adventurous mixing of avant-garde jazz, classical, and world music. The AACM also ran a school, The AACM School of Music, with classes in all areas taught by members of the AACM. The AACM also had a strong relationship with an influential sister organization, the Black Artists' Group (BAG) of St. Louis, Missouri. The AACM has received aid from the MacArthur Foundation and has a strong relationship with Columbia College. \"A Power Stronger Than Itself: The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians\" by George Lewis, has been published by the University of Chicago Press (May 2008).\n\nIn 2015, a 50-year retrospective exhibition of art, music and group-related artifacts, entitled, \"Free at First\", was held at the DuSable Museum of African American History.\n\nThe AACM has been on the forefront of the avant-garde since its inception in 1965. Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago pushed the boundaries of jazz and challenged the avant-garde classical movement led by John Cage. Concerts were heavily improvised, and many AACM members created scores that blended music, geometry, painting, and ciphers to be interpreted by the performers live. The AACM was part of an artistic movement on the South Side of Chicago that included AFRICobra (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) and other collectives.\n\n\n"}

None of the three women is who they appear to be: each has an ulterior motive.\n\nThey kidnap a gangster called Gage and try to force him to reveal where the treasure is buried. He refuses, believing they will kill him anyway, but Hel promises he will not be harmed. Camero shoots him, against the wishes of Hel, saying she made no such promise. His phone rings, and they believe Gage is connected to Pinky.\n\nThings become more complicated when a police officer named Deputy Fuchs arrives. Unknown to them, he was in the audience five nights ago when Trixie performed as a stripper to seduce Gage. However, the three women hide the body and are able to convince Fuchs to leave. While digging for the treasure, Camero asks the girls about the best sex each has ever had, believing the answer tells her something important about their character. She admits her best sex ever was with a circus contortionist, although she did not even know the contortionist's name.\n\nDuring a water fight, Trixie falls onto something in the sand. They dig; however, instead of buried treasure they find the dead body of one of Hel's contacts. Trixie goes into the trailer to collect herself as Hel follows her to check on her, only for Trixie to seduce Hel into kissing her, which leads to them having sex until Camero catches them in the act. They are interrupted by Hot Wire and his girlfriend Kinki, whom Camero is familiar with. At gunpoint, the two abuse the women and force them to dig for the buried treasure. Deputy Fuchs returns and attempts to save the women, but instead creates a gunfight, which Hel ends with a high-powered machine gun found in the nearby trailer.\n\nCamero asks the meaning of the code Hel uses on the bunker \"75650\". \nAt closer inspection it appears that the number 1 is associated with the letter A, 2 with BCD, 3 with E, 4 is with FGH, 5 is with IJK, 6 is with LMN, 7 is with OPQ, 8 is with RST, 9 is with UVW and 0 is with XYZ.\nWith this info the code numbers spell \"PINKY\" \nHel and Trixie find a concealed bunker full of goods stolen from Pinky, including a mysterious weapon, diamonds, and a beautiful sword, which Trixie takes. Camero, believing she is in the midst of a double-cross, fights Hel for the diamonds. Camero overcomes Hel and sets Trixie afire along with barrels of flammable liquids. Camero leaves Hel in chains while she attempts to drive away with the diamonds; however, Hel quickly uses the super-machine gun to free herself, and fires a rocket that destroys the car Camero was driving.\n\nHel admits to Trixie that she is a secret agent who reports to a man named Phoenix, and that she is on a mission to retrieve the weapon they found in Pinky's lair. Camero returns and again fights Hel. After she beats Hel to the ground, Camero assumes she is dead and moves to kill Trixie. As Trixie will not fight back, Camero attempts to rape her, but stops when she sees a tattoo and realizes Trixie was the mysterious contortionist from her past. Before she can kill Trixie, Camero is shot in the back and killed by Deputy Fuchs, who managed to survive the explosion. However, instead of thanking him, Trixie kills Fuchs using a hidden throwing star. Hel awakens, having survived Camero's attack. Trixie then reveals that she, in fact, is Pinky, and concocted the entire plot to retrieve the sword she took from Gage's bunker, which he had taken from her six months previously.\n\n\nJohn R. Graham composed the musical score and the CD was released in 2009; featuring 29 songs. The film also features songs by AM Conspiracy, Rebel Vengeance and Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on January 8, 2010 in theaters and video-on-demand. It received a limited run of three weeks in three theaters and closed January 21.\nThe film grossed $17,365 at the domestic (US and Canada) box office and $199,436 foreign.\n\nAn unrated DVD was released on March 2, 2010 in the United States.\n\nMetacritic gave the film a score of 19% based on a weighted average of 5 reviews, indicating \"Overwhelming dislike\" from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 31% based on 16 reviews, where ratings below 60% are considered \"Rotten\".\n\nIn \"Daily Variety\", IM Global's Stuart Ford described \"Bitch Slap\" as \"a pure exploitation pic — chicks, boobs, guns and bad guys, in that order\". In \"Variety\", Joe Leydon wrote \"Overblown and underwhelming, 'Bitch Slap' is a desperately unfunny attempt to satirically recycle cliches and archetypes from sexploitation actioners of the 1960s and '70s.\" Amy Biancolli of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote \"The idea is to amuse anyone who's not offended by all the over-baked violence, bad acting and slapping babeage, but it's so heavy-handed and hyper-stylized that any extant wit gets smacked into submission. It's just not any fun.\" Mark Olsen in the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that, \"Despite its obsession with décolletage, \"Bitch Slap\" is surprisingly puritanical (much teasing, no pleasing).\"\n\nThe film is described as \"a post-modern, thinking man's throwback to the 'B' Movie/Exploitation films of the 1950s–70s as well as a loving, sly parody of the same\". The film is inspired by the \"Dragstrip Girl\", \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\", \"Kung Fu Nun\", the pantheon of blaxploitation and other exploitation films which had a renewal in popularity after the cult success of \"Grindhouse\" in 2007.\n\n"}

{"id": "734019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=734019", "title": "Chanel", "text": "Chanel\n\nChanel S.A. (; ) is a French, privately held company owned by Alain Wertheimer and Gérard Wertheimer, grandsons of Pierre Wertheimer, who was an early business partner of the \"couturière\" Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel. Chanel S.A. is a high fashion house that specializes only in women's haute couture and ready-to-wear clothes, luxury goods, and fashion accessories. In her youth, Gabrielle Chanel gained the nickname \"Coco\" from her time as a chanteuse. As a fashion designer, Coco Chanel catered to women's taste for elegance in dress, with blouses and suits, trousers and dresses, and jewellery (gemstone and bijouterie) of simple design, that replaced the opulent, over-designed, and constrictive clothes and accessories of 19th-century fashion. The Chanel product brands have been personified by fashion models and actresses, including Inès de La Fressange, Catherine Deneuve, Carole Bouquet, Vanessa Paradis, Nicole Kidman, Anna Mouglalis, Audrey Tautou, Keira Knightley, Kristen Stewart and Marilyn Monroe.\n\nThe House of Chanel is known for the \"little black dress\", the perfume No. 5 de Chanel, and the Chanel Suit. Chanel's use of jersey fabric produced garments that were comfortable and affordable. Chanel revolutionized fashion — high fashion (haute couture) and everyday fashion (prêt-à-porter) — by replacing structured-silhouettes, based upon the corset and the bodice, with garments that were functional and at the same time flattering to the woman's figure.\n\nIn the 1920s, the simple-line designs of Chanel couture made popular the \"flat-chested\" fashions that were the opposite of the hourglass-figure achieved by the fashions of the late 19th century — the Belle Époque of France (ca. 1890–1914), and the British Edwardian era (ca. 1901–1919). Chanel used colors traditionally associated with masculinity in Europe, such as grey and navy blue, to denote feminine boldness of character. The clothes of the House of Chanel featured quilted fabric and leather trimmings; the quilted construction reinforces the fabric, the design, and the finish, producing a garment that maintains its form and function while being worn. An example of such haute couture techniques is the woolen Chanel suit — a knee-length skirt and a cardigan-style jacket, trimmed and decorated with black embroidery and gold-coloured buttons. The complementary accessories were two-tone pump shoes and jewellry, usually a necklace of pearls, and a leather handbag.\n\n\nThe House of Chanel (Chanel S.A.) originated in 1909 when Gabrielle Chanel opened a millinery shop at 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, the ground floor of the Parisian flat of the socialite and textile businessman Étienne Balsan, of whom she was the mistress. Because the Balsan flat also was a salon for the French hunting and sporting élite, Chanel had the opportunity to meet their \"demi-mondaine\" mistresses, who, as such, were women of fashion, upon whom the rich men displayed their wealth — as ornate clothes, jewelry, and hats.\n\nCoco Chanel thus could sell to them the hats she designed and made; she thus earned a living, independent of her financial sponsor, the socialite Balsan. In the course of those salons Coco Chanel befriended Arthur 'Boy' Capel, an English socialite and polo player friend of Étienne Balsan; per the upper class social custom, Chanel also became mistress to Boy Capel. Despite that social circumstance, Boy Capel perceived the businesswoman innate to Coco Chanel, and, in 1910, financed her first independent millinery shop, \"Chanel Modes\", at 21 rue Cambon, Paris. Because that locale already housed a dress shop, the business-lease limited Chanel to selling only millinery products, not couture. Two years later, in 1913, the Deauville and Biarritz couture shops of Coco Chanel offered for sale \"prêt-à-porter\" sports clothes for women, the practical designs of which allowed the wearer to play sport.\n\nThe First World War (1914–18) affected European fashion through scarcity of materials, and the mobilisation of women. By that time, Chanel had opened a large dress shop at 31 rue Cambon, near the Hôtel Ritz, in Paris; among the clothes for sale were flannel blazers, straight-line skirts of linen, sailor blouses, long sweaters made of jersey fabric, and skirt-and-jacket suits.\n\nCoco Chanel used jersey cloth because of its physical properties as a garment, such as its drape — how it falls upon and falls from the body of the woman — and how well it adapted to a simple garment-design. Sartorially, some of Chanel's designs derived from the military uniforms made prevalent by the War; and, by 1915, the designs and the clothes produced by the House of Chanel were known throughout France.\n\nIn 1915 and in 1917, \"Harper's Bazaar\" magazine reported that the garments of the House of Chanel were \"on the list of every buyer\" for the clothing factories of Europe. The Chanel dress shop at 31 rue Cambon presented day-wear dress-and-coat ensembles of simple design, and black evening dresses trimmed with lace; and tulle-fabric dresses decorated with jet, a minor gemstone material.\n\nAfter the First World War, the House of Chanel, following the fashion trends of the 1920s, produced beaded dresses, made especially popular by the Flapper woman. By 1920, Chanel had designed and presented a woman's suit of clothes — composed either of two garments or of three garments — which allowed a woman to have a modern, feminine appearance, whilst being comfortable and practical to maintain; advocated as the \"new uniform for afternoon and evening\", it became known as the Chanel Suit.\n\nIn 1921, to complement the suit of clothes, Coco Chanel commissioned the perfumer Ernest Beaux to create a perfume for the House of Chanel, his perfumes included the perfume No.5, named after the number of the sample Chanel liked best. Originally, a bottle of No. 5 de Chanel was a gift to clients of Chanel. The popularity of the perfume prompted the House of Chanel to offer it for retail sale in 1922.\n\nIn 1923, to explain the success of her clothes, Coco Chanel told \"Harper's Bazaar\" magazine that design \"simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.\"\n\nThe success of the No. 5 encouraged Coco Chanel to expand perfume sales beyond France and Europe and to develop other perfumes — for which she required investment capital, business acumen, and access to the North American market. To that end, the businessman Théophile Bader (founder of Galeries Lafayette) introduced the venture capitalist Pierre Wertheimer to Coco Chanel. Their business deal established the Parfums Chanel company, a \"parfumerie\" of which Wertheimer owned 70 per cent, Bader owned 20 per cent, and Chanel owned 10 per cent; commercial success of the joint enterprise was assured by the Chanel name, and by the cachet of la \"Maison Chanel\", which remained the sole business province of Coco Chanel.\n\nNonetheless, despite the success of the Chanel couture and \"parfumerie\", the personal relations between Coco and her capitalist partner deteriorated, because, Coco said that Pierre Wertheimer was exploiting her talents as a fashion designer and as a businesswoman. Wertheimer reminded Chanel that he had made her a very rich woman; and that his venture capital had funded Chanel's productive expansion of the \"parfumerie\" which created the wealth they enjoyed, all from the success of No. 5 de Chanel.\n\nNevertheless, unsatisfied, the businesswoman Gabrielle Chanel hired the attorney René de Chambrun to renegotiate the 10-per-cent partnership she entered, in 1924, with the Parfums Chanel company; the lawyer-to-lawyer negotiations failed, and the partnership-percentages remained as established in the original business deal among Wertheimer, Badel, and Chanel.\n\nFrom the gamine fashions of the 1920s, Coco Chanel had progressed to womanly fashions in the 1930s: evening-dress designs were characterised by an elongated feminine style, and summer dresses featured contrasts such as silver eyelets, and shoulder straps decorated with rhinestones - drawing from Renaissance-time fashion stylings. In 1932, Chanel presented an exhibition of jewelry dedicated to the diamond as a fashion accessory; it featured the \"Comet\" and \"Fountain\" necklaces of diamonds, which were of such original design, that Chanel S.A. re-presented them in 1993. Moreover, by 1937, the House of Chanel had expanded the range of its clothes to more women and presented \"prêt-à-porter\" clothes designed and cut for the petite woman. Among fashion designers, only the clothes created by Elsa Schiaparelli could compete with the clothes of Chanel.\nDuring the Second World War (1939–45), Coco Chanel closed shop at Maison Chanel — leaving only jewellry and \"parfumerie\" for sale — and moved to the Hôtel Ritz Paris, where she lived with her boyfriend, Hans Günther von Dincklage, a Nazi intelligence officer. Upon conquering France in June 1940, the Nazis established a Parisian occupation-headquarters in the Hôtel Meurice, on the rue de la Rivoli, opposite the Louvre Museum, and just around the corner from the fashionable Maison Chanel S.A., at 31 rue Cambon.\n\nMeanwhile, because of the Nazi occupation's official anti-Semitism, Pierre Wertheimer and family, had fled France to the U.S., in mid-1940. Later, in 1941, Coco Chanel attempted to assume business control of Parfums Chanel but was thwarted by an administrative delegation that disallowed her sole disposition of the \"parfumerie\". Having foreseen the Nazi occupation policy of the seizure-and-expropriation to Germany of Jewish business and assets in France, Pierre Wertheimer, the majority partner, had earlier, in May 1940, designated Felix Amiot, a Christian French industrialist, as the \"Aryan\" proxy whose legal control of the Parfums Chanel business proved politically acceptable to the Nazis, who then allowed the perfume company to continue as an operating business.\n\nOccupied France abounded with rumours that Coco Chanel was a Nazi collaborator; her clandestine identity was secret agent 7124 of the Abwehr, code-named \"Westminster\". As such, by order of General Walter Schellenberg, of the \"Sicherheitsdienst\", Chanel was despatched to London on a mission to communicate to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill the particulars of a \"separate peace\" plan proposed by \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler, who sought to avoid surrendering to the Red Army of the Soviet Russians.\n\nAt War's end, upon the Allied liberation of France, Chanel was arrested for having collaborated with the Nazis. In September 1944, the Free French Purge Committee, the \"épuration\", summoned Chanel for interrogation about her collaborationism, yet, without documentary evidence of or witnesses to her collaboration with the Nazis, and because of Churchill's secret intervention in her behalf, the \"épuration\" released Coco Chanel from arrest as a traitor to France. Despite having been freed by the political grace of Churchill, the strength of the rumours of Chanel's Nazi collaboration had made it not possible for her to remain in France; so Coco Chanel and her German lover, Hans Günther von Dincklage, went into an eight-year exile to Switzerland.\n\nIn the post–war period, during Coco Chanel's Swiss exile from France, Pierre Wertheimer returned to Paris and regained formal administrative control of his family's business holdings — including control of Parfums Chanel, the \"parfumerie\" established with his venture capital, and successful because of the Chanel name.\n\nIn Switzerland, the news revived Coco Chanel's resentment at having been exploited by her business partner, for only ten per cent of the money. So she established a rival Swiss \"parfumerie\" to create, produce, and sell \"her\" \"Chanel perfumes\". In turn, Wertheimer, the majority capital stock owner of Parfums Chanel, saw his business interests threatened, and his commercial rights infringed because he did not possess legally exclusive rights to the Chanel name. Nonetheless, Wertheimer avoided a trademark infringement lawsuit against Coco Chanel, lest it damages the commercial reputation and the artistic credibility of \"his\" Chanel-brand \"parfumerie\".\n\nWisely, Pierre Wertheimer settled his business- and commercial-rights quarrel with Chanel, and, in May 1947, they renegotiated the 1924 contract that had established Parfums Chanel — she was paid $400,000 in cash (wartime profits from the sales of perfume No. 5 de Chanel); assigned a 2.0 per cent running royalty from the sales of No. 5 \"parfumerie\"; assigned limited commercial rights to sell \"her\" \"Chanel perfumes\" in Switzerland; and granted a perpetual monthly stipend that paid all of her expenses. In exchange, Gabrielle Chanel closed her Swiss \"parfumerie\" enterprise, and sold to Parfums Chanel the full rights to the name \"Coco Chanel\".\n\nIn 1953, upon returning to France from Switzerland, Coco Chanel found the fashion business enamoured of the \"New Look\" (1947), by Christian Dior; the signature shape featured a below-mid-calf-length, full-skirt, a narrow waist, and a large bust (stylistically absent since 1912). As a post–War fashion that used some 20 yards of fabric, the House of Dior couture renounced wartime rationing of fabric for clothes.\n\nIn 1947 — after the six-year austerities of the Second World War (1939–45) — the New Look was welcomed by the fashion business of Western Europe because sales of the pretty clothes would revive business and the economy.\n\nTo regain the business primacy of the House of Chanel, in the fashion fields of \"haute couture\", \"prêt-à-porter\", costume jewelry, and \"parfumerie\", would be expensive; so Chanel approached Pierre Wertheimer for business advice and capital. Having decided to do business with Coco Chanel, Wertheimer's negotiations to fund the resurgence of the House of Chanel, granted him commercial rights to all Chanel-brand products.\n\nIn 1953, Chanel collaborated with jeweler Robert Goossens; he was to design jewelry (bijouterie and gemstone) to complement the fashions of the House of Chanel; notably, long-strand necklaces of black pearls and of white pearls, which high contrast softened the severe design of the knitted-wool Chanel Suit (skirt and cardigan jacket).\n\nThe House of Chanel also presented leather handbags with either gold-colour chains or metal-and-leather chains, which allowed carrying the handbag from the shoulder or in hand. The quilted-leather handbag was presented to the public in February 1955. In-house, the numeric version of the launching date \"2.55\" for that line of handbags became the internal \"appellation\" for that model of the quilted-leather handbag.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, the sense of style of Chanel continued undeterred; the firm's initial venture into masculine \"parfumerie\", Pour Monsieur was a successful \"eau de toilette\" for men. Chanel and her spring collection received the Fashion Oscar at the 1957 Fashion Awards in Dallas. Pierre Wertheimer bought Bader's 20 per cent share of the Parfums Chanel, which increased the Wertheimer percentage to 90 per cent.\n\nLater, in 1965, Pierre's son, Jacques Wertheimer, assumed his father's management of the \"parfumerie\". About the past business relationship, between Pierre Wertheimer and Coco Chanel, the Chanel attorney, Chambrun said that it had been \"one based on a businessman's passion, despite her misplaced feelings of exploitation . . . [thus] when Pierre returned to Paris, full of pride and excitement [after one of his horses won the 1956 English Derby]. He rushed to Coco, expecting congratulations and praise. But she refused to kiss him. She resented him, you see, all her life.\"\n\nCoco Chanel died on 10 January 1971, at the age of 87. She was still designing at the time of her death. For example, in the (1966–1969) period, she designed the air hostess uniforms for Olympic Airways, the designer who followed her was Pierre Cardin. In that time, Olympic Airways was a luxury airline, owned by the transport magnate Aristotle Onassis. After her death, the leadership of the company was handed down to Yvonne Dudel, Jean Cazaubon and Philippe Guibourgé.\n\nAfter a period of time, Jacques Wertheimer bought the controlling interest of the House of Chanel. Critics stated that during his leadership, he never paid much attention to the company, as he was more interested in horse breeding. In 1974, the House of Chanel launched Cristalle eau de toilette, which was designed when Coco Chanel was alive. 1978 saw the launch of the first non-couture, prêt-à-porter line and worldwide distribution of accessories.\n\nAlain Wertheimer, son of Jacques Wertheimer, assumed control of Chanel S.A. in 1974. In the U.S., No. 5 de Chanel was not selling well. Alain revamped Chanel No.5 sales by reducing the number of outlets carrying the fragrance from 18,000 to 12,000. He removed the perfume from drugstore shelves and invested millions of dollars in advertisement for Chanel cosmetics. This ensured a greater sense of scarcity and exclusivity for No.5, and sales rocketed back up as demand for the fragrance increased. He used famous people to endorse the perfume — from Marilyn Monroe to Audrey Tautou. Looking for a designer who could bring the label to new heights, he persuaded Karl Lagerfeld to end his contract with fashion house Chloé.\n\nIn 1981, Chanel launched Antaeus, an eau de toilette for men. In 1983 Karl Lagerfeld took over as chief designer for Chanel. Like Chanel, he looked into the past as inspiration for his designs. He incorporated the Chanel fabrics and detailing such as tweed, gold accents, and chains. Lagerfeld kept what was signature for Chanel but also helped bring the brand into today.\n\nIn later collections Lagerfeld chose to break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, \"We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people know what to expect. And they keep coming back to us, at all ages, as they enter and leave the market.\" The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, \"Coco\", continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.\n\nMaison de Chanel increased the Wertheimer family fortune to $5 billion USD. Sales were hurt by the recession of the early 1990s, but Chanel recovered by the mid-1990s with further boutique expansion.\n\nIn 1994, Chanel had a net profit equivalent to €67 million on the sale of €570 million in ready-to-wear clothes and was the most profitable French fashion house.\n\nIn 1996, Chanel bought gun-makers Holland & Holland, but failed in its attempt to revamp the firm. It launched the perfumes Allure in 1996 and Allure Homme in 1998. The swimwear label Eres was purchased. The House of Chanel launched its first skin care line, Précision, in 1999. That same year, Chanel launched a travel collection, and under a license contract with Luxottica, introduced a line of sunglasses and eyeglass frames.\n\nWhile Wertheimer remained chairman, Françoise Montenay became CEO and President. 2000 saw the launch of the first unisex watch by Chanel, the J12. In 2001, watchmaker Bell & Ross was acquired. The same year, Chanel boutiques offering only selections of accessories were opened in the United States. Chanel launched a small selection of menswear as a part of their runway shows.\n\nIn 2002, Chanel launched the Chance perfume and Paraffection, a subsidiary company originally established in 1997 to support artisanal manufacturing, that gathered together Ateliers d'Art or workshops including Desrues for ornamentation and buttons, Lemarié for feathers, Lesage for embroidery, Massaro for shoemaking and Michel for millinery. A prêt-à-porter collection was designed by Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nIn July 2002, a jewelry and watch outlet opened on Madison Avenue. Within months, a shoe/handbag boutique opened next door. Chanel continued to expand in the United States and by December 2002, operated 25 U.S. boutiques.\n\nChanel introduced Coco Mademoiselle and an \"In-Between Wear\" in 2003, targeting younger women, opened a second shop on Rue Cambon, opened a boutique in Hong Kong and paid nearly $50 million USD for a building in Ginza, Tokyo.\n\nIn 2007, Maureen Chiquet was appointed CEO. She remained CEO until her termination in 2016. Nick Hochland succeeded Chiquet as CEO.\n\nIn 2018, Chanel announced that it would be moving its global headquarters to London. \n\nThe Chanel logotype comprises two interlocked, opposed letters-C, one faced left, one faced right. The logotype was given to Chanel by the Château de Crémat, Nice, and was not registered as a trademark until the first Chanel shops were established. Along with other makers, Chanel is a target of counterfeiters. China is prime supplier. An authentic classic Chanel handbag retails from around US$4,150, while a counterfeit usually costs around US$200. Beginning in the 1990s, all authentic Chanel handbags were numbered.\n\nOne timeline measurement for Chanel presence in the United States is via trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). On Tuesday, 18 November 1924, Chanel, Inc. filed trademark applications for the typeset mark \"Chanel\" and for the interlocking \"CC\" design plus word mark. At that time, the trademarks were registered only for the perfume, toiletry, and cosmetic products in the primary class of common metals and their alloys. Chanel provided the description of \"face powder, perfume, eau de cologne, toilet water, lip stick, and rouge,\" to the USPTO.\nThe Chanel and double-C trademarks were awarded on the same date of 24 February 1925 with respective Serial Numbers of 71205468 and 71205469. The first trademark application for the No. 5 perfume was on Thursday, 1 April 1926, described as perfume and toilet water. First use and commercial use was stated as 1 January 1921. Registration was granted on 20 July 1926 with Serial Number 71229497.\n\nIn 1924, Pierre Wertheimer founded Parfums Chanel, to produce and sell perfumes and cosmetics; the \"parfumerie\" proved to be the most profitable business division of the Chanel S.A. corporation. Since its establishment, \"parfumerie\" Chanel has employed four perfumers:\n\nCosmetics are the most accessible Chanel product, with counters in department stores across the world, including Harrods, Galeries Lafayette, Bergdorf Goodman, Hudson's Bay, and David Jones, Wojooh, John Lewis, Debenhams, Boots as well as its own beauty boutiques.\n\nProducts lines\n\n- Hydra Beauty\n\n- Le Blanc\n\n- Le Lift\n\n- Sublimage\n\n- Blue Serum\n\n- La Solution 10 de Chanel\n\nChanel 'High Jewellery' was founded in November 1932. Chanel debuted 'Bijoux de Diamants' at her Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Paris mansion. In 2012, the company created a special collection to celebrate Diamants' 80th anniversary. Current collections include High Jewellery, Camelia, Comete, Baroque, 1932, Ultra, Bridal and Jewellery Watches.\n\nThe Chanel wristwatch division was established in 1987. In 1995, division presented a second design, the \"Matelassé\". Although the \"Première\" and \"Matelassé\" wristwatches were successful products, the presentation, in 2000, of the \"Chanel J12\" line of unisex style wristwatches, made of ceramic materials, established Chanel wristwatches as a Chanel marque. The J12 line of wristwatches features models in four dial-face sizes: 33mm, 38mm, 41mm, and 42mm. In 2008, Chanel S.A. and Audemars Piguet developed the ceramic Chanel AP-3125 clockwork, exclusive to the House of Chanel.\n\nChanel owns the wineries Château Rauzan-Ségla, Château Canon, and St. Supéry Estate Vineyards & Winery.\n\nAt Paris Fashion Week, Chanel presented its Spring 2016 line on an airport themed runway.\n\nWorldwide, Chanel S.A. operates around 310 Chanel boutiques; 94 in Asia, 70 in Europe, 10 in the Middle East, 128 in North America, 1 in Central America, 2 in South America, and 6 in Oceania. The shops are located in wealthy communities, usually in department stores like Harrods and Selfridges, high streets, shopping districts, and inside airports. The company recently paid $152 million, or more than $13,000 per square foot for 11,500 square feet at 400 North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. This is the most expensive amount paid for retail space in Los Angeles since the record was set in 2012 at $10,400 per square foot in 2012.\n\n"}

The motion pictures have won international awards and each year new Estonian films are seen at film festivals around the globe.\n\nThe first \"moving pictures\" were screened in Tallinn in 1896. The first movie theater was opened in 1908. First local documentary was made in 1908 with the production of a newsreel about Swedish King Gustav V’s visit to Tallinn.\n\nThe first Estonian documentary was created by Johannes Pääsuke in 1912 that was followed by a short film \"Karujaht Pärnumaal\" (Bear Hunt in Pärnumaa) in 1914. The first movie studio in Estonia, \"Estonia Film Tartus\" (The Tartu Studio of Estonia Film), was established by Johannes Pääsuke (1892–1918). Pääsuke produced documentaries, short films and pictures of Estonian nature for the Estonian National Museum. \"Karujaht Pärnumaal\" (Bear-Hunt in Pärnu County, 1914) was the first fictional short film made in Estonia. In total, eight films made by J. Pääsuke have survived and are stored at the Estonian Film Archives.\n\nThe first full-length feature film was made in 1924 \"Shadow of the Past\" directed by Konstantin Märska and produced by his \"Konstantin Märska Filmiproduktsioon\" (Konstantin Märska Film Production). Two feature films by Märska have survived: \"Vigased pruudid\" (1929) and \"Jüri Rumm\" (1929). \"Theodor Lutsu Filmiproduktsioon\" (the Film Production of Theodor Luts Studio) was established by Theodor Luts and his wife Aksella Luts, who produced documentaries and feature films. His \"Noored kotkad\" (Young Eagles) (1927) is generally regarded as the cornerstone of Estonian cinema. Luts was also responsible for directing the only Estonian sound feature made before Soviet era, an Estonian-Finnish co-production \"Päikese lapsed\" (1932). Luts moved to Finland to work as a cinematographer immediately after finishing the film, and never returned to Estonia. Smaller film production studios in Estonia included \"Siirius Film\" and \"K.Kalamees Tartu\".\n\nThe major film production company after the Great Depression hit Estonia during the 1930s was state subsidized the Estonian Culture Film () that produced mostly documentaries.\nIn late 1930s, Academy Award nominated Miliza Korjus best known for a role in \"The Great Waltz\" (1938), daughter of an Estonian lieutenant colonel in the Imperial Russian Army and later Chief of Staff to the War Minister of Estonia, had a successful career in Hollywood film industry\n\nThe first Estonian animated short film \"Kutsu-Juku seiklusi\" was made in 1931.\n\nDuring the first year of Soviet occupation (1940–1941) \"Eesti Kultuurfilm\" was taken over by the Communist Party and renamed \"Kinokroonika Eesti Stuudio\" (the Estonian Newsreel Studio). During the first decades of Soviet rule as Estonia became a part of USSR in 1944 after the end of World War II, filmmakers in Estonia were mostly coming from inner Soviet Union whose job was to create propaganda films that depicted the victory of socialism in a form of newsreels and documentaries.\n\nFormer Eesti Kultuurfilm was called \"Kinokroonika Tallinna Stuudio\" (The Tallinn Newsreel Studio) in 1942 during the German occupation in World War II and \"Tallinna Kinostuudio\" (The Tallinn Film Studio) in 1947 again by the Soviets.\n\nDuring the era two feature films on Soviet themes were produced in Estonia directed by Gerbert Rappaport, an Austrian émigré in Soviet Union: \"Elu tsitadellis (Life in the Citadel)\" in 1947, \"Valgus Koordis (Light in Koordi)\" in 1951 that was the first color motion picture film made in Estonia.\n\nAfter the death of Stalin in 1953 a more liberal period in Soviet Union's cultural policies followed. Filmmakers started to enjoy greater artistic control at the same time the Soviet State Committee for Cinematography (Goskino) in Moscow provided the money, state censorship body Glavlit and CPSU Department of Culture had the control over releasing the movies.\n\nThe Tallinn Film Studio was renamed \"Kunstiliste ja Kroonikafilmide Tallinna Kinostuudio\" (Tallinn Feature- and Newsreel Film Studio) in 1954 and in 1963 was renamed again Tallinnfilm \n\nSome of the first films produced during the era that were co directed by an Estonian Kaljo Kiisk were \"Juunikuu päevad\" (1957) and \"Vallatud kurvid\" also known as \"Opasniye Povoroty\", the first dramatic film shot in Kinopanorama (1959).\n\nIn the 1960s a story of Prince Gabriel by Estonian writer Eduard Bornhöhe was turned into a movie script by Arvo Valton. Grigori Kromanov was named to be the director of \"Viimne reliikvia\" (The Last Relic), released in 1969 by Tallinnfilm. The movie set the absolute box office record for the entire Soviet Union at the time by selling 44,9 million tickets. It was successfully distributed by the Soviet film export internationally in more than 60 countries. The film also influenced Estonian literature: 2 short stories listed for the Friedebert Tuglas award in 1970-75 included references to the Last Relic.\n\nAnother milestone in Estonian Cinema released in 1969 was Arvo Kruusement's \"\"Kevade\"\" (Spring) based on Oskar Luts popular novel.\n\nSuccessful films in the 1980s were \"\"Hukkunud Alpinisti\" hotell\" (Dead Mountaineer's Hotel) by Kromanov and movies made by Kaljo Kiisk such as \"Nipernaadi\" (1983).\n\nThe most prominent female director Leida Laius who emerged during the era is best known for her \"Kõrboja peremees\" (1979) and \"Naerata ometi\" (1985) receiving at the Berlin International Film Festival UNICEF Award in 1985. Peeter Simm's best known Soviet era film is \"Ideaalmaastik\" (The Ideal Landscape) released in 1980. Peeter Urbla's \"Ma pole turist, ma elan siin\" (I'm Not a Tourist, I'm Living Here) (1988). Jaan Kolgerg emerged by the end of Soviet era with films \"See kadunud tee\" (1990) (The Lost Way) and \"Võlausaldajad\" (Creditors) (1992)\n\nAmong the leading Estonian film actors during the Soviet era were Rein Aren with about 30 roles, Jüri Järvet and Leonhard Merzin.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union Estonia regained its independence, the cost of filmmaking skyrocketed and the 1990s showed decline in filmmaking that reached its bottom in 1996, the year when no fictional films and only 2 documentaries \"Lipule... güüsile... valvel!\" and \"Turvalisuse illusioon\" were made in Estonia.\n\nIn 1997, the Estonian Film Foundation was founded by the Estonian Ministry of Culture. Production of \"Minu Leninid\" (All My Lenins) (1997) a parody of Soviet Revolution by Hardi Volmer marked a turnaround for Estonian feature films. In 1998, there were two feature films produced. \"Georgica\" directed by Sulev Keedus won the \"FIPRESCI Prize\" at the Stockholm Film Festival in 1998 and the \"Prix Europa Special\" at Prix Europa in 1999.\n\nSince then, the trend has also been towards joint film productions such as Peeter Simm's \"Head käed\" (Good Hands) (2001) a joint Estonian-Latvian coproduction that in 2002 won the \"Manfred Salzgeber Award\" at the Berlin International Film Festival and the \"Golden Olive Tree\"\nLecce Festival of European Cinema in Italy. \"Kõrini\" (Fed Up) (2005) an Estonian-German coproduction. Arvo Iho' s \"Karu süda\" (Hart of the Bear) (2001) nominated for \"Golden St. George\" at the Moscow International Film Festival and for the \"European Film Award\" at European Film Awards, was a coproduction between Estonia, Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe most commercially successful Estonian film in 2002 was \"Nimed marmortahvlil\" (2002) (Names in Marble) by Elmo Nüganen and in 2003 a comedy by Rando Pettai \"Vanad ja kobedad saavad jalad alla\" (Made in Estonia) that in Estonia topped the international blockbuster \"\" with its box office results.\n\nIn 2004, two young directors emerged Jaak Kilmi and René Reinumägi with their \"Sigade revolutsioon\"\n(Revolution of Pigs) that won the \"Special Jury Prize\" and was nominated for \"Golden St. George\" at the Moscow International Film Festival, and for \"Grand Prix Asturias\" at the Gijón International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2007, about 10 feature films were made in Estonia. Most notable perhaps \"Sügisball\" (2007) by Veiko Õunpuu receiving among other awards \"Best Director\" at the Thessaloniki Film Festival, International Film Festival Bratislava and \"Venice Horizons Award\" at the 64th Venice International Film Festival. \"Georg\" (2007) by Peeter Simm is a movie about the life of legendary Estonian singer Georg Ots.\n\nMost recent awarded film is Veiko Õunpuu's \"The Temptation of St. Tony\" (2009).

The conventions together cover the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Aruba and all French territories. \n\nA legal basis for cross-border injunctions may amongst others be found in Article 6(1) (most instruments) or Article 8(1) (EU regulation 1215/2012), providing that \"a person domiciled in a Member State to also be sued\n\nFor a period in the late-1990s, national courts issued cross-border injunctions covering all Brussels regime jurisdictions, but this has been limited by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). \n\nIn two cases in July 2006, interpreting Articles 6(1) and 16(4) of the Brussels Convention, the ECJ held that European patents are national rights that must be enforced nationally, that it was \"unavoidable\" that infringements of the same European patent have to be litigated in each relevant national court, even if the lawsuit is against the same group of companies, and that cross-border injunctions are not available. In particular, the court set forth in grounds 41 of case C-539/03 that \"Article 6(1) of the Brussels Convention ... does not apply in European patent infringement proceedings involving a number of companies established in various Contracting States in respect of acts committed in one or more of those States even where those companies, which belong to the same group, may have acted in an identical or similar manner in accordance with a common policy elaborated by one of them\". In other words, there will be no close connection between claims as required by Article 6(1) if two closely connected companies domiciled in different Contracting States act (infringe) in the same manner.\n\nAlso in 2006, the ECJ decided on case C-04/03 (GAT/LUK). The court ruled that \"Article 16(4) of the Convention … is to be interpreted as meaning that the rule of exclusive jurisdiction laid down therein concerns all proceedings relating to the registration or validity of a patent, irrespective of whether the issue is raised by way of an action or a plea in objection\". As of 2015, Article 16(4) of the Convention corresponds to Article 24(4) of EU regulation 1215/2012. The ruling in case C-04/03 confirms that the courts of each Contracting State have exclusive jurisdiction on validity of patents registered for the territory of that State. Exclusive jurisdiction under Article 22(4) applies irrespective of whether a patent proprietor is sued for revocation or whether an alleged infringer asserts invalidity in inter partes proceedings.\n\nIn 2012, nearly six years after its rulings on cases C-04/03 and C-539/03, the ECJ decided on case C-616/10 (Solvay/Honeywell). The court held that \"Article 22(4) of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as not precluding, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the application of Article 31 of that regulation\". Since Article 31 is about provisional measures, a court may issue a cross-border injunction where an action aims for such measures. The ruling on case C-539/03 allows for a court to issue cross-border injunctions as provisional measures where companies domiciled in different Contracting States infringe in the same Contracting State.\n\n\n"}

The movie is the sequel to \"Father of the Bride\" (1950).\n\nIn this sequel to \"Father of the Bride\", newly married Kay Dunstan (Elizabeth Taylor) announces that she and her husband are going to have a baby, leaving her father, Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracy), having to come to grips with becoming a grandfather.\n\nMiddle-class family man Stanley Banks reminisces on events of the past year: One afternoon, returning from the office feeling happy and energetic, Stanley's routine is interrupted when his wife Ellie (Joan Bennett) tells him that they are having dinner with their daughter Kay and her husband, Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor), to hear some important news. Although Stanley is certain that it concerns Buckley's business, the newlyweds reveal that Kay is expecting a baby. Buckley's parents, Doris (Billie Burke) and Herbert (Moroni Olsen), are delighted, as is Ellie, but Stanley broods that he is too young and vibrant to be a grandfather. Soon Ellie, flush with excitement, throws Kay a baby shower, something Stanley thinks is highway robbery not punishable by law. Later, Ellie suggests that they remodel their house to enable Kay, Buckley, and the baby to move in with them, but Stanley puts his foot down. Ellie is near tears when the wealthy Dunstans announce that they are planning to add a wing to their home for the couple, but is overjoyed when Kay and Buckley reveal that they have just bought their own little house, enabling Ellie to have free rein helping Kay decorate.\n\nAfter settling into their new home, Kay, who is very close to her father, expresses her concern that the baby will make a difference in her relationship with Buckley. Stanley comforts her by telling her how much he loved her as a baby. Soon the Bankses and the Dunstans are trying to outdo one another buying gifts and making plans for the baby, up to his enrollment in college. One night, while listening to Ellie, Doris, and Herbert bicker over what the baby should be named, Kay breaks down and runs to her room. Only Stanley, whom Kay feels is the sole parent who understands her is able to comfort her. The day after pledging to Kay that he will make certain that none of the in-laws will interfere again, Stanley drags Ellie to Kay's physician, Dr. Andrew Nordell, anxious over the \"modern\" ideas Nordell has about a more natural method of childbirth and infant care.\n\nFor the next month or so, things remain calm, until Stanley is awakened by a late night call from Buckley, who says that Kay has left him \"for good.\" After sneaking over to Buckley and Kay's place, Stanley learns from a cab driver that Kay took a taxi to his house. The two men then return to the Banks house, where the couple make up after Kay's jealousy is revealed to be a misunderstanding stemming from Buckley's late nights working at the office. Kay, as well as Stanley, realize Buckley's devotion to his family.\n\nAs the baby's birth approaches, nerves among the parents and grandparents become frayed. The eventual birth of a baby boy delights everyone, except Stanley, a distant and wary observer of the as-yet-unnamed baby, who starts to cry whenever Stanley comes near him.\n\nWhen the baby is six months old, Kay joins Buckley on a brief business trip and leaves the baby with her parents, hoping to give Stanley time to grow closer to his grandson. One afternoon, while Kay is still away, Stanley takes the baby for a walk in the park. When the baby finally falls asleep in his carriage, Stanley joins some friendly neighborhood boys in a game of football and loses track of time. After the game, when Stanley cannot find the carriage, he frantically retraces his steps back to the house. Seeing through the window that Kay has returned early, he panics and takes a taxi to the local police station. There a befuddled Stanley confesses to the grim-faced police sergeant that he has lost the baby. Fearing the wrath of the police squad, who found the sweet-natured baby and have fallen in love with him, Stanley secretly prays that his grandson will not start to scream when he picks him up. To Stanley's relief, the baby is delighted to see him, and from that moment on, the two are devoted to each other. Some time later, at the baby's christening, Stanley beams with pride as his grandson is finally named \"Stanley Banks Dunstan.\"\n\n\n\"Father's Little Dividend\" was semi-remade in 1995 as \"Father of the Bride Part II\", with Steve Martin and Diane Keaton in Tracy and Bennett's roles. However, Keaton's character also has a baby and the plot has many similarities to this movie.\n\nSpencer Tracy and Joan Bennett had made films together two decades earlier, including \"Me and My Gal\" (1932), in which their characters marry, and \"She Wanted a Millionaire\" (1932).\n\nAccording to film critic Leonard Maltin, this film was one of the first examples of a proper movie studio sequel.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $3,122,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1.5 million elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $2,025,000.\n\nOriginally released by MGM, the film entered the public domain in the United States in 1979 because MGM did not renew the copyright registration. Despite the fact that Warner Bros. Entertainment (via ownership of Turner Entertainment) owns the distribution rights to the original, they have not yet released an authorized DVD release of the sequel, which is available on DVD through several other DVD distributors.\n\n"}

{"id": "12799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12799", "title": "Graphic design", "text": "Graphic design\n\nGraphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \"graphic design\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.\n\nThe term graphic design was coined by William Addison Dwiggins in 1922. However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of Lascaux, to Rome's Trajan's Column to the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of Ginza, Tokyo. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\". This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the Rosetta Stone. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" The Egyptians also invented papyrus, paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"Dark Ages\", from 500 to 1450 , monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with Benjamin Franklin who used his newspaper \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\", to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, Andrew Bradford as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his \"General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America\" (the precursor to the Saturday Evening Post) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the \"Pennsylvania Fireplace\". His invention is still sold today and is known as \"the Franklin stove\". \"\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize logos, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter William Hogarth used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, Johann Gutenberg introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a printing press and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, criers announced products for sale just as ancient Romans had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. Aldus Manutius developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called Humanist or Old Style. Additionally, William Caxton, England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed \"squis\" or \"\"pin up\" posters,\" in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe\".\" The term \"Siquis\" came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating \"if anybody...\", which is Latin for \"si quis\". These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of \"wants\" called \"want ads\" and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as \"want ad media\" or \"advice columns\".\n\nIn 1638 Harvard University received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller Benjamin Harris received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, \"'Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'\". It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the \"'Boston News-Letter'\", which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as \"Weeklies\". The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. \"'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.\"' The initial use of the \"Boston News-Letter\" carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th, 1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in Oyster Bay, owned by William Bradford, a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the New-York Gazette\". Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the \"American Weekly Mercury\", 1719. \"The Mercury\" and William Brooker's \"Massachusetts Gazette\", first published a day earlier.\n\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his \"Journal of Design and Manufactures\". He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the Arts and Crafts movement, and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.\n\nThe term \"graphic design\" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay \"New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design\" by William Addison Dwiggins, an American book designer in the early 20th century. Raffe's \"Graphic Design\", published in 1927, was the first book to use \"Graphic Design\" in its title.\n\nThe signage in the London Underground is a classic design example of the modern era and used a typeface designed by Edward Johnston in 1916.\n\nIn the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.\n\nJan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, \"New Typography\". He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential. Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application. The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German Bauhaus school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" architecture and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include Adrian Frutiger, designer of the typefaces Univers and Frutiger; Paul Rand, who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as corporate identity; Alex Steinweiss, credited with the invention of the album cover; and Josef Müller-Brockmann, who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine \"Emigre\" 51 stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.\" Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as Rudy VanderLans, Erik Spiekermann, Ellen Lupton and Rick Poynor. The 2000 manifesto was also published in Adbusters, known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from road signs to technical schematics, from interoffice memorandums to reference manuals.\n\nDesign can aid in selling a product or idea. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging and text as part of branding (see also advertising). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the entertainment industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl album covers, comic books, DVD covers, opening credits and closing credits in filmmaking, and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as information design. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include data visualization, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.\n\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing text and either preexisting imagery or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as interactive design, or multimedia design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.\n\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on paper and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires judgment and creativity. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and rendering. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an art director), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using traditional media and guides, or digital image editing tools on computers. Tools in computer graphics often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"pen\". Some graphic design tools such as a grid are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process. Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.\n\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process. Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or paste-up. While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nMost designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXpress. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include Inkscape (for vector graphics), GIMP (for photo-editing and image manipulation), Krita (for painting) and Scribus (for page layout).\n\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in interface design, in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This has included web design and software design, when end user interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application. An important aspect of interface design is icon design.\n\nUser experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding, placemaking, branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year. The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include graphic designer, art director, creative director, animator and entry level production artist. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"DTP Associate\" or \"Graphic Artist\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration, photography, animation or interactive design.\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations. Graphic designers may also work freelance, working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the art director, creative director or senior media creative. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as brand development and corporate identity development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\nJeff Howe of \"Wired Magazine\" first used the term \"crowdsourcing\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\" It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.\n\n\n"}

The show starred Ron and Natalie Daise, who also served as the cultural advisors, and was inspired by the Gullah culture of Ron Daise's home of St. Helena Island, South Carolina, part of the Sea Islands.\n\nRon Daise's book \"Reminiscences of Sea Island Heritage\" was published in 1987. He and his New York-born wife, Natalie Daise (née Eldridge), followed by creating and touring with a multimedia show, \"Sea Island Montage\", based on the book as well as stories from oral histories of elderly St. Helena Island residents. After one of their performances, the Daises met with an executive producer from Nickelodeon. Creator Maria Perez-Brown had planned on building a multicultural program featuring a \"magical island\" and was inspired by the Daises to use the Sea Islands and elements of Gullah culture. Part of Nickelodeon's initiative to broaden its preschool programming, \"Gullah Gullah Island\" was the first show of its kind to star an African-American family set in an indigenously black community. The show's originality caused some upfront concerns. \"We were apprehensive about naming it 'Gullah Gullah Island'. We wanted to make sure the portrayal was positive and didn't in any way poke fun at the culture or the community,\" Ron Daise said of creating a show based on an existing culture.\n\n\"Gullah Gullah Island\" is a sing-along half-hour live-action show. The format was part of a \"flexible thinking\" initiative that taught children to make good choices rather than using rote memorization.\n\nThe series revolves around a family headed by Ron and Natalie Daise, playing fictionalized versions of themselves, known as The Alstons, set on the fictional \"Gullah Gullah Island\". Additional cast featured the Daise's actual children Simeon and Sara among others, including a full-body puppet frog, Binyah Binyah ('Binyah' is the Gullah word for 'island native'.) The show was taped and recorded at Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando at Universal Studios Florida, with the show \"Clarissa Explains It All\" shot on the same set (interior and exterior). Outdoor shots featured Beaufort, South Carolina and Fripp Island. Charleston, SC was featured in one episode when the family took a trip to the City Market.\n\nEpisodes are presented with a unified plot and not separate segments, featuring singing, dancing, learning and encouraging children to think about things like taking care of yourself, animals, telling the truth, social skills, and problem solving. The show also highlights the culture and language of Gullah, descendants of former slaves who live on the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nCritical reception of the show was consistently positive; both as a children's show and as groundbreaker for African American programming, it was praised for \"vividly colored sets, infectious sing-alongs, unique character accents and quirky humor that defined the show and introduced millions of children to an overlooked but centuries-old branch of African American culture.\" It was described as \"a combination summer camp, cheerleading session and music video.\" The issues, especially with the first season, had to do with show's depiction being unrealistic. \"The songs were lively and catchy, the kids were cute and the general theme was unlike other kids' programming,\" Jenifer Managan of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote. However:\n\n... it stars \"perfect\" parents, Ron and Natalie Daise, who with their three children (who never fight), neighbors and friends seek to entertain and socially educate kids through a sing-song series. While the show encourages active participation from at-home viewers, the dictionary responses and incomparable energy from the Daises make normal parents look like misfits. Perhaps as the show seasons, the lip-syncing will improve and the characters won't be so picture-perfect.\n\nIn 1996, \"TV Guide\" named the show one of \"10 best children's shows\". During its original broadcast it was Nickelodeon's highest-rated preschool show, averaging more 750,000 viewers per episode.\n\nThe show ran for 4 seasons from 1994 to 1998, with a total of 70 episodes. Following the series' end, reruns aired through July 2000. Reruns also aired on Noggin (now Nick Jr.) from February 2, 1999 to April 2004 and again from 2008 to December 31, 2011.\n\nSeveral special home video releases accompanied the original broadcast, including: \"Gullah Gullah Island: Binyah's Surprise\" (1994), \"Gullah Gullah Island: Play Along With Binyah and Friends\" (1994), \"Gullah Gullah Island - Dance Along with the Daise Family\" (1997), and \"Gullah Gullah Island - Christmas\" (1998).\n\nHome videos of the show were released on VHS format by Sony Wonder from 1995-1996 and later by Paramount from 1997-1998. As of February 7, 2012, every season of the series is being released to DVD through Amazon.com's MOD (Manufacture On Demand) program. Nickelodeon licensed a series of children's books, musical cassettes and \"Binyah Binyah Polliwog\" plush animals.\n\nThe first 37 episodes are available to watch on the Noggin subscription service as of October 14, 2015.\n\n\nIn 1997, five episodes of a \"Gullah Gullah Island\" miniseries titled \"Binyah Binyah!\" were produced at the now-defunct Nickelodeon Studios in Orlando, Florida, and aired from February 2 to February 6, 1998. A separate theme song written by Sean Altman was given to these episodes. The miniseries also featured several new puppet characters in addition to the original cast, and focused on polliwog Binyah Binyah journeying to locations outside of Gullah Gullah. Ron and Natalie Daise were a part of the cast as well. It was never broadcast again after its initial airing of episodes, nor was it released to home video. A promo advertising the series' debut is the only known footage; all five episodes were believed to be lost until 2017, when snippets of episode 5 and all of episode 4 surfaced online, evidently coming from a homemade VHS tape of old Nickelodeon shows.\n\n"}

He briefly attended California School of Fine Arts, San Francisco. When World War II started, Howard Brodie was a sports artist for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". Brodie also enjoyed success as an illustrator of college football program covers.\n\nWith entry of the United States into World War II, Brodie enlisted in the Army. He became one of \"Yank\" magazine's best-known artists during the war. He sketched everything from Guadalcanal to the Battle of the Bulge and had an uncanny ability to capture the emotions of his subjects and record a scene with great attention to detail.\n\nHe put himself in combat situations many times and, while he never carried a weapon, he worked as a medic when needed. He received the Bronze Star for valor.\n\nAfter the war Brodie became a courtroom artist and recorded many famous trials, including those of the Chicago Seven, Charles Manson and General Westmoreland, the Ruby trial and Senate Civil Rights Debates. He was also a CBS TV Artist-Correspondent. Brodie never fully severed his ties to the military and was a combat artist in Korea, French Indochina, and Vietnam. His works can be found in the Library of Congress.\n\nTwo of Brodie's most famous works are \"Portrait of a Medic\", which appeared on the cover of Yank Magazine, and \"Compassion\". Another sketch, which depicted an exhausted G.I. dropping his rifle as World War II ended, appeared on the cover of Yank’s Continental Edition on August 19, 1945. Brodie's works are collected in \"Drawing Fire: A Combat Artist at War Pacific Europe Korea Indochina Vietnam\".\n\nAs \"The New York Times\" has stated, \"His sketch of the black militant Bobby Seale gagged and strapped to his chair became the image that epitomized the trial of the Chicago Seven, the leaders of protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\"\n\n"}

Painted toward the end of his life, from 1854–1861, it depicts a puzzling episode from The Bible's Book of Genesis, XXXII, 22-32 - Jacob wrestling with the angel. The painting decorates the wall of the Chapel of the Holy Angels in the Paris church of Saint-Sulpice. Another mural by Delacroix, \"Heliodorus Driven from the Temple\", drawn from the Book of the Maccabees, a scene of someone taking a beating in the Jerusalem Temple, is also there.\n\nIn an invitation sent out by Delacroix in July 1861 to inspect the Chapel of the Holy Angels in the church of Saint-Sulpice he wrote : \"Jacob is travelling with the flocks and other gifts he is taking to his brother Esau in the hope of appeasing his anger. A stranger appears, blocking his path, and engages him in a fierce struggle - The holy books see this struggle as a symbol of the trials God sometimes sends His chosen ones. \" Delacroix does not indicate in what holy books he found such an interpretation.\n\nMaurice Barres wrote that it was 'a final page of autobiography, a summary of the experience of a great life, the last will and testament written by an old artist on the wall of the Angels'. He called it Delacroix's 'spiritual testament ' --\nalthough the French writer Jean-Paul Kauffmann calls Barres' book \"Mystere en pleine lumiere\" [ The mystery in Full Daylight] -- 'certainly questionable on the significance of the scene painted by Delacroix'.\n\nIn Delacroix's composition, a caravan procession--a convoy of servants, flocks, Jacob's sons and wives--appears then fades, only to reappear briefly at the bend of a ravine. Three huge trees dominate the scene; the gorge with misty contours is the painting's final destination. Thereby, Jacob's life is represented in two parts, as he is not to be the same after the depicted fight. 'He bears the mark for ever in his flesh', victorious but wounded, whereas before the meeting with the angel he is all tricks and cheating. Thus Delacroix depicted a pile of clothes left in the foreground by Jacob, as he has still his bulky animal skin, symbol of animal human nature and the lower instincts, and wears a lion skin across his shoulder: one of whose paws can be seen flying in the air near his right calf. Paul Claudel wrote of the femininity of the angel attacked by a vigorous young man: 'these two bodies becoming aware of each other'\n\nDelacroix's house close to Paris on the edge of the Sénart forest was his retreat during the work and conception of Jacob. He left Champrosay in the morning, took the train to Ris station, and returned in the evening to sleep at the hermitage. \"Nature as depicted [here] is not very eastern--the stream, the vegetation, the rise with the three trees definitely belong to the landscape of the Ile de France--Senart forest. Delacroix liked to walk in the woods and be around the decomposing organic matter--had a saprophiliac side to his nature--a fascination with destruction and putrefaction, squelching in mud and breathing in the air of the secluded paths\". (Kauffman)\n\nDelacroix wanted to work in the church on Sundays. There were sung masses and the music inspired him. When the Abbé Croquant objected, Delacroix went as far as to request the Emperor and Empress to intervene. \nPreparing the wall in Sant-Sulpice--worried by absorption (walls swallow liquid preparations)--\"the great enemy is the dampness of the walls:in short the walls are dreadful for any paint. Oil, sinking in to a great depth, can compensate for the drawback.\" The Chapel faces south, so Delacroix played with the light flowing in directly through the window--a solar architecture - Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice\nGnomon astronomicus - the threat of lead poisoning, brought on by breathing the lead n paint - the walls contain white-lead.\n\n'Jacob' is set in an uneven hilly surface. Delacroix, who above all studied Rubens, admired the thickness of Rubens' paint and the way its impasto stands out from surfaces. The Historic Monuments research laboratory has identified an incredible number of layers: indeed, the Angel's robe has up to thirteen.\n\nIn 1856 Delacroix was suffering from tubercular laryngitis,the illness that would kill him. A varicocele torments him as its testicular trouble flares up. The nature of his work on the mural 'means that he is always either standing or perched up on a ladder, increasing his discomfort.'\n\n\"The names of angels - what is your name?\" Jacob asks at the end of the fight.\n\nOn 28 December 1857 Delacroix moved his lodgings from rue Notre Dame de Lorette to no6 Rue Furstenberg to be nearer Saint-Sulpice, and by 22 July 1861 he had finished the Chapel of the Holy Angels. He had only two more years to live, time spent most of it in his refuge at Champrosay.\n\n1938 - damaged by sandbags\n\n\"Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink\" -Psalm 69 verse 14 - this is the inscription over the entrance to the Chapel of the Holy Angels.\nIn October 1858 Delacroix wrote to Berryer, 'I have made a solid effort. I think it will save the work, which was probably bogged down.'\n\nOn 28 April 1849, the Ministry of the Interior officially commissions Delacroix to do the mural paintings for the Font Chapel - its name at that time - he had chosen subjects to do with original sin, washed away by baptism - He is 51. He will get 26,826 francs - He learns that the chapel, wrongly called Font Chapel because the baptismal font was temporarily placed there, is dedicated to St Sulpice - On 2 October 1849, it changes name - and this time invokes the Holy Angels. The change obliges Delacroix to look for other themes. He writes in his journal 'The justifiable anger I felt has really knocked me about.' On 5 October 1850 he reveals in a letter to a friend, the painter Constant Dutilleux his subjects, and mentions Jacob wrestling with the angel, Heliodorus, and the ceiling, which will have as its subject \"the Archangel Michael slaying the Demon\". From 1850-54 Delacroix is busy with another commission however, the decoration of the Hall of Peace in the Town Hall and then, on 16 June 1854 writes in his Journal - \"Andrieu has begun work at Saint-Sulpice.\" Pierre Andrieu, was a pupil of Delacroix, before becoming his collaborator from 1850 onwards.\n\nHeim's work in chapel of souls in purgatory on other side of wall to delacroixs mural - 'prayer for the dead' - less looked at- there was a confessional in the chapel of the holy angels - placed beneath wrestling with the angel, enroached on the bottom part of the painting - it was moved - to the heim chapel beneath heims prayer for the dead -\n\nKauffmann - Titian \"The Martyrdom of St Peter\" - inspiration for delacroix?\n\n\n"}

Crary also earned a B.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he studied film and photography.\n\nHe first taught at the Visual Arts Department at University of California, San Diego. In 1989 he began teaching at Columbia.\n\nHis \"Suspensions of Perception\" focuses on the period from about 1880 to 1905, exploring the second half of the nineteenth century in which a new way of seeing was introduced. Crary describes this shift as an emergence of subjective vision. In addition, Crary discusses how Attention became a “new object within the modernization of subjectivity...”. Crary’s book examines how the perception of various cultures were reconstructed and uncertainties were argued. This new development of vision created controversy because it implied that seeing was dependent upon one’s subjective thoughts, which were based on what the observer saw. Therefore, this new way of seeing was thought of as unclear, unreliable, and always questioned among a large population of people. \"Suspensions of Perception\" published in 2000 was the winner of the 2001 Lionel Trilling Book Award.\n\nCrary's \"Techniques of the Observer\" gives a unique study on the origins of modern visual culture. \"Techniques of the Observer\" was published in 1990 and translated into nine foreign languages.\n\nCrary has also written on present day “art and culture for publications including Art in America, Artforum, October, Assemblage, Cahiers du Cinema, Film Comment, Grey Room, Domus and Village Voice.” Crary is also a critic and wrote critical essays for more than thirty exhibition catalogs.

At the time, Ms. Bingham's philanthropic gift of $10 million was the largest endowment to any women's fund in the United States. The mission of the Kentucky Foundation for Women is \"to promote positive social change by supporting varied feminist expression in the arts.\"\n\nThe foundation funds two grant programs annually, they are \"Artist Enrichment\" and \"Arts Meets Activism\". Both grant programs are artist-centered, feminist in nature, and demonstrate high artistic quality. Applicants to both programs are expected to be able to express their commitment to feminism and their understanding of the relationship between art and social change.\n\nGrant awards range from $1,000 to $7,500 per project. Social change, as defined by the foundation, includes \"eliminating societal barriers to women: neutralizing discrimination against women based on age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical ability, economic condition, and geographic origin; and producing actions, conditions, policies, attitudes, and behaviors that benefit women.\"\n\nBetween 1985 and 2005 the Kentucky Foundation for Women awarded 1298 grants to individuals and organizations totaling $7,140,831.\n\nHopscotch House is a program of the Kentucky Foundation for Women; it is first and foremost an artist retreat center for feminist artists. It is also used by a variety of groups and organizations that are working to better the lives of women and girls in Kentucky.\n\nHopscotch House was purchased by the Kentucky Foundation for Women in 1987 and was first used by a group of women writers known as the Wolf Pen Writer's Colony. In the early 1990s Hopscotch House became available to other women artists and women's groups. Over the years, Hopscotch House has served hundreds of women including artists, activists, feminists, eco-feminists, art critique groups, drumming circles, quilting groups, social justice groups, girls' empowerment groups, arts organizations, and social service organizations.\n\nThe property is considered a \"classic\" Kentucky farmstead and is located 13 miles east of downtown Louisville.

{"id": "383805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383805", "title": "Liberty Leading the People", "text": "Liberty Leading the People\n\nLiberty Leading the People ( ) is a painting by Eugène Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, which toppled King Charles X of France. A woman personifying the concept and the Goddess of Liberty leads the people forward over a barricade and the bodies of the fallen, holding the flag of the French Revolution – the tricolour, which again became France's national flag after these events – in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The figure of Liberty is also viewed as a symbol of France and the French Republic known as Marianne.\n\nBy the time Delacroix painted \"Liberty Leading the People\", he was already the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school in French painting. Delacroix, who was born as the Age of Enlightenment was giving way to the ideas and style of romanticism, rejected the emphasis on precise drawing that characterised the academic art of his time, and instead gave a new prominence to freely brushed colour.\n\nDelacroix painted his work in the autumn of 1830. In a letter to his brother dated 21 October, he wrote: \"My bad mood is vanishing thanks to hard work. I’ve embarked on a modern subject—a barricade. And if I haven’t fought for my country at least I’ll paint for her.\" The painting was first exhibited at the official Salon of 1831.\n\nDelacroix depicted Liberty as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. The mound of corpses acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the romantic era.\n\nThe fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, a student from the prestigious École Polytechnique wearing the traditional bicorne, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols. What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute \"tricolore\" can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre Dame.\n\nThe identity of the man in the top hat has been widely debated. The suggestion that it was a self-portrait by Delacroix has been discounted by modern art historians. In the late 19th century, it was suggested the model was the theatre director Étienne Arago; others have suggested the future curator of the Louvre, Frédéric Villot; but there is no firm consensus on this point.\n\nSeveral of the figures are probably borrowed from a print by popular artist Nicolas Charlet, a prolific illustrator who Delacroix believed captured, more than anyone else, the peculiar energy of the Parisians.\n\nThe French government bought the painting in 1831 for 3,000 francs with the intention of displaying it in the throne room of the Palais du Luxembourg as a reminder to the \"citizen-king\" Louis-Philippe of the July Revolution, through which he had come to power. This plan did not come to fruition and the canvas hung in the palace's museum gallery for a few months, before being removed due to its inflammatory political message. After the June Rebellion of 1832, it was returned to the artist. According to Albert Boime,\n\nChampfleury wrote in August 1848 that it had been “hidden in an attic for being too revolutionary.” Although Louis-Philippe's Ministry of the Interior initially acquired it as a gesture to the Left, after the uprising at the funeral of Lamarque in June 1832 it was never again openly displayed for fear of setting a bad example. Delacroix was permitted to send the painting to his aunt Félicité for safekeeping. It was exhibited briefly in 1848, after the Republic was restored in the revolution of that year, and then in the Salon of 1855. In 1874, the painting entered the collection of Palais du Louvre in Paris.\n\nIn 1974–75, the work was the featured work in an exhibit organized by the French government, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Detroit Institute of Arts as a Bicentennial gift to the people of the United States. The exhibit, entitled \"French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution\", marked a rare display of the Delacroix painting, and many of the other 148 works, outside France. The exhibit was first shown at the Grand Palais from 16 November 1974 to 3 February 1975. It moved to Detroit from 5 March to 4 May 1975, then New York from 12 June to 7 September 1975.\n\nIn 1999, it was flown on board an Airbus Beluga from Paris to Tokyo via Bahrain and Calcutta in about 20 hours. The large canvas, measuring high by long, was too large to fit into a Boeing 747. It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurised container provided with isothermal protection and an anti-vibration device.\n\nIn 2012, it was moved to the new Louvre-Lens museum in Lens, Pas-de-Calais, as the starring work in the first tranche of paintings from the Louvre's collection to be installed. On 7 February 2013, the painting was vandalized by a visitor in Lens. An unidentified 28-year-old woman allegedly wrote an inscription (\"AE911\") on the painting. The woman was immediately arrested by a security guard and a visitor. A short time after the incident, the management of the Louvre and its Pas-de-Calais branch published a press release indicating that \"at first glance, the inscription is superficial and should be easily removed\". Louvre officials announced the next day that the writing had been removed in less than two hours by a restorer without damaging the original paint, and the piece returned to display that morning.\n\nAlthough Delacroix was not the first artist to depict Liberty in Phrygian cap, his painting may be the best known early version of the figure commonly known as Marianne, a symbol of the French Republic and of France in general.\n\nThe painting may have influenced Victor Hugo's novel \"Les Misérables\". In particular, the character of Gavroche is widely believed to have been inspired by the figure of the pistol-wielding boy running over the barricade. The novel describes the events of the June Rebellion two years after the revolution celebrated in the painting, the same rebellion that led to its being removed from public view.\n\nThe painting inspired Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi's \"Liberty Enlightening the World\", known as the Statue of Liberty in New York City, which was given to the United States as a gift from the French a half-century after \"Liberty Leading the People\" was painted. The statue, which holds a torch in its hand, takes a more stable, immovable stance than that of the woman in the painting. An engraved version of part of the painting, along with a depiction of Delacroix, was featured on the 100 franc note from 1978 to 1995.\n\nThe painting has had an influence on classical music. George Antheil titled his Symphony No. 6 \"After Delacroix\", and stated that the work was inspired by \"Liberty Leading the People\". The imagery was adapted by Robert Ballagh to commemorate Ireland's independence struggle on an Irish postage stamp in 1979, the centenary of the birth of Pádraig Pearse, and the painting was used for the band Coldplay's album cover \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\", with the words \"Viva La Vida\" written in white. The cover of the book \"Enough is Enough: How to Build a New Republic\" by Fintan O'Toole references the painting, but with Kathleen Ni Houlihan holding the Irish tricolour in Dublin while the leaders of the three main political parties at the time (Brian Cowen, Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore) lie on the ground.\n\nDuring the 20 October 2011 episode of the BBC Radio 4 series In Our Time, host Melvyn Bragg led a panel discussion of painting.\n\n\"Liberty Leading the People\" is considered to be a republican and anti-monarchist symbol, and thus was sometimes criticized, especially by royalists and monarchists.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress have been presented since the 1st ceremony, while the awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress have been presented since the 9th ceremony. Of the 919 Academy Award nominees in an acting category, a total of 338 have received two or more acting nominations (167 men, 171 women). Meryl Streep is the most nominated performer in the acting categories, with 21 nominations between 1979 and 2018.\n\nAs well as the record for total number of acting nominations, Streep holds the record for most Best Actress nominations with 17, ahead of Katharine Hepburn with 12 and Bette Davis with 10. Jack Nicholson is the most nominated male performer in the acting categories with 12 nominations. The most Best Actor nominations is nine, for both Spencer Tracy and Laurence Olivier (Nicholson has eight). Thelma Ritter is the most nominated in the Best Supporting Actress category with six, while in the Best Supporting Actor category six actors have each received four nominations, they are Walter Brennan, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy, Jack Nicholson, Robert Duvall and Jeff Bridges. The record for most nominations in the acting categories without a win, is eight by Peter O'Toole, followed by Richard Burton with seven, and Deborah Kerr, Thelma Ritter and Glenn Close all with six. Both O'Toole and Kerr did receive the Academy's Honorary Oscar.\n\nThe 185 performers listed below are the 179 who have received three or more Academy Award nominations in the four acting categories plus the six performers who have two wins from two nominations.\n\nListed are the actors with three or more nominations plus those with two wins from two nominations.\n\n\nABette Davis' performance in \"Of Human Bondage\" (1934) and Paul Muni's performance in \"Black Fury\" (1935) were not nominated for Oscars. As a result of Davis's failure to get a nomination, several influential people campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year, and the following year also, the Academy allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible. At the 6th, 7th and 8th Academy Awards, the Academy publicly announced those that placed second and third in the vote. Davis placed third ahead of one official nominee and Muni placed second, ahead of three official nominees, and both Davis and Muni are listed on the Academy's official database as write-in nominees who placed in the final voting. From the 9th Academy Awards, the nominating committees were no longer used and the entire membership of each individual branch voted for the nominees in their respective categories.<br>\nBLaurence Olivier received a total of 13 Oscar nominations, winning two. In addition to his 10 acting nominations (one win), he received two Best Picture nominations; for producing 1944 film \"Henry V\" (released in the US in 1946) and 1948 film \"Hamlet\" (for which he won), and received a Best Director nomination for \"Hamlet\". Olivier also received two Honorary Oscars; one for bringing \"Henry V\" to the screen, and a second in 1979 for Lifetime Achievement.<br>\nCDenzel Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Shirley MacLaine and Bradley Cooper have all received an additional nomination in a non-acting category. MacLaine received an additional nomination in the Best Documentary Feature category as co-director of the 1975 documentary \"\". Washington, DiCaprio and Cooper have received an additional nomination in the Best Picture category, Washington for co-producing \"Fences\" (2016), DiCaprio for co-producing \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013), and Cooper for co-producing \"American Sniper\" (2014)<br>\nDRules at the time of the first three Academy Award ceremonies allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film. At the 1st ceremony, Emil Jannings won Best Actor for his work in two films and Janet Gaynor won Best Actress for her work in three films. Richard Barthelmess also received a nomination for two films at the 1st ceremony. At the 3rd ceremony, George Arliss, Maurice Chevalier, Ronald Colman, Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer all received a single nomination for their work in two films. This is why the Academy lists Colman and Garbo as three-time nominees and Shearer as a five-time nominee. Barthelmess, Arliss and Chevalier are one-time nominees, so do not feature in the above lists. No official reason was ever given as to why Arliss and Shearer were named Best Actor and Best Actress for only one of the two films for which they were listed.<br>\nEAt the 2nd Academy Awards only the Best Actor and Best Actress winners were announced. There was no announcement of nominations. The official Academy site states that \"although not official nominations, the additional names in each category, according to in-house records, were under consideration by various boards of judges\". Although unofficial, Ruth Chatterton's nomination at the 2nd ceremony (the first of her two) counts towards her total in the above lists, and Paul Muni's nomination at the 2nd ceremony, counts as one of his five nominations in the above lists (his write-in vote from 1935 is not counted).<br>\nFGeorge Clooney, Emma Thompson, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon have all won Oscars in non-acting categories. Clooney has eight Oscar nominations (four for acting, two for writing, one for directing and one for producing) with two wins. In addition to his win for Best Supporting Actor, he won Best Picture for co-producing \"Argo\" (2012). Thompson is a five-time nominee with two wins. In addition to her Best Actress win, she won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995). Pitt is a six-time Oscar nominee (three for acting, three for producing). He won an Oscar for co-producing Best Picture winner \"12 Years a Slave\" (2013). Damon is a five-time nominee (three for acting, one for writing and one for co-producing 2016 Best Picture nominee \"Manchester by the Sea\"), winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (shared with Ben Affleck) for \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997).<br>\nGAt the 1st Academy Award ceremony, Charlie Chaplin received four nominations (including Best Actor) for his film \"The Circus\", before the Academy decided to remove his name from the competitive categories and instead honor him with a special award. A letter sent by the Academy to Chaplin told him that they had \"Unanimously decided that your name should be removed from the competitive classes, and that a special award be conferred upon you for writing, acting, directing and producing \"The Circus\". The collective accomplishments thus displayed place you in a class by yourself\". Chaplin went on to receive nominations for Best Actor, Best Writing and Best Picture (the latter credited to Charlie Chaplin Productions) for the 1940 film \"The Great Dictator\" and a Best Writing nomination for the 1947 film \"Monsieur Verdoux\". He received a second Honorary Oscar at the 44th Academy Awards in 1972, before winning his first competitive Oscar at the 45th Academy Awards in 1973 for Best Original Dramatic Score for his 1952 film \"Limelight\", which was eligible for that years Oscars because it was not released in Los Angeles until 1972.\n\n"}

{"id": "14116843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14116843", "title": "Multiverse (DC Comics)", "text": "Multiverse (DC Comics)\n\nThe Multiverse, within DC Comics publications, is a \"cosmic construct\" collecting many of the fictional universes in which the published stories take place. The worlds in this multiverse share a space and fate in common, and its structure has changed several times in the history of DC Comics.\n\nThe concept of a universe and a multiverse in which the fictional stories take place was loosely established during the Golden Age. With the publication of \"All-Star Comics\" #3 in 1940, the first crossover between characters occurred with the creation of the Justice Society of America (JSA), which presented the first superhero team with characters appearing in other publications (comic strips and anthology titles) to bring attention to less-known characters. This established the first shared \"universe\", as all these heroes now lived in the same world. Prior to this publication, characters from the different comic books seemingly existed in different worlds.\n\nLater, \"Wonder Woman\" #59 (May 1953) presented DC Comics's first story depicting a parallel \"mirror\" world. Wonder Woman is transported to a twin Earth where she meets Tara Terruna who is exactly like her. Tara Terruna means \"Wonder Woman\" in the native language of that world. Wonder Woman describes this world as being a twin world existing alongside Earth with duplicates of everyone but with a different development. The concept of different versions of the world and its heroes was revisited in the pages of \"Wonder Woman\" a few times later.\n\nLed by editor Julius Schwartz and writer Gardner Fox, DC Comics's super heroes were given a \"reboot\" with the publication of \"Showcase\" #4 in 1956, where a new version of the Flash made his first appearance. The success of this new Flash led the creation of new incarnations of the Golden Age characters who only shared the names and powers but had different secret identities, origins and stories. Later, new versions of other heroes, Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, were also restarted by retelling their origins but keeping their secret identities.\nGardner Fox, who worked before in the creation of the JSA, where other heroes met for the first time, created the story \"Flash of Two Worlds\" in \"The Flash\" #123, where Barry Allen, the new Flash, is transported to the Earth where the original Flash, Jay Garrick, existed. To Allen, Jay Garrick's world was a work of fiction as it was in the real world. This story not only presented the encounter of two worlds and the existence of the Multiverse for the first time, it also presented key features of the Multiverse: all the universes vibrate at a specific frequency which keeps them separated; these \"barriers\" could be trespassed by \"tuning\" to that vibration. Because people could also \"tune-in\" these worlds in dreams, some people wrote comic books with the stories from those worlds they dreamed, which explained why Barry Allen knew about Jay Garrick as a fictional character.\n\nThe success of this story led to the first team crossover between the new Justice League of America (JLA) and the Golden Age JSA, in the stories \"Crisis on Earth-One\" (\"Justice League of America\" #21) and \"Crisis on Earth-Two\" (\"Justice League of America\" #22). This story arc started the tradition of a yearly crossover between the JLA and the JSA, and established firmly the concept of a Multiverse and the designation of names, Earth-One being the JLA reality and Earth-Two the JSA reality. The success of these crossovers spawned publications telling the further stories of the Golden Age heroes in the present day parting from many of the stories told, thus, establishing a more defined continuity for every Universe.\n\nThis concept of parallel Earths with differences in locations, persons and historical events became a very important ingredient within DC Comics' publications. It helped (among other things) to explain continuity errors, to retell and retcon stories, and to incorporate foreign elements that could actively interact with everything else and allow them to have an \"existence\". Continuity flaws between the established Earth-Two and several stories from the Golden Age were given separate Earths. \"Imaginary\" stories and some time divergences of Earth-One were given also separate realities (such as Earth-B and Earth-A). In addition to the stories appearing mainly in the pages of \"JLA\" that created new Earths, the acquisition of other comic book companies and characters by DC Comics incorporated these new properties as Earths in the Multiverse which would interact several times with the \"main\" Earths, One and Two; two of the most notable being Earth-S for the Fawcett Comics characters, and Earth-X for the Quality Comics characters. By the 1970s, everything that was published or related officially to DC Comics' titles could become part of the Multiverse, although much of it remained largely uncatalogued.\n\nThe names of the worlds were usually in the format \"Earth, hyphen, spelled numeral/letter/name\". In the case of worlds with numerals, the \"rule\" of spelling the number was not always followed, even within the pages of the same issue.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of DC Comics drew near, major events were proposed for the celebration: an encyclopedia (\"Who's Who in the DC Universe\") and a crossover of the ages, characters, and worlds appearing in DC's comics. As told in the letter section of \"Crisis On Infinite Earths\" #1, as the research started in the late 1970s, it became evident that there were many flaws in continuity. The way used to circumvent some of these errors was the \"Multiple Earths\", which also showed a chaotic nature that brought even more continuity problems that were not easily explained or were simply left unexplained. Examples of this included: 1) Black Canary of Earth-One being the daughter of the original Black Canary of WWII even though the original Black Canary was a resident of Earth-Two, and 2) the existence of Golden Age comic books on Earth-One and the people not noticing that some of the characters in those comic books existed in \"real-life\". In addition, many universes had multiple alternate timelines, such as Kamandi and the Legion of Super-Heroes, both being from Earth-One.\n\nWriter Marv Wolfman took this crossover event as an opportunity to reform all the fictional universe of DC Comics to avoid further continuity errors and update the DC characters to modern times. The whole Multiverse is destroyed except for five Earths (Silver Age Earth-One, Golden Age Earth-Two, Charlton Comics' Earth-Four, Fawcett Comics' Earth-S and Quality Comics' Freedom Fighters' Earth-X). Later, the universe is recreated as one single universe from those five.\n\nThe \"Convergence\" (2015) crossover event officially retconned the events of \"Crisis\" after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse.\n\nAfter the conclusion of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the concept of a single Universe containing most elements of the \"surviving Earths\" was established and heavily enforced to avoid the continuity problems of the Multiverse. However, alternate realities that affected the new DC Universe appeared very quickly. In \"Superman\" Vol. 2 #8, a Universe inside the Universe was revealed to have been created to preserve the Legion of Super Heroes' 30th century in New Earth. This world was used to allow crossovers with certain characters of the Legion of Super-Heroes and recreate characters that otherwise could not exist in the new continuity (such as Kryptonians, as in the New Earth Superman was the only survivor of Krypton). Alternate timelines were also used, the most notable event being \"Armageddon 2001\" in 1991. An Antimatter Universe existed as well, which had some \"reversed\" events in a similar way as the former Earth-Three. The Earth within this Universe was called \"Earth 2\". In addition, there was a Limbo, where some heroes and characters that could not be brought back to \"existence\" after the Crisis on Infinite Earths lived outside the Universe.\n\nAn important rule in the new DC Universe was that there could only be one timeline, so any change caused by time travelers caused the destruction of their timelines of origin. Changes in the past were often \"fixed\" or have to comply with the present to prevent continuity errors.\n\nNonetheless, continuity errors appeared. The retold origin of Hawkman presented errors regarding the existence of the Golden Age version (Carter Hall) and the Silver Age version (Katar Hol) in the same continuity without a good explanation. The interaction of \"possible timelines\" also created continuity holes. This led to a new crisis to address the problem: the . The resulting universe had a slightly re-written story with no continuity errors even though it was acknowledged that reality-shattering events did happen (including the Crisis on Infinite Earths). This Universe kept the concept of one universe, one timeline. Such timeline was \"mapped\" from beginning to present (1994) at the back cover of \"Zero Hour\" #0, that also included certain key dates in the future.\n\nThe need to publish stories outside the strict DC Universe continuity led to the creation of certain DC imprints. Stories that set DC characters in different situations after the Crisis on Infinite Earths, were published by DC Comics under the Elseworlds imprint. None of these stories were ever intended to be included in the \"real\" continuity of the DC Universe.\n\nCertain characters were reinvented in a mature context and were published under the Vertigo imprint. Most of the times, the characters depicted within the Vertigo imprint had no relation to the original DC Universe's versions, nor did the events have influence over the new Universe.\n\nLater, under a special publishing deal with Milestone Media, DC Comics published a new series of comic books that told the stories of the heroes living in Dakota City, formed mostly by African-American superheroes and other minorities. These characters lived in a universe separated from the DC Universe (known as the Dakotaverse or Milestone Universe). The event known as \"Worlds Collide\" presented one of the first modern intercompany crossovers within the established continuity of the Universes instead of being \"imaginary\" and showed that there could be other universes or even multiverses outside the new DC Universe.\n\nIn a similar way to \"Worlds Collide\", the crossover event \"DC vs. Marvel\" showed another in-continuity crossover with another reality completely separated from the DC Universe and that has a Multiverse of its own: the universe of Earth-616 of the Marvel Multiverse.\n\nThe universes were rarely referred to with specific names within the stories but were named in the \"Real World\" (both officially and unofficially) using the name of the editorial, imprint or even an element in particular. While in the comic books the concept of a \"real\" Multiverse was avoided, the Multiverse played an important role in cartoon series and live-action shows (see Other versions).\n\nIn summary, from 1986 to 1999, everything not happening in the \"mainstream\" continuity appearing in DC comics was either an \"apocryphal\" story or happened in a completely different and separate reality/universe/multiverse.\n\nIn 1999, the unexpected and overwhelming success of Elseworlds's \"Kingdom Come\" and other stories, led to the creation of the concept known as Hypertime in order to publish crossovers with those characters and the mainstream continuity. This structure gave \"existence\" to alternate timelines, stories in Elseworlds, appearances in other media and any other appearance of DC characters in the past. The main timeline or \"Central Timeline\" was like a river and all of the alternate stories were branches of it. Hypertime was similar to the former Multiverse as it allowed each and every reality ever published to co-exist and interact as most branches tend to return to the original stream (explaining some retcons as well as crossovers). However, all realities existed within only one Universe.\n\nOriginally, the stories appearing in WildStorm Productions' comic books occurred in a Universe that was part of the Image Universe along with other characters appearing in Image Comics publications. It was separated from it during the event called Shattered Image consolidating the separate WildStorm Universe which had its own multiversal structure. After the purchase of WildStorm by DC Comics, crossovers occurred with the new DC Universe, which were still separated just like Milestone and Marvel.\n\nIn 2005, a new universal crisis story arc was published as a way to update once more the super heroes of DC Comics, bring together other \"realities\" (namely, Milestone and Wildstorm) and bring back the Multiverse, this time with a limited number of Earths instead of infinite.\n\nDuring the event \"Infinite Crisis\", the Universe was \"splintered\" and the original Multiverse was restored briefly, showing that the entire Hypertime and many other appearances of the DC characters were part of the original Multiverse, including Tangent Comics which were published 12 years after the Multiverse was no more. In the end of \"Infinite Crisis\", the multiverse is merged back as a New Earth with a new continuity with many stories re-written and many others from the Modern Age still happening.\n\nIn parallel, \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\" tells the story of how Captain Atom of the DC Universe causes the recreation of the Wildstorm Universe upon its destruction (and possibly its Multiverse as well). The recreated universe became part of the newly recreated DC Universe.\n\nThe aftermath of \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\" (\"52\", \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" and \"Final Crisis\") showed that a new Multiverse was created. The new Multiverse consisted of 52 positive matter universes, an Antimatter Universe and a Limbo. The main continuity still occurred in New Earth (also called Earth-0), Earths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 resembled Earths One, Two, Three, Four, S, and X of the original Multiverse respectively. Earths 13 and 50 were Vertigo and the rebooted Wildstorm Universe, while Earth-17 became the world of a revived post-apocalypse Atomic Knights after a mid-80s World War III once more. Many important stories from the Elseworlds imprint were later also given their own alternate Earths within this new Multiverse.\n\nIn the miniseries, \"Milestone Forever\", in a similar fashion as \"Captain Atom: Armageddon\", the events that led to the end of the Dakotaverse and its integration to the new DC continuity are revealed. Most of the stories that were told in Milestone Comics publications now occurred in New Earth and the Dakotaverse ceased to exist as a separated Universe.\n\nA naming convention was established and followed this time in the format \"Earth, hyphen, numeral\", from Earth-0 to Earth-51.\n\nEven with a new Multiverse, not every published or related work had an \"Earth\" within the 52 and there were no in-continuity intercompany crossovers.\n\nTaking advantage of the fact that many of these universes were mostly unchronicled or merely glimpsed and that \"Final Crisis\" also changed the Multiverse slightly, many stories featuring alternate worlds and their interactions were published, which led certain inconsistencies and retcons to appear, such as Earth-1 being originally a \"mirror\" of Earth-One and later being the reality of J. Michael Straczynski's \"\" or Earth-16 being the home of an alternate Superman/Christopher Kent, the home of the \"Super-Sons\", and later the reality of the \"Young Justice\" TV series. Also, some universes appearing in the new continuity were never given a proper place within the 52 Universe, such as Prime-Earth.\n\nThe new restored universe with only 52 worlds opened myriad possibilities for new stories and crossovers with different versions of heroes interacting with the main versions of heroes as well as the stories resulting from the new integrated characters from Milestone and Wildstorm. However, it became chaotic in just five years. Many stories and situations of other Universes were not followed well. The number designations could be completely disregarded from story to story and some universes were recreated over and over. In addition, as most of the history of the Modern Age was still being the main continuity, younger readers could not follow the stories of the mainstream versions of the DC heroes, just as had happened prior to the original \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".\n\nIn order to overcome these new problems, a new event was created to restart the DC Comics's Universe. In the \"Flashpoint\" miniseries (May–September 2011), the Flash alters the timeline of Earth-0 creating a ripple effect that affected several past events, Earth-13 (Vertigo Universe) and Earth-50 (new Wildstorm Universe). Similar to the end result of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", a new mainstream Earth is created from the former three, with a whole new history. Most of the stories have been retold anew but certain events of New Earth remain (such as Batgirl being crippled by the Joker). Since it was established after \"Infinite Crisis\" that if something ever happened to the main Universe, the whole Multiverse could be affected as well, a new Multiverse of 52 worlds was also recreated. This new Multiverse is called \"The New 52\".\n\nThis time, not all universes were revealed right away, only a couple were revealed in the first two years of \"The New 52\". In addition, in a similar fashion as the Elseworlds logo would appear in comics that did not occur in the \"real\" continuity, the logo \"THE NEW 52!\" would only appear in publications with stories occurring in the new continuity, while those taking place outside of this new continuity (such as \"Smallville: Season 11\" or the \"Batman Beyond\" universe) would not bear this distinction. At first it seemed that there was not going to be a naming convention for the Earths as it happened with the 52. The mainstream continuity was known as Prime Earth, although it was not a similar world to the real world as Earth-Prime was. J. Michael Straczynski's re-envisioning of classic Batman and Superman stories was released as part of a series called \"Earth One\". In Grant Morrison's \"The Multiversity\" (2014–2015), the Earths are named in the same format as in the former 52 Multiverse (Earth-6, Earth-7, Earth-8 etc.) Morrison intended for \"The Multiversity\" to reveal remaining universes of The New 52 multiverse, and the underlying structure for the multiverse was revealed in a detailed map in the back of several comic books, for which an interactive online version is being maintained and updated on the DC Comics website. In addition, the sixth issue of \"The Multiversity\" constituted a 'guidebook' to the worlds of the current DC multiverse and was published in January 2015.\n\nOn October 2, 2011, Dan DiDio posted on his Facebook page that in The New 52, the three previous \"crises\" did not occur in this new continuity, but other events such as \"Zero Hour\" still happened, without ending in a crisis/reboot. However, writers continued to make references to the crises, and the full history of the structure of the DC Multiverse, detailing previous crisis events, was given in Grant Morrison's \"The Multiversity\" (2014–2015) limited series.\n\nThe \"Convergence\" (2015) crossover event later explored this concept within the DCU. This miniseries brought back several heroes from the ages of DC Comics that were obliterated by the crisis events. They were trapped by a godlike incarnation of Brainiac outside of time (or Vanishing Point as this \"place\" is called). At the end of the crossover, Brainiac sent these heroes back to their own timelines, and also successfully sent \"Zero Hour\" Hal Jordan, pre-\"Flashpoint\" Superman and other heroes back to the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" so that the collapse of the Multiverse could be averted.\n\nFrom July 2015 onwards, The New 52 marking ended with the continuation of several publications and new others that did not necessarily take place within \"The New 52\" multiverse. Advertised as \"DC YOU\" (a pun of DCU or DC Universe and the phrase \"it's about you, the fans\" appearing in the advertisements), DC now has an \"open doors\" policy to continuity, granting writers greater freedom to explore stories set outside the established New 52 Multiverse continuity, as well as to revisit other characters and concepts from DC's history as the conclusion of \"Convergence\" suggested that although the core 52 universe that now exists is the evolution of the multiverse, all the worlds still exist in some form. This was confirmed by \"Convergence\" writer Jeff King, as he stated that the reconstituted DC Multiverse is now infinite and there might be more than one Multiverse.\n\nThe 2016 \"DC Rebirth\" initiative returned the original Wally West to Earth from the Speed Force and reveals that time has been stolen from his friends' memories, and the Superman of the pre-\"Flashpoint\" world, stranded in the new timeline following \"Convergence\", assumes the role of that Earth's Superman. In \"Action Comics\" #976, the pre-\"Flashpoint\" and \"New 52\" Supermen's histories are merged. Peter J. Tomasi explains that \"The events of \"Action\" #976 reset and reshape the entire Superman timeline. Where there had been two Superman, their realities have now been fused into one timeline with just one of them.\"\n\nAs told in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #7, the DC Universe was a single positive matter Universe until a scientist named Krona from the planet Oa altered the very moment of the creation of the Universe, causing it to split into countless similar universes and an antimatter universe. Oa, however, had no duplicates in the Multiverse but did have a twin in the antimatter universe: Qward. A satellite on each of these planets was created in the cataclysm and it was there where the embodiments of the Multiverse were born: the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor. The two battled to a standstill and eventually rendered one another comatose.\n\nThe Multiverse had countless duplicates of planet Earth. Every Earth had a different history from one another but they always developed heroes and inspired heroic ages (which, according to Harbinger, it somehow made them a focal point among all the worlds in every universe). Some of the heroes of Earth knew about other Earths and their own counterparts and fought side by side on many occasions.\n\nLater, a scientist from one universe named Kell Mossa (known initially only as Pariah) created another device that would allow him to attempt the same thing Krona had attempted before. His actions accidentally awakened the Anti-Monitor, who then devoured Pariah's entire universe (aside from Pariah himself) and began to do the same to other universes (Pariah originally believes that the opposite is true; that his experiment destroyed the universes, which awakened the Anti-Monitor, until the truth is revealed to him). The time period of Earth when this takes place or the name of this Earth are never revealed.\n\nThe Monitor is awakened by the destruction of the positive matter universes and starts a plan to save the Multiverse but his efforts, and later those of his protégé, Harbinger, with the help of the heroes of the Multiverse, only manage to save five universes. In a desperate effort to save all existence, heroes and villains unite in order to stop Krona from splitting the Universe and stop the Anti-Monitor from altering the moment of creation and make the Antimatter Universe the only one. They succeed in saving all existence but in the process, the Multiverse, its countless duplicate worlds and its history ceased to exist. The five universes that were saved were folded together into a single universe, placing all the heroes and villains into a single timeline. For example, Justice Society of Earth-Two instead became a team active in the 1940s that inspired the Justice League to form decades later. And in the event of any duplicate characters, the original Earth-One version would take precedence.\n\nAll the universes existed within the same space but had a unique vibration that kept them separated. Only by \"tuning\" to the specific frequency of a universe could a person leap to another Earth, as Barry Allen discovered as he tried to perform a disappearing act by vibrating his molecules at super speed (\"Flash\" #123). The \"speedster\" later developed a machine called the \"Cosmic Treadmill\", which, when it was used by people who controlled the Speed Force, it allowed the users to trespass the \"vibrational barriers\". Magic and cosmic incidents also made many people to travel to other universes.\n\nEvery universe could have its own dimensions, such as the Fifth Dimension (where Mr. Mxyztplk (Earth-Two), Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite (both Earth-One) came from), alternate timelines (Kamandi and the 30th Century of Earth-One) and realms (Hell, Heaven, Gemworld, etc.). In addition to the unique Antimatter Universe, the dimension of the New Gods (the Fourth World) was also believed unique, although there is evidence that there could have been alternate versions of them (as those appearing in Earth-17 and Earth-Crossover).\n\nEven though the interaction between multiple Earths was common in the 20th century with relative safety and ease, most of the population of Earth was unaware of the Multiverse until the Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nThe following is a short list of the most notable universes in the Multiverse.\n\n15 billion years ago, a single universe with a single timestream was created. 4.4 billion years ago, Krona, the renegade Maltusian (a race of highly evolved beings) creates the Antimatter Universe and releases entropy in the universe by linking the beginning and the end of the timeline in his attempts to reveal the secrets of the creation of the universe.\n\nIn this single universe, the timeline was destroyed in the early 1990s by Hal Jordan (possessed by Parallax) and created a slightly changed timeline (\"Zero Hour\", 1994). It was later revealed that this \"Central Timeline\" was like a river with branches. These branches were like different realities, the history of Earth was different in every branch and everything could be possible in them. They could affect the Central Timeline as they return to the mainstream and the heroes could encounter with different versions of themselves. However, they were somewhat ephemeral as the Central Timeline is the only one that could prevail (\"The Kingdom\", 1999).\n\nAfter \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", there was no place for alternate realities, although they could exist in the form of ephemeral timelines (Hypertime), dimensions (such as the fifth dimension or the Fourth World) or universes inside the Universe (such as the Legion of Super-Heroes' pocket universe or the Amalgam Universe).\n\nHowever, there was contact with realities that existed outside the Universe such as those from Marvel, Milestone and Wildstorm. The collection of universes, multiverses and others that are unrelated, is most of the time called the Megaverse. Some also call it the Omniverse, but tend to include the Real World when using this denomination.\n\nThe contact of these worlds usually brought cataclysms, the one being the most common, amalgamation. Traveling between these realities was extremely hard, only two characters were capable of doing so with natural abilities: Rift, who existed in both the DC and Milestone Universes, and Access, who had the task of keeping the DC and Marvel Universes separated to prevent amalgamation.\n\nMost of the time, these events were either forgotten (as shown in the \"Unlimited Access\" miniseries as Access has the power to annul or restore the memories of heroes) or believed to be \"dreams\" (as shown in \"DC/Milestone: Worlds Collide\" and \"DC/Wildstorm: Dreamwar\"), which in the end left few traces of the events in the respective continuities.\n\nThe Wildstorm Universe was part of a larger multiverse but was separated after a multiversal cataclysm, forming a multiverse of its own (\"Shattered Image\"). Organizations known as Planetary and the Authority were capable of traveling across the Multiverse and were also able to map it. Its structure was described as a web of 196,833 universes arranged in a pattern resembling a snowflake, each universe separated from its neighbors by a medium called the Bleed. The Bleed prevented the Universes from colliding and was inhabited by \"fauna\" that despised all different Earths.\n\nAlexander Luthor Jr. of Earth-Three and Superboy of Earth-Prime grew tired of their exile. After successfully escaping their prison, they seek to restore their worlds and search for a perfect new world, as they believe the happenings at New Earth after the Crisis make it a flawed reality. The whole Multiverse is restored, but with great instability that could cause the end of all existence (\"Infinite Crisis\"). Parallel to these events, Captain Atom arrives in a different multiverse, jeopardizing its very existence. Void destroys the now-corrupted universe in order to recreate it (\"Captain Atom: Armageddon\").\n\nThe heroes of Earth manage to merge back the Multiverse into a single universe, but it could not hold so much energy. 52 identical worlds are created to liberate such energy. Mister Mind, finally in his ultimate form, has the power to devour parts of the time continuum, literally eating parts of the Earths' history and creating major differences between each other (\"52\").\n\nIn the Universe where the city of Dakota existed, a man known as Dharma foresaw the final demise of Earth and searched for a way to avert it. His very efforts were responsible for the apocalypse he tried to prevent. He managed to salvage the remains of his Earth by merging them to the main Earth of the new Multiverse that was reformed after the death of the New Gods (\"Milestone Forever\", \"Final Crisis\").\n\nThis Multiverse consisted of only 52 worlds, 51 resting upon Earth-0. According to Rip Hunter in \"52 #52\", every universe occupied the same space, each on a different vibrational plane (as it was in the original Multiverse). However, it was stated later that the universes were also separated by a fluid known as the Bleed (just like in the former Wildstorm Universe). The Bleed is interconnected to the Source Wall (which separates existence from the force that created it or \"the Source\") and the Multiversal Nexus, where the 52 Monitors watched over the Multiverse and had the task of avoiding contacts between the universes that could cause cataclysms. If Earth-0 should be destroyed, it would cause a chain reaction, destroying the rest of the 51 universes and leaving the opposite Antimatter Universe solely in existence. Each of the alternate universes have their own parallel dimensions, divergent timelines, microverses, etc., branching off them. The Monitors originated in a world called Nil and were a sort of descendants of the original Monitor, who was created by Overvoid, a limitless intelligence who investigated the Multiverse at the beginning of time. Nix Uotan, the Monitor of Earth-51 erased the Monitors, as they self-proclaimed themselves the judges of what happened in the worlds of the Multiverse.\n\nThe Flash wakes up in an altered timeline. As he tries to find the cause, he discovers that he was responsible for the alteration and attempts to fix it. In doing so, it is revealed that the timelines of Earth-0, Earth-13 and Earth-50 were originally one, but were splintered. The result is a new timeline formed by those three and along with it came a new history for the other 52 worlds within the Multiverse (\"Flashpoint\", 2011). It is later revealed that, in actuality, the current timeline was created when a mysterious being (implied to be Doctor Manhattan from \"Watchmen\") entered the Multiverse while the timeline was resetting due to Barry Allen preventing the Flashpoint event and extracted ten years from continuity (\"DC Universe: Rebirth\", 2016)\n\nYears later, the Harbinger Program at the House of Heroes gathers several superheroes of the \"Orrery of Worlds\" to fight against a force known as the \"Gentry\" who has already decimated Earth-7 and threatens the rest of the worlds of the Multiverse. As the story unfolds, Earths within the Orrery are visited and reveal the new nature of them after the Flashpoint event. Also, mysterious comic books published by DC and Major Comics appear and are believed to be cursed or to be messages from parallel Earths (\"The Multiversity\" (2014)).\n\nSeveral stories and even the structure of the entire Multiverse have been retold after the events of \"Flashpoint\". As it has been revealed so far, most of the 52 worlds suffered drastic changes such as Earth-2 which is now a reboot in the present day of the heroes that formed the Justice Society or Earth-3 which reverted to be the opposite of the main Earth (Earth-0 in this case), instead of the opposite of Earth-Two. Others retain most of what they were in the 52 multiverse such as Earth-5, Earth-10, or Earth-23. In addition, seven Earths remain undisclosed in composition or purpose, other than their creation by the Monitors for unknown reasons-Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49.\n\nThe Monitors are now described as a race of countless members and only 52 remained after the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" event, suggesting that there were Monitors for every world in the original Multiverse instead of just one. Several elements that have appeared across the history to what now is DC Comics have also been actively incorporated in the new structure, such as the Source Wall (\"The New Gods\"), the Bleed (Wildstorm's \"The Authority\"), the Speed Force and the vibrational barriers (\"The Flash\") and the Rock of Eternity (\"Shazam!\").\n\nThis new Multiverse has a sphere-like structure with several levels (or vibrational realms) as described in the map:\n\n\nAn infinitely powerful and god-like version of Brainiac abducted multiple superheroes and their core cities from various alternate Earths and eras of the Multiverse and pitted them against one another. Because of the heroes' efforts for the survival of reality during this event, the events of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" and \"Zero Hour\" were averted and there is once more an infinite Multiverse beyond the core 52 universes which have made up the local Multiverse since \"Infinite Crisis\" and \"Flashpoint\". The original Multiverse coexists along with the collapsed Earth, the core 52 worlds, and all other versions of the Multiverse that have ever existed.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, it is revealed that each reality of the Multiverse has a negative counterpart created by the fears of a universe's people. These Dark Universes are explained to be temporary realities, which motivate the Dark Knights to invade the Multiverse so that they can save their dying realities. Forthcoming \"Dark Multiverse\" stories will revisit this realm, with mutated versions of Superman, Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane.\n\nContact between the universes (or stories set on the other Earths) have been reprinted in the following graphic novels.\n\nIn the animated television series \"Super Friends\", the superhero team has encounters with other universes, including the world of Qward. In the episode \"Universe of Evil\", a freak accident causes Superman to switch places with his evil counterpart.\n\nThe DC animated universe (DCAU) has depicted the Multiverse many times. Several characters from the main DCAU have visited parallel universes that were similar to the DCAU.\n\n\nIn \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\", the show's primary protagonists, Lois Lane and Clark Kent, encountered an alternative version Clark Kent from a parallel universe in the episodes \"Tempus, Anyone?\" and \"Lois & Clarks\". In the episode \"Tempus, Anyone?\", the dimension included these differences:\n\n\nThe primary version of Lois, who was abducted by the villain Tempus and taken to this dimension, helped the alternate Clark become Superman, only to have Tempus expose his secret identity to the world on television. Despite Clark's alien origin, the world embraces him as their champion.\n\nLater in the episode \"Lois & Clarks\", the alternate Clark visits the primary \"L&C\" dimension to aid Lois in stopping Tempus while the Clark Kent of her world is trapped in a time vortex. After Tempus' defeat, it is implied that the alternate Clark would travel to the past with H.G. Wells and take his reality's Lois Lane to his own time thus, under a predestination paradox, explaining her disappearance.\n\n\nThe WildStorm comic book series \"Planetary\" also introduced the concept of a multiverse, drawing upon the mathematical concept known as the Monster group for inspiration. The multiverse is described as \"a theoretical snowflake existing in 196,833 dimensional space\", a reference to the visualization method used by some mathematicians when describing the Monster group.\n\nThe live-action television series \"Smallville\" also featured the Multiverse concept. In the season 5 episode \"Lexmas\", Lex Luthor visits an alternate timeline where Lionel cuts Lex out of the family fortune while Lex is married to Lana and has a son named Alexander. Clark Kent is a reporter with the Daily Planet, Chloe is publishing a book exposing LuthorCorp with Lex's help, and Jonathan Kent is a state senator.\n\nIn the season 7 episode \"Apocalypse,\" Clark is taken to an alternate timeline where his counterpart had not arrived in Smallville and is killed by Brainiac. In that dimension, Clark Kent encounters another version of himself who is a human biological son of Martha and Jonathan and never met Lana Lang (who is a cheerleader with a different group of friends). Also in this dimension, Chloe Sullivan is engaged, Lana Lang is a married woman living in Paris, Sheriff Nancy Adams left Smallville and works as a member of the government, and Lex Luthor became President of the United States. While this dimension's Earth is destroyed by President Luthor, Clark travels back in time and sends his infant self to Earth, thus restoring his timeline.\n\nIn the season 10 episode \"Luthor\", Clark Kent travels to an alternate universe dubbed Earth-2 with the help of a Kryptonian mirror box. There, Lionel Luthor is his adopted father instead of Jonathan Kent. Clark is a bloodthirsty tyrant whose persona is Ultraman. He has a relationship with his adopted sister, Tess. Clark Luthor killed his adoptive brother Lex. When Clark Kent travels to the alternate earth, his counterpart, Clark Luthor, travels to his. Lois Lane is engaged to Oliver Queen, who bought land in Smallville for its kryptonite. Lionel lures Clark into Oliver's kryponite trap and beats him. With the help of Oliver (who closes the kryponite portal), Clark uses the mirror box and returns to his world. Unbeknownst to him, Lionel comes with him.\n\nEarth-2 is featured again later in the season in the episode \"Kent\", as Clark Luthor returns to his counterpart's world once more, and Clark Kent meets Earth-2's Jonathan Kent. After Clark Kent interacts with his deceased adoptive father's counterpart, he returns to his own world and lures Clark Luthor to the Fortress of Solitude, where he sends his counterpart back to his world.\n\nIn the fourth issue of the television series' comic book continuation \"Smallville Season 11\", an alternative version of Chloe Sullivan from Earth-2 arrives to Clark Kent's world and reveals that her universe is destroyed before her death. In issue #11, it is reveals that the Monitors are responsible for Earth-2's destruction.\n\nAcross this multiverse, there are other Earths featured in the series including:\n\n\nIn \"Batman: The Brave and the Bold\", a kind of \"multiverse\" is referenced in the episodes \"Deep Cover for Batman!\" and \"Game Over for Owlman!\", which feature several references to alternate incarnations of DC Comics heroes and villains, including the Batman and the Owlman. The Multiverse is briefly revisited in \"Night of the Batmen!\", with a large group of Batmen gathered from across various Earths coming together to help an injured Bruce Wayne protect Gotham. The army of Multiverse Batmen contained various iterations of the Batman from different media adaptions, such as from \"The Batman\", the DC Animated Universe, the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series, and \"Batman Beyond\".\n\nThe direct-to-video feature \"Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths\" deals with the Multiverse as part of its story. The main story deals with a good Lex Luthor from his Earth (based on the Pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Three) coming to the Earth where the Justice League are located to help fight their counterparts, the Crime Syndicate. While the two Earths inhabited by the Justice League and Crime Syndicate are not named, names of other Earths are mentioned. These names are not from the official Pre-\"Crisis\" nor post-\"Infinite Crisis\" Multiverse, but are nods to a degree. Examples include: \"Gamma F-1\", \"Theta-Alpha\", \"Zeta-Pi\", which are all Greek numbers. Earth-Prime is featured in the film, but is not the same Earth-Prime from the comics, where it was \"our\" Earth. In the film, Earth-Prime is shown to be the cornerstone of all reality, and that decisions made by humankind on this world caused alternate Earths where the opposite decision was made to come into being. This world is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though the Owlman reasons that it was mankind who destroyed itself. There was also an unnamed Earth that is mostly covered in ice. It was destroyed when the Owlman allowed the bomb to detonate with himself still on it.\n\nIn the video game \"DC Universe Online\", Brainiac decides to conquer New Earth in order to know the secret of the multiverse. After he was defeated, the heroes have to face the Council of Luthors, who wants to take control of the Nexus of Reality and rule existence through the achievement of ultimate power. But the Council of Batmen wishes to stop the Luthors and undo the damage that has been done.\n\nThe storyline of \"\" features an alternate reality where the Joker has tricked Superman into killing Lois Lane and their unborn son and destroying Metropolis with a nuclear explosion. This tragedy completely ruins Superman's moral compass to the point of no return and the Kryptonian murders the Joker in retaliation. As time passes, he establishes a new world order, with himself as the High Councilor. Soon enough, Superman's iron-fisted rule triggers a war between the Regime and those allied with the Batman's Insurgency. High Councilor Superman begins a relationship with Wonder Woman who becomes one of his most devoted followers. Damian Wayne eventually sides with Superman against his father and kills Victor Zsasz. Cyborg also joins the Regime due to sharing his anger over the destruction of Metropolis. Dick Grayson is accidentally killed by Damian Wayne, which creates an even further rift between himself and his father, who mourns the death of his adopted son while Damian eventually adopts Dick's mantle of Nightwing. Harley Quinn leads a group called the Joker Gang who idolizes the Joker and fights alongside the Insurgency against the Regime. Both Black Adam and Billy Batson (Shazam) join the Regime. Hal Jordan becomes Yellow Lantern after joining the Sinestro Corps. which has allied itself with Superman's Regime against the Green Lantern Corps. The Green Arrow is killed by the Regime, leaving behind the Black Canary who is pregnant with their son Connor. The Black Canary is saved by Doctor Fate who transports her to an alternate Earth where Oliver Queen is still alive, though he has lost his Black Canary. Five years into the war, the Insurgency discovers an alternate universe where the Joker's plan did not succeed and transports several of its superheroes (Wonder Woman, the Batman, Aquaman, the Green Arrow, and Green Lantern) to their world in order to help them defeat the Regime. Unfortunately, the Joker of this universe is brought to the Regime universe and is killed. Also in this universe, Lex Luthor never becomes a criminal and instead he is a selfless businessman, best friend of this world's Superman and cares for the people of Metropolis, though he secretly sides with the Batman against the tyrannical Superman, only to be killed in battle. Together with the alternate universe Justice League and the Regime Flash, who defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam when he objects to Superman's plans to attack cities, the Regime Superman is defeated and imprisoned in the Red Son prison along with fellow Regime members Cyborg and Damian Wayne (Nightwing). Hal Jordan and Sinestro are imprisoned on Oa by the Guardians. The Flash allows himself to be taken into custody to face charges for his role in the Regime. After the Regime's fall, Bruce Wayne works to rebuild the world after the fall of the Regime. The alternate Justice League return to their universe.\n\nThe \"Injustice\" universe is featured at the beginning of \"Convergence\" as one of the many realities affected by Telos' Blood Moon.\n\nIn \"Injustice 2\", it is revealed that Krypton in this universe was attacked by Brainiac who collects the city of Kandor and destroys Argo City, which Kara Zor-El barely survives. Her mother saves her from Brainiac's Betas and reveals that Brainiac has destabilized the planet's core. Kara is tasked with watching over her baby cousin Kal-El and flees Krypton in a spaceship at the behest of her mother; however, her ship is damaged and knocked off course by the planet's explosion, which puts her into suspended animation. She is later found drifting through space by Black Adam, who takes her to Kahndaq where he and Wonder Woman have been hiding out since Superman was imprisoned. Black Adam and Wonder Woman train her in the hopes that her strength will give them the edge to free Kal-El. A flashback shows how Robin (Damian Wayne) joins Superman after killing the remorseless serial killer Victor Zsasz (which retcons the nature and timing of Damain's murder of Zsasz from the \"Injustice\" prequel comics). In the present, Damian Wayne and Cyborg are also incarcerated with Superman, while Aquaman has distanced himself away from the Regime to protect Atlantis. Meanwhile, Bruce is busy with the rebuilding the world after the Regime, forcing him to enlist other heroes such as the Black Canary, her husband the Green Arrow (from the alternate universe that the Black Canary was sent to by Doctor Fate), Firestorm and the Blue Beetle/Jaime Reyes as well as Harley Quinn, the Flash (who had been pardoned due to his role in taking down the Regime after the murder of Billy Batson by Superman) and Hal Jordan, who was reinstated as Green Lantern by the Guardians of the Universe, who managed to rehabilitate him. The Batman also constructs Brother Eye to monitor Earth for the Regime, the Society, and other potential threats. The Batman tasks the Black Canary, the Green Arrow, and Harley to deal with the Society, a group of supervillains formed by Gorilla Grodd after the fall of the Regime. During their confrontation with the Society in Gorilla City, they learn of an even greater threat posed by Brainiac which leads to the three being captured, though Harley escapes thanks to the intervention of the Catwoman, who had infiltrated the Society as an undercover mole. Brainiac hacks into Brother Eye and demands that Superman be handed over to him, though Bruce suits up and flees from the Batcave. Supergirl informs Wonder Woman and Black Adam of the threat posed by Brainiac and tells them they must get to her cousin before it is too late. This leads Kara and the Regime to break into the Red Son prison to free Superman, Cyborg, and Damian Wayne. However, the Blue Beetle and Firestorm protect the prison, but they are overwhelmed. Firestorm plans to destroy the Regime with a nuclear explosion, but the Batman tells him to stand down and decides that the threat posed by Brainiac is too great, leading the Insurgency and Regime to join forces to battle a common enemy. However, Supergirl begins to question what she had been told when Wonder Woman stabs Harley for trying to stop her from killing the Cheetah. Kara manages to save Harley's life, confronts her cousin and realizes that he has become a ruthless dictator like General Zod. After a brief battle with Robin, Black Adam, and Superman after her attempts to reason with Superman fail, they are interrupted by Brainiac's attack and Superman tells his cousin she must choose a side when it is over. During the battle with Brainiac's Skull Ship, Metropolis is destroyed again and Superman apparently killed. The Batman consoles Kara and tells her about how Superman was his friend once and refuses to accept Brainiac's proposal that he will spare Earth if Kara is handed over to him. She later joins the Batman in infiltrating Brainiac's ship, but Kara is captured, though Superman is revealed to be alive and he teams up with the Batman to stop Brainiac and save Kara. However, after Brainiac's defeat (which frees Kara) and Superman stopping the Skull Ship from crashing, the Regime and Insurgency clashes over how to deal with Brainiac as the Insurgency believes that if they spare Brainiac they will discover how to restore the collected cities and free their inhabitants, while Superman plans to kill Brainiac and restore the Regime, though Supergirl sides with the Insurgency, understanding that the Regime was planning to betray the Insurgency as soon as Brainiac was defeated. The story has two different endings.\n\n\nThe video game \"Infinite Crisis\" (which is unrelated to the comic book of the same name) features a multiverse with 52 different worlds. This multiverse is threatened by a sudden assault and all realities stand on the brink of annihilation. Now, the last hope for Earth lies in the powers of the DC legends.\n\nDuring the events of the tie-in comic book \"Infinite Crisis: Fight for the Multiverse\", it is said that the Monitors were a race of beings native to the world of Nil that resided outside all realities in the Overvoid. Their existence came following the creation of the Multiverse and the Bleed where they watched the infinite Earths and sought to protect the infinite strands of creation. It was claimed that they were a people that cared little about the existence of the inhabitants of these universes and more for the preservation of their grand order. Such was their existence, until one of their kind turned against the others and became the Anti-Monitor. A Crisis emerged as a result whereby many universes were destroyed, but the Anti-Monitor was defeated at the cost of almost the entire Monitor race. From this Crisis, there existed only 52 universes left in the Multiverse that were kept in perfect balance. The only survivor of their race was Nix Uotan, who detected a new Crisis emerging from an unknown menace who made use of corrupted Monitor technology and struck at Earth-48. Nix Uotan returned to his people's home world in order to reactivate the machinery to help contain the damage from the Crisis. As a result, he began to seek out champions and even villains to help combat this menace from across the Multiverse. These individuals would be charged with recovering artifacts from across the many Earths that were being taken by the mysterious enemy to aid in their assault. Among his agents was a human female from Earth-48 who went by the name of Harbinger.\n\nThe featured alternate Earths are those of the New 52 DC Multiverse.\n\n\nSuperman, Supergirl, Poison Ivy, the Joker, Harley Quinn, the Catwoman, Wonder Woman, the Batman and Robin are featured as player possibilities, each with alternate versions amongst the six featured alternate Earth scenarios.\n\nIn this reality, the Monitors had access to energy constructs that were able to record messages and transmit communiques across the Multiverse. They also forged orbs that glowed with light and served as a guide across the alternate universes as well as serve as a communicator with the Monitors. On their homeworld of Nil, there were spatial engines that could be used to help prevent large scale universal breaches that would damage the Multiverse.\n\nIn July 2014, DC CCO Geoff Johns confirmed that the universe present in the publisher's television series, \"Arrow\" and \"The Flash\", is separate from the one being built in their films with \"Man of Steel\" and \"\". In October 2014, Johns explained DC's difference in approach to Marvel, saying \"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through...It's just a different approach.\"\n\nThe Multiverse concept is explored during the second season of \"The Flash\", which is pivotal to the conflicts between Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) and rogue speedster Hunter Zolomon (Teddy Sears). The access points to the Multiverse are portals that were created as a result of an exploding singularity over Central City during the season 2 premiere \"The Man Who Saved Central City\". In the episode \"Enter Zoom\", it is revealed that Earth-2's version of the Green Arrow is Robert Queen (Jamey Sheridan) instead of his son Oliver (Stephen Amell), who presumably died on the boat accident. In the season 2 finale \"The Race of His Life\", Zoom reveals that the universe in which that of \"Arrow\", \"The Flash\" and \"Legends of Tomorrow\" sets is positioned in the Multiverse's center, and from there one could travel to any of the other infinite numbers of Earths. After Jay Garrick is rescued from Zoom, he reveals that he is from yet another Earth, designated Earth-3. In the Season 3 episode \"The New Rogues\", the Flash team explore the multiverse in search of a Harrison Wells doppelganger to replace the Earth-2 version. They encounter four others from various Earths, two of which are named Earth-17 and Earth-19, from which their new recruit, Harrison \"H.R.\" Wells, originates.\n\nThe television series \"Supergirl\" exists as another alternate universe separate from the main Arrowverse continuity. This is confirmed in the \"Supergirl\" episode \"Worlds Finest\", when the Flash appears on Supergirl's universe and names heroes from his world (the Green Arrow, the Black Canary, the Atom, Firestorm) that Supergirl does not recognize. In addition, the Flash's allies Dr. Harrison Wells, Caitlin Snow, and Cisco Ramon do not exist in Supergirl's universe, and S.T.A.R. Labs was not founded due to Wells' absence. Barry Allen does note that they do share celebrities, such as singer Mariah Carey and writer Alexandre Dumas, who wrote \"The Three Musketeers\". Supergirl's universe is coined Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon. Subsequent episodes from \"Legends of Tomorrow,\" \"Supergirl,\" and \"The Flash\" reveal that both Supergirl and Barry's universes also share the existences of the alien races of Thanagarians and Dominators.\n\nThe 2017 crossover event \"Crisis on Earth-X\"- which sees the heroes from all four shows face an invasion from the titular 'Earth-X', as a world where the Nazis won World War II- establishes that there are 52 known alternate Earths, with the titular 'Earth-X' being the fifty-third Earth, described by Harrison \"Harry\" Wells of Earth-2, that those who aware of the multiverse as being so dark and horrific that no interdimensional traveler would dare to journey there. Its history is basically the same as Earth-1, Earth-2, and Earth-38's, except the outcomes of World War II and Adolf Hitler continued his reign worldwide until his death in 1994. Its inhabitants include counterparts of people from these Earths as well, including Oliver Queen's doppelgänger, who is Hitler's successor as Führer and the villainous archer the Dark Arrow.\n\nBelow are the known Multiverse worlds in the Arrowverse:\n\nIssue #48 introduces its own multiverse. Each world pays references to various incarnation of the Teen Titans. The worlds shown are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20453478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20453478", "title": "Olla (Roman pot)", "text": "Olla (Roman pot)\n\nIn ancient Roman culture, the olla (archaic Latin: aula or aulla; Greek: , \"chytra\") is a squat, rounded pot or jar. An \"olla\" would be used primarily to cook or store food, hence the word “olla\" is still used in some Romance languages for either a cooking pot or a dish in the sense of cuisine. In the typology of ancient Roman pottery, the \"olla\" is a vessel distinguished by its rounded “belly,” typically with no or small handles or at times with volutes at the lip, and made within a Roman sphere of influence; the term \"olla\" may also be used for Etruscan and Gallic examples, or Greek pottery found in an Italian setting.\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, \"ollae\" (plural) have ritual use and significance, including as cinerary urns. In the study of Gallo-Roman art and culture, an \"olla\" is the small pot carried by Sucellus, by the mallet god often identified with him, or by other gods.\n\n\"Olla\" is a generic word for a cooking pot, such as would be used for vegetables, porridge, pulse and such. The 1st-century BC scholar Varro gives an \"absurd\" etymology that derives the word for vegetables, \"olera\" or \"holera\", from \"olla\"; although as a matter of scientific linguistics the derivation may be incorrect, it indicates that cookery was considered essential to the pot's function. Isidore of Seville said that the word \"olla\" derived from \"ebullit\", \"it boils up,\" and describes a patera as an \"olla\" with the sides flattened out more broadly. It was a word of ordinary usage, and does not appear in literary works by Vergil, Horace, and Ovid.\n\nUnlike the \"aenum\" or cauldron, which hung over the fire from chains, the \"olla\" had a flat bottom for resting on a hot surface, though it might also be placed directly on logs or coals in rustic cookery. The kitchen reconstructed at the House of the Vettii from Pompeii shows a large \"olla\" set on a tripod on the stove.\n\n\"Ollae\" were used for funerary purposes from earliest times. In Italic inhumations, \"ollae\" might be placed with the body in the tomb as grave goods, sometimes with a ladle or dipper. A tomb from a 7th-century BC necropolis at Civita Castellana yielded an \"olla\" decorated with a pair of horses and a Faliscan inscription. From the 3rd century BC (Mid-Republic) into the 2nd century AD of the Imperial era, cremation was the most characteristic means of disposing of a body among the Romans. \"Ollae\" shifted function to hold cremated remains for entombment, a practice of Etruscan as well as Italic burials. The remains of those of modest means might be contained in earthenware \"ollae\" placed on the shelves of an \"ollarium\" or columbarium.\n\nAfter the performance of an animal sacrifice, a designated portion of the entrails \"(exta)\" was placed either in an \"olla\" and boiled, or in oldest times on a spit and roasted, as part of the \"cuisine\" of sacrifice. The \"exta\" were the victim's liver, gall, lungs, and the membrane covering the intestines, with the heart added after 275 BC. The \"olla\" was one of the characteristic implements of sacrifice, and appears in reliefs as such, particularly in the Gallic provinces. The vessel is mentioned, for instance, in Livy's account of a sign \"(prodigium)\" that manifested divine displeasure: the official presiding over the sacrifice himself poured the cooking liquid out of the \"olla\" in order to inspect the remaining entrails, which were intact except for the mysteriously liquified liver.\n\n\"Ollae\" figured in the rituals of the Arval Brethren, the \"Brothers of the Fields\" who constituted a college of priests dating from Rome's archaic period. The \"exta\" of the victims used in their sacrifices were placed in an \"olla\" and cooked. Examples of these earthenware pots have been uncovered by archaeologists in the sacred groves of the Arvals. Their rudimentary technique suggests the great antiquity of the religious traditions associated with them. After conducting their rites, the Arval priests opened the door to the temple, and cast the \"ollae\" down the slope leading up to it.\n\nThe name of the woodland god Silvanus appears in inscriptions within the province of Gallia Narbonensis with representations of a mallet, an \"olla\", or both. The mallet is not a regular attribute of Silvanus, and may be borrowed from the Celtic mallet god sometimes identified with Sucellus.\n\n"}

It was the first public opera house to be established in Germany: not a court opera, as in many other towns. Everybody could buy a ticket, like in Venice. Most works were in the German language or translated librettos (from Italian). \n\nThe building was torn down in 1756, but rebuilt in 1765.\n\nHamburg was a rich city and hardly affected by the Thirty Years' War. \n\nThe founding of the Hamburg opera was an initiative of the well-traveled lawyer and alderman Gerhard Schott, who was impressed by Italian opera and Johann Adam Reincken, a local church organist. Johann Theile, Kapellmeister of Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who lived during the years 1675-1679 and 1684-1689 in exile in the city, organised its first performance. \nFor the construction of the stage the Italian engineer and architect Girolamo Sartorio was attracted by the private company. Protests and accusations by some Hamburg ministers before and after the opening held on for several years, and is known as the first \"Hamburger Theaterstreit\".\n\nThe opening of the house took place on 2 January 1678 with Johann Theile's sacred opera \"Adam und Eva\", succeeded by works of Nicolò Minato and Antonio Sartorio, Johann Wolfgang Franck with \"Cara Mustapha\" (1686), Agostino Steffani, Carlo Pallavicino and Johann Sigismund Kusser. Because of an argument with the management, Kusser organized an opera in the refectory of the local Dom. \n\nIn 1695 Reinhard Keiser took over the post of Kapellmeister until 1718; from 1703 to 1707 he also held the directorship. In 1703 Handel came from Halle to Hamburg as a cembalist and violin player, and a famous duel took place between Handel and Mattheson, during and after which \"Cleopatra\" was performed. One of the musicians was Christoph Graupner. In 1705 (?) Handel met with Gian Gastone de' Medici, who invited him to Pratolino.\n\nAgostino Steffani, Johann Mattheson, Georg Friedrich Händel, Nicolaus Adam Strungk, Johann Philipp Förtsch, Georg Bronner, Johann Philipp Krieger, Georg Caspar Schürmann, and Johann Georg Conradi composed Singspiele or baroque opera's for the Hamburg opera. There were performances on two or three days a week, and around 90 performances a year. The opera season started in Winter; in Summer and on religious holidays the theatre was closed. Because of the long scene changes each performance took four to six hours and began by afternoon.\n\nIn 1722 Georg Philipp Telemann took over the management of the opera house, which he held until the end of 1738. In 1727 the first German opera \"Dafne\" (lost) by Heinrich Schütz was performed. From 1743 till 1750 the building was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian opera's by Johann Adolph Hasse and Pergolesi. Christoph Willibald Gluck performed his works in 1748. In 1750 the building was sold.\n\nBetween 1767 and 1770 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was the dramatist in what was called Deutsches Nationaltheater.\n\n"}

It is one of the most revered arts throughout history of Iran.\n\nAfter the introduction of Islam in the 7th century, Persians adapted the Arabic alphabet to Persian and developed the contemporary Persian alphabet. The Arabic alphabet has 28 characters. An additional four letters were added by Iranians [http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/History-of-Calligraphy.html [2<nowiki>]</nowiki>], which resulted in the 32 letters currently present in the Persian alphabet.\n\nAround one thousand years ago, Ibn Muqlah () and his brother created six genres of Iranian calligraphy, namely \"Mohaqiq\", \"Reyhan\", \"Sols\", \"Naskh\", \"Toqi\" and \"Reqa\". These genres were common for four centuries in Persia. In the 7th century (Hijri calendar), Hassan Farsi Kateb combined the \"Naskh\" and \"Reqah\" styles and invented a new genre of Persian calligraphy named \"Ta'liq\". In the 14th century, Mir Ali Tabrizi combined two major scripts of his time, i.e. Naskh and Taliq, and created a new Persian calligraphic style called \"Nas’taliq\"[http://www.persiancalligraphy.org/History-of-Calligraphy.html [2<nowiki>]</nowiki>]. In the past 500 years Nastaʿlīq (also anglicized as Nastaleeq; \"\") has been the predominant style for writing the Perso-Arabic script.\n\nIn the 17th century Morteza Gholi Khan Shamlou and Mohammad Shafi Heravi created a new genre called cursive Nastaʿlīq Shekasteh Nastaʿlīq (Persian: شکسته نستعلیق). Almost a century later, Abdol-Majid Taleqani, who was a prominent artist at the time, brought this genre to its highest level. This calligraphic style is based on the same rules as Nas’taliq. However, cursive Nas’taliq has a few significant differences: it provides more flexible movements, and it is slightly more stretched and curved. Yadollah Kaboli is one of the most prominent contemporary calligraphers within this style.\n\nIn 1950, the \"Iran's Association of Calligraphers\" was founded by Hossein Mirkhani, Ali Akbar Kaveh, Ebrahim Bouzari, Hassan Mirkhani and Mehdi Baiani. For an overview of Persian calligraphy's development within Afghanistan, see \"Calligraphy during last two centuries in Afghanistan\" (1964), by Azizuddin Vakili.\n\n, Jalil Rasouli, Parviz Tanavoli, and Nima Behnoud use Persian calligraphy and Rumi poetry in dress designing.\nabol atighetchi, abolghassem uses combination of colored naskh, suluth and kufic style calligraphy with large letters in a single large format acrylic painting for his work presentation and circles in gold leaf or simple color to decorate but in the nastaligh style lots of colorful geometrical forms and lines are used to modernize the painting and also the same technique is used to modernize the large format birds of bessmel (مرغ بسمل), all drawn with large letters.this style of work can be classified as post modern.\n\n\n\n"}

A philistine person is a man or woman of smugly narrow mind and of conventional morality whose materialistic views and tastes indicate a lack of and an indifference to cultural and æsthetic values.\n\nSince the 19th century, the contemporary denotation of \"philistinism\", as the behaviour of \"ignorant, ill-behaved persons lacking in culture or artistic appreciation, and only concerned with materialistic values\" derives from Matthew Arnold's adaptation to English of the German word Philister, as applied by university students in their antagonistic relations with the townspeople of Jena, Germany, where, in 1689, a row resulted in several deaths.\n\nIn the aftermath, the university cleric addressed the town-vs-gown matter with an admonishing sermon \"The Philistines Be Upon Thee\", drawn from the \"Book of Judges\" (Chapt. 16, 'Samson vs the Philistines'), of the Tanakh and of the Christian Old Testament. In \"Word Research and Word History\", the philologist Friedrich Kluge said that the word \"philistine\" originally had a positive meaning that identified a tall and strong man, such as Goliath; later the meaning changed to identify the \"guards of the city\". \n\nIn German usage, university students applied the term Philister (Philistine) to describe a person who was not trained at university; in the German social context, the term identified the man (Philister) and the woman (Philisterin) who was not of the university social set.\n\nIn English usage, as a descriptor of anti-intellectualism, the term philistine—a person deficient in the culture of the liberal arts—was common British usage by the decade of 1820, which described the bourgeois, merchant middle class of the Victorian Era (1837–1901), whose wealth rendered them indifferent to culture. In \"Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism\" (1869), Matthew Arnold said:\n\nThe denotations and connotations of the terms \"philistinism\" and \"philistine\" have evolved to consistently describe the uncouth person who is hostile to art, culture, and the life of the mind, who, in their stead, prefers the life of economic materialism and conspicuous consumption as paramount human activities.\n\nWhilst involved in a lawsuit, the writer and poet Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), in the slang of his time, described a gruff bailiff as a philistine, someone who is considered a merciless enemy.\n\nThe polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) described the philistine personality, by asking:\n\nGoethe further described such men and women, by noting that:\n\nIn the comedy of manners play, \"The Rivals\" (1775), Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751–1816) identifies a violent aristocrat as 'that bloodthirsty Philistine, Sir Lucius O'Trigger'.\n\nThe philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) identified the philistine as a person who, for a lack of true unity, could only define style in the negative.\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes instead attributed to Parmigianino but majority opinion is that it dates to Correggio's first mature period, which is supported by the fact that it was painted directly on top of the sketch, an informal technique suggesting it was made for a close friend of the artist.\n\nIt shows a man in a black coat and black cap three-quarter-length against a wooded background, reading from a tiny book held in his right hand, argued by Roberto Longhi to be a book of hours and by others such as Muzzi to be a \"Petrarchino\" (ie a miniature edition of Petrarch's \"Il Canzoniere\").

She first appeared in \"The Day of the Clown\".\n\nRani Chandra was introduced into \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" as a replacement for departing character Maria Jackson played by Yasmin Paige. Paige left the series as a regular due to her wanting to complete her GCSE's, thus, Maria moved to America because her Dad had been offered a job there.\nRani's parents, Haresh and Gita Chandra, replace Maria's parents, Alan and Chrissie Jackson, as Alan departs with their daughter and Chrissie no longer has reason to show up.\n\nRani shares her name with the Rani, a recurring villain from the classic series of \"Doctor Who\". Russell T Davies told readers of \"Doctor Who Magazine\" that Rani is \"not \"the\" Rani\".\n\nRani Chandra first appears in the second story of series two, replacing the character of Maria Jackson (Yasmin Paige). In \"The Day of the Clown\" (2008), Rani and her parents move into the Jacksons' old house at 12 Bannerman Road (sometimes 36 Bannerman Road), opposite Sarah Jane (Elisabeth Sladen) and Luke Smith's (Tommy Knight) house, in Ealing, London. Her father is the new head teacher of the school where she, Luke and his best friend Clyde (Daniel Anthony) are pupils; her mother owns Bloomin' Lovely floral shop. An aspiring journalist, Rani soon joins Sarah Jane's investigative gang.\n\nIn the series three première \"Prisoner of the Judoon\" (2009), Rani and Clyde are banned by extraterrestrial police force the Judoon from space travel as punishment for interference in their work. Although grounded on her terrestrial homeworld, she is nobility of an unspecified alien planet. A humanoid child monarch known as Gavin creates her Lady Rani in appreciation of her assistance in his succession which also saved the whole of humanity. Coincidentally, she is continually addressed as Lady Rani in the subsequent serial, when she is transported to the court of Queen Jane and mistaken for a newly summoned lady-in-waiting.\n\nSeries three story \"The Mad Woman in the Attic\" focuses on Rani. Sarah Jane discovers that, in violation of her rules, Rani has shared her adventures in letters to her former schoolfriend Samuel; the events of the episode cause two timelines to occur, one where in 2059, Rani has acquired the Smith home at 13 Bannerman Road and become miserable and alone, and another where she will have a son and grandchildren and still friends with Luke and even her predecessor, Maria, living with her family at the former Smith home. Rani's final appearance comes in series five, in the last episode of the programme, \"The Man Who Never Was\" (2011).\n\nThe official \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" website offers the following description of Rani Chandra:\n\nIn an interview for \"SFX\", Mohindra asserts that Rani and Maria are only similar in the extent that they are both girls, live in the same house and \"[i]n personality terms...[they are] both quite strong-willed\", although she notes that there are \"a lot less tears from Rani than there were from Maria.\" She describes Rani's relationship with Sarah Jane as \"a lot different\" to that between Sarah Jane and Maria. Mohindra notes that Rani is \"very much an apprentice of Sarah Jane...[although] at first...Sarah Jane is not really that interested in taking on another child.\" Rani shadows Sarah Jane and copies her behaviour to help her deal with a situation. She is keen on fighting mentally as opposed to physically and Mohindra likes the fact that Rani is \"a girl between two guys at times\".\n\nReviewing the second series of \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" for Digital Spy, Ben Rawson-Jones writes that: \"As Rani, Anjli Mohindra was fine with dialogue, but painfully self-conscious on a physical acting level when compared to the effortless ease with which Daniel Anthony and Tommy Knight portray Clyde and Luke. It was almost as if someone was stood slightly off set operating her with strings. That theory at least fits into the whole 'body possession' procession of the second season.\"\n\nFollowing Rani’s first appearance, Michael Bush writes for Den Of Geek: “Rani is another asset to the fledgling cast: a gabby young journalist whose inquisitive nature leads to a run in with alien foes. Comparisons between Rani and Sarah Jane's former companion Maria are almost inevitable, and bound to be divisive, but - based on this episode, at least - Mohindra gives as good as she takes, and her character manages to be interesting and endearing without treading on Miss Jackson's toes.” \n"}

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976 as the T.B. Sheldon Memorial Auditorium for having local significance in the theme of performing arts. It was nominated for being the first municipally owned theatre in the United States and a long-standing cultural venue in Red Wing. It later became a contributing property to the Red Wing Mall Historic District as well.\n\nIn 1856, Massachusetts businessman Theodore B. Sheldon moved to Red Wing with his first wife, Mary. Sheldon was very prominent in the small, growing town of Red Wing. He first joined Jesse McIntire and established himself in the mercantile business. Sheldon was involved with numerous other industries in Red Wing, including grain, banks, railroads, stoneware, and gas and power. Most prominently, he and McIntire established Red Wing's First National Bank in 1865. Sheldon also unified the Bluff and Diamond flour mills to establish Red Wing Mills, which have been described as the pride of Red Wing.\n\nWhen Sheldon died in 1900, his will required that half of his estate be used for a public, nonsectarian purpose in the town of Red Wing. On March 3, 1903, Sheldon's trustees proposed the idea of T.B. Sheldon Memorial Auditorium, and the city council approved it. Eighteen months later, the new theater stood on the corner of Third Street and East Avenue. It was managed by the city of Red Wing.\n\nThe theater opened on October 10, 1904, with a performance of the light comic opera \"The Royal Chef\". The opening ceremonies also included a performance by the Rossiter Orchestra from Minneapolis.\n\nFrom the beginning, some feared that the theater would have a demoralizing effect on the town. During opening night, several seats were left vacant in protest. In the 1920s, Red Wing church groups took their concerns to the city council. They petitioned, unsuccessfully, for greater censorship and for Sunday shows to be discontinued.\n\nThe theater was originally used for live performances. It primarily showed lighter fare, like musical comedies and romantic dramas. In 1911 the theater began projecting silent movies. After a fire in 1918, the theater was refurbished by the original architecture firm, overseen by Lowell Lamoreaux. Among the improvements was a movie projection box. The theater re-opened with a viewing of the movie \"Tom Sawyer\", which signaled its shift away from live theater and toward film.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the theater became a popular and profitable movie house. Red Wing was fortunate not to suffer considerably during the Great Depression. In 1929, the theater began showing sound movies or \"talkies\". It was remodeled in 1936 to improve the visuals and acoustics for showing films.\n\nThe auditorium began to experience trouble in the 1950s. A nationwide slump in moviegoing slowed its profits, and unwise investments in improvements sunk its funds. The theater was further threatened in 1957, when John Wright brought two lawsuits against it. Wright, the owner of a competing theater, alleged that the city had an unfair advantage over private entrepreneurs. He also filed suit to argue that a movie theater was not \"public\" and the auditorium was therefore in violation of Sheldon's trust.\n\nIn 1958 the Minnesota Supreme Court ordered the auditorium to quit the movie business. The theater's board found a way around the ruling, however, by leasing the theater to James Fraser. Fraser had been the theater's manager, and he continued to show movies there. In 1960 the Minnesota Supreme Court handed down its final decision, which was unanimously in favor of the auditorium.\n\nPoor management caused continued financial problems for the theater in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1984 the board established a task force to raise money to restore the theater. The restored theater re-opened in 1988. The theater projected its last movie in May 1988, but it continued to host live entertainment. In 2012 the auditorium was offering a range of live programming that included both highbrow and middlebrow events.\n\nThe MISSION of Red Wing's “jewel-box,” the Sheldon Theatre, is to showcase the best in arts and entertainment for the enjoyment, education, and enlightenment of the community and its visitors.\nThe Sheldon is a cornerstone community partner, a regional arts hub, and a national trailblazer in the rise of small-town performing arts centers. Located in the heart of one of the most beautifully distinctive downtowns in the Midwest, the Sheldon is a truly unique gathering place where 30,000 people a year of all ages and backgrounds are uplifted and engaged through the transformative power of the performing arts.\nAt the Sheldon with its remarkable architecture and intimate charm, there's a kind of \"wow\" even before the show begins, and audiences know they are a part of something special. People come to the Sheldon to see exceptional performers from all over the world in a breathtaking setting. With steadfast community support over the Sheldon's long history, the organization has been able to continue to push the boundaries, with progressive productions and new features that are sure to open the mind, expand horizons, and inspire wonder. It is our hope that you leave with a fresh perspective and an unforgettable experience every time you revisit the Sheldon.

In Sri Lanka whole districts in the central, southern, and western provinces are credited with being the abode of foolish people. \n\nTales of simpleton behavior have often been collected into books, and early joke books include many simpleton jokes. In ancient Greece, Hierokles created such a collection. In England, the famous \"Joe Miller's Jests\" is highly inclusive of simpleton jokes. In Britain the Irish are often stereotyped as stupid and are the butt of An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman jokes. Books of simpleton tales exist in Persia, Ireland, Turkey, Iceland, Japan, Sicily, and India. \n\nSimpleton tales are huge in number, but many of them share the same notions of simple-minded behavior.

Louise reluctantly agrees. Benno then uses their written agreement to blackmail Heinz who, with Wolf's help, deports Benno. \n\nHeinz is now determined to separate his wife from her Japanese lover. The two women plan to scare Heinz to accept their relationship by faking an attempted suicide. The plan takes an unexpected turn when Mitsuko seduces Heinz in a ménage à trois. Caught in a love triangle Louise, Mitsuko and Heinz grow more and more jealous of each other. Mitsuko, jealous and possessive, dominates Louise and Heinz. At a dinner, Mitsuko drugs the von Hollendorfs with sleeping pills to prevent them from having sex. Mitsuko uses the ruse to turn Heinz and Louise on each other. By now, their self-destructive relationship becomes publicly known to the Nazi regime as the exiled Benno publishes his account abroad. To avoid the scandal, Heinz is asked to resign and leaves Berlin. Wolf temporarily withdraws their passports. However, rather than leave each other, all three drink poison in a ceremonial rite. \n\nUpon awakening, and to her bewilderment, Louise discovers that both Heinz and Mitsuko are dead, revealing that she was given a sedative instead of poison, and effectively being left behind and betrayed by both her lovers. She confides in her former professor one last time. He urges her to publish her story before he is arrested by the Gestapo.\n\n\nThe original title of the film, \"Interno Berlinese\", can be translated as Inside Berlin or Interior Berliner. The story is based upon Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's novel \"Quicksand\", or \"Manji\", published serial from 1928-1930. Cavani was drawn to the novel because of its dramatic intensity and extreme economy, his capacity to bring us, as nearly breathless spectators, inside the meaning of seemingly insignificant details. \"Manji\" was published as a serial novel in a literary magazine between 1928 and 1930. Sonoko, the first-person narrator, recounts her own story to a prominent writer as a long monologue that continues the novel itself. It is the story of a passionate love affair with Mitsuko that eventually involves her husband and Watanuki, an impotent effeminate dandy. Mitsuki was actually the name of Tanizaki's third wife. She inspired several of his novels. Cavani brought the story forward in time and set the plot in Germany in 1938.\n\n\"The Berlin Affair\" was the first film produced by Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus in Italy for Cannon. It was shot in Rome at the Paolis Studios and Vienna from April to July 1985. Gudrun Landgrabe, one of the discoveries of the New German Cinema, had appeared in Robert van Ackeren's \"A Woman in Flames\" 1982, Edgar Reitz’s Heimat 1984, and István Szabó’s Colonel Redl 1985. Kevin McNally, a British actor, plays the husband. Casting the role of Mitzuko was challenging. Cavani went to Tokyo looking for a model of beauty that could balance seductiveness with an iron will. She found it in the 24-year-old actress and pop singer Mio Takaki.\n\nIt was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival. \"The Berlin Affair \" is available in Region 2 DVD. It has not been released on DVD in the U.S.A.\n\n\n"}

The theatre has survived multiple wars, fires, and economic depressions. Theatre Tulsa started as a small community theatre that played shows in a tent, and grew to the largest community theatre in the nation in the 1970s, followed by years of decline and a recent re-invigoration that includes the new creation of a Broadway Series main stage season, a Next Stage series season composed of new works, and a Family Series season for children, families, and arts education programming. \n\nTulsa Little Theatre was incorporated December. 10, 1922 by Mrs. Bonnie Reed and Mrs. Hope Holway. Despite the Great Depression, the group managed to raise money to build a theater which was christened with a performance of \"The Cradle Song\" in February 1932. Two years later, the group incorporated as Tulsa Little Theatre. Struggling through the next few years, the theater survived a threatened bank foreclosure in 1935 after a number of donors stepped in, and in 1940 the theater paid off its mortgage. During World War II, it produced shows for military camps and veterans’ hospitals. Tulsa Little Little Theatre prospered, and by 1959 was the largest non-professional theater company in the country. In 1964, its membership was 8,000 strong. By 1972 it had the largest community theater membership in the nation and had counted 1.5 million members over the past 50 years. In 1974 Tulsa Little Theatre changed its name to Theatre Tulsa, Inc. Theatre Tulsa remains active today producing 10 productions a year that include modern and classic dramas, comedies, and musicals.\n\nTheatre Tulsa has had many firsts; it was the first community theater in the country to premiere \"Our Town\" (1939) and \"All My Sons\" (1947); the musical \"Brownstone\"(1985); “Miracle on 34th Street: A Musical Adaptation” (a 1993 original musical written for Theatre Tulsa); “\"I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change\"” (2003); and the first American production of \"Pitmen Painters\" (2011). Theatre Tulsa’s production of \"Forever Plaid\" sold out more than 400 shows in 1995 and 1996. Some noted performers, including Jeanne Tripplehorn, Kristin Chenoweth and Sam Harris, received their first stage experience with Theatre Tulsa. \n"}

{"id": "7763396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7763396", "title": "Video games as an art form", "text": "Video games as an art form\n\nThe concept of video games as a form of art is a controversial topic within the entertainment industry. Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.\n\nThe earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated first and second generation games. In exhibitions such as the Museum of the Moving Image's 1989 \"Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade\", video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art. Further explorations of this theme were set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s with exhibitions like the Walker Art Center's \"Beyond Interface\" (1998), the online \"Cracking the Maze - Game Plug-Ins as Hacker Art\" (1999), the UCI Beall Centre's \"Shift-Ctrl\" (2000), and a number of shows in 2001.\n\nThe concept of the video game as a Duchamp-style readymade or as found object resonated with early developers of the art game. In her 2003 Digital Arts and Culture paper, \"Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre\", professor Tiffany Holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the digital art community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like \"Breakout\", \"Asteroids\", \"Pac-Man\", and \"Burgertime\". In modifying the code of simplistic early games or by creating art mods for more complex games like \"Quake\", the art game genre emerged from the intersection of commercial games and contemporary digital art.\n\nAt the 2010 Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, professor Celia Pearce further noted that alongside Duchamp's art productions, the Fluxus movement of the 1960s, and most immediately the New Games Movement had paved the way for more modern \"art games\". Works such as Lantz' \"Pac Manhattan\", according to Pearce, have become something like performance art pieces. Most recently, a strong overlap has developed between art games and indie games. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement is important according to Professor Pearce, insofar as it brings art games to more eyes and allows for greater potential to explore in indie games.\n\nIn March 2006, the French Minister of Culture first characterized video games as cultural goods and as \"a form of artistic expression,\" granting the industry a tax subsidy and inducting two French game designers (Michel Ancel, Frédérick Raynal) and one Japanese game designer (Shigeru Miyamoto) into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. In May 2011, the United States National Endowment for the Arts, in accepting grants for art projects for 2012, expanded the allowable projects to include \"interactive games\", furthering the recognition of video games as an art form. Similarly, the United States Supreme Court ruled that video games were protected speech like other forms of art in the June 2011 decision for \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\". In Germany, prior to August 2018, the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK) software ratings body enforced \"Strafgesetzbuch\" (German code) section 86a as outlined by the German government, which banned the sale of games that contained imagery of extremist groups such as Nazis; while Section 86a allowed for use of these images in artistic and scientific works, video games were not seen to fall within an artistic use. On August 9, 2018, the German government agreed to recognize some of the artistic nature of video games and softened the restriction on Section 86a, allowing the USK to consider games with such imagery as long as they fell within the social adequacy clause of Section 86a.\n\nThe lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both game and interactive art. The Smithsonian American Art Museum held an exhibit in 2012, entitled \"The Art of Video Games\", which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games, including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture. The Smithsonian later added \"Flower\" and \"Halo 2600\", games from this collection, as permanent exhibits within the museum. Similarly, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City aims to collect forty historically important video games in their original format to exhibit, showcasing video game interaction design as part of a broader effort to \"celebrate gaming as an artistic medium\". The annual \"Into the Pixel\" art exhibit held at the time of the Electronic Entertainment Expo highlights video game art selected by a panel of both video game and art industry professionals.\n\nWhile many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling, another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player, generally by having the user role-play as a character under a stress-inducing situation, covering topics associated with poverty, sexuality, and physical and mental illnesses. Such games are considered to be examples of an empathy game, loosely described by Patrick Begley of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" as a game that \"asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds\".\n\nThe characterization of games as works of art has been controversial. While recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.\n\nAmerican courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of free speech as under the First Amendment, in March 1982 in the case of \"America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.\" In a brace of similarly decided lawsuits in 1982 and 1983, precedent began to be established for finding that video games were no more expressive than pinball, chess, board- or card-games, or organized sports. This began to change in 2000 as some courts began to make rulings in distinction and carving out narrow exceptions for some \"elements\" of video games.\n\nBy April 2002, controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr., upon reviewing gameplay from \"'The Resident of Evil Creek', 'Mortal Combat', 'DOOM,' and 'Fear Effect'\" ruled in \"Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County\" that \"just like bingo, the Court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself\". In 2011's \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\" the United States Supreme Court ruled that games are entitled to First Amendment protection, with the majority opinion reading, \"Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection.\"\n\nEmerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation, even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support. Games have faced suspicion from critics of established media, just as film, television, and comics were once doubted. Keith Stewart, games editor for \"The Guardian\", sees mainstream media as preferring to approach games from the angle of the human stories surrounding them – making indie games with identifiable creators attractive to journalists. Critical communities devoted to games have likewise embraced auteur theory of games' artistic potential as underpinned by the creative visions of sole creators. John Lanchester of the \"London Review of Books\" noted that even as video games become a larger market by revenues compared to films and books, the amount of attention given to video games is generally delegated to a limited set of sources and do not readily enter the \"cultural discourse\".\n\nAuteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet, with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games, when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game. Rather than defending the medium as a whole, proponents of art games attempt to create a separate milieu opposed to video games they accept to be low culture. In practice, indie auteurs often receive commercial backing, while mainstream creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Peter Molyneux are increasingly viewed as auteurs as well. The conflation of indieness and artistry has been criticized by some, including Anna Anthropy, Lucy Kellaway, and Jim Munroe, who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic.\n\nMunroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and non-artistic, but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of non-artistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions. He further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture, in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms, than to a non-interactive presentation as in cinema.\n\nVideo game designer Kim Swift believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value. She feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations.\n\nThe question rose to wide public attention in the mid-2000s when film critic Roger Ebert participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies. In 2005, following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game \"Doom\" was essential to a proper appreciation of the film \"Doom\" (which Ebert had awarded one star) as a commentary on the game, Ebert described video games as a non-artistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms:\n\nIn 2006, Ebert took part in a panel discussion at the Conference on World Affairs entitled \"An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form?\" in which he stated that video games don't explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do. A year later, in response to comments from Clive Barker on the panel discussion, Ebert further noted that video games present a malleability that would otherwise ruin other forms of art. As an example, Ebert posed the idea of a version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" that would allow for an optional happy ending. Such an option, according to Ebert, would weaken the artistic expression of the original work. In April 2010, Ebert published an essay, dissecting a presentation made by Kellee Santiago of thatgamecompany at the 2009 Technology Entertainment Design Conference, where he again claimed that games can never be art, due to their rules and goal-based interactivity.\n\nEbert's essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community, including Santiago herself, who believes that video games as artistic media are only at their infancy, similar to prehistoric cave paintings of the past. Ebert later amended his comments in 2010, conceding that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense, that he had enjoyed playing \"Cosmology of Kyoto\", and addressing some replies to his original arguments.\n\nAlthough Ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy, the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered fine art due to their commercial appeal and structure as choice-driven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary Brian Moriarty who in March 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled \"An Apology For Roger Ebert\". In this lecture Moriarty emphasized that video games are merely an extension of traditional rule-based games and that there has been no call to declare games like Chess and Go to be art. He went on to argue that art in the sense that Romantics like Ebert, Schopenhauer, and he were concerned with (i.e. fine art or sublime art) is exceptionally rare and that Ebert was being consistent by declaring video games to be without artistic merit inasmuch as Ebert had previously claimed that \"Hardly any movies are art.\" Moriarty decried the modern expansion of the definition of \"art\" to include low art, comparing video games to kitsch and describing aesthetic appreciation of video games as camp. After addressing the corrupting influence of commercial forces in indie games and the difficulty of setting out to create art given the \"slippery\" tools that game designers must work with, Moriarty concluded that ultimately it was the fact that player choices were presented in games that structurally invalidated the application of the term \"art\" to video games as the audience's interaction with the work wrests control from the author and thereby negates the expression of art. This lecture was in turn criticized sharply by noted video game designer, Zach Gage.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with \"US Official PlayStation 2 Magazine\", game designer Hideo Kojima agreed with Ebert's assessment that video games are not art. Kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork, but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art. Since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100% player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person, Kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor.\n\nAt the 2010 Art History of Games conference, Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey (founding members of indie studio Tale of Tales), argued in no uncertain terms that games \"are not art\" and that they are by and large \"a waste of time.\" Central to Tale of Tales' distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art: Whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by play, argues Samyn, and as play has manifested itself in the form of games, games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity. Art, on the other hand, is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes. Thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient, according to Samyn, to disqualify it as art.\n\nGamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior third-party characterizations of Tale of Tales' productions as \"art games,\" however Tale of Tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games. The characterization of their games as \"art games,\" noted Samyn, was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry. While Tale of Tales acknowledged that old media featuring one-way communication was not enough, and that two-way communication via computers offers the way forward for art, the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the video game industry. To enable and foment this futuristic two-way art, suggests Tale of Tales, the concept of \"the game\" must be eviscerated by games that do not fit within the current paradigm and then \"life must be breathed into the carcass\" through the creation of artworks Samyn and Harvey refer to as \"not games.\"\n\nIn 2011, Samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rule-based. Samyn identified an industry emphasis on gameplay mechanics as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport. Pointing to systemic problems, Samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient development team who may not share the artist's vision. However, Samyn does not reject the idea that games, as a medium, can be used to create art. To create art using the medium of the video game Samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics, the development of \"funness\" or economic considerations must cease to guide the work's creation, and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artist-author's vision gains central primacy.\n\nIn 2012, \"Guardian\" art critic Jonathan Jones published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art. Jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs \"one person’s reaction to life\" and that \"no one owns the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of art.\"\n\nIn 2013, video game journalist Patricia Hernandez described a puzzle in the interactive fiction game \"Photopia\". The solution of the puzzle involves a reveal regarding the player's controlled playable character, prompting experiences which Hernandez argues could not be made \"as powerful as they are\" in any other art form without interactivity. Hernandez says that narrations in the interactive medium happen in the first person and the present tense, which are \"fundamental (and often misunderstood) elements of the interactive medium\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19719473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19719473", "title": "Wine tasting", "text": "Wine tasting\n\nWine tasting is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the 14th century onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters (such as sommeliers or buyers for retailers) use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. More informal, recreational tasting may use similar terminology, usually involving a much less analytical process for a more general, personal appreciation.\n\nResults contradicting the reliability of wine tasting in both experts and consumers have surfaced through scientific blind wine tasting, such as inconsistency in identifying wines based on region and price.\n\nThe Sumerian stories of Gilgamesh in the 3rd millennium BCE differentiate the popular beers of Mesopotamia, as well as wines from Zagros Mountains or Lebanon. In the fourth century BCE, Plato listed the main flavors of wine, and classified the aromas as \"species\", or families.\n\nAristotle proposed a sensory tasting defined by the four elements (air, water, fire, and earth) further deepened by the Roman noblewoman Lucretia in the first century BCE.\n\nAlthough the practice of tasting is as old as the history of wine, the term \"tasting\" first appeared in 1519. The methodology of wine tasting was formalized by the 18th century when Linnaeus, Poncelet, and others brought an understanding of tasting up to date.\n\nIn 2004, Richard Axel and Linda B. Buck, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their contribution to the knowledge of the senses of taste and smell.\n\nThe results of the four recognized stages to wine tasting:\n– are combined in order to establish the following properties of a wine: \nA wine's overall quality assessment, based on this examination, follows further careful description and comparison with recognized standards, both with respect to other wines in its price range and according to known factors pertaining to the region or vintage; if it is typical of the region or diverges in style; if it uses certain wine-making techniques, such as barrel fermentation or malolactic fermentation, or any other remarkable or unusual characteristics.\n\nWhereas wines are regularly tasted in isolation, a wine's quality assessment is more objective when performed alongside several other wines, in what are known as tasting \"flights\". Wines may be deliberately selected for their vintage (\"horizontal\" tasting) or proceed from a single winery (\"vertical\" tasting), to better compare vineyard and vintages, respectively. Alternatively, in order to promote an unbiased analysis, bottles and even glasses may be disguised in a \"blind\" tasting, to rule out any prejudicial awareness of either vintage or winery.\n\nTo ensure impartial judgment of a wine, it should be served \"blind\" – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black wine glass to mask the color of the wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.\n\nScientific research has long demonstrated the power of suggestion in perception as well as the strong effects of expectancies. For example, people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine. When given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive. French researcher Frédéric Brochet \"submitted a mid-range Bordeaux in two different bottles, one labeled as a cheap table wine, the other bearing a grand cru etiquette.\" Tasters described the supposed grand cru as \"woody, complex, and round\" and the supposed cheap wine as \"short, light, and faulty.\"\n\nSimilarly, people have expectations about wines because of their geographic origin, producer, vintage, color, and many other factors. For example, when Brochet served a white wine he received all the usual descriptions: \"fresh, dry, honeyed, lively.\" Later he served the same wine dyed red and received the usual red terms: \"intense, spicy, supple, deep.\"\n\nOne of the most famous instances of blind testing is known as the Judgment of Paris, a wine competition held in 1976 where French judges blind-tested wines from France and California. Against all expectations, California wines bested French wines according to the judges, a result which would have been unlikely in a non-blind contest. This event was depicted in the 2008 movie \"Bottle Shock\".\n\nAnother well-publicized double-blind taste test was conducted in 2011 by Prof. Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire. In a wine tasting experiment using 400 participants, Wiseman found that general members of the public were unable to distinguish expensive wines from inexpensive ones. \"People just could not tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine\".\n\nIn 2001, the University of Bordeaux asked 54 undergraduate students to test two glasses of wine: one red, one white. The participants described the red as \"jammy\" and commented on its crushed red fruit. The participants failed to recognize that both wines were from the same bottle. The only difference was that one had been colored red with a flavorless dye.\nFor 6 years, Texas A&M University invited people to taste wines labeled \"France\", \"California\", \"Texas\", and while nearly all ranked the French as best, in fact, all three were the same Texan wine. The contest is built on the simple theory that if people do not know what they are drinking, they award points differently than if they do know what they are drinking.\n\nVertical and horizontal wine tastings are wine tasting events that are arranged to highlight differences between similar wines.\n\nTasting flight is a term used by wine tasters to describe a selection of wines, usually between three and eight glasses, but sometimes as many as fifty, presented for the purpose of sampling and comparison.\n\nA tasting note refers to a taster's written testimony about the aroma, taste identification, acidity, structure, texture, and balance of a wine. Online wine communities like Bottlenotes allow members to maintain their tasting notes online and for the reference of others.\n\nThe temperature that a wine is served at can greatly affect the way it tastes and smells. Lower temperatures will emphasize acidity and tannins while muting the aromatics. Higher temperatures will minimize acidity and tannins while increasing the aromatics.\nThe Wine & Spirit Education Trust uses the following recommendations for serving temperatures:\n\nThe shape of a wineglass can have a subtle impact on the perception of wine, especially its bouquet. Typically, the ideal shape is considered to be wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use ISO XL5 glasses, which are \"egg\"-shaped. The effect of glass shape does not appear to be related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.\n\nWithout having tasted the wines, one does not know if, for example, a white is heavy or light. Before taking a sip, the taster tries to determine the order in which the wines should be assessed by appearance and nose alone. Heavy wines will be deeper in color and generally more intense on the nose. Sweeter wines, being denser, will leave thick, viscous streaks (called \"legs\" or \"tears\") down the inside of the glass when swirled.\n\nThere are five basic steps in tasting wine: color, swirl, smell, taste, and savor. These are also known as the \"five S\" steps: see, swirl, sniff, sip, savor. During this process, a taster must look for clarity, varietal character, integration, expressiveness, complexity, and connectedness.\n\nA wine's color is better judged by putting it against a white background. The wine glass is put at an angle in order to see the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.\n\nVarietal character describes how much a wine presents its inherent grape aromas. A wine taster also looks for integration, which is a state in which none of the components of the wine (acid, tannin, alcohol, etc.) is out of balance with the other components. When a wine is well balanced, the wine is said to have achieved a harmonious fusion.\n\nAnother important quality of the wine to look for is its expressiveness. Expressiveness is the quality the \"wine possesses when its aromas and flavors are well-defined and clearly projected.\" The complexity of the wine is affected by many factors, one of which may be the multiplicity of its flavors. The connectedness of the wine, a rather abstract and difficult to ascertain quality, describes the bond between the wine and its land of origin (terroir).\n\nA wine's quality can be judged by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total aromatic experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as cork taint; oxidation due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and wild yeast or bacterial contamination, such as those due to Acetobacter or \"Brettanomyces\" yeasts. Although low levels of \"Brettanomyces\" aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.\n\nThe bouquet of wine is best revealed by gently swirling the wine in a wine glass to expose it to more oxygen and release more aromatic etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules that comprise the essential components of a wine's bouquet. Sparkling wine should not be swirled to the point of releasing bubbles.\n\nPausing to experience a wine's bouquet aids the wine taster in anticipating the wine's flavors. The \"nose\" of a wine – its bouquet or aroma – is the major determinate of perceived flavor in the mouth. Once inside the mouth, the aromatics are further liberated by exposure to body heat, and transferred retronasally to the olfactory receptor site. It is here that the complex taste experience characteristic of a wine actually commences.\n\nThoroughly tasting a wine involves perception of its array of taste and mouthfeel attributes, which involve the combination of textures, flavors, weight, and overall \"structure\". Following appreciation of its olfactory characteristics, the wine taster savors a wine by holding it in the mouth for a few seconds to saturate the taste buds. By pursing ones lips and breathing through that small opening oxygen will pass over the wine and release even more esters. When the wine is allowed to pass slowly through the mouth it presents the connoisseur with the fullest gustatory profile available to the human palate.\n\nThe acts of pausing and focusing through each step distinguishes wine tasting from simple quaffing. Through this process, the full array of aromatic molecules is captured and interpreted by approximately 15 million olfactory receptors, comprising a few hundred olfactory receptor classes. When tasting several wines in succession, however, key aspects of this fuller experience (length and finish, or aftertaste) must necessarily be sacrificed through expectoration.\n\nAlthough taste qualities are known to be widely distributed throughout the oral cavity, the concept of an anatomical \"tongue map\" yet persists in the wine tasting arena, in which different tastes are believed to map to different areas of the tongue. A widely accepted example is the misperception that the tip of the tongue uniquely tells how sweet a wine is and the upper edges tell its acidity.\n\nAs part of the tasting process, and as a way of comparing the merits of the various wines, wines are given scores according to a relatively set system. This may be either by explicitly weighting different aspects, or by global judgment (although the same aspects would be considered). These aspects are 1) the appearance of the wine, 2) the nose or smell, 3) the palate or taste, and 4) overall. Different systems weight these differently (e.g., appearance 15%, nose 35%, palate 50%). Typically, no modern wine would score less than half on any scale (which would effectively indicate an obvious fault). It is more common for wines to be scored out of 20 (including half marks) in Europe and parts of Australasia, and out of 100 in the US. However, different critics tend to have their own preferred system, and some gradings are also given out of 5 (again with half marks).\n\nTraveling to wine regions is one way of increasing skill in tasting. Many wine producers in wine regions all over the world offer tastings of their wine. Depending on the country or region, tasting at the winery may incur a small charge to allow the producer to cover costs.\n\nIt is not considered rude to spit out wine at a winery, even in the presence of the wine maker or owner. Generally, a spittoon will be provided. In some regions of the world, tasters simply spit on the floor or onto gravel surrounding barrels. It is polite to inquire about where to spit before beginning tasting.\n\nA growing number of wine schools can be found, offering wine tasting classes to the public. These programs often help a wine taster hone and develop their abilities in a controlled setting. Some also offer professional training for sommeliers and winemakers. It is even possible to learn how to assess wine methodically via e-learning.\n\nBecause intoxication can affect the consumer's judgment, wine tasters generally spit the wine out after they have assessed its quality at formal tastings, where dozens of wines may be assessed. However, since wine is absorbed through the skin inside the mouth, tasting from twenty to twenty-five samplings can still produce an intoxicating effect, depending on the alcoholic content of the wine.\n\nTasting plays an important role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as organoleptic analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.\n\nWine grape varieties are variously evaluated according to a wide range of descriptors which draw comparisons with other, non-grape flavors and aromas. The following table provides a brief and by no means exhaustive summary of typical descriptors for the better-known varietals. \n\n\n"}
