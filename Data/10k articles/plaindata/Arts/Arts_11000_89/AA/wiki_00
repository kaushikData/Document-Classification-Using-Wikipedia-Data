{"id": "3840099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3840099", "title": "1650–1700 in Western European fashion", "text": "1650–1700 in Western European fashion\n\nFashion in the period 1660–1700 in Western European clothing is characterized by rapid change. The style of this era is known as Baroque. Following the end of the Thirty Years' War and the Restoration of England's Charles II, military influences in men's clothing were replaced by a brief period of decorative exuberance which then sobered into the coat, waistcoat and breeches costume that would reign for the next century and a half. In the normal cycle of fashion, the broad, high-waisted silhouette of the previous period was replaced by a long, lean line with a low waist for both men and women. This period also marked the rise of the periwig as an essential item of men's fashion.\n\nThe wide, high-waisted look of the previous period was gradually superseded by a long vertical line, with horizontal emphasis at the shoulder. Full, loose sleeves ended just below the elbow at mid century and became longer and tighter in keeping with the new trend. The body was tightly corseted, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the overskirt was drawn back and pinned up to display the petticoat, which was heavily decorated.\n\nSpanish court fashion remained out of step with the fashions that arose in France and England, and prosperous Holland also retained its own modest fashions, especially in headdress and hairstyles, as it had retained the ruff in the previous period.\n\nA daring new fashion arose for having one's portrait painted in \"undress\", wearing a loosely fastened gown called a \"nightgown\" over a voluminous chemise, with tousled curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of Peter Lely, which derive from the romanticized style originated by Anthony van Dyck in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn on the street or at court.\n\nThe \"mantua\" or \"manteau\" was a new fashion that arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the shoulders to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's Banyan, worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline in contrast to the broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or \"eardrops\" worn since the 1630s remained popular.\n\nThe mantua, made from a single length of fabric pleated to fit with a long train, was ideal for showing the designs of the new elaborately patterned silks that replaced the solid-colored satins popular in mid-century.\n\nIn a June 1666 diary entry, Samuel Pepys describes the Maids of Honour in their riding habits of mannish coats, doublets, hats, and periwigs, \"so that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men's coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever\". For riding side-saddle, the costume had a long, trailing petticoat or skirt. This would be looped up or replaced by an ankle-length skirt for shooting or walking.\n\nEarly in the period, hair was worn in a bun at the back of the head with a cluster of curls framing the face. The curls grew more elaborate through the 1650s, then longer, until curls were hanging gracefully on the shoulder. In the 1680s hair was parted in the center with height over the temples, and by the 1690s hair was unparted, with rows of curls stacked\nhigh over the forehead.\n\nThis hairstyle was often topped with a \"fontange\", a frilly cap of lace wired to stand in vertical tiers with streamers to either side, named for a mistress of the French King. This was popular from the 1690s to the first few years of the 18th century.\n\n\n\n\nWith the end of the Thirty Years' War, the fashions of the 1650s and early 1660s imitated the new peaceful and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military boots gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see Petticoat breeches) became so baggy that Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary: \"And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his Knees of his breeches, and so went all day.\" (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 \"this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome.\" This era was also one of great variation and transition.\n\nIn 1666, Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland, following the earlier example of Louis XIV of France, decreed that at court, men were to wear a long coat, a vest or waistcoat (originally called a \"petticoat\", a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a cravat, a periwig or wig, and breeches gathered at the knee, as well as a hat for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.\n\nThe unfitted looser fit of the 1640s continued into the 1650s. In the 1650s, sleeves ranged from above to below the elbow. The sleeves could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching the bottom of the rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of the sleeves.\n\nA longer and rather baggy coat (still with sleeves rarely going below the elbow) made an appearance in the early 1660s and as the decade progressed became the most popular coat. By the late 1660s, an upturned cuff became popular although the sleeves had still remained above the elbows. By the 1670s, a vest or waistcoat was worn under the coat. It was usually made of contrasting, often luxurious, fabric, and might have a plain back since that was not seen under the coat. It was a long garment which by the 1680s reached just above the knees. With the end of the 1670s the sleeves became longer and the coat more fitted. The 1680s saw larger upturned cuffs and the waist of the coat became much wider. The coat could have lapels or none. This coat is known as the \"justacorps\". The pockets on both sides of the coats were arranged horizontally or vertically (especially the mid to late 1680s) until the 1690s when the pockets were usually always arranged horizontally. The waistcoat could be sleeveless or have long sleeves. Typically, a long-sleeved waistcoat was worn in winter for added warmth. By the mid-1680s, ribbons were reduced to one side of the shoulder until by the 1690s, they were gone.\n\nThe ruffled long-sleeved white shirt remained the only constant throughout the period, although less of it was seen with the advent of the waistcoat.\n\nDuring the early to mid-1650s, a rather small falling collar was in fashion. This increased in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. Cravats and jabots around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the cravat remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red was the most common color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of cravat made its appearance in the 1690s, the \"Steinkerk\" (named after the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692). Before, the cravat was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk cravat looped through a buttonhole of the coat.\n\nThe previous decade saw Spanish breeches as the most popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called petticoat breeches became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving the impression of a lady's petticoat. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee on the outside of the leg. Alongside the petticoat breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called rhinegraves, were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.\n\nWith the rising popularity of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned in favor of more close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.\n\nShoes again became the most popular footwear during the 1650s, although boots remained in use for riding and outdoor pursuits. \"Boothose\", originally of linen with lace cuffs and worn over the fine silk stockings to protect them from wear, remained in fashion even when boots lost their popularity. Boothose lasted well in the mid-1660s, attached right under where the rhinegraves were gathered below the knee, or fashionably slouched and unfastened. Shoes from the 1650s through the 1670s tended to be square toed and slightly long in appearance. Usually the shoes were tied with ribbon and decorated with bows. By the 1680s, the shoe became a bit more fitted; the heel increased in height (with red heels being very popular, especially for attendance at Court), and only a small ribbon if any remained.\n\nThe baldric (a sword hanger worn across one shoulder) was worn until the mid-1680s, when it was replaced by the sword belt (a sword hanger worn across the hips).\n\nThroughout the period, men wore their hair long with curls well past the shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the forehead a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, the popularity of the wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due to the success of the wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, Monseigneur was well known for wearing blond wigs. Facial hair declined in popularity during this period although thin moustaches remained popular up until the 1680s.\n\nHats vary greatly during this period. Hats with very tall crowns, derived from the earlier capotain but with flat crowns, were popular until the end of the 1650s. The brims varied as well. Hats were decorated with feathers. By the 1660s, a very small hat with a very low crown, little brim, and large amount of feathers was popular among the French courtiers. Later in the 1660s, very large brims and moderate crowns became popular. Sometimes one side of the brim would be turned up. These continued fashionable well into the 1680s. From the 1680s until 1700, various styles and combinations of upturned brims were in fashion, from one brim upturned to three brims upturned (the \"tricorne\"). Even the angle at which the brims were situated on the head varied. Sometimes with a tricorne, the point would meet over the forehead or it would be set at a 45 degree angle from the forehead.\n\n\n\nYoung boys wore skirts with doublets or back-fastening bodices until they were breeched at six to eight. They wore smaller versions of men's hats over coifs or caps. Small children's clothing featured leading strings at the shoulder.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "349941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349941", "title": "Being John Malkovich", "text": "Being John Malkovich\n\nBeing John Malkovich is a 1999 American fantasy comedy-drama film directed by Spike Jonze and written by Charlie Kaufman, both making their feature film debut. The film stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener, with John Malkovich and Charlie Sheen as themselves. The film follows a puppeteer who finds a portal that leads into Malkovich's mind.\n\nReleased by USA Films, the film was nominated in three categories at the 72nd Academy Awards: Best Director for Jonze, Best Original Screenplay for Kaufman and Best Supporting Actress for Keener.\n\nCraig Schwartz is an unemployed puppeteer in a forlorn marriage with his pet-obsessed wife Lotte. Gaining a file clerk job through Dr. Lester at LesterCorp, in the strange Floor low-ceiling offices of the Mertin-Flemmer Building in New York City, he develops an attraction to his coworker Maxine Lund, who does not return his affections. Craig discovers and enters a small door hidden behind a filing cabinet, and crawls down a tunnel. Suddenly he is quickly drawn into the opposite end of the tunnel, and finds himself in the mind of actor John Malkovich.\n\nCraig is able to observe and sense whatever Malkovich does for fifteen minutes before he is ejected and dropped into a ditch near the New Jersey Turnpike. He reveals the portal to Maxine, who sees the profit in it, and they let others use it for $200 a turn.\n\nCraig tells Lotte, who becomes obsessed with the experience, which had allowed her to live out her transgender desires. Lotte becomes attracted to Maxine when she is experiencing Malkovich, and she and Malkovich begin a sexual relationship with Lotte inside Malkovich's head while Maxine and Malkovich have sex. Craig, forsaken by both women, binds and gags Lotte and locks her in a cage with the chimpanzee, then enters Malkovich's mind and has sex with Maxine.\n\nSoon Craig, with his expert puppeteer skills, discovers that he is able to control Malkovich's actions while in his head. This causes the actor to feel paranoid that he is being controlled by someone else. After Malkovich consults with his friend Charlie Sheen, Malkovich trails Maxine to the Mertin-Flemmer building, where he himself tries the portal into his own head. He finds himself in a world where everyone has his face and they only say \"Malkovich\", and views his own lifetime history. He is then ejected and meets Craig by the turnpike. Malkovich demands that the portal be closed, but Craig refuses.\n\nLotte escapes with the help of her pet chimpanzee, who learned how to untie knots in Africa during a zoological capture, which is shown viewed from the chimpanzee's point of view. Lotte phones Maxine, revealing that it was Craig having sex with her while inside Malkovich. Maxine is annoyed but accepts it, because she enjoyed the experience.\n\nSeeking help, Lotte finds Lester, who reveals himself to be Captain Mertin, the original founder of LesterCorp. Lester is aware of the portal, and has a room dedicated to Malkovich's life. Lester explains that the person who is connected to the portal becomes \"ripe\" for lasting occupation by others on the eve of their 44th birthday. However, when the host turns 44, the portal immediately moves to its next host, an unborn child.\n\nIf it is possible for a person to take advantage of the \"ripe\" host and enter the portal then, one can greatly increase one's lifespan, and then one can eventually move on to another host. However, if one misses the brief window of \"ripeness\", and enters the portal even a minute too late, one will find oneself trapped within the unborn child who will be the next host. Lester, who has been using the portal in order to prolong his life, reveals his plan to use Malkovich when \"ripe\" as the host for him and several of his elderly friends. Offered the chance to join Lester's group, Lotte warns him that Craig currently has control of Malkovich.\n\nCraig finds he is able to remain in Malkovich indefinitely. He spends the next eight months in Malkovich's body, and using his puppeteer's control, he is able to turn Malkovich into a world-class puppeteer. Malkovich marries Maxine. He learns that she is pregnant as their relationship grows distant.\n\nAs Malkovich's 44th birthday approaches, Lester and his friends cut a deal with Maxine, and fake her kidnapping. They call up Craig, threatening to kill her if Craig does not leave Malkovich. Craig ends the call, causing Lester to think that he is calling their bluff. Lotte loses hope and attempts to kill Maxine, but they end up at the turnpike after falling through the portal and through Malkovich's shame-ridden subconscious. Maxine reveals to Lotte that Maxine conceived when Lotte was inside Malkovich's body, and she kept the child because it is \"theirs\". The revelation cements their love for each other.\n\nCraig calls Lester back, thinking Maxine is still in danger. Realizing his opportunity, Lester continues his bluff, convincing Craig to leave Malkovich's body. Lester and his friends enter the portal, taking control of Malkovich. Craig, discovering that Lotte and Maxine are together again, decides to enter the portal to become Malkovich and regain Maxine, however he has unknowingly missed the deadline for getting into Malkovich. Years later, an aging Malkovich, containing the collective mind of Lester and his friends, reveals to Sheen a plan to prolong their lives via Maxine's daughter Emily, within whom Craig is now permanently trapped. Through Emily's eyes Craig is forced to watch Maxine and Lotte living happily together as he futilely pleads that Emily look away.\n\nKaufman's idea of \"Being John Malkovich\" originated simply as \"a story about a man who falls in love with someone who is not his wife.\" Gradually he added further elements to the story which he found entertaining, such as floor 7½ of the Mertin Flemmer building; among his first ideas, Malkovich was \"nowhere to be seen\". He wrote the script on spec in 1994 and though it was widely read by production company and film studio executives, all turned it down. Hoping to find a producer, Kaufman sent the script to Francis Ford Coppola, who passed it on to his then-son-in-law Spike Jonze.\n\nJonze first read the script in 1996 and had agreed to direct the film by 1997. Jonze brought the script to Propaganda Films, which agreed to produce the film in partnership with production company Single Cell Pictures. Single Cell producers Michael Stipe and Sandy Stern pitched the film to numerous studios, including New Line Cinema, who dropped the project after chairman Robert Shaye asked: \"Why the fuck can't it be \"Being Tom Cruise\"?\". Jonze revealed in a September 2013 interview that Malkovich asked him the same question during their first meeting and also relayed Malkovich's attitude after filming commenced:\n\nJonze explained in the same interview that he didn't realize how brave Malkovich's performance in the film was.\n\nWith a budget of $10 million, principal photography of \"Being John Malkovich\" began on July 20, 1998, and continued through August. Filming took place primarily in Los Angeles; specific locations included the University of Southern California campus and the Observation Bar on board the RMS \"Queen Mary\".\n\nThe puppets in the film were created by Kamela Portuges and Images in Motion. Phillip Huber animated the puppets.\n\nDiaz's make-up artist Gucci Westman described styling Diaz in the role as \"a challenge, to make her look homely.\" The script included minimal physical descriptions of characters, and thus when Diaz took up the role she did not know that \"people weren't going to recognize me.\"\n\nCusack read the film's script after he had asked his agent to present him with the \"craziest, most unproduceable script you can find.\" Impressed with the script, he asked his agent to follow its progress and book him an audition, with which he won the role.\n\nKeener cited \"Being John Malkovich\" as an instance of her taking up a role based on the director's previous work. She had heard about Jonze's experience with music videos and took up the part of Maxine although she initially disliked the character and did not feel that she was right for the part.\n\nCharlie Kaufman said that there was never another actor in Malkovich's place in the script: \"The screenplay was always \"Being John Malkovich\", even before I had any expectation that John Malkovich would even read the script.\" He chose Malkovich because he believed there to be \"an enigmatic quality about him that works\", though Malkovich was partly chosen because of the sound of his name in repetition. Kaufman explained that \"When we were thinking of alternatives, we found that a lot of them weren't fun to say.\" Jonze's then-father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola was able to contact Malkovich, and Jonze flew with producer Sandy Stern to Malkovich's home in France. Stern said that Malkovich was \"half intrigued and half horrified\" when he first read the script, but he eventually agreed to star in the film.\n\nSpike Jonze makes a cameo appearance as Derek Mantini's assistant; Mantini is billed in the story as the greatest puppeteer in the history of the world and arouses Schwartz's envy. Brad Pitt also has a half-second-long cameo, as a miffed star in the documentary on Malkovich's career, who seems to be on the verge of saying something before the shot ends. Sean Penn appears as a fictionalized version of himself and a fan of Malkovich's puppeteer work. Film director David Fincher makes an uncredited appearance as Christopher Bing in the American Arts & Culture pseudo-documentary on John Malkovich. Winona Ryder, Andy Dick, and the members of Hanson can be seen in the audience of a Malkovich puppet show.\n\n\"Being John Malkovich\" was given limited release in the United States theatres on October 22, 1999, and opened across 25 screens. On its opening weekend, the film grossed US$637,731 across 25 screens with a per-screen average of $25,495. It expanded to another 150 screens the following week, bringing in $1.9 million with a per-screen average of $10,857. In its third week, the film's release widened to 467 locations and grossed $2.4 million, averaging a lower $5,041 per screen with a cumulative gross of $6.1 million. It moved into a wide release the next week, expanding to 591 screens, and grossed $1.9 million with a 20% drop in ticket sales. Its fifth week brought in $2.2 million with a 17% increase in ticket sales, which dropped a further 33% the following week despite further expansion to 624 screens. It finished its theatrical run after 26 weeks with a total gross of $22,863,596.\n\nThe film opened in the United Kingdom in March 2000, earning £296,282 in its debut week and closing after fifteen weeks with a total gross of £1,098,927. In France, the film opened in December 1999 with a gross of US$546,000 from 94 venues and went on to further success due to positive reviews and word of mouth. It grossed $205,100 from 109 screens on its opening weekend in Italy and ticket sales dropped by 37% the following week with a cumulative gross of $480,000 from 82 screens. Its German release brought in a total of $243,071. \"Being John Malkovich\" had a total foreign gross of $9,523,455, combined with its domestic gross to give an international total of over $32 million.\n\n\"Being John Malkovich\" was initially released in 2000 on VHS, both as a regular edition and a limited edition collector's set, and on DVD, with special features including a theatrical trailer, TV spots, cast and crew biographies, the director's photo album and featurettes on floor 7½ and puppeteering. A special edition DVD, released later the same year, included the aforementioned features, an interview with Jonze and two behind-the-scenes featurettes. It was released on HD DVD in 2008. The Criterion Collection released a special edition of the film on Blu-ray and DVD in 2012.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 93% \"Certified Fresh\" rating, based on 126 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"\"Being John Malkovich\" is both funny and smart, featuring a highly original script.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" The film ranked 441st on \"Empire\" magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time.\n\nIn his review, Roger Ebert awarded the film a full four stars; he would later name it the best film of 1999. His comments of praise included: \"Rare is the movie where the last half hour surprises you just as much as the first, and in ways you're not expecting. The movie has ideas enough for half a dozen films, but Jonze and his cast handle them so surely that we never feel hard-pressed; we're enchanted by one development after the next\" and he also felt that \"Either \"Being John Malkovich\" gets nominated for best picture, or the members of the Academy need portals into their brains.\" Another top critic Peter Rainer, writing for \"New York\", commented that \"dazzlingly singular movies aren't often this much fun\" in his review, and Owen Gleiberman, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", called it \"the most excitingly original movie of the year.\"\n\nJohn Malkovich's performance as himself in \"Being John Malkovich\" is ranked No. 90 on \"Premiere\" magazine's '100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time'.\n\nFollowing the financial and critical success of the 2017 film \"Get Out\", varying fan theories arose delving into the social horror themes of the film. In December of that year, the film's writer/director/producer Jordan Peele had an interview with \"Vanity Fair\" in which he discussed the major fan theories surrounding the film, confirming which of the most popular were true and false. Peele stated that he and \"Being John Malkovich\" director Spike Jonze had discussed the theory that \"Get Out\" was a secret stand-alone sequel to \"Being John Malkovich\", and, although admitting that \"Get Out\" was never conceived as a sequel to \"Being John Malkovich\" or thought of as such until after the film was released, Peele stated that since hearing the theory both himself and Jonze viewed the connection as both films being set in the same continuity, saying that \"as far as I'm concerned, it's true\".\n\nThe theory states that Catherine Keener's \"Maxine\" in \"Being John Malkovich\" is the same character as \"Missy\" in \"Get Out\"; \"Being John Malkovich\" concludes with Maxine and Lotte raising a child fathered by John Malkovich, but unbeknownst to them, the spirit of Craig is trapped inside the child's mind. With the portal to Malkovich's mind officially closed, they sought out other avenues for mind-transplant experimentation, eventually coming across Roman Armitage (Richard Herd), a neurosurgeon. Lotte entered the body of Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), Roman's son, and Emily, combined with the spirit of Craig, living in his own \"Sunken Place\", grows up to become the malevolent sociopath that is Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), all completely complicit in the scheme. Regarding his video about the theory in the January 2018 issue of \"Empire\", Peele expressed interest in casting John Malkovich in a \"Get Out\" sequel, stating that it would be \"cool\" to \"do the full trilogy\".\n\n"}

The derivative term bodegón is an augmentative that refers to a large \"bodega\", usually in a derogatory fashion. In Spanish art, a \"bodegón\" is a still life painting depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often arranged on a simple stone slab, and also a painting with one or more figures, but with significant still life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. It also refers to low-life or everyday objects, which can be painted with flowers, fruits, or other objects to display the painter's mastery.\n\nStarting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain in the second quarter of the 17th century. The tradition of still life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the \"breakfast piece\" was augmented by the \"trompe-l'œil\", the \"flower bouquet\", and the \"vanitas\". In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of \"breakfast piece\" did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Though now considered a Spanish invention, the classic trompe-l'œil presentation of fruit on a stone slab was common in ancient Rome.\nStill life painting in Baroque Spain was often austere; it differed from the Flemish Baroque still lifes, which often contain both rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items with fabric or glass. In bodegones, the game is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Both Netherlandish and Spanish still lifes often had a moral vanitas element. Their austerity, akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, never copies the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of many Northern European still life paintings.\n\nThe Velázquez paintings \"The Waterseller of Seville\", \"\", and \"The lunch\" are often described as \"bodegones\" due to the artist's depiction of jars and foodstuff. Some people reject this use of the term, calling them instead a mixture of genre painting in Bamboccianti style and still life.\n\n\n"}

The towers are known as one of the most important symbols of the city.\n\nAlthough they look identical, the towers were not built at the same time. The Southern tower, also known as the \"Speyetoren\", was built in 1385 to control the traffic on the river Lys. This tower was part of the fortified fence of the first medieval castle of the Counts of Flanders. The Speyentoren was also part of the 12th century rampart, destroyed by Louis XIV in the 17th century. <br>\nThe Northern tower, known as the \"Ingelborchtoren\" was built in 1415 and was used as an armory.\n\nNowadays, the towers are, together with the Artillerytower (\"in Dutch: Artillerietoren\"), the last remaining parts of the medieval city wall around the city. Most of the fortifications in Kortrijk were ordered to be destroyed by Vauban in 1683, a period in which the French and the Spanish armies repeatedly fought over control of the region. The remaining parts were destroyed in the 18th century and during the world wars.\n\nA statue of John of Nepomuk can be found in the middle of the bridge spanning between the two towers. This statue of the patron saint of the drowned has, ironically, fallen into the river Lys on several occasions due to warfare in the city.

He also published a selection of comics and zines during the same period. Starting in 1970 as a mail-order distributor specializing in underground comix, Plant absorbed some of his smaller rivals in the 1980s, and then sold his business to Diamond Comics Distributors in 1988.\n\nPlant (born 1952) was a comics and illustrated books enthusiast from San Jose, California, who throughout his high school years bought and sold back issue comic books through ads in fanzines such as \"Rocket's Blast\"/\"ComicCollector\". In 1968 he co-founded Seven Sons Comic Shop with five friends, John Barrett, Jim Buser, Mike Nolan, Frank Scadina, and Tom Tallmon, in San Jose. Selling Seven Sons within a year, Plant and three partners then opened another San Jose-based comics shop called Comic World.\n\nIn 1970 Plant founded Bud Plant, Inc. as a mail order company specializing in underground comix. (His Holly Drive address appears as the publishing address of the first issue of \"Promethean Enterprises\" in 1969.) In 1971, Plant and five friends spent the summer dealing comics at conventions in Houston, New York, Dallas, San Diego, Miami, Boston, and Washington, D.C.\n\nPlant had met direct market pioneer Phil Seuling on the convention circuit; in late 1973 Seuling called Plant to inform him that he had just cut a deal to ship Archie, DC, Marvel, and Warren comic books from a new distribution center in Sparta, Illinois. Seuling offered the West Coast region to Plant, but Plant turned him down, preferring then to concentrate on the proliferating underground comix market.\n\nPlant entered the publishing field in 1969 as one of the three publishers, along with Al Davoren and Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr., of \"Promethean Enterprises\" — a fanzine that attempted to straddle the comic/comix boundary. (\"Promethean Enterprises\" lasted from 1969–1974.) In 1972, Plant took over the publishing responsibilities of the fanzine \"Anomaly\" from Jan Strnad who had published three issues since 1969. Plant published issue #4 of \"Anomaly\", evolving it into an underground comic.\n\nAs part of his retailing enterprise Comics & Comix (see below), in 1974 Plant co-published one issue of the underground/sword and sorcery hybrid \"Barbarian Killer Funnies\"; moving from there to the similarly themed \"The First Kingdom\", written and illustrated by Jack Katz. (Under various publishing names, Plant published 24 issues of \"The First Kingdom\", from 1974 to 1986.) Comics & Comix also published three issues of Jim Pinkoski's \"Spaced\" in 1974–1976; two issues of \"Dan O'Neill's Comics and Stories\" in 1975; and two issues of Alfredo Alcala's \"Magic Carpet\" in 1977–1978.\n\nAround 1978, Plant was approached by Wendy & Richard Pini about publishing \"Elfquest\", but he turned the couple down, as he was getting out the comics publishing business. (The Pinis went on to much success as self-publishers.)\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985, Comics & Comix also published the industry trade journal \"Telegraph Wire\".\n\n\nIn August 1972, while still an undergraduate at San Jose State University, Plant co-founded what became the comics retailer Comics & Comix in Berkeley, California, with John Barrett and Plant's housemate Robert Beerbohm. In 1973 Comics & Comix helped host the first Bay Area comics convention, Berkeleycon 73, in the Pauley Ballroom in the ASUC Building on the University of California, Berkeley campus. At that show, Comics & Comix acquired over 4,000 Golden Age comic books owned by Tom Reilly. The phenomenal sales of the Reilly collection enabled Comics & Comix to open more retail locations, first in San Francisco (May 1973), on Columbus Avenue (down from the North Beach area on the way to Fisherman's Wharf), and later in San Jose and Sacramento, making it the first comic book chain store in America.\n\nIn the early 1980s Plant supplied product to Destiny Distributors, a sub-distributor based in Seattle and Vancouver, started by Phil Pankow (which was acquired by Diamond in 1990). In 1982, Plant bought out regional rival Charles Abar Distribution, based in Belmont, California.\n\nThe year 1985 brought two important developments in the distribution industry, the bankruptcy of Seuling's Sea Gate Distributors (Seuling himself had died in 1984), and the failure of Plant's West Coast rival Pacific Comics (which by that point was also a large independent comics publisher). Plant and Midwestern distributor Capital City Distributors opened \"an expanded facility in Seagate's old space in Sparta, Illinois, alongside [Pacific's old] printing plant\". In 1987, Plant acquired Alternate Realities Distributing, Inc., based in Denver, Colorado, a wholesale distribution operation run by Nanette Rozanski.\n\nBy 1988, Plant dominated distribution of comics in the West Coast, finally fulfilling Seuling's 1974 vision.\n\nIn the summer of 1988, Steve Geppi of Diamond Comics Distribution bought Plant's distribution warehouses, allowing Diamond to go \"national\", \"thereby assuming control of \"40 percent of the direct-sales market\".\n\nLater in 1988, Plant also sold Comics & Comix.\n\nSince divesting himself of his distribution and brick-and-mortar retail businesses, Plant has maintained a mail-order (and now Internet) presence in art books, trade paperbacks, and rare books. Plant is known for the colorful titles of his sales catalogs:\n\n\nOn July 5, 2011, Plant announced plans to sell his mail-order business and retire. Then in April 2012 (after failing to find a buyer) he announced plans to downsize (eliminating print catalogs) but continue operations.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "429191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429191", "title": "Gamut", "text": "Gamut\n\nIn color reproduction, including computer graphics and photography, the gamut, or color gamut , is a certain \"complete subset\" of colors. The most common usage refers to the subset of colors which can be accurately represented in a given circumstance, such as within a given color space or by a certain output device.\n\nAnother sense, less frequently used but still correct, refers to the complete set of colors found within an image at a given time. In this context, digitizing a photograph, converting a digitized image to a different color space, or outputting it to a given medium using a certain output device generally alters its gamut, in the sense that some of the colors in the original are lost in the process.\n\nThe term \"gamut\" was adopted from the field of music, where it means the set of pitches of which musical melodies are composed; Shakespeare's use of the term in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is sometimes attributed to the author/musician Thomas Morley. In the 1850s, the term was applied to a range of colors or hue, for example by Thomas De Quincey, who wrote \"Porphyry, I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble.\"\n\nIn color theory, the gamut of a device or process is that portion of the color space that can be represented, or reproduced. Generally, the color gamut is specified in the hue–saturation plane, as a system can usually produce colors over a wide intensity range within its color gamut; for a subtractive color system (such as used in printing), the range of intensity available in the system is for the most part meaningless without considering system-specific properties (such as the illumination of the ink).\n\nWhen certain colors cannot be expressed within a particular color model, those colors are said to be \"out of gamut\". For example, while pure red can be expressed in the RGB color space, it cannot be expressed in the CMYK color space; pure red is out of gamut in the CMYK color space.\n\nA device that can reproduce the entire visible color space is an unrealized goal within the engineering of color displays and printing processes. Modern techniques allow increasingly good approximations, but the complexity of these systems often makes them impractical.\n\nWhile processing a digital image, the most convenient color model used is the RGB model. Printing the image requires transforming the image from the original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors from the RGB which are out of gamut must be somehow converted to approximate values within the CMYK space gamut. Simply trimming only the colors which are out of gamut to the closest colors in the destination space would burn the image. There are several algorithms approximating this transformation, but none of them can be truly perfect, since those colors are simply out of the target device's capabilities. This is why identifying the colors in an image which are out of gamut in the target color space as soon as possible during processing is critical for the quality of the final product.\n\nGamuts are commonly represented as areas in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram as shown at right, with the curved edge representing the monochromatic (single-wavelength) or spectral colors.\n\nThe accessible gamut depends on the brightness; a full gamut must therefore be represented in 3D space, as below:\n\nThe pictures at left show the gamuts of RGB color space (top), such as on computer monitors, and of reflective colors in nature (bottom). The cone drawn in grey corresponds roughly to the CIE diagram at right, with the added dimension of brightness.\n\nThe axes in these diagrams are the responses of the short-wavelength (\"S\"), middle-wavelength (\"M\"), and long-wavelength (\"L\") cones in the human eye. The other letters indicate black (\"Blk\"), red (\"R\"), green (\"G\"), blue (\"B\"), cyan (\"C\"), magenta (\"M\"), yellow (\"Y\"), and white colors (\"W\"). (Note: These pictures are not exactly to scale.)\n\nThe top left diagram shows that the shape of the RGB gamut is a triangle between red, green, and blue at lower luminosities; a triangle between cyan, magenta, and yellow at higher luminosities, and a single white point at maximum luminosity. The exact positions of the apexes depends on the emission spectra of the phosphors in the computer monitor, and on the ratio between the maximum luminosities of the three phosphors (i.e., the color balance).\n\nThe gamut of the CMYK color space is, ideally, approximately the same as that for RGB, with slightly different apexes, depending on both the exact properties of the dyes and the light source. In practice, due to the way raster-printed colors interact with each other and the paper and due to their non-ideal absorption spectra, the gamut is smaller and has rounded corners.\n\nThe gamut of reflective colors in nature has a similar, though more rounded, shape. An object that reflects only a narrow band of wavelengths will have a color close to the edge of the CIE diagram, but it will have a very low luminosity at the same time. At higher luminosities, the accessible area in the CIE diagram becomes smaller and smaller, up to a single point of white, where all wavelengths are reflected exactly 100 per cent; the exact coordinates of white are determined by the color of the light source.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, industrial demands for a controllable way to describe colors and the new possibility to measure light spectra initiated intense research on mathematical descriptions of colors.\n\nThe idea of optimal colors was introduced by the Baltic German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald. Erwin Schrödinger showed in his 1919 article \"\" (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity) that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full. Thus two types of \"optimal color\" spectra are possible: Either the transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right, or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle. The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, but are generally less saturated. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but generally less saturated than) the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram, leading to magenta-like colors. Schrödinger's work was further developed by David MacAdam and Siegfried Rösch. MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the \"MacAdam limit\". On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds or minutes. The MacAdam limit, on which the most saturated (or \"optimal\") colors reside, shows that colors that are near monochromatic colors can only be achieved at very low luminance levels, except for yellows, because a mixture of the wavelengths from the long straight-line portion of the spectral locus between green and red will combine to make a color very close to a monochromatic yellow.\n\nLight sources used as primaries in an additive color reproduction system need to be bright, so they are generally not close to monochromatic. That is, the color gamut of most variable-color light sources can be understood as a result of difficulties producing pure monochromatic (single wavelength) light. The best technological source of monochromatic light is the laser, which can be rather expensive and impractical for many systems. However, as optoelectronic technology matures, single-longitudinal-mode diode lasers are becoming less expensive, and many applications can already profit from this; such as Raman spectroscopy, holography, biomedical research, fluorescence, reprographics, interferometry, semiconductor inspection, remote detection, optical data storage, image recording, spectral analysis, printing, point-to-point free-space communications, and fiber optic communications.\n\nSystems that use additive color processes usually have a color gamut which is roughly a convex polygon in the hue-saturation plane. The vertices of the polygon are the most saturated colors the system can produce. In subtractive color systems, the color gamut is more often an irregular region.\n\nFollowing is a list of representative color systems more-or-less ordered from large to small color gamut:\n\n\nThe Ultra HD Forum defines wide color gamut (WCG) as a color gamut that is wider than Rec. 709. WCG would include DCI-P3 and Rec. 2020.\n\n"}

As one observer put it, \"his first foray into Parisian modernism revealed an acute eye, an instinct for the historical moment and a deeply felt connection to an artist who opened up a new world for him.\"\nPearlman quickly made connections in the New York art world; he spent time in museums and archives; and he soon traded his decorative collection for carefully selected examples of modern works by impressionist, post-impressionist and expressionist European artists. Pearlman found himself captivated by the details of the lives of and associations among these artists, and his acquisitions often followed such discoveries; he \"liked connections and contexts, but as they arose within the framework of his vividly personal taste.\" Pearlman was invigorated by the pursuit of quality as well as the challenges of finding, authenticating and negotiating the ownership of increasingly rare masterpieces.\n\nIn the years after World War II, Pearlman began traveling to Europe. During an early trip to London he met Austrian expressionist Oskar Kokoschka. This would result in a lifelong friendship for Pearlman with one of the few living artists whose work he collected. On this same trip he also visited the places where Soutine had painted, trying to identify the landscapes he already knew well from their expressionist representation – an activity he would repeat with other artists and works as he built his collection. In his hunt for new works, he looked first to Soutine’s close associates, including Modigliani. Ultimately the collection would include seven paintings by Soutine, and four works by Modigliani, including a rare limestone head and two oil portraits (\"Léon Indenbaum\" and \"Jean Cocteau\").\n\nAlthough successful in business, Pearlman was never able to match the resources of his contemporaries. Instead, \"he was both lucky and clever: lucky in that, when he first started, the art he was interested in…could be secured for thousands rather than millions of dollars…and clever in that he continuously honed his eye and then applied his skills… to obtain the objects of his passion.\"\nIn 1950 Pearlman learned from a dealer that Van Gogh’s \"Tarascon Diligence\" was available from the heirs of the artist Milo Beretta. He quickly offered a combination of paintings and cash to make what is perhaps his most fabled acquisition – the last time a \"lost\" Van Gogh will reappear for the next sixty-five years. As a reviewer described, this Van Gogh was \"a typical Pearlman picture: assertive, pushing a characteristic manner to an extreme that is slightly unusual in the artist’s oeuvre.\"\nAlso in 1950, with the advice of noted Cézanne specialist John Rewald, Pearlman made his first purchase of a Cézanne watercolor, \"Cistern in the Park of Château Noir\". Over the following two decades, he would acquire more than thirty works by Cézanne and assemble the most distinguished collection of watercolors by the artist.\nThis new fascination with Cézanne did not distract Pearlman from his expanding interest in the works of other artists who lived and worked in France, many of whom knew, were influenced by and competed with one another. In addition to Modigliani, he added works by Toulouse-Lautrec, Manet, Degas, Renoir and Gauguin as well as several significant oil paintings by Cézanne, including the only known vertical-format of the artist’s favorite subject, Mont Sainte-Victoire. Pearlman continued to build his collection - buying, selling and trading works – for the three remaining decades of his life. His last two purchases were Cézanne watercolors: a late masterpiece (\"Still Life with Carafe, Bottle, and Fruit\") and \"Rocks at Bibémus\", which he had come to know when it appeared alongside works from his collection in a number of exhibitions.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, Henry and Rose Pearlman began lending individual works to major museums, initially for retrospectives of Soutine and Modigliani. As their collection took shape, loans and exhibitions of the collection became important to them and eventually occupied as much of Henry’s time and attention as acquisitions did. Although he never tired of the hunt, works that met his eye for quality and expressiveness were soon available only to those with the funds, not just a passion.\n\nPearlman’s generosity extended beyond the loans of works from his collection. He lent financial and other support to artists, including Kokoschka and Jacques Lipchitz, whose studio was destroyed by fire in 1952. Later he allowed his collection to be exhibited as a fundraiser for an organization helping immigrant populations settle in New York.\nThe Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958: twenty-seven selected works, lent anonymously, to the Baltimore Museum of Art. Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at Knoedler & Company in New York in 1959; the Fogg Museum in 1959; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1960, 1964, 1974 and 1986; the Detroit Institute of Art in 1967; the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1970; the National Gallery of Art in 1972, and at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 1982. A 1960 article in \"Connoisseur\" magazine describes Pearlman’s \"unflagging fascination of the hunt … [He] trusts a stubborn faith in his own taste and has no interest in assembling an anthology of the standard names of modern art, but only those artists who have a special appeal to his individual taste.\"\nIn 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s \"Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition\" series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton. (When not on loan, the collection was divided between their Park Avenue apartment and Henry’s office in midtown Manhattan.)\n\nHenry Pearlman spent much of the last year of his life organizing an exhibition of the collection at the Brooklyn Museum, which toured after his death to Princeton, Utica (NY), Williamstown (MA) and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. The collection returned to the Princeton University Art Museum in 1976, when Rose Pearlman, as head of the foundation, initiated a series of longer-term loans that continue to this day. A world-class university-based museum, Princeton offers the collection security, conservation, curatorial expertise and management of loan requests from museums around the world.\n\nIn 2014, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation and the Princeton University Art Museum initiated a tour of the collection, including its first exhibitions outside the United States. With the aim of expanding the audience for these works and artists, the tour (\"Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection\") opened at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England, in March 2014. Reviewers noted: \"A collection of truly stunning art works\" (\"Oxford Times\"); \"\"Cézanne and the Modern\"… makes you think about modern art – where it began, and what it is\" (\"The Guardian\"); \"The finest, best preserved collection of Cézanne watercolours in the world\" (\"Financial Times\"). In July, 2014, it traveled to the Musée Granet in Aix-en-Provence, France, where many of the Cézanne works were originally created. The collection then returned to North America with three exhibitions: The High Museum in Atlanta, the Vancouver Art Gallery and at Princeton for the fall semester of 2015.\n\nIn September, 2018, the Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation launched a redesigned website for the collection. Featuring high-quality, shareable images of the entire collection, it also offers details about where the works were created. Some of these include photographs of the same view today and many include Google Map locations. The site also has excerpts from Henry Pearlman’s \"Reminiscences of a Collector,\" with anecdotes about collecting, forgeries, negotiations, dealers and competing collectors. The paper archives of Pearlman’s correspondence and files, held at the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art, are also linked as well as other external resources, such as the letters of Van Gogh, X-rays of hidden works and connections among the artists represented in the collection.\n\nArchives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Henry and Rose Pearlman papers, 1893-1995 (bulk 1950-1980).\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives, Records, Exhibition negatives: installations. 38 Post-Impressionist Works from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Pearlman.1964.\n\nThe Brooklyn Museum Libraries and Archives, Records, Records, Exhibition views: installations.

Hurley worked for five years as a surf board shaper for various companies; including Lightning Bolt; Wind-an-Sea and Wave Tools. While becoming known as one of the premiere shapers in Southern California, Hurley licensed the U.S. rights to the up-and-coming Australian surf brand Billabong, and formed Billabong USA in 1983. Founding partners in Billabong USA besides Hurley were Bob Rowland (General Partners), and as limited partners Chip Rowland, Mike Ochsner, Joe Knoernschild, Tom Fletcher and Bill Hurley.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. licensing rights for Billabong were up for renewal after the company had grown to over $70M in sales in America. The USA management team decided to not renew the USA license for Billabong USA and in 1999 Hurley International was born.

{"id": "16350642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16350642", "title": "Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire", "text": "Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire\n\nIFAN (I.F.A.N., Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire or African Institute of Basic research) is a cultural and scientific institute in the nations of the former French West Africa. Founded in Dakar, Senegal in 1938 as the Institut français d’Afrique noire (the name was changed only in 1966), it was headquartered in what is now the building of the IFAN Museum of African Arts. Its charge was to study the language, history, and culture of the peoples ruled by French colonialism in Africa.\n\nIFAN first formed from a combination of three forces: the French colonial \"Civilizing mission\", the desire for more efficient Indirect rule through the understanding of African cultures, and research into the resources of the French dominion in Africa. Governors General Ernest Roume (1902–1908) and William Ponty (1908–1914) oversaw a reorganization of the French higher educational system in the colonies, and placing Georges Hardy in charge, moved the colonial administration into a model which used elements from both a \"Direct\", Assimilationist policy and an Indirect, rule by African proxy policy. The first required educational resources be created provided for the small minority of \"assimilated\" Africans, while the later required French colonial administrators be educated in the workings of African societies. To these ends, Hardy oversaw the creation of the École normale supérieure William Ponty (under the administration of Joseph Clozel), the publication \"Bulletin de l'Enseigement en AOF\", and the \"Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF\" (1918). This last, immensely successful as a scientific journal, inaugurated what one historian has called an era of \"..knowledge and control.\" \n\nThese imperial (or at best paternalist) scientific tools were turned on their head in a number of ways. First, the African higher education system (and the École William Ponty in particular) became the incubator for the political leaders of the independence movement. The study of African cultures, though invaluable to modern historians, did little to legitimize French rule through their Chefs du Canton, but it did provide Francophone West Africans (such as Léopold Senghor) with the materials to bolster their sense of cultural importance, as demonstrated in the Negritude movement. Finally, Europeans and Africans who opposed colonial rule came together in the years after the founding of IFAN in Dakar. IFAN was first conceived as an integration of various French colonial research systems in the early 1930s, and the vision was one of putting science to the service of the colonial project.\nJules Brévié, governor of French West Africa from 1930 to 1936, wrote that \"colonization needs scholars, impartial and disinterested researchers with broad vision, outside of the urgency and fire of action. He wanted a methodical research program into colonial history and African culture, and lobbied for an official scientific institute to undertake geographical, ethnographic and historical research.\n\nThe Popular Front government, in 1936, converted the \"Comite d'etudes historiques et scientifiques de l'AOF\" into the Dakar-based IFAN, and placed naturalist Théodore Monod at its head.\nFrom the opening of the institute in 1938, Monod sought to promote Africans into positions of authority in IFAN, such as ethnologist Amadou Hampâté Bâ. With the end of the Second World War, an influx of African intellectuals and French radicals (such as Jean Suret-Canale) found homes in IFAN and its branches, some taking part in political agitation through organisations like the Senegalese Popular Front, the RDA, and the Communist Study Groups of the 1940s.\n\nAs independence loomed in the 1950s, IFAN became an increasingly African institution. It formed a parallel National Archives to the Archives of the Governor General in Dakar, with Monod and the IFAN answering directly to the Minister of Overseas France - a rare degree of autonomy under the AOF system. By independence IFAN had offices in Saint-Louis, Abidjan, Bamako, Cotonou, Niamey, Ouagadougou, associated centers in Douala and Lomé, and permanent scientific research stations in Atar, Diafarabé, and Mont-Nimba. The 1940s and 50s saw more such projects undertaken, such as the 1943 \"Office of Colonial Scientific Research\" (Now the ORSTOM Soil Research Centre in Dakar-Hann) and the University of Dakar in 1957. Each of these institutions, begun as colonial instruments, evolved with the coming of independence into African tools to meet African needs.\n\nBy independence in 1960 IFAN had branches across French West Africa, in all the cities which were to become the capitals of independent states. The Dakar IFAN was transferred to Cheikh Anta Diop University in 1960, and Monod was kept on as director until 1965. In 1986 it was officially renamed \"IFAN Cheikh Anta Diop\", and maintains budgets, administration and staff independent of the university. It is today one of the most prestigious centers for the study of African culture in the world. As the main cultural research center of the colonies of French West Africa, it contains important collections from across Francophone Africa. Most branches of IFAN, notably in Conakry (Guinea), Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire), and Bamako (Mali), became the basis for national archives and research centers. Some still retain the \"IFAN\" title. The IFAN of Soudan Francais became the National Museum of Mali, while IFAN of French Guinea became the \"Institut National de Recherche et Documentation\": the National Library, Archives and Museum of Guinea.\n\nIFAN publishes a number of academic journals. \"Mémoire de l'IFAN\" and \"\" (abbreviated \"BIFAN\") mostly deal with linguistics, anthropology, history and archeology.\nThe Centre de Linguistique Appliquée de Dakar, in conjunction with IFAN, has published extensive work on the Languages of Africa, notably the multi-volume \"Lexique Wolof-Français\". Other sections of IFAN have published collections on everything from the fish to the dance of the West African region.\n\n"}

They are also an important manufacturer of pressure cookers. Lagostina was founded in 1901 in Omegna, Province of Verbania, Italy, as a family business initially focusing on stainless steel flatware.\n\n\"Lagostina\" was born in the Piedmont, in Omegna, on the shores of Lake Orta, a region famous for handcrafted household goods production, the company was founded by Carlo Lagostina and his son Emilio. \n\nThe metalcrafters gradually settled in this country where the economy was based mainly on wood, and contributed to the beginnings of industrial progress. The distribution of electric power, the development of railway network and the presence of a skilled workforce heavily impulsed the industrial boom. \n\"Lagostina\" was created in 1901 and quickly became an expert in the manufacture of tinned iron flatware. In the early 30's, the flatware production reached up to 30 000 pieces per day and included among its main customers the Navy, Army and Aeronautics.\n\nMassimo Lagostina, grandnephew of the founder, launched the first stainless steel kitchen tools . This material, totally new for this purpose but already known for its aesthetic qualities and its robustness, enables \"Lagostina\" to express the Italian style art of living. \n\nIn 1929, at the Fair of Milan, Massimo saw the first stainless steel sheets. In the United States and Sweden, industrial production of this alloy began after a long period of studies and experiences . At that time the first products manufactured for the chemical and food industries were experimented. Massimo quickly understood that this material could also be used successfully in the field of kitchen tools. \n\nIn Italy, the first collection of stainless steel kitchenware was created in 1934 by \"Lagostina\" : « Casa Mia ». The range bore the famous logo of \"the little house with smoking chimney\" and a met great success, immortalized in 1956 in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA). \n\nAt that time, selling steel pots and pans was not easy and Massimo faced the challenge to impose these new ranges. He made great efforts to make his new and much more expensive products accepted on the market. The first customers were communities, hospitals, liners but also department stores such as La Rinascente in Milan. The first retailers were mainly located in the Piedmont and Lombardy. \n\nMeanwhile, the rise of \"Lagostina\" continues through the manufacturing of technical parts for the aircraft industry until 1940. Indeed, demand for technical parts strongly increases during the War.\n\nThe years 1956–1957 showed the end of tinned iron production. It was a turning point for \"Lagostina\": the manufacturing process went from manual era to more mechanized manufacturing.\n\nThe company established its own research and development laboratory in order to promote the development of innovative processes. \nThe industrial boom inexorably went ahead in 1955 with the launch of the first thermodiffusion base: Thermoplan, which provides excellent heat conductivity across the bottom of the product. 1960 marks the birth of the \"Lagostina\" pressure cooker, with its system of closure and openness so characteristic : with a lever and a flexible cover, the product is entirely made of stainless steel whereas in rest of Europe, this type of product is still made of aluminium.\n\nThus a new plant and new office were built with the help of the architect Carlo Mazzeri, who had already participated as a designer to create the Moon Line handles and the kettle with Thermoplan base. Coming years dedicated to export, to Canada and particularly to France where a sales subsidiary was founded in 1967. \nDuring those years, \"Lagostina\" kept on drawing attention by an innovative and humorous communication such as \"The Line\" (La Linea) created by Osvaldo Cavandoli. \"Lagostina\" became one of the first Italian companies to understand the importance of advertising.\n\nOther famous designers helped the brand to establish its awareness and strong personality. Thus, Giorgetto Giugiaro designed the \"Atmosphere\" pressure cooker and the « Modia ».\n\nThis last part of the 20th century was characterized by a process of diversification of ranges.

Their early approach is notably different from the lean manufacturing that became famous through the book \"The Machine that changed the world\".\n\nWhen Toyota started manufacturing cars, there was a difference in manufacturing conditions between Japan and the USA. Toyota had few educated engineers and little prior experience. Car companies in US employed a well-educated work force in the cities and benefited from the research and student skill-sets of established engineering schools. To tackle this shortfall in knowledge and experience, Toyota conducted an incremental approach to development that built on their existing knowledge and became the basis of the lean systems Toyota uses today.\n\nAllen Ward studied Toyota’s lean product development system and found parallels with the US airplane industry. For instance, the Wright brothers’ method of constructing their airplanes became one of the legacies they passed on to the aviation industry. This approach enabled the USA to create one of World War II's most successful fighter planes from scratch in the short span of six months. After the war, Toyota incorporated many of the airline industry's findings into its own product development methodology.\n\nWhile some basic principles and guidelines are applicable across lean product development and lean production (such as waste reduction), many applications of lean process for development have focused more on the production approach.\n\nThe purpose of production is to manufacture products reliably within margins of control. The flow of value is physically evident, and the link between cause and effect is easy to see. For example, feedback on adjusting the speed of production is immediately realized in an increase or decrease in rejected items. Any decisions made must be based on best practice.\n\nOn the other hand, the purpose of product development is to design new products that improve the lives of customers. This is a complex space where the flow of value can only be discerned at an abstract level and where cause and effect might be separated by time and space. For example, feedback on the decision to design a certain feature will not be received until the product has been built and is in the hands of the customer. This means that decisions are made on short-cycle experimentation, prototyping, set-based design, and emergent practice. A premium is placed on creating reusable knowledge and reducing risk at handover points.\n\nAn essential point about these differences is summarized in the advice Jim Womack gives Harley Davidson: \"Don't try to bring lean manufacturing upstream to product development. The application of Lean in product development and manufacturing are different. Some aspects may look similar, but they are not! Be leery of an expert with experience in lean manufacturing that claims to know product development\" \n\nThe most common high level concepts associated with lean product development are:\n\nLean product development has been claimed to produce the following results:\n\nCompanies such as Toyota can attribute their success to lean product development. In 2000, Toyota launched 14 new products, a larger product line than GM's entire product offering. At that point, Toyota had just 70,000 employees while GM had more than five times as many.\n\nResearchers divide product development projects accordingly to their need drivers:\n\nFor example, the mobile phone was a \"Wanted\" product in the 1990s because it was on the leading edge of technology. Today it is regarded as a \"Needed\" product. It is common in the market. There is enough knowledge in the public domain so that even small companies can make a good mobile phone.\n\nProduct development methods can be classified according to whether they are focused on handling stable or non-stable conditions. Lean product development is a dynamic method of product development that handles unstable conditions.\n\nThe influence of need drivers and stability (or lack of stability) on product development are illustrated in the table below.\n\nExchange ref 12 with:\nOttosson, S.

Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of history (e.g. the Ancient Briton queen Boudica, who led the Iceni into battle against the Romans). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of military, be it recognized, like an organized army, or unrecognized, like revolutionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonhelema was a Shawnee chieftess and sister of Cornstalk.

The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.\n\nNusaybah bint Ka’ab, also known as Umm Ammarah (Ammarah's mother), a Hebrew woman by origin from the Banu Najjar tribe, was an early convert to Islam. Nusaybah was attending the Battle of Uhud like other women, and her intention was to bring water to the soldiers, and attend the wounded while her husband and son fought on the side of the Moslems. But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34230479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34230479", "title": "Madonna at the Fountain", "text": "Madonna at the Fountain\n\nThe Madonna at the Fountain is a 1439 oil on panel painting by the early Netherlandish artist Jan van Eyck. It belongs to van Eyck's late work, and is his last signed and dated painting. It retains its original frame, which bears the inscription; \n\nAt 19 x 12 cm. the painting is only a little larger than a postcard. It is set in a \"hortus conclusus\", with the fountain representing the fountain of life. The Madonna is depicted dressed in blue, her figure framed by a richly embroidered cloth of honor supported by two angels. The Christ Child holds prayer beads in his left hand, suggesting, along with the rose bush behind the figures, the rosary. In the mid to late 15th century the rosary was becoming increasingly popular in northern Europe.\n\nThis depiction is unusual in that the Madonna wears a blue robe; in the \"Dresden Triptych\", \"Lucca Madonna\", and the \"Madonna of Chancellor Rolin\", van Eyck had depicted her dressed in red. The use of red for the clothes of sacred figures was characteristic of 15th century Netherlandish painting, as cochineal was among the most expensive pigments available for dying textiles. In contrast to this, Italian painters used ultramarine for the robes of Madonnas. Thus van Eyck's choice of blue can be seen as evidence of Italian influence.\n\nWith the \"Madonna in the Church\" in Berlin, this is generally thought to have been one of van Eyck's two paintings of the Madonna and Child from the final years before his death in about 1441. Both show a standing Virgin, in contrast to his earlier treatments of the subject, and the great majority of other painted Virgins. Models for standing Virgins existed in the icons of Byzantine art, and both paintings also represent modified version of the \"eleusa\" type, sometimes called the \"Virgin of Tenderness\" in English, where the Virgin and Child touch cheeks, and he reaches out a hand. The \"Madonna in the Church\" wears a blue cloak over a red dress.\n\nDuring the early 14th and 15th century a large number of these works were imported into the North, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine, typified by the unknown artist responsible for the \"Cambrai Madonna\", and 14th century successors such as Giotto favoured showing the Madonna in a monumental scale, and it is accepted by art historians that van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had direct exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428. Van Eyck's two panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.\n\nIt is possible that the Byzantine flavour to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's \"Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati\" (c. 1431) had depicted one of the diplomats most involved with these efforts, acting for the Papacy.\n\nThe image was much copied, with a very high-quality copy assigned to van Eyck's workshop just after the original (Private collection, Maastricht). There is a workshop drawing of the central figures by Gerard David of about 1500-1510 in the Kupferstichkabinett Berlin, presumably used for his version of the figures, now with four angels and a panoramic landscape background of Bruges, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. This was planned as a precise copy, but the new elements were added while the work was in progress, as modern scientific analysis of the underdrawing shows.\n\n"}

The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly tricephalic (having three heads). It was once thought to be ithyphallic, an interpretation that is now mostly discarded. He has a horned headdress and is surrounded by animals. He may represent a horned deity.\n\nIt is purported to be one of the earliest depictions of the Hindu god Shiva (\"Pashupati\", meaning \"lord of animals\", is one of Shiva's epithets) or Rudra, who is associated with asceticism, yoga, and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three heads. The figure has often been connected with the widespread motif of the Master of Animals found in ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean art, and the many other traditions of horned deities.\n\nThe seal was uncovered in 1928-29, in Block 1, Southern Portion of the DK-G Area of Mohenjo-daro, at a depth of 3.9 meters below the surface. E.J.H. Mackay, who directed the excavations at Mohenjo-daro, and dated the seal to the Intermediate I Period (now considered to fall around 2350-2000 BCE) in his 1937-38 report in which the seal is numbered 420, giving it its alternate name.\nThe seal is formed of steatite and measures 3.56 cm by 3.53 cm, with a thickness of 0.76 cm. It has a human figure at the center seated on a platform and facing forward. The legs of the figure are bent at the knees with the heels touching and the toes pointing downwards. The arms extend outwards and rest lightly on the knees, with the thumbs facing away from the body. Eight small and three large bangles cover the arms. The chest is covered with what appear to be necklaces, and a double band wraps around the waist. The figure wears a tall and elaborate headdress with central fan-shaped structure flanked by two large striated horns. The human figure is surrounded by four wild animals: an elephant and a tiger to its one side, and a water buffalo and a rhinoceros on the other. Under the dais are two deer or ibexes looking backwards, so that their horns almost meet the center. At the top of the seal are seven pictographs, with the last apparently displaced downwards for lack of horizontal space.\n\nAn early description and analysis of the seal's iconography was provided by archaeologist John Marshall who had served as the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India and led the excavations of the Indus Valley sites. In addition to the general features of the seal described above, he also saw the central figure as a male deity; as three-faced, with a possible fourth face towards the back; and, as ithyphallic, while conceding that what appeared to be the exposed phallus could instead be a tassel hanging from the waistband. Most significantly he identified the seal as an early prototype of the Hindu god Shiva (or, his Vedic predecessor, Rudra), who also was known by the title Pashupati ('lord or father of all the animals') in historic times. In a 1928–29 publication, Marshall summarized his reasons for the identification as follows:\n\nLater, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of \"linga\", and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal. Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis \"has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism\". Writing in 1976, Doris Srinivasan introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that \"no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto- character of the seal has been accepted.\" And Alf Hiltebeitel noted that, following Marshall's analysis, \"nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure\".\n\nA lot of discussion has taken place about this seal. While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals. Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with \"Mahisha\", the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions. However, Mahisha strikingly resembles Mahesha, an epithet of Shiva Pashupati, besides recalling his vehicle, or vahana Nandi, the bull. This seems to provide further evidence for the interpretation of the Pashupati seal as a proto-Shiva archetype. Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the Vedic deities: Rudra, Agni, Mahisha, Varuna, Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, Ŗșyaśŗnga (sage with horns) who is a contemporary of Dasarataand; and some non-aryan deities, including the unlikely Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.\n\nWriting in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would \"go too far.\"\n\n"}

Postminimalism is more an artistic tendency than a particular movement. Postminimalist artworks are usually everyday objects, use simple materials, and sometimes take on a \"pure\", formalist aesthetic. However, since postminimalism includes such a diverse and disparate group of artists, it is impossible to enumerate all the continuities and similarities between them.\n\nThe work of Eva Hesse is also postminimalist: it uses \"grids\" and \"seriality\", themes often found in minimalism, but is also usually hand-made, introducing a human element into her art, in contrast to the machine or custom-made works of minimalism. Richard Serra is a prominent post-minimalist.\n\nIn its general musical usage, \"postminimalism\" refers to works influenced by minimal music, and it is generally categorized within the meta-genre art music. Writer Kyle Gann has employed the term more strictly to denote the style that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s and characterized by: \n\nMinimalist procedures such as additive and subtractive process are common in postminimalism, though usually in disguised form, and the style has also shown a capacity for absorbing influences from world and popular music (Balinese gamelan, bluegrass, Jewish cantillation, and so on). \n\nFor a musical style derived from minimalism, see Totalism (music). \n\n"}

Jorn had recently left the Situationist International, although he continued to support them financially. The stated purpose of the institute was to throw new light upon the Scandinavian culture in the age of migrations and Vikings. For several years, Jorn toured around Scandinavia and Europe with photographer Gérard Franceschi, former photographer for French writer and onetime culture minister André Malraux on his \"Musée imaginaire\" project, photographing ancient, Romanesque, Scandinavian, and Gothic figurative and decorative motifs in order to trace the connections between Scandinavian and European motifs. Jacqueline de Jong was also involved in several of these excursions.\n\nIn 1965, the Silkeborg municipal government provided a building to store over 20,000 photographs taken by Jorn, Gerard Franceschi and Ulrik Ross. Jorn was working with the publisher Skandinavisk Forlag in Odense to publish a series of books based on his research and documentation called \"10,000 Years of Nordic Folk Art\" (\"10 000 års nordisk folkekunst\"). Jorn gave up the project that year, however, when the press Skandinavisk Forlag refused to proceed unless the project was run by a committee of scholars, with Jorn having only one vote. He wanted total control of the subject of each volume. The Institute remained as a sort of imaginary museum, now housed in the Silkeborg Kunstmuseum, home of Jorn's art collection and archives. Jorn continued to publish articles and books on the subject of Nordic art as a tradition independent of what he called the \"Classical-Latin\" tradition.\n\nA publication series of theoretical texts (without illustration) in the name of the institute (\"Meddelelse fra Skandinavisk institut for sammenlignende vandalisme\") encompasses four books, all by Jorn\n\n"}

Typically this is found in aircraft that are equipped with fly-by-wire control systems.\n\nThe throttle controls are typically located to the left of the pilot (or centrally on a two-seat flightdeck). Only one hand may thus be used for the stick, and both-hands operation is neither possible nor required.\n\nThe side-stick is used in many modern military fighter aircraft, such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, Mitsubishi F-2, Dassault Rafale, and F-22 Raptor, and also on civil aircraft, such as the Sukhoi Superjet 100, Airbus A320 and later Airbus aircraft, including the largest passenger jet in service, the Airbus A380.\n\nThis arrangement contrasts with the more conventional design where the stick is located in the centre of the cockpit between the pilot's legs, called a \"centre stick\".\n\nIn the centre stick design, both the pilot's and co-pilot's controls are mechanically connected together so each pilot has a sense of the control inputs of the other. In typical Airbus side-stick implementations, the sticks are independent. The plane's computer either aggregates multiple inputs or a pilot can press a \"priority button\" to lock out inputs from the other side-stick. However, if both side sticks are moved in different directions (regardless of which pilot has priority), then both inputs are cancelled out. Examples of this occurrence include the 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 (an Airbus A330 flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris), and the 2015 crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 (an Airbus A320 flying from Surabaya to Singapore).\n\n\n"}

It was the second theatre of Stockholm during the Gustavian age. In 1784-87, before the inauguration of the theatre of Ristell in Bollhuset, it was the only dramatic theatre of the native language in Stockholm. \n\nThe Stenborg theatre was a continuation of the famous Stenborg Troupe; when the first Swedish national theatre at Bollhuset was closed in 1753–54, half of the troupe performed in various localities in the city under the leadership of Petter Stenborg. When the national stage was re-established by king Gustav III of Sweden in 1773, it did not include the old Stenborg troupe. In 1780, the troupe had finally acquired a proper house to perform in; Eriksbergsteatern, (The Eriksberg Theatre), and in 1781, the leadership was taken over by Petter Stenborg son, Carl Stenborg. In 1780–84, the Eriksberg Theatre was the only permanent theatre on the native language in Stockholm. \n\nThe Erikberg Theatre was uncomfortably outside of town, and the Stenborg troupe under Carl Stenborg searched for a new building. They made a partnership with the rich brewer Christina Nyman, who wanted to establish a theatre in Gamla stan and had obtained a permission to do so. The theatre was housed in a large building erected in Gamla Stan in 1782; the first floor housed four taverns and several apartments, while the second floor was reserved for the Stenborg troupe. From 1784, it was formally named \"Svenska komiska Teatern\" (Swedish Comical Theatre) or \"Svenska Teatern\" (Swedish Theatre) and from 1788 \"Komiska Teatern\" (Comedy Theatre). It was also known as \"Munkbroteatern\" (The Munkbro Theatre), after its location. The common name for it was always the Stenborg Theatre. \n\nThe theatre was luxuriously decorated and was in 1784 called the biggest theatre in the country. The theatrically interested king was present at its premier and gave away gifts to its performers. However, it did not have the same status as the Royal Swedish Opera and Royal Dramatic Theatre and was considered much less formal: it was a place for less formal and solemn performances, a place for satirical comedy and such, and foreigners sometimes compared it to a boulevard-theatre of the kind that was popular in Paris. I also performed less formal opera and musicals. \"The Barber of Seville\" had its Swedish premiere here in 1785, as well as \"The Marriage of Figaro\" in 1792. Also foreign guest-artists and circus-performances were given here; in the autumn of 1793, the English circus-company of Peter and James Price performed acrobatics and tight-rope-dancing here, were the four-year-old Louise Price danced on a rope. The theater's status as a less serious theatre did not stop actors from the Royal Swedish Opera and the Royal Dramatic Theatre to appear there; even Elisabeth Olin had performed here, and it was in fact used by actors and singers to work in during their conflicts with the managements with their regular stages. \n\nThe director Carl Stenborg, who was a celebrated opera singer at the Royal Swedish Opera, resided in one of the apartments, where he and his wife, the singer Betty Olin, hosted gatherings and parties for the cultural elite of the city. The theatre often took their staff from the choir at the Royal Opera, but it also took in its own students. An advertisement in 1786 read as follows: \n\nIn 1798, the new monopoly of the royal theaters was proclaimed in the city of Stockholm, and the Stenborg theatre was closed the year after (the monopoly was in effect until 1842). The building itself was torn down in 1899.\n\nStage manager\n\nDirector\n\nActors\n\n\nActresses\n\n\nGuest actors\n\n\n\n"}

It tells three stories, each depicting a different stage in the lives of Iranian women. It premièred at the 2000 Venice Film Festival and won several festival awards during 2000. Critical response was positive with some calling it \"Felliniesque\".\n\nThe film tells three different stories about women struggling for identity in Iran.\nHava is a young girl who, on her ninth birthday, is told by her mother and grandmother that she has become a woman with particular responsibilities. She may no longer play with her best friend, a boy, and must wear a chador when outside the home. Hava is given the choice when to start taking on those responsibilities—noon that day. A stick pushed into the ground will mark time as the shadow at noon will align with the stick.\n\nAhoo is a married woman who is taking part in a cycling race. Ahead of the rest, Ahoo is pursued by her husband on horseback. He tries to persuade her to stop cycling and come home, and then threatens her with divorce. When Ahoo defiantly continues cycling, her husband brings a mullah who divorces them. Later, tribal superiors and male family members come to stop Ahoo as she tries to escape the social constraints of being a woman.\n\nHoora is an elderly widow who has recently inherited a great deal of money. She decides to buy all of the material possessions she has ever wanted, but could not have while she was married. She ties strings to her fingers to remind her what to buy, and hires several young boys to help her. They take her and her new belongings to the beach. As she floats out to a waiting ship, seemingly free from the bonds of womanhood, she is watched by two of the young women from the bicycle race, and Hava, now wearing her chador.\n\n\nThe film was co-written by director Marzieh Meshkini, from a script by her husband Mohsen Makhmalbaf. It was shot on Kish Island in the Hormozgān Province in southern Iran. Makhmalbaf was on the island at the same time, shooting \"Testing Democracy\". Some commentators have suggested that Makhmalbaf was the real director of \"The Day I Became a Woman\" (as well as the films of his daughters). Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum has argued against these claims. Meshkini has said that as a female filmmaker, she found making a film in Iran particularly difficult, having to prove her abilities to the cast and crew before being accepted by them.\n\n\"The Day I Became a Woman\" premièred at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. It went on to play at several festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival, the London Film Festival and the New York New Directors/New Films Festival. It was given a limited release in American theatres on April 6, 2001. On its release in Iran, it was temporarily banned.\n\nThe film won awards at the Venice Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki Film Festival, the Pusan International Film Festival, the Oslo Films from the South Festival and the Chicago International Film Festival.\n\nCritical response to the film was generally positive. Film review site Rotten Tomatoes gave it a score of 87% based on 55 reviews. Metacritic gave it a score of 84% based on 24 reviews. Writing for the \"New York Times\", Stephen Holden called it a \"stunner of a film\" and \"an astonishing directorial debut\". He said that leaving characters' backgrounds and motives unexplored makes the film enigmatic. Roger Ebert said that the three stories lack \"the psychological clutter of Western movies\", describing this fact as a strength. In the \"Boston Phoenix\", Chris Fujiwara said that the film was \"largely successful, describing the second segment as the highlight, and calling the final story disappointing. In \"The New Yorker\", Michael Sragow called the film \"fierce, inspired filmmaking\". Several critics described it as \"Felliniesque\".\n\n"}

The work is widely considered his masterpiece.\n\nŽižek thematizes the Kantian notion of the sublime in order to liken ideology to the experience of something that is absolutely vast and powerful beyond all perception and objective intelligibility. Žižek provides an analysis of \"How did Marx Invent the Symptom?\", in which he compares the ways in which the notion of symptom runs through the work of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Žižek opposes any simplistic reading of the two thinkers, who are shown to have discovered the \"kernel\" of meaning concealed within the apparently unconnected \"forms\" of commodities (Marx) and dreams (Freud). The kernel of a commodity's content is labour and its latent meaning is the dream. Žižek thinks it more important to ask why latent content takes a particular form. Žižek therefore argues that according to both Freud and Marx the dream-work and commodity-form itself require analysis.\n\nŽižek believes \"The Sublime Object of Ideology\" to be one of his best books, while psychologist Ian Parker writes in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" that it is \"widely considered his masterpiece\". Anthony Elliott writes that the work is \"a provocative reconstruction of critical theory from Marx to Althusser, reinterpreted through the frame of Lacanian psychoanalysis\".\n\n"}
