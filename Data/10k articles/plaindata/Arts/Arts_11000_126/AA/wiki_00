In this theory, life and the affairs of living are conceived of as innately artistic, and related to as such politically. Politics are in turn viewed as artistic, and structured like an art form which reciprocates the artistic conception of life being seen as art.\n\nThis has also been noted as being connected to the Italian Futurist movement and postulated as its main motivation for getting involved in the Fascist regime of Italy.\n\nAlternately, \"politicization of aesthetics\" (or \"politicization of art\") has been used as a term for an ideologically opposing synthesis, sometimes associated with the Soviet Union, wherein art is ultimately subordinate to political life and thus a result of it, separate from it, but which is attempted to be incorporated for political use as theory relating to the consequential political nature of art. The author Emilio Gentile has stressed that these two ideas are not mutually exclusive, and both regimes had a large degree of the other. In Benjamin's original formulation, however, the politicization of aesthetics was treated conceptually as the polar opposite of the aestheticization of politics, the former treated as a kind of revolutionary praxis, redeeming force, or \"antidote\" to the corrupting fascistic influence of the latter.\n\n"}

Because the role has roots in the United Kingdom, they are most common in the English-speaking world.\n\nWhile an animateur is likely to have some skill in performance (with voice or instrument), conducting, teaching and possibly composition or arrangement, their principal role is to assist the communication of the performers and the audience. If working with a symphony orchestra, for instance, they might accomplish this through running participatory workshops to introduce audience members to aspects of the music to be performed, or by facilitating dialogue between performers and audience members.\n\nThere are animateurs in a wide number of musical styles. While they are probably most common in classical music, they also work in jazz, gamelan and some forms of African traditional music. Often they are employed by an orchestra, concert hall or music education service, though some also work freelance accepting commissions from groups or organisations for a specific occasion. Animateurs also work with children (where the discipline can approach a form of musical youth work) as well as adults. Possibly the best known animateur in the United Kingdom is Gareth Malone, who for some years ran the youth and community choirs at the London Symphony Orchestra's music education center, LSO St Luke's prior to applying the same skills in a series of television programmes.\n"}

In 1992, she was admitted to the New-York Pratt Institute to the department of Art and Design where she majored in Computer Graphics and Animation.\n\nThe mastering of computer graphics and animation marked the beginning of her enthusiasm for new media, new media art and technologies in art and the concentration of her interests on the transition from traditional classical methods to cyberarts that was afforded unlimited possibilities by the rapidly developing internet.\n\nIn 1997, she married Leonid Frants. Their son Daniil became the youngest artist at CYLAND MediaArtLab: when he was only twelve, he created, as part of Cyfest, an international educational game program for children, the workshop \"Humanizing Robots\", which he held in Russia, Germany, Japan, United States and Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to continuous exhibition activities as an artist and a curator in New York, St. Petersburg, Europe and Japan, in 2010, Anna traveled to the Polar Region as a member of the international group of artists within the program \"The Arctic Circle\" organized by the Canadian government. The program's purpose was to afford the artists an opportunity to visit hard-to-reach places of the Polar Region that are mostly known through scientific reports, which would subsequently allow them to create art projects based on their impressions of the region. In addition to the video footage filmed by Anna, that trip resulted in her interactive project Trembling Creatures, exhibited at the group show of participants of those annual expeditions that opened in May 2014 at the \"1285 Avenue of the Americas Art Gallery\" in New York.\n\n\nThe last two works were made as a result of the trip to the Polar circle as a member of the Canadian art expedition \"The Arctic Circle\" in 2009.\nArtworks by Anna Frants are presented by Borey Gallery (St. Petersburg, Russia), Dam Stuhltrager Gallery (New York, United States, and Berlin, Germany) and Barbarian Gallery (Zurich, Switzerland).

Its purpose was the representation in New York of the artists from Leningrad/St. Petersburg who have been working there from the postwar 1950s until the present time. The primary focus was on the so-called Leningrad undergroundâââthe unique and underexplored cultural phenomenon of the 1970s and the artistic and social environment that brought if forth.\n\nGradually, the scope of activities of \"Frants Gallery Space\" expanded and started including not just the traditional genres, such as painting, sculpture and graphics, but also the art associated with the latest technologies: cyberart, video art, computer animation, interactive installations as well as performance art.\n\nThe collection's creation was a natural extension of the development of \"St. Petersburg Arts Project\". Since 1998, Anna and Leonid Frants have been collecting works of visual arts of Leningrad underground. Their current collection also includes sculptures, assemblages, photographs, videos, objects of actual art and archival materials.\n\nIn January 2013, the Department of Contemporary Art at the Hermitage Museum organized, as a part of the project \"Actual Art of St. Petersburg, A Retrospective\", the exhibition \"Simple Rules\".

It is made of gilt-copper round a wooden core, decorated with champlevÃ© enamel, and of a shape called a \"chasse\". It was made in about 1180â90 in Limoges, France, and depicts one of the most infamous events in English history. On the night of 29 December 1170, Archbishop Thomas Becket was murdered in Canterbury cathedral by four knights obeying the wishes of King Henry II. It provoked outrage throughout Europe, and pilgrims flocked to Canterbury to pray at the site of the murder. In 1173 Becket was canonized and his shrine was one of the most famous in the Christian world, until its total destruction in 1538 during the reign of Henry VIII. It is thought that this particular casket was made to hold the relics of Thomas Becket that were taken to Peterborough Abbey (now Peterborough Cathedral) by Abbot Benedict in 1177. Benedict had been Prior at Canterbury Cathedral and therefore saw Becket's assassination. \n\nRelics of St Thomas were widely dispersed in the years following his death. Many were placed in caskets made in Limoges enamel in south-west France. This was the centre for the production of objects in champlevÃ© enamel, which is characterized by brilliant blues, colourful rosettes and boldly engraved figures. This casket is the most elaborate, the largest and possibly the earliest in date, but over 45 medieval chasses survive showing Becket's story and thought to have been made in Limoges. Another fine example is in the Burrell Collection in Glasgow. \n\nThe scene of the martyrdom is shown on the front, where one of the knights decapitates Becket in front of the altar, while on the sloping roof the archbishop's funeral is depicted. On the back are four saints and at the one end Christ is seated on a rainbow. The other end, which may have shown St Peter, is missing, as is the floor of the casket and its contents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1453013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1453013", "title": "Byzantine Revival architecture", "text": "Byzantine Revival architecture\n\nThe Byzantine Revival (also referred to as Neo-Byzantine) was an architectural revival movement, most frequently seen in religious, institutional and public buildings. It incorporates elements of the Byzantine style associated with Eastern and Orthodox Christian architecture dating from the 5th through 11th centuries, notably that of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) and the Exarchate of Ravenna.\nNeo-Byzantine architecture emerged in the 1840s in Western Europe and peaked in the last quarter of the 19th century in the Russian Empire, and later Bulgaria. Neo-Byzantine school was active in Yugoslavia between World War I and World War II.\n\nEarliest examples of emerging Byzantine-Romanesque architecture include the Alexander Nevsky Memorial Church, Potsdam, by Russian architect Vasily Stasov, and the Abbey of Saint Boniface, laid down by Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1835 and completed in 1840. The basilica followed the rules of 6th-century Ravenna architecture, although its corinthian order was a clear deviation from the historical Byzantine art. In 1876 Ludwig II of Bavaria commissioned Neo-Byzantine interiors of the externally Romanesque Neuschwanstein Castle, complete with mosaic images of Justinian I and Greek saints.\n\nDanish architect Theophil Hansen became a supporter of the style in the 1850s. His major works belonged to Neo-Grec style, however, Hansen as a professor of Byzantine art in University of Vienna shaped a generation of architects that popularized Neo-Byzantine architecture in Austro-Hungary, Serbia and post-war Yugoslavia. Hansen's own Neo-Byzantine work include the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Vienna (1856â1858) and the Christuskirche in Matzleindorf (1858â1860).\n\nSeveral Neo-Byzantine-style churches were constructed during the GrÃ¼nderzeit, for instance, the Sacred Heart Church or the Rosary Basilica, both located in Berlin.\n\nSophia Cathedral in Pushkin (1782â1788) was the earliest and isolated experiment with Byzantine treatment of otherwise neoclassical structures. In 1830s Nicholas I of Russia promoted the so-called \"Russo-Byzantine\" style of churches designed by Konstantin Thon. Nicholas I despised true Byzantine art; Thon's style in fact had little common with it. Notably, Thon routinely replaced the circular Byzantine arch with a keel-shaped gable, and the hemispherical Byzantine dome with an onion dome; layout and structural scheme of his churches clearly belonged to neoclassical standard.\n\nTrue Byzantine art, popularized by Grigory Gagarin and David Grimm, was adopted by Alexander II of Russia as the de facto official style of the Orthodox Church. Byzantine architecture became a vehicle of Orthodox expansion on the frontiers of Empire (Congress Poland, Crimea, the Caucasus). However, few buildings were completed in the reign of Alexander II due to financial troubles. Alexander III changed state preference in favor of Russian Revival trend based on 16th-17th century Moscow and Yaroslavl tradition, yet Byzantine architecture remained a common choice, especially for large cathedrals. Neo-Byzantine cathedrals concentrated in the western provinces (Poland, Lithuania), the Army bases in Caucasus and Central Asia, the Cossack hosts and the industrial region in Urals around the city of Perm. Architects David Grimm and Vasily Kosyakov developed a unique national type of a single-dome Byzantine cathedral with four symmetrical pendentive apses that became de facto standard in 1880s-1890s.\n\nThe reign of Nicholas II was notable for the architects's turn from this standard back to Hagia Sophia legacy, peaking in the Naval Cathedral in Kronstadt and Poti cathedral. These designs employed reinforced concrete that allowed very fast construction schedule; their interiors contained clear references to contemporary Art Nouveau yet the exteriors were a clear homage to medieval Constantinople. Russian Neo-Byzantine tradition was terminated by the revolution of 1917 but was continued by emigrant architects in Yugoslavia and Harbin.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, the Neo-Byzantine style is often seen in vernacular amalgamations with other Medieval revivalist styles such as Romanesque and Gothic, or even with the Mission Revival or Spanish Colonial Revival styles.\n\nNotable American examples include many buildings on the campus of Rice University in Texas, and Christ Church United Methodist in Manhattan by Ralph Adams Cram; Immaculate Conception Church in New Orleans, St. Francis de Sales Church in Philadelphia, Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception built between 1920 and 1959 in Washington, D.C. In the early 1980s, Philip Johnson designed a Post-Modernist addition to the Cleveland Play House that reflects Byzantine influences, and could thus be termed Neo-Byzantine.\n\nWestminster Cathedral (1895â1903), the Catholic cathedral in London, is the largest and most thorough British effort in the style, by John Francis Bentley (1839â1902), but there are a number of other churches and other buildings such as the Christ Church, Brixton Road, also in London, by Arthur Beresford Pite, 1897â1903, near the Oval Cricket Ground. From about 1850 to 1880 in Bristol a related style known as Bristol Byzantine was popular for industrial buildings which combined elements of the Byzantine style with Moorish architecture. Newman University Church, Dublin (1885â86) is a notable Irish example.\n\n"}

{"id": "39965341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39965341", "title": "Diana (pastoral romance)", "text": "Diana (pastoral romance)\n\nThe Seven Books of the Diana (Spanish: \"Los siete libros de la Diana\") is a pastoral romance written in Spanish by the Portuguese author Jorge de Montemayor. The romance was first published in 1559, though later editions expanded upon the original text. A sixteenth-century bestseller, the \"Diana\" helped launch a vogue for stories about shepherds, shepherdesses, and their experiences in love. One of its most famous readers was William Shakespeare, who seems to have borrowed the Proteus-Julia-Sylvia plot of \"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\" from Felismena's tale in the \"Diana\".\n\nThe \"Diana\" begins with a summary of previous events, telling us that the shepherd Sireno is in love with the shepherdess Diana. She once returned his love, but when Sireno was called away from their village, she was married to another shepherd named Delio. The story begins with Sireno's return after a year's absence, having already learned of Diana's marriage.\n\nOver the course of the first three books, Sireno encounters other shepherds and shepherdesses who sing songs and tell stories of their own experiences with frustrated love. Among these is a warrior maiden named Felismena (not truly a shepherd, but dressed as one for the time being), who rescues Sireno and his friends from an attack by wild men. The group of shepherds is persuaded to seek out the enchantress Felicia, who may have the power to solve their romantic dilemmas. In the fourth book they are welcomed by Felicia at her castle, and proceed to tour the wonders within (including the halls of Venus and Mars, and a performance by the legendary Orpheus). After they have rested, Felicia administers her magic potion, causing some of the shepherds to either forget or reroute their old desires. Sireno is cured of his love for Diana. In the final three books the initial love stories are resolved, with the shepherds either finding new love partners or recovering ones they believed they had lost. Felismena finds her lover, Don Felis (or \"Felix\" in the English translation), and rescues him from an attack by enemy knights. With a little help from Felicia's magic, Felis remembers his love for Felismena and the two are married. The Sireno-Diana situation, however, remains unresolved. Sireno can now greet Diana with calm indifference, but Diana is clearly pained by his transformation and laments her forced marriage to another man. The book ends by promising a sequel, though Montemayor never lived to complete one.\n\nThe 1561 edition of Valladolid introduced certain changes into the text which were often reproduced in later editions and translations. The most significant of these changes is the insertion of a new interpolated tale, the \"Abencerraje,\" told to entertain the shepherds in Felismena's palace at the end of book 4. Scholars now believe the new material to be Montemayor's own work, though the decision to add them to his pastoral romance may have been made by an enterprising publisher.\n\nMontemayor's text prompted two separate sequels in Spanish, both published in 1564: Alonso PÃ©rez's \"La Segunda Parte de la Diana\" (The Second Part of the Diana), and Gaspar Gil Polo's \"Diana Enamorada\" (Enamoured Diana). Bartholomew Yong's English translation of the \"Diana\" (completed ca. 1582 and published in 1598) included both sequels alongside Montemayor's original.\n\nWhile inspired by Jacobo Sannazaro's \"Arcadia\", Montemayor's \"Diana\" is arguably the first major work of pastoral prose fiction in the Renaissance, placing just as much emphasis on its ongoing plot and interwoven stories as on the poems sung by its shepherd protagonists. The \"Diana\" is significant for being one of the most popular works of early modern fiction not merely in Spain, but abroad as well. By JuliÃ¡n Arribas' count, there were at least thirty-one Spanish editions of the text printed in the sixteenth century alone. That same period also witnessed twelve French translated editions, and one English translation by Bartholomew Yong.\n\nFelismena's back-story in the \"Diana\", wherein Felismena cross-dresses as a page in order to pursue her faithless lover, was probably Shakespeare's source for his Two Gentlemen of Verona. Montemayor's ending differs from Shakespeare's play, however, since Montemayor's heroine saves her lover's life; the rekindling of their love is also helped along by Felicia's magic. Speaking more broadly, Geoffrey Bullough, Judith Kennedy, and Stuart Gillespie have all noted that Montemayor's pastoral romance seems to have been foundational for the development of Shakespeare's comedies: they point particularly to Montemayor's influential exploration of love, his emphasis on strong female heroines and their perspectives, and his treatment of amorous intrigue and entanglements.\nMontemayor's \"Diana\" was also a major inspiration for Philip Sidney in writing the \"New Arcadia\". Montemayor's influence was noticed early on by Sidney's contemporaries: as John Hoskins stated in 1599, \"For the web, as it were, of [Sidney's] story, he followed three: Heliodorus in Greek, Sannazarius' \"Arcadia\" in Italian, and \"Diana\" by Montemayor in Spanish.\" Sidney in particular seems to have modeled his opening scene between the shepherds Strephon and Klaius on Montemayor's Sireno and Sylvano.\n\nMiguel de Cervantes mentions the \"Diana\" with both approval and criticism in the book-burning episode of his \"Don Quixote\" (part I, chapter 6), where Quixote's friend the priest declares the book too good to be thrown in the fire like the rest:\n<poem> And opening one, [the priest] saw that it was \"Diana\", by Jorge de Montemayor, and he said, believing that all the others were of the same genre:\n\n\"Diana\" has been translated into English twice. First by Bartholomew Yong in 1598, (republished in 1968) and more recently by RoseAnna M. Mueller in 1989.\n"}
{"id": "11643218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11643218", "title": "Eau de toilette", "text": "Eau de toilette\n\nEau de toilette () literally translated as toilet water (but more appropriately described as \"grooming water\") is a lightly scented cologne used as a skin freshener. It is also referred to as \"aromatic waters\" and has a high alcohol content. It is usually applied directly to the skin after bathing or shaving. It was originally composed of alcohol and various volatile oils. Traditionally these products were named after a principal ingredient; some being geranium water, lavender water, lilac water, violet water, spirit of myrcia and 'eau de Bretfeld'. Because of this, eau de toilette was sometimes referred to as \"toilet water\".\n\nIn modern perfumery, the term eau de toilette is generally used to describe the concentration of fragrance, with eau de toilette being weaker than Eau de Parfum and stronger than Eau de Cologne.\n\nEau de toilette is a weaker concentration of fragrance than pure perfume. The concentration of aromatic ingredients is typically as follows (ascending concentration):\n\nPerfume oils are often diluted with a solvent, though this is not always the case, and its necessity is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water. Perfume has a mixture of about 10â20% perfume oils mixed with alcohol (acting as a diffusing agent delivering the fragrant odor) and a trace of water. Colognes have about 3â5% perfume oil mixed with 80â90% alcohol with about 5 to 15 percent water in the mix. Originally, eau de cologne was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons, oranges, tangerines, limes, and grapefruits. These were combined with such substances as lavender and neroli (orange-flower oil). Toilet water has the least amount of perfume oil mixture among the three main liquid \"perfumery\" categories. It has only about 2 to 8 percent of some type of perfume oil and 60â80% alcohol dispersent with water making up the difference. Toilet waters are a less concentrated form of these above types of alcohol-based perfumes. Traditionally cologne is usually made of citrus oils and fragrances, while toilet waters are not limited to this specification.\n\nIn the fourteenth century Hungarian Eau de toilette, predecessor of eau de cologne, was produced. Queen Elisabeth of Hungary (1305â1380) had created a fragrant oil mix with alcohol that evaporated slowly on her skin. Hungary Water was the first toilet water developed. This toilet water was called \"eau de la reine de hongrie\", and was based on rosemary.\n\nKing of France Louis XIV (1638â1715) used a concoction of scents called \"heavenly water\" to perfume his shirts; It consisted of aloewood, musk, orange flower, rose water and other spices.\n\nSome Eau de toilette were once considered restorative skin toners with medical benefits. The journal Medical Record reported in 1905 that a toilet water spray restores energies lost in business, social, and domestic situations. During the fourteenth through sixteenth centuries a type of toilet water called \"plague waters\" was supposed to drive away the bubonic plague.\n\n\n\n"}

The \"crew\" is also separate from the \"producers\" as the \"producers\" are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the film's intellectual property rights. A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional jobs date from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and film-making cultures.\n\nMotion picture projects have three discrete stages: development, production and distribution. Within the production stage there are also three clearly defined sequential phases â pre-production, principal photography and post-production â and many film crew positions are associated with only one or two of the phases. Distinctions are also made between above-the-line personnel (such as the director, the screenwriter and the producers) who begin their involvement during the project's development stage, and the below-the-line \"technical\" crew involved only with the production stage.\n\nA film director is a person who directs the making of a film. The director most often has the highest authority on a film set. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking.[1] Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film.[2]\n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. [3] Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.[4]\n\n\"Production\" is generally not considered a department as such, but rather as a series of functional groups. These include the film's producers and executive producers and production office staff such as the production manager, the production coordinator, and their assistants; the various assistant directors; the accounting staff and sometimes the locations manager and their assistants.\n\nProducer\nExecutive producer\n\nLine producer\nProduction assistant\n\nProduction manager\nAssistant production manager\nUnit manager\nProduction coordinator\n\n\n\n\nSince the turn of the 21st century, several additional professionals are now routinely listed in the production credits on most major motion pictures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrips are trained lighting and rigging technicians. Their main responsibility is to work closely with the electrical department to put in the non-electrical components of lighting set-ups required for a shot, such as flags, overheads, and bounces. On the sound stage, they move and adjust major set pieces when something needs to be moved to get a camera into position. In the US and Canada they may belong to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees.\n\n\n\nThe art department in a major feature film can often number hundreds of people. Usually it is considered to include several sub-departments: the art department proper, with its art director, set designers and draftsmen; set decoration, under the set decorator; props, under the props master; construction, headed by the construction coordinator; scenic, headed by the key scenic artist; and special effects.\n\n\nWithin the overall art department is a sub-department, also called the art departmentâwhich can be confusing. This consists of the people who design the sets and create the graphic art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome actors or actresses have personal makeup artists or hair stylists.\n\n\nThis department oversees the mechanical effectsâalso called practical or physical effectsâthat create optical illusions during live-action shooting. It is not to be confused with the Visual effects department, which adds photographic effects during filming to be altered later during video editing in the post-production process.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual effects commonly refers to post-production alterations of the film's images. The on set VFX crew works to prepare shots and plates for future visual effects. This may include adding tracking markers, taking and asking for reference plates and helping the Director understand the limitations and ease of certain shots that will effect the future post production. A VFX crew can also work alongside the Special effects department for any on-set optical effects that need physical representation during filming (on camera.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation film crews have many of the same roles and departments as live-action films (including directing, production, editing, camera, sound, and so on), but nearly all on-set departments (lighting, electrical, grip, sets, props, costume, hair, makeup, special effects, and stunts) were traditionally replaced with a single animation department made up of various types of animators (character, effects, in-betweeners, cleanup, and so on). In traditional animation, the nature of the medium meant that \"everything\" was literally flattened into the drawn lines and solid colors that became the characters, making nearly all live-action positions irrelevant. Because animation has traditionally been so labor-intensive and thus expensive, animation films normally have a separate story department in which storyboard artists painstakingly develop scenes to make sure they make sense before they are actually animated.\n\nHowever, since the turn of the 21st century, modern 3D computer graphics and computer animation have made possible a level of rich detail never seen before. Many animated films now have specialized artists and animators who act as the virtual equivalent of lighting technicians, grips, costume designers, props masters, set decorators, set dressers, and cinematographers. They make artistic decisions strongly similar to those of their live-action counterparts, but implement them in a virtual space that exists only in software rather than on a physical set. There have been major breakthroughs in the simulation of hair since 2005, meaning that hairstylists have been called in since then to consult on a few animation projects.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Angelina Jolie as Gia and Faye Dunaway as Wilhelmina Cooper, with Mercedes Ruehl and Elizabeth Mitchell. It was directed by Michael Cristofer and written by Cristofer and Jay McInerney. The original music score was composed by Terence Blanchard.\n\nGia Carangi (Angelina Jolie) is a Philadelphia native who moves to New York City to become a fashion model and immediately catches the attention of powerful agent Wilhelmina Cooper (Faye Dunaway). Gia's attitude and beauty help her rise quickly to the forefront of the modeling industry, but her persistent loneliness after the death of Wilhelmina drives her to experiment with mood-altering drugs like cocaine.\n\nShe becomes entangled in a passionate affair with Linda (Elizabeth Mitchell), a make-up artist. Their love affair first starts when both pose nude and make love to each other after a photo shoot. However, after a while Linda begins to worry about Gia's drug use and gives her an ultimatum; Gia chooses the drugs.\n\nFailed attempts at reconciliation with Linda and with her mother, Kathleen (Mercedes Ruehl), drive Gia to begin abusing heroin. Although she is eventually able to break her drug habit after much effort, she has already contracted HIV from a needle containing infected blood, having already progressed to AIDS. She spends the remainder of her life in the hospital until she dies.\n\n\n\"Gia\" was generally well received by critics, with an approval rating of 92% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. \"Kalamazoo Gazette\" commented: \"Jolie gives it her all in a thoroughly uninhibited and highly effective portrait of a woman living from thrill to thrill.\" Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. Conversely, Film Freak Central gave the film only 1.5 out of 4 stars and commented: \"Gia\" isn't hagiography, I'll give it that, but it \"is\" reductive to a fault.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the woman's request, British photographer Graham Mitchell filmed her speaking on the Maidan, and her friend, Ben Moses, edited the material into video he posted on her behalf on YouTube. By late March that year the video had been viewed over 8 million times.\n\nThe woman in the video was initially not named in order to keep her safe, but was eventually identified as Yulia Marushevska, a Kyiv Ph.D. student of Ukrainian literature at Taras Shevchenko National University. Marushevska conceived, wrote, and produced the video after the death of five people, three of whom died of gunshot wounds, on January 22. Marushevska felt she needed to do more for the EuroMaidan, and was frustrated with what she perceived to be the foreignersâ ignorance about why the protests were happening. She wanted to inform the viewers that the Ukrainians want to change their government due to concerns over alleged unchecked corruption within it. They ended up shooting a 2-minute, 4 second long video where she speaks in English.\n\nAfter only a few days on YouTube the video had about 3.5 million views. The video has received mostly positive reception, with the majority of the tens of thousands of comments supportive. By February 21 the video had approximately 70,000 \"likes\" and 4,000 \"dislikes\". A minority of voices argued that it is too one-sided. It has also been criticized for its professional production value, invoking a comparison to the controversial Kony 2012 viral video, which misled viewers into thinking it was a purely amateur production.\n\nBBC News has described it as having the greatest impact of any video from the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Moses has now completed a feature-length documentary, \"Witness to a Revolution\", about Yulia's and Ukraine's progress in the year following her viral video.\n\nIn July 2015 Mikheil Saakashvili, Governor of Odessa, announced that Yulia Marushevska accepted a job as Deputy Head of the Odessa Regional State Administration. According to Mikheil Saakashvili Yulia Marushevska had previously spent a year of training at Harvard and Stanford universities.\n\n"}

It was discovered in 1968 on the east side of Lough Lene, County Westmeath nearest to the Cummerstown/Windtown townlands of Collinstown. Radiocarbon dating revealed that the boat was constructed sometime between the 1st and 4th century.\n\nThe boat, which resembled a \"dug out canoe\", was discovered by divers belonging to the local Mullingar Sub Aqua Club. The divers moved the boat into shallower water and then, on 28 September 1958, brought it ashore for examination by experts.\n\nP. O hEailidhe from the National Museum of Ireland reported: \n\"the Lough Lene boat combines techniques of sewn boat construction together with that of mortise-and-tenon in a way which cannot be paralleled elsewhere at present.\" \n\"The Monks' Boat\" appellation comes from a 20th century local tradition that associates the boat with the monks of the ruined Fore Abbey. Although the boat pre-dates the abbey by several centuries, it is thought that the boat may have been sunk while moving religious artifacts used during mass in the Fore Abbey and on the convent on Nuns Island. Another legend holds that locals, believing the boat cursed with bad fortune, did not wish the boat recovered.\n\nBecause of theories about a possible Romano-British origin for the Lough Lene Boat, some have even speculated a connection between the vessel and St. Patrick. According to the Annals of Ulster (a late medieval document in which dates, especially of earlier events, are suspect) the era of St. Patrick's life coincides with scientific estimation of when the boat was constructed.\n\nIn 1882, the Royal Irish Academy was presented with the Bell of Lough Lene by the Barbavila estate proprietor, Mr. William Barlow Smythe. The bell had been discovered the previous year in Lough Lene by a boy fishing for eels on Castle Island, which was owned by Smythe at the time.\n\nGiven the close proximity to the Fore Abbey, the estate owner Smythe concluded that the bell possibly belonged to the St Feichin Abbey; During the Viking and Anglo-Norman oppressions, it may have been transferred to Nun's Island, before being eventually being hidden upon Castle Island.\n\nThe Bell has a faint outline of the Christian Celtic cross upon opposing sides of the bell and an ornamental periphiral border. Smythe pronounced that ornamentation was generally reserved for the cases or shrines for that era and was therefore most unusual.\nThe bell appears similar to two other bells from that early Christian period. These had been found in Bangor, County Down in the year 1832, and another in Cashel, County Tipperary in 1849. Smythe, the Barbavila owner, believed that the Lough Lene Bell was contemporary to these bells which were believed to be from the 7th century, therefore supporting his theory that it was possible that it could have been a relic of St. Feichins.\nThe Folklore Commission also hold an account of Kit \"the Blade\" Fagan's discovery of the bell, which consequentially triggered a local treasure hunt for further artifacts around Collinstown and Fore.\n\nWhile the original \"Lough Lene Bell\" remains within the National Museum, a half sized replica holds a place of pride as the Ceann Comhairle's Bell in DÃ¡il Ãireann.\nThis replica was presented to the DÃ¡il in 1931 by the widow of Major Bryan Cooper, a former member of the House.\n\n"}

Mal is played by actor Nathan Fillion in the 2002 TV series \"Firefly\" and the 2005 film \"Serenity\". In the series, Mal is a former Browncoat sergeant and the captain of the \"\"Firefly\"-class\" spaceship \"Serenity\". The character was named #18 in \"TV Guide\" Greatest Sci-Fi Legends list in 2004.\n\nConceived by Joss Whedon, the character Malcolm Reynolds was the only definite character he had in mind when formulating the ensemble cast. He wanted a hero, but not a hero in the classic sense; someone that is \"everything that a hero is not.\"\n\nIn the proposed pilot, Mal was much darker and considerably more closed-off. Fox network executives objected, and asked that Mal be \"lightened up\". For the second episode (\"The Train Job\"), Whedon created a more \"jolly\" Mal Reynolds.\n\nFillion shares his view on the motivations of the character he portrayed. Mal has lost so much that each character in the crew he has gathered on \"Serenity\" represents an aspect of himself he no longer has. \"In Wash, he has a lust for life and a sense of humor he's lost. In Jayne, he has selfishness. In Book, he has spirituality. In Kaylee, he has innocence. Everybody represents a facet of himself that he has lost and that's why he keeps them close and safe, and yet at arm's length.\"\n\nThe role was originally written for \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" co-star Nicholas Brendon (who played Xander Harris); however, the shooting schedule conflicted with his commitment to \"Buffy\".\n\nWhedon approached Nathan Fillion to play the lead, and after explaining the premise and showing Fillion the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that \"It was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories.\"\n\nLos Angeles prop shop Applied Effects was approached by Randy Erikson to create Mal's main gun, a \"Moses Brothers Self-Defense Engine Frontier Model B\", and gave them a week and a half. Erikson provided a foamcore conceptual mockup and the base guns, one of which was a five-shot .38 caliber Taurus Model 85 revolver. Erikson researched American Civil War-era revolvers for inspiration and the final mockup had a brass or bronze look, with the revolver a little elongated. The biggest challenge was masking the shape of the original revolver and still keeping it operable.\n\nOn the TV series \"Firefly\", a cast bronze pistol was used, but for the film \"Serenity\", a more detailed replica was created which had moving action and a blank pistol hidden inside, so that it could be fired in close-ups. Since this version was quite heavy, a resin replica was also constructed, which in addition to being less tiring for the actors to carry, could be thrown or dropped with less fear of injury. Nonfunctional replicas of the gun are commercially available for fans and collectors.\n\nGBB Custom Gunleather was tasked with creating Mal's gun holster, which was made out of oak-tanned carving leather. The character's coat, a relic of his time as a Browncoat, was a collaboration between Firefly costume designer Shawna Trpcic and Jonathan A. Logan, a leather artist. Trpcic sketched her idea and a cloth mockup was created before the final was made with domestic-farmed deerskin. The cuffs are actually the sleeves folded back, evoking the style of Oriental robes with their silk linings. Two coats were made for the character, one called \"Number 1\" coat and another called \"The Hero\" coat. The Number 1 coat's bullet hole is drawn in, while The Hero version has a detailed cut and sewn repair. As with the gun, replicas of Malcolm Reynolds' coat have also been made available commercially for fans.\n\nMalcolm's main mission is to keep his crew alive and to keep his ship flying. As \"Firefly\" writer Tim Minear stated in an interview: \"It's just about getting by. That's always been the mission statement of what the show isÂ â getting by.\" In \"Serenity\", Mal says of himself: \"[If the] Wind blows Northerly, I go North.\"\n\nMal was raised by his mother and \"about 40 hands\" on a ranch on the planet Shadow. Though Mal usually seems more practical than intellectual, he occasionally surprises his friends by displaying familiarity with disparate literature varying from the works of Xiang Yu to poems by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, though he has no idea \"who\" Mona Lisa is.\n\nMal volunteered for the Independents army during the Unification War against the Alliance, gaining the rank of sergeant during that time. His loyal second-in-command Zoe was by his side for most of the war, surviving many dangerous conflicts with him. The show mentions three such battles, including the Battle of Du-Khang in 2510 (featured in \"The Message\") and a long winter campaign in New Kashmir (as told by Zoe in \"War Stories\") where he commanded a platoon. Mal was also involved in the ground campaign during the Battle of Sturges (as seen in the comic book \"\"), which according to Badger was the \"bloodiest and shortest battle in all the war\", although Mal considers it a distant second. Mal fought in many more battles, but the turning point for him and the Independents came with their physical and emotional defeat at the \"Battle of Serenity Valley\" on the planet Hera. On-screen information in \"Serenity\" shows him to have been attached to the 57th Overlanders Brigade; in the series pilot, Badger calls it the \"Balls and Bayonets Brigade\", though it is unclear whether this was a disparaging nickname coined by Badger himself or the actual unit sobriquet (A deleted scene in \"Serenity\" marks it as the actual unit nickname. It is unknown if the deleted scene can be considered canon or not.)\n\nAfter the war, Mal acquired his own ship, a derelict 03-K64 \"Firefly\"-class transport. Mal named the ship \"Serenity\" after the Battle of Serenity Valley, the decisive battle of the Unification War.\n\nFillion won the \"Cinescape Genre Face of the Future AwardÂ â Male\" award by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA for his role as Malcolm Reynolds. Fillion also won the SyFy Genre Awards in 2006 for \"Best Actor/Television\" and was runner-up for \"Best Actor/Movie\".\n\nThe character was named #18 in \"TV Guide\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Greatest Sci-fi legends\" list in 2004. In 2008, \"Empire\" ranked Mal as #34 on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters. In 2011, \"SFX Magazine\" voted Mal Reynolds #1 on their Top 100 Sci-Fi icons of the century.\n\nIn her review of the film \"Serenity\" for \"The New York Times\", Manohla Dargis had this to say about the character and Nathan Fillion: \"Mal is no Neo redux; he's closer to Indiana Jones, if absent Harrison Ford's rakishly handsome looks and star magnetism. Like the rest of the cast, Mr. Fillion is a charming performer, but he borrows rather than owns the screen, which dovetails with Mr. Whedon's modest aspirations for this film.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "113084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113084", "title": "Mastaba", "text": "Mastaba\n\nA mastaba (, or ) or pr-djt (meaning \"house for eternity\" or \"eternal house\" in Ancient Egyptian) is a type of ancient Egyptian tomb in the form of a flat-roofed, rectangular structure with inward sloping sides, constructed out of mud-bricks (from the Nile River). These edifices marked the burial sites of many eminent Egyptians during Egypt's Early Dynastic Period and Old Kingdom. In the Old Kingdom epoch, local kings began to be buried in pyramids instead of in mastabas, although non-royal use of mastabas continued for over a thousand years. Egyptologists call these tombs \"mastaba\", from the Arabic word \"stone bench\".\n\nThe afterlife became a main focus of Egyptian civilization and ruled every aspect of the society. This is reflected in Egyptian architecture and most prominently by the enormous amounts of time, money, and manpower involved in the building of tombs. Ancient Egyptians believed the soul could live only if the body was preserved from corruption and depredation as well as fed.\n\nStarting in the Predynastic era and continuing into the later dynasties, the ancient Egyptians developed increasingly complex and effective methods for preserving and protecting the bodies of the dead. The ancient Egyptians initially buried their dead in pit graves dug out from the sand. The body of the deceased was buried inside the pit on a mat, usually along with some items believed to help them in the afterlife. The first tomb structure that the Egyptians built was the mastaba. Mastabas provided better protection from scavenging animals and from grave robbers. However, the human remains were not in contact with the dry desert sand, so natural mummification could not take place. Use of the more secure mastabas required Ancient Egyptians to devise a system of artificial mummification. Until at least the Old Period or First Intermediate Period, only high officials and royalty would be buried in these mastabas.\n\nThe word 'mastaba' comes from the Arabic word for a bench of mud, and when seen from a distance a mastaba does resemble a bench. Historians speculate that the Egyptians may have borrowed architectural ideas from Mesopotamia since at the time they were both building similar structures.\n\nThe above-ground structure of a mastaba is rectangular in shape with inward-sloping sides and a flat roof. The exterior building materials were initially bricks made of sun dried mud, which was readily available from the Nile River. Even after more durable materials like stone came into use, all but the most important monumental structures were built from the easily available mud bricks. Mastabas were often about four times as long as they were wide, and many rose to at least 30 feet in height. The mastaba was built with a north-south orientation, which the Ancient Egyptians believed was essential for access to the afterlife. This above-ground structure had space for a small offering chapel equipped with a false door. Priests and family members brought food and other offerings for the soul, or \"ba\", of the deceased because Egyptians believed that the soul had to be maintained in order to continue to exist in the afterlife.\n\nInside the mastaba, a deep chamber was dug into the ground and lined with stone and bricks. The burial chambers were cut deep, until they passed the bedrock, and were lined with wood. A second hidden chamber called a \"serdab\" (Ø³Ø±Ø¯Ø§Ø¨), from the Persian word for \"cellar\", was used to store anything that may have been considered essential for the comfort of the deceased in the afterlife, such as beer, cereal, grain, clothes, and precious items. The mastaba housed a statue of the deceased that was hidden within the masonry for its protection. High up the walls of the serdab were small openings that would allow the \"ba\" to leave and return to the body (represented by the statue); Ancient Egyptians believed the \"ba\" had to return to its body or it would die. These openings \"were not meant for viewing the statue but rather for allowing the fragrance of burning incense, and possibly the spells spoken in rituals, to reach the statue\".\n\nThe mastaba was the standard type of tomb in pre-dynastic and early dynastic Egypt for both the pharaoh and the social elite. The ancient city of Abydos was the location chosen for many of the cenotaphs. The royal cemetery was at Saqqara, overlooking the capital of early times, Memphis.\n\nMastabas evolved over the early dynastic period. During the 1st Dynasty, a mastaba was constructed simulating house plans of several rooms, a central one containing the sarcophagus and others surrounding it to receive the abundant funerary offerings. The whole was built in a shallow pit above which a brick superstructure covering a broad area. The typical 2nd and 3rd Dynasty mastabas was the 'stairway mastaba', the tomb chamber of which sank deeper than before and was connected to the top with an inclined shaft and stairs.\n\nEven after pharaohs began to construct pyramids for their tombs in the 3rd Dynasty, members of the nobility continued to be buried in mastaba tombs. This is especially evident on the Giza Plateau, where at least 150 mastaba tombs have been constructed alongside the pyramids.\n\nIn the 4th Dynasty (c. 2613 to 2494 BC), rock-cut tombs began to appear. These were tombs built into the rock cliffs in Upper Egypt in an attempt to further thwart grave robbers. Mastabas, then, were developed with the addition of offering chapels and vertical shafts. 5th Dynasty mastabas had elaborate chapels consisting of several rooms, columned halls and 'serdab'. The actual tomb chamber was built below the south-end of mastaba, connected by a slanting passage to a stairway emerging in the center of a columned hall or court.\n\nMastabas are still well attested in the Middle Kingdom. Here they had a revival. They were often solid structures with the decoration only on the outside. \n\nBy the time of the New Kingdom (which began with the 18th Dynasty around 1550 BC), \"the mastaba becomes rare, being largely superseded by the independent pyramid chapel above a burial chamber\".\n"}

It was founded in 1928 as the \"Nationalsozialistische Gesellschaft fÃ¼r deutsche Kultur\" (NGDK, National Socialist Society for German Culture') by Nazi ideologue Alfred Rosenberg and remained under his leadership until it was reorganized and renamed to the National Socialist Culture Community (\"Nationalsozialistische Kulturgemeinde\") in 1934. Its aim was to make a significant imprint on cultural life in Germany that was based on the aims and objectives of the inner circles of the Nazi Party. Upon its reorganization, it was merged with the \"Deutsche BÃ¼hne\" (German Stage), connected with the establishment of the official body for cultural surveillance, the \"Dienstelle Rosenberg\" (DRbg) and was later known as the Amt Rosenberg.\n\nThe number of members, who were organized in local chapters, rose from approximately 300 in 25 chapters in April 1929 to about 38,000 in 450 chapters by October 1933. \n\nThe members and supporters included representatives of the extreme right wing of the National Socialist movement. These included anti-Semitic literary historians Adolf Bartels, Ludwig Polland, Gustaf Kossinna, physicist and Einstein-opponent Philipp Lenard, publishers Hugo Bruckmann and Julius Friedrich Lehmann, the leaders of the Bayreuth Society Winifred Wagner, Daniela Thode, Hans Freiherr von Wolzogen, the widow of racial ideologist Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Eva Chamberlain, the composer Paul Graener, the philosophers Otto Friedrich Bollnow, and Eugen Herrigel, the poet and later president of the \"Reichsschrifttumskammer\" Hanns Johst; the architect Paul Schulze-Naumburg, who edited the periodical \"Kunst und Rasse\" [\"Art and Race\"], and who spoke at many events; Gustav Havemann, a violinist and later leader of the Reichsmusikkammer (who founded and lead a Kampfbund orchestra); the theater director Karl von Schirach; Fritz Kloppe who led \"Werwolf\", a paramilitary organization; and the theologian and nationalist musicologist Fritz Stein. Othmar Spann, Austrian political philosopher and a teacher of Friedrich Hayek. After an ad on April 20, 1933, Edwin Werner, PhD, founded his own association in Passau. \n\nCorporate and organizational members included the Association of German Fraternities [Deutsche Burschenschaften], the German Homeland Association [Deutsche Landsmannschaft], German College Gymnastics Associations [Turnerschaften an deutschen Hochschulen], the Association of German Guilds [Deutsche Gildenschaften], the Association of German Glee Clubs [Deutsche SÃ¤ngerschaft], the German College Music Society [SondershÃ¤user Verband], and German College Art Society [Deutscher Hochschulring].\n\nThe Society published the periodical \"Mitteilung des Kampfbundes fÃ¼r deutsche Kultur\" [\"Proceedings of the KfdK\"] from 1929 to 1931. Under the heading \"Signs of the Times\" they listed their enemies: Erich KÃ¤stner, Kurt Tucholsky, Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Walter Mehring, and the Berlin Institute for Sexual Research. Later the most frequently mentioned were Paul Klee, Kandinsky, Kurt Schwitters, the Bauhaus Movement, Emil Nolde, Karl Hofter, Max Beckmann, and Georg Grosz. Books by Ernst Toller, Arnold Zweig, Jakob Wassermann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Arnolt Bronnen, Leonhard Frank, Emil Ludwig, and Alfred Neumann were dismissed as not properly German. In 1930, the society directed a campaign against Ernst Barlach and the so-called \"hate art\" (\"Hetzkunst\") of KÃ¤the Kollwitz.\n\nThe Society published \"German Culture Watch: Journal of the KfdK\" in October 1932, reprinted in 1933, under the editorship of Hans Hinkel.\n\nTheir activities had a nationwide impact. In 1930 Wilhelm Frick, the Nazi Interior and Cultural minister of Thuringia and KdfK regional leader, named Hans Severus Ziegler of the Schultze-Naumburg firm as director of the Weimar Architecture Institute. He immediately dismissed all practitioners of the Bauhaus style. Frick ordered artworks by \"degenerate artists\" to be removed from the Schlossmuseum in Weimar. These included works by Otto Dix, Lyonel Feininger, Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Barlack, Oskar Kokoschka, Franz Marc, and Emil Nolde, although the latter was himself a nazi. Works by modernist composers Stravinsky and Hindemith were struck from state-subsidized concert programs, and books by Erich Maria Remarque, and films by Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Georg Wilhelm Pabst were banned outright.\n\nThe KfdK, under Frick's auspices, arranged its first major youth conference on Pentecost in 1930. It presented Nazi leaders Baldur von Schirach, Goebbels, GÃ¶ring, and DarrÃ©. Referencing Weimar's \"spiritual heroes\" a resolution called for \"strengthening German military will\" and, in reference to the arts, \"resistance against all populist harmful influences in the area of theater, literature and fine arts, and against alien architecture.\" The following Pentecost in 1931, saw a youth and cultural meeting in Potsdam, where Rosenberg gave a lectures on \"Blood and Honor,\" and \"Race and Personality\" and GÃ¶ring on the theme \"Readiness to fight to protect our culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are the main focus of the Finnish documentary film \"The Punk Syndrome\". In 2015, they qualified for the finals of Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu, which they later won; they represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 but got knocked out in the semi-final. The band disbanded in December 2016 when guitarist Pertti Kurikka turned 60 years old and retired from playing punk rock.\n\nPertti Kurikan NimipÃ¤ivÃ¤t began in a workshop run by Lyhty, a charity for adults with developmental disabilities. In 2004, Pertti Kurikka, the future guitarist of the band, met organizer Kalle Pajamaa of Lyhty. Pajamaa, who remains manager of the band today, noticed Kurikka's potential and sought to establish a band based upon him. They worked on the band's formation over the next five years, and in 2009 the band made its debut.\n\nIn 2009, Finnish director Pekka Karjalainen sought music performed by people with disabilities for the film \"VÃ¤hÃ¤n kunnioitusta\", which tells the story of a young girl with a learning disability aspiring to live an independent and normal life. Pertti Kurikan NimipÃ¤ivÃ¤t is featured in the film with their first-ever demo: \"Kallioon!\". The song became a hit, and the band soon discovered that they had a following outside the circle of disabled people.\n\nIn 2012, their fame grew as they were the main subject of \"The Punk Syndrome\", a Finnish documentary film. The documentary, depicting the band's story from its outset to their first European tour, earned them a following in Scandinavia and Germany.\n\nIn 2014, the band performed in a charity concert with Mr. Lordi of the Finnish rock band, Lordi. The charity concert was held in Rovaniemi on 23 May 2014 for benefit of the mentally-disabled community of Mozambique and the Lapland Metkat Association. Pertti Kurikan NimipÃ¤ivÃ¤t's bold and unusual take on Eurovision has been compared to that of Lordi, Finland's 2006 Eurovision entry and the winner of that year's contest.\n\nThe band entered Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu, Finland's national selection for Eurovision Song Contest 2015 with the song \"Aina mun pitÃ¤Ã¤\". They entered the contest in order to raise awareness for people with Down's Syndrome. On 7 February 2015, the band was one of the three acts from the first-semi finals to advance to the finals. On 28 February 2015, the band won Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu 2015, thereby becoming Finland's representative for the Eurovision Song Contest in Vienna, Austria in May 2015. PKN was the first punk band to compete in Eurovision.\n\nPKN's Eurovision bid was noticed by the international media and covered, for instance, by the BBC, \"The Guardian\", VICE and the Associated Press.\n\nPosti issued a PKN stamp on 11 May 2015, eight days before the first Eurovision semi-final in Vienna.\n\nThe band has four members: guitarist Pertti Kurikka, vocalist Kari Aalto, bassist Sami Helle and Toni VÃ¤litalo on drums.\n\nPertti Kurikka (born 26. December 1956 in Vihti) is the band's guitarist. He writes the music for the band and also some of the lyrics. He has released a spoken word cassette and a book of horror stories under the pseudonym Kalevi Helvetti. He also edits a zine called \"KotipÃ¤ivÃ¤\" (\"Home Day\").\n\nKurikka has been listening to punk for 30 years, but also listens to many other music genres ranging from classical to schlager and disco to children's music. He visits church regularly and plans to retire and stop playing music when he turns 60. He can also play the street organ.\n\nKari Aalto (born 25. May 1976 in Tampere) is the singer of the band and also writes most of their lyrics. He is a school friend of Kurikka. He has his own talk show on Finnish local radio station Bassoradio. He can play drums, bass and keyboards. He loves motorcycles, American cars, women and alcohol. He listens to 1950s and 1960s rock, psychobilly, rockabilly, surf, doowop and also rap, heavy metal and folk. He does not listen to punk in his spare time, as nowadays it is his profession.\n\nSami Helle (born 1973) plays bass in the band and also sings background vocals. As a child he lived in Boston, New York City, Paris and Antibes, so he can speak fluent English. He is politically active as a member of the Finnish Central Party and also as activist of \"Me itse\", an organization of disabled people. He wishes to become a municipal councillor of Helsinki and later a member of the parliament.\n\nToni VÃ¤litalo (born 1982 or 1983) is the drummer and also the youngest member of the band.

As a member of ICAIC during its early years, she was one of only two black filmmakers in attendance. She was the institute's first and for her lifetime Cuba's only, woman director. GÃ³mez is known for her first and final feature length film \"De Cierta Manera\" (1974) and as, \"a revolutionary filmmaker with intersecting concerns about the Afro-Cuban community and the value of its cultural traditions, women's issues, and the treatment of the marginalized sectors of society.\"\n\nBrought up in a middle-class black family in Havana, she studied music (piano), literature, and Afro-Cuban ethnography. She worked as a journalist on the youth publication Mella before joining the newly-formed Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria CinematogrÃ¡ficos (ICAIC) in 1961, where she subsequently served as assistant director to Jorge Fraga and TomÃ¡s GutiÃ©rrez Alea, as well as to the visiting French director AgnÃ¨s Varda. GÃ³mez made a series of documentary shorts on assigned topics before directing her first feature.\n\nSara GÃ³mez's last film, the hybrid narrative/documentary \"De cierta manera\", (translated for US audiences as \"One Way or Another)\" has been hailed as the \"first movie to truly explore conflicting threads of racial and gender identity within a revolutionary context.\" However, GÃ³mez died before the film could be completed and so TomÃ¡s GutiÃ©rrez Alea, Rigoberto Lopez, and Julio GarcÃ­a Espinosa supervised the sound-mix and post-production stages of preparing \"One way or Another\" for theatrical release. Noted Cuban film scholar Michael Chanan observes that the film is \"an aesthetically radical film...mix[ing]...fiction and documentary, in the most original way...by using real people to play themselves alongside professional actors.\" Haseenah Ebrahim writes about how GÃ³mez's work brings attention to religious groups such as the AbakuÃ¡, \"Afrocuban religions make an appearance in the films and videos of almost all Afrocuban filmmakers, and feature prominently in the work of GÃ³mez...\" and highlights the importance of Sara GÃ³mez's background as a black Cuban woman in cinema by noting, \"In the case of both GÃ³mez and Rolando, race has functioned to provide a perspective that is not mirrored in the work of non-black Cuban filmmakers. Significantly, both women self-identified themselves as black Cubans: Sara GÃ³mez has been quoted as saying she did not want to be 'just another middle-class black woman who plays the piano'\". Essayist Roberto Zurbano Torres states, \"it is also essential to mark her commitment to popular culture and her critical and self-critical passion through which she expressed the complexity of a world under construction: contributing a cinema of conscience, pointing out the virtues and defects of a social process that tried to change the world from an island in the Caribbean.\" \n\nAt the end of AgnÃ¨s Varda's short documentary (1963), Sara GÃ³mez is featured as a young filmmaker dancing Cha-cha-cha with her fellow ICAIC filmmakers (illustrated through photographic animation.) AgnÃ¨s Varda describes GÃ³mez in the documentary as one who, \"directs didactic films.\"Throughout the production of this film, \"She [GÃ³mez] had the opportunity to accompany the prestigious gala director AgnÃ¨s Varda in her tour of our country and collaborate with her in the documentary\"\n\nA few decades after GÃ³mez's time, The Swiss filmmaker Alessandra Muller directs the documentary film: \"Sara GÃ³mez: An Afro-Cuban Filmmaker\" (2004), supported both by ICAIC and AgnÃ¨s Varda, a film which looks back on her life and revisits GÃ³mez's family and friends. In the documentary, they describe her film sets as social events and that Sara would listen to everyone's input, of professionals and those who were not. Actor Mario Balmaseda notes \"We spent a lot of time with people from this area, almost three, four months living with them sometimes sleeping and eating in their home, and this made it a lot easier. We slipped from a professional level into friendship.\" In the documentary, she is praised by her family as as a woman who refused to choose between family and normal life. \n\nGÃ³mez died after editing her feature, at the age of 31, due to an asthma attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanan, Michael. \"Cuban Cinema\" Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004.

The \"Financial Times\" defined sexposition as \"keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on\". Its purpose, according to James Poniewozik, is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation.\n\nThe term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNutt to describe scenes in the HBO TV series \"Game of Thrones\" in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author George R. R. Martin said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show. The term \"sexposition\" has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows \"Deadwood\" and \"The Sopranos\" (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip \"Jane\". According to critic Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need.\n\nCritics have disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality. Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men. Neil Marshall, director of the second-season episode \"Blackwater\", recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that \"[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience\", an experience that Marshall described as \"pretty surreal\" to happen on the set of a major network production.\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does \"pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes\", while co-creator D. B. Weiss disagreed, countering that \"Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it.\" While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say \"Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO.\" \"Time\" reported before the seventh season in 2017 that \"Even if Benioff and Weiss donât always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back\".\n\nFan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 skit on \"Saturday Night Live\" when discussing Marshall's anecdote. Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of \"HBO First Look\" featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old \"creative consultant\" to \"Game of Thrones\". Played by Andy Samberg, the teenage boy was proud of \"mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs\" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin (Bobby Moynihan) called Friedberg \"a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it.\" The real Martin is aware of the skit, joking at San Diego Comic-Con that Friedberg could not attend because \"[t]here was a scene in Belfast with no boobies in it and he needed to go there to put that to rights\".\n"}

They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Staining is used for biochemical research, metal staining, and art (e.g.,Â wood staining, stained glass).\n\nThere can be intentional stains (such as wood stains or paint), indicative stains (such as food coloring or adding a substance to make bacteria visible under a microscope), natural stains (such as rust on iron or a patina on bronze), and accidental stains such as ketchup on a shirt.\n\nDifferent types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern textile engineering.\n\nThe primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface. The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature.\n\nA secondary method of stain involves a chemical or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category.\n\nFinally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a covalent bond and showing the color of the bound substance.\n\nIn many cases, stains are affected by heat and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Extreme heat, such as from ironing or dry cleaning, can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical compound that is impossible to remove.\n\nVarious laundry techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and stain removers are an important type of chemical in laundry detergents. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11582552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11582552", "title": "Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan", "text": "Temperance \"Bones\" Brennan\n\nTemperance \"Bones\" Brennan, Ph.D. (born Joy Keenan) is a fictional character portrayed by Emily Deschanel in the American Fox television series \"Bones\". An anthropologist, forensic anthropologist, and kinesiologist, she is described in the series as a leading authority in the field of forensic anthropology. Brennan first appeared on television, along with other series characters, in the \"Pilot\" episode of \"Bones\" on September 13, 2005. She is the main protagonist of the series along with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz).\n\nBrennan is loosely based on author Kathy Reichs. Her name originates from the heroine in Reichs's crime novel series, also named Temperance Brennan. The main similarity the two share is their occupation as forensic anthropologists. Brennan appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters. She was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters. Her relationship with Seeley Booth was listed in \"Entertainment Weekly\" \"30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples\".\n\nTemperance \"Bones\" Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works in the Medico-Legal lab at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She received her Ph.D. from Northwestern University, as stated in \"The Girl in the Fridge\". She has three doctorates, as referred to by Dr. Jack Hodgins in the episode \"The Parts of the Sum in the Whole\", in anthropology, forensic anthropology and kinesiology; it is implied that most of her work at the lab was related to either long-dead bodies or victims of genocide.\n\nHer occasional contract work for the FBI shifted the focus of her work. She was paired with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, and helped to solve two difficult cases; since then, they have worked together almost exclusively on modern-day murder cases.\n\nBrennan works with a group of other well-qualified colleagues, including the entomologist Jack Hodgins, her boss and forensic pathologist Camille Saroyan, forensic artist Angela Montenegro, and a host of eager graduate students. Booth refers to her crew of colleagues as \"squints\", because they come to crime scenes and squint at evidence. He is also responsible for her nickname, \"Bones\", which she initially detested.\n\nIn the first-season finale (which aired on May 17, 2006), Brennan stated that she was born in 1976, which would have made her either 29 or 30 (approximately the same age as Deschanel, who was born on October 11, 1976). In the fifth-season episode \"The Death of the Queen Bee\" (which aired nearly four years later, on April 15, 2010), it is implied that her then-current age was 33 years (based on Brennan's identification of a former high school classmate as the victim and statement that the classmate was 33).\n\nFirst mentioned in season 1, Brennan has a love of dolphins, which she shared with her late mother: in the season one finale, \"The Woman in Limbo\", Brennan examines a custom-made belt with a dolphin on the buckle, which had belonged to her mother, and which she mentions having once borrowed without asking first. Brennan's love of dolphins is highlighted again in season 2 episodes \"The Titan on the Tracks\", \"The Killer in the Concrete\" and \"Stargazer in a Puddle\", when she mentions the constellation Delphinus, (the Dolphin), her and her mother's favorite. In season 6, \"The Doctor in the Photo\", she is shown to wear a dolphin ring.\n\nIn \"Mummy in the Maze\", Brennan exhibited ophidiophobia when confronted with snakes, but later only shows a moment of fright when confronted with another snake in \"The Mastodon in the Room\". She takes note of this, voicing her observation that she only seems to lose her head around snakes when Booth is also \"there to be jumped upon\", and also she mentions that she once had a pet snake during high school. It should also be noted that, in \"The Man in the Morgue,\" Brennan handled a snake without any trace of fear, even while Booth is in the room.\n\nIn season one, in \"A Man on Death Row\", Dr. Brennan expresses her stance on the death penalty; \"I believe in the death penalty. There are certain people who shouldn't be in this world. The people who hacked hundreds of innocent children to death in Rwanda; beheaded them at their desks at school! The people who did that, they should be executed.\" In \"The Woman at the Airport\", Dr. Brennan is shown to have a strong dislike for plastic surgeons, believing them to be no more than \"glorified butchers with medical degrees\", and this dislike is voiced again in season 4, in \"Cinderella in the Cardboard\". In \"The Woman in the Car\", Dr. Brennan reveals that her third doctorate is in kinesiology, a field that would allow her and Angela to unravel how one of the bodies that had been found had been killed.\n\nIn season two, she expressed the desire to get a pet pig, whom she would have named \"Jasper\". Brennan's expertise in kinesiology would again prove its worth in \"The Truth in the Lye\" (she could tell that one of the murder suspects was pregnant just from having observed her gait), in \"The Girl with the Curl\" (she could tell if one of the young beauty pageant contestants was suffering from scoliosis just by watching them perform on stage), and in \"The Woman in the Sand\" (while undercover with Booth, she was able to tell Booth exactly how to beat his opponent from just having watched his moves). In \"Judas on a Pole\", she and her brother are identified as having the same blood type, blood type O. In \"Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House\", she is shown to be a good cook: Booth's comment on her mac and cheese is that he'd \"like to be alone with it\".\n\nIn the season 3 episode, \"Mummy in the Maze\", it is revealed that Brennan's favorite superhero is Wonder Woman, and that she always goes as Wonder Woman to the Jeffersonian's Halloween party. In \"The Baby in the Bough\", it is revealed that Brennan is a registered foster parent, at her brother's request, to take in his stepdaughters in case anything should happen to him and his girlfriend. In the season 3 episode, \"Intern in the Incinerator\", Booth reveals that Brennan's favorite flower is a Daffodil, her second favorite flower is a Daisy, and her favorite planet is Jupiter.\n\nIn season 5, in \"The Death of the Queen Bee\", when asked if she'd had a pet rat, Brennan discloses that she, in fact, had a pet mouse, snake and some spiders. During her time at Burtonsville high school, her only friend was the school custodian, Ray Buxley, with whom she would enjoy long, in-depth conversations on life and death, and who would also provide her with dead animals to dissect (Brennan having set out to become a forensic anthropologist,) and who would later be one of her books' biggest fans (she having named the killer in her first book, \"Bred in the Bone\", after him). According to the Burtonsville high school on-line yearbook entry on Brennan, in her senior year, she was a member of the Chemistry club and Math club, her interests were chemistry and mathematics, and she was a National Merit Scholar and an Academic All Star.\n\nIn the season 6 episode, \"The Blackout in the Blizzard\", Brennan mentions her pet iguana for the first time. This same episode show that one of the number of scientific publications that Brennan reads is \"Medicinal Physics Quarterly\", with one article on electrostatics and triboluminescence proving useful during the lab's power outage. Further concerning her pet iguana in \"The Truth in the Myth\", as a part of his rehab from alcohol abuse, Vincent Nigel-Murry made apologies for, among other things, having borrowed her iguana one night, wearing him as a hat for a party. She comments that he must have taken good care of her iguana as she has observed nothing wrong with him and further expresses some surprise that Vincent Nigel-Murry was able to get her iguana to stay perched atop his head, to which he replies that he was good with ribbons.\n\nIn season 8, \"The Tiger in the Tale\", Booth mentions to Sweets that Dr. Brennan once took Peyote with Native Americans.\n\nIn season 11, \"The Senator in the Street Sweeper\", Dr. Brennan is mentioned to be a member of the Green Party of the United States along with Dr. Hodgins.\n\nAlthough Brennan seemed to have a relatively normal childhood, her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old. Her older brother Russ, himself still an adolescent, was unable to care for her and she was put in the foster care system. By the time she started college she had been to twelve different schools and has specifically said that she hated the lack of consistency.\n\nThere has been contradictory evidence about her time in the system; in one episode, Brennan stated that her grandfather got her out of the foster system, but in a later episode, she indicates that she never knew her grandparents (possibly the two references are to two separate sets of grandparents, paternal and maternal). However, taking into consideration the fact that Brennan's parents had assumed new identities when she was 3-years-old, the grandfather who had taken her in from her time in the foster system may not have been her biological grandfather.\n\nHer time in foster care was quite traumatic and abusive; Brennan indicated that she was once locked in the trunk of a car for two days because she broke a plate, and in the episode \"The Finger in the Nest\", she reveals to Booth that she walked into her elderly neighbor's house to find the woman dead. In the same episode, she also mentions to Booth that her parents were very concerned about her afterwards, because she started faking her own death. In Season 2, she mentions that during her time in the foster care system, she kept a list of foster homes she had been kicked out of on the bottom of her shoe.\n\nIn the first season she hands Booth the file on her parents' disappearance and he agrees to look into it as a personal favor. It is later revealed in Season 2 that her parents, who were bank robbers specializing in safety deposit boxes, changed the family's identity after they stole some damaging FBI documents regarding the murder of an FBI agent and the false imprisonment of civil rights activist Marvin Beckett. Brennan's birth name was Joy Keenan. Her mother (real name Ruth Keenan, known under the assumed identity of Christine Brennan) had hoped to someday return to her children and family, but made a tape for Brennan to watch on her 16th birthday in case that never happened. Brennan later discovered that Ruth/Christine was murdered in 1993, two years after she and her husband went on the run.\n\nHer father Max Keenan re-entered Brennan's life when she and her brother were being threatened by an old acquaintance, who turned out to be Booth's boss, Deputy Director Kirby. Max evades capture after killing Kirby, and takes Russ into hiding to protect him. Later, Max allows Booth to arrest him in order to improve his relationship with his daughter. At trial, Max is acquitted of murdering Director Kirby (due in large part to a defense Booth indirectly came up with, positing an alternate theory of the crime in which Temperance was the killer instead, creating reasonable doubt), and he begins to rebuild his life.\n\nHe temporarily works at the Jeffersonian as a guide for children visiting the place and demonstrates his brilliant talent as a former science teacher. However, Brennan is concerned about a convicted felon having access to a lab that investigates crimes. Max also introduces Brennan to her cousin Margaret Whitesell, portrayed by Deschanel's real-life sister Zooey Deschanel.\n\nBrennan is best friends with her coworker, Angela, saying in the 6th-season premiere she loves Angela \"like a sister\" and is going to be an aunt to Hodgins' and Angela's newborn child. It is revealed at the end of the season six finale \"The Change in the Game\" that Brennan is pregnant and the father is Booth.\n\nIn Season 7, episode 2 \"The Hot Dog in the Competition\", Brennan and Booth found out they were having a baby girl. Their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named for Brennan's mother and her best friend), was born in a stable during the episode \"The Prisoner in the Pipe\". In the Season 7 finale, \"The Past in the Present\", key evidence in the death of her friend, Ethan Sawyer, is linked to Brennan. Max convinces her to go on the run along with Christine, saying that if she is arrested, even if she is found innocent, she may never see her daughter again.\n\nIn Season 8 premiere, it is revealed that while on the run, Brennan was communicating with Angela, via flowers, and eventually used this as a way to communicate with Booth. Despite being on the run, Brennan risks her safety and decides to meet directly with Booth in a hotel room after months of being a single mother. Eventually, they arrest Christopher Pelant, who was the real murderer of Ethan Sawyer, and Brennan is allowed to return to her family. Although Pelant blackmails Booth to prevent him from accepting Brennan's proposal by threatening to kill five innocent people if Booth accepted, also warning Booth not to give a reason for his refusal, this threat is removed when the team manage to kill Pelant, and Booth and Brennan marry in the Season 9 episode 'The Woman in White'.\n\nIn the Season 10 episode, \"The Eye in the Sky\", Brennan learns that she is pregnant with her and Booth's second child.\n\nThroughout the course of the series, Brennan is portrayed as a straightforward, brilliant anthropologist, who lacks social skills. Her social ineptitude is especially apparent when it comes to sarcasm, metaphors which she often interprets literally, and pop culture jokes and is often the source of comedy in the show. An example of this is when she mistakes Colin Farrell for Will Ferrell. In earlier seasons, she was characterized as straightforward and unable to detect social cues â she states that Booth once told her that she \"stinks at non-verbal communication\" â and was well-known within the FBI for being extremely difficult to work with. She began to acknowledge her lack of sensitivity after Booth bluntly told her outright that she was \"bad with people\" in \"A Boy in a Tree\". Her lack of \"political savvy\" and social skills was also a reason why she was passed over for Dr. Camille Saroyan as head of the Jeffersonian in Season 2. Other characters have described her as \"no fun\" and \"a rigid traditionalist\".\n\nShe had a difficult adolescence, and it is implied, often by Sweets, that her withdrawn social tendencies are a defense mechanism. She also sometimes struggles in identifying and explaining her emotions, and takes comfort in the rationality of her anthropological discipline. Although it has been stated that Brennan was based on a person with Asperger syndrome, this has never been confirmed in the plot of the series. The creator of the series has stated that the character was never labeled as having the syndrome in order to increase the appeal of the show on network television. This influence on her character also helps to explain her extreme rationality in early seasons, as well as some of her social difficulties. Brennan is a self-proclaimed atheist and often points out what she believes to be the irrationality of religious and spiritual beliefs. This has led to more than one argument with Booth, who is a devout Roman Catholic; he becomes particularly irate when she compares less common religions, such as voodoo, to Christianity. During the \"Sleepy Hollow\" crossover episode \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\", \"Sleepy Hollow\" protagonist Ichabod Crane notes that Brennan is so sceptical that she would dismiss the demon Moloch â the primary antagonist in the first two seasons of \"Sleepy Hollow\" â as nothing more than a tall man with a skin condition, although this does leave him reassured that she will not realise the nature of the secret tomb they have uncovered underneath the White House.\n\nBrennan is a bestselling author, who has been on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List for 18 weeks. She is trained in three types of martial arts, has hunting licenses in four states, and has a legally registered gun as well as a diving certificate. She promised to consider becoming a vegetarian after seeing how pigs were slaughtered (which was also the way her mother had been killed). However, in \"The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken\" (season 5, episode 6) Angela cites health reasons for Brennan's vegetarian diet. Brennan is also a trained amateur highwire performer, and speaks at least seven other languages, including Spanish, French, Latin, Chinese, Pashto Japanese, Norwegian (although she says only \"skull\" and avers that, as a forensic anthropologist, this is a word she knows \"in just about every language\"), Farsi, and German. She has also admitted to knowing a bit of Russian. She often says she does not \"put much stock in psychology\" and makes a point of noting that Dr. Sweets is not a real scientist as he \"bases his life on the vagary of psychology and emotions\".\n\nBrennan's personality undergoes significant changes throughout the course of the series. Her thinking becomes less rigid in later seasons, something which is observed by Dr. Gordon Wyatt, who notes that she is now able to distinguish the difference between accuracy and truth. In season 4, Booth takes her along to his interrogations and helps her learn how to set aside her scientific perspective and relate with the victim's family and suspects on a more interpersonal level. She is also able to put aside her rationality to support her friends in sometimes irrational pursuits, such as Angela's quest to raise money to save a pig from slaughter, and to comfort Booth, even using science or quoting directly from the Bible to rationalize his religious beliefs. Her sensitivity and empathy towards others are also much improved, seen quite strongly when she comforts his grandfather, and when she attends a funeral so that the victim's single mother won't be alone. She also displays more \"typical\" human emotions when in extreme stress. One example of this is her fear of snakes in \"The Mummy in the Maze,\" when a girl is in the process of being scared to death in a room, the floor teeming with snakes. This goes against her empirical nature, as, when Booth tells her that the snakes aren't venomous, she states that she is aware, but still refuses to step in the room, causing Booth to carry her on his back.\n\nBrennan begins to feel both dissatisfaction and discomfort with her work toward the end of the fifth season. She also sees some futility in her work, stating that no matter how many killers they catch, there will always be more. To help her gain new perspective, she later decides to head up an anthropological expedition to Indonesia for a year to identify some ancient proto-human remains, after mulling it over during the episode. However, 7 months later, she and everyone else return to D.C. in order to save Cam's job, and they all decide to stay.\n\nAs season 6 progresses, Brennan must confront her feelings for Booth, whom she rejected in the 100th episode from the previous season. Having returned from 7 months of introspection, she has come to terms with her romantic affection towards him, even admitting that she regretted not having given them a chance together, midway through the season. However, Booth returns from Afghanistan with a new love interest, war correspondent Hannah Burley, whom Brennan befriends. When Hannah rejects Booth's marriage proposal, Brennan must help him through the emotional fallout.\n\nIn the second to last episode of season 6 Booth and Brennan had sex, consummating their relationship, and it is revealed in the last few moments of the season finale that as a result, Brennan has become pregnant, with Booth the father. Throughout the episode (\"The Change in the Game\") Brennan has been seen asking Angela questions and making comments that make her seem excited and apprehensive; when she sees that Booth is happy with the news, she also seems overjoyed. This reflects her earlier desire to become a mother, circa season 4, as well as her desire that Booth be the father of the baby.\n\nIn the Season 8 episode \"The Shot in the Dark\", Brennan is shot while working in the lab late at night. While undergoing emergency surgery, she experiences a vision of meeting with her deceased mother, Christine Brennan. Initially dismissing this as a hallucination, Brennan experiences several more visions throughout the episode. During these discussions, it's revealed that Brennan's hyper rationalization originates from the very last piece of advice her mother gave to her (before going on the run) which was to use her brain instead of her heart. While that advice enabled Brennan to survive all these years, the vision of her mother explains, it's now time for Brennan to do more than just survive.\n\nSince entering a relationship with and marrying Booth and then having children, the character has undergone development personally and is shown to be a caring wife and protective mother. She would often put aside her own atheistic views and uses her hyper-rationality to justify Booth's religious beliefs, as shown in season 8 where she references the Bible in order to persuade Booth to forgive his mother and in the season finale where she agrees to a church wedding, rationalizing that she could appreciate the \"beauty\" of the ceremony and its significance to Booth.\n\nBrennan has had a number of relatively short relationships, including an ill-fated date with a man who turned out to be a murderer and the re-kindling of a romance with her former thesis supervisor. She has stated that although she does not always feel the need for a committed emotional relationship, she has engaged in casual relationships to \"satisfy biological urges\". In one episode, she was spending time with two men, one for his intelligence and the other for his sexual skills. In Season 5, episode \"The Plain in the Prodigy\", she tells Booth she lost her virginity at the age of 22 and when asked why she waited so long, she said it was because the decision was \"important to her\". FBI psychologist Lance Sweets postulates in a number of episodes that Brennan's apprehension over having relationships is largely due in part to the abandonment and abuse she experienced as a teenager after her parents disappeared. It is said that she \"hides\" herself behind a front of hyper-rationalism and she always keeps people at arms' length, except for those closest to her (namely FBI partner Seeley Booth and best friend Angela Montenegro). After much character growth, Temperance Brennan is now married to her principal love interest of the series Seeley Booth, and they have a daughter (Season 7) and a son together.\n\nFBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is Brennan's husband and partner, and the principal liaison between the Jeffersonian and law enforcement agencies. Prior to their marriage, he is also Brennan's principal love interest throughout the series. Although his working style initially clashed with Brennan's, they have since become full-fledged partners. Their compatibility has become one of the central points of the show, with many new characters mistaking them for a couple and co-workers, especially Angela, constantly speculating that they were \"more than partners\". Booth and Brennan have repeatedly risked their safety to save each other, including when Booth took a bullet meant for Brennan. After Booth rescues Brennan from the corrupt Agent Kenton, Booth lifts her off the hook she was hung on by putting her tied hands around his neck even though he himself was severely injured. In \"Two Bodies in the Lab\", in season 1, and in \"The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle\", in season 5, Brennan and Booth's mutual love for Foreigner's Hot Blooded is mentioned; Booth even refers to it as 'their song' in \"The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle\". Brennan once commented to Dr. Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) that she \"[couldn't] think of anything [she] wouldn't do to help Booth.\" Brennan's novels are also dedicated to him and the character Special Agent Andy Lister is based on him even though she still denies it.\n\nInitially Brennan was mostly dismissive of Booth due to their opposing worldviews and work styles â which is a source of friction and banter between them. Although she refused to admit it at first, Brennan enjoyed working with him from the beginning, even after their falling out when Booth got her drunk and \"fired\" her, and, in Season 1, she cajoled him into launching an investigation after finding three bone fragments on a golf course so he could work with the Jeffersonian team on the case despite the fact that the FBI technically had no jurisdiction. She often unknowingly offends him on a number of occasions during the first few seasons with her tactlessness, only realizing after being gently admonished by Angela or another member of the team. She comes to admire his ability to connect with people and read behavioral cues when interrogating suspects after coming to terms with her own lack of social skills. After finding out about his abusive childhood and haunted past in the Army, she also begins to respect him as a person. Booth, who is particularly taciturn in revealing emotions or speaking about his past, begins to open up to and confide in her. Since entering a relationship with (and eventually marrying) Booth, she is shown to be extremely supportive of him, even at the expense of her friendship with Angela. Additionally, she put aside her own misgivings several times for Booth's benefit; for example, she agrees to have Christine christened into the Catholic church and referenced the Bible when trying to talk Booth into forgiving his mother.\n\nBrennan acquired the nickname \"Bones\" from Booth. She initially disliked it but comes to regard it with affection. Booth and his son Parker are the only characters in the show she permits to use it and the former rarely addresses her by her first name or \"Tempe\".\n\nIn Season 2 Brennan shot and killed a person for the first time while working on a string of murders connected to serial killer Howard Epps. She was forced to pull the trigger after Epps' accomplice attacked and injured Booth with a pipe. At the end of the episode she confides in Booth of her conflicted feelings and finds comfort in the fact that Booth understood how she felt.\n\nThe relationship between Brennan and Booth has often become strained when either partner has a significant other. For example, Booth was quite irritable when Brennan dated Agent Sully, and their relationship was also strained when Booth's brother Jared was showing an interest in Brennan. Brennan constantly needled Booth while he was dating Tessa.\n\nWhen Brennan decided that she wanted to have a baby, she asked Booth if he would be the sperm donor. He agrees to Brennan's request at first, but subsequently struggles with the thought of not being involved in the life of his prospective child. Eventually he tells Brennan he cannot let her have his child if he is not allowed to be a father to it. Soon thereafter, it is discovered that he has a (benign) brain tumour. He has to undergo surgery, and though the surgery is successful, a poor reaction to anesthesia left him in a coma for several days. While in his coma, Brennan reads to him from her new novel, and he has an elaborate dream in which Brennan is his wife and that she is pregnant, and that the staff at the Jeffersonian play the characters in the novel. When he awakens, he initially suffers from amnesia, not recognizing Brennan.\n\nAlthough for the majority of the series Booth and Brennan denied that their relationship was anything more than friendly professionalism, they admitted to Dr. Sweets that they kissed and nearly spent the night together after their very first case together. After this discussion, Booth attempted to convince Brennan to give a relationship a try. However, she declined, telling him that she, unlike him, is not a gambler, and isn't able to take that kind of a chance. They have subsequently attempted to date other people, although the fact that Booth once comments that he regards Brennan as his \"standard\" for other women suggests that he, at least, has not completely moved on. Brennan does admit to her best friend Angela Montenegro that as time has gone on, she is unsure if she wants to keep doing consulting work for the FBI, citing that she is tired of murderers and victims, and is constantly worried that something will happen to Booth and she will be unable to save him. In the climax of Season Five, Brennan and Booth part ways for a year â he goes to Afghanistan while she leaves for the Maluku Islands in Indonesia â but they promise to meet, one year from that day, at the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nIn the beginning of season six (7 months later), they reunite in the stated place. Booth came back from Afghanistan, along with everyone else from various places, to help save Cam's job. They all decided to stay. Booth has a serious new girlfriend, Hannah, and despite the hints of her colleagues at Brennan's unconscious jealousy of their relationship, she vehemently denies feeling uncomfortable with the new situation. Through subsequent episodes her jealousy and resentfulness began becoming more apparent as Hannah and Booth started becoming more serious. In the episode \"The Doctor in the Photo\", Brennan realizes she is in love with Booth and confronts him, but she is let down when Booth says that he loves Hannah and she is not a \"consolation prize\", prompting Brennan to conclude that she has missed her chance, later reflecting that she should move on. In episode 10 of the sixth season \"The Body in the Bag\", Booth tells his girlfriend about the incident, stating that it (his love for Temperance) was all in the past and whatever he felt, he does not feel it anymore, except for Hannah. However it was clear in the following episode that he still has feelings for Brennan.\n\nDespite her apparent resolve to move on, Brennan later showed sorrow when her father noted that he always thought she and Booth would end up together. During a subsequent case involving a polygamist who would spend the night with his first wife on the night he was scheduled to sleep alone, Booth commented that, while you can love several people, there is only ever one person you love the most, prompting Brennan to ask what happens when you push that person away, something Booth answered saying that it never truly leaves, adding further weight to the implication that he still has feelings for Brennan. Following Hannah's departure, the two have begun to reconnect, to the point that, during a case that saw the two trapped in an elevator during a blackout for several hours, Booth and Brennan admitted that they are each interested in a relationship, but require more time to sort out their own feelings before they make such a commitment.\n\nIn episode 22 of season 6, \"The Hole in the Heart\", which saw the death of Vincent Nigel-Murray (Brennan's favorite intern) at the hands of renegade sniper Jacob Broadsky, Booth has Brennan stay at his apartment for her safety. Later that night, Brennan, still overcome with shock and grief over Vincent's death, goes into Booth's bedroom and they talk about the events of that day, and then allows Booth to hold her in bed. It is implied in the following day that they had sex. In the last scene of the season 6 finale, \"The Change in the Game\", after the birth of Angela and Hodgins' son, Brennan tells Booth that she is pregnant and that he is the father.\n\nAt the start of Season 7, a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are a couple but are going back and forth between apartments. Booth suggests that they should have their own place, whereas Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment. It causes a minor rift between them, but is resolved when Booth admits why he wants to move into a new house and Brennan having some time to think over it says it's a good idea because she'd need him practically, emotionally and sexually. In episode 6, \"The Crack in the Code,\" they decide to buy a two-story house in the suburbsâwhich they jokingly called \"The Mighty Hut\"âthat Booth found at a police auction and renovate it, (according to a mailed check sent to Brennan in \"The Heiress in the Hill\", in season 9, the \"Mighty Hut\"'s address is \"1297 Janus Street, Washington DC, 20002\"). In episode 7, \"The Prisoner in the Pipe\", Brennan goes into labor inside a prison just as she discovers who killed in an inmate there and Booth rushes her out with the intention to take her to the nearest hospital, but they both know she won't make it in time. This leads them to driving to an inn close to the prison. At first, they are rejected and are told to leave, but after some desperate pleading from an agonized Brennan, the two of them are led to a stall where she gives birth to their daughter, Christine Angela Booth (named after Temperance's mother, Christine Brennan, and Temperance's best friend Angela Montenegro). Some time after the delivery, Temperance and Seeley both go back to their home where they celebrate with their friends from the Jeffersonian, who brought dinners that would last a few nights as well as a few baby supplies. In \"The Past in the Present\", Brennan becomes the prime suspect in the murder of her schizophrenic friend, Ethan Sawyer, after supposedly threatening to kill Christine. Max advises Brennan to get off the grid and go into hiding, but she and Booth do not follow up at this suggestion. However, at the end of the episode, after Christine is christened in a Catholic church, it is revealed Brennan decided to take her father's advice and flee with her daughter until her name is cleared. Just before Brennan flees town with Christine, she tells Booth she loves him and not just because of their daughter. After she is cleared of Sawyer's murder, Brennan, Booth and Christine resume their family life.\n\nAt the end of Season 8, Brennan finally decides to marry Booth. However, their plans are ruined when a vengeful Christopher Pelant blackmails Booth, threatening to kill five random people if Booth marries Brennan. Booth calls off the wedding, but does not explain the real reason to Brennan. Brennan is devastated but pretends to be fine with this. In the season 9 premiere, Brennan fears that since Booth turned down her proposal, she fears that the love from their life is fading. After talking with bartender Aldo Clemens, a former priest and Army chaplain Booth confessed to, she realizes that it was uncharacteristic for Booth to suddenly cancel the wedding as he believed in marriage and that he likely had a legitimate reason to do so. Despite her colleagues' anger at Booth, she decides to stay with him, telling him that she understands that he has his reasons and has faith that he will resolve the issue. In the episode 4, \"The Sense in the Sacrifice\", after Booth singlehandedly tracks Pelant down through an abandoned building and kills him with a single gunshot, he reveals to her that Pelant had blackmailed him. Pelant had threatened to kill five innocent people if Booth continued with the wedding or went to the police or FBI. At the end of the episode he proposes and she happily accepts; unknown to them, Caroline, Angela and Hodgins witnessed it via the security cameras. In \"The Woman in White\", Booth and Brennan marry at a small garden ceremony outside the Jeffersonian.\n\nTheir infant son Hank Jr. (named after Booth's grandfather) was born off-screen sometime after season 10 and before the beginning of season 11.\n\nBrennan had a brief relationship with FBI Agent Tim Sullivan (Eddie McClintock), also known as Sully, whom she met while on a case when Booth was in therapy due to his grief-induced rage over his self-perceived role in the death of serial killer Howard Epps. Sully asked Dr. Brennan out on a date after their case was completed, and they began a relationship.\nTheir relationship ended, however, when Sully decided to sail a boat down to the Caribbean, and Brennan declined to leave the Jeffersonian to go with him despite Angela trying to persuade her to follow him; psychiatrist Doctor Gordon Wyatt (Stephen Fry) speculated that this was due to Brennan being unable to live a life without purpose.\nDespite Dr. Wyatt's original perception as to why she stayed, there exist strong indications, especially through Angela's observations of the situation, that the real reason she stayed was because of Booth. Sully returns in Season 12.\n"}

The sculpture is displayed on a rock by the waterside at the Langelinie promenade in Copenhagen, Denmark. It is tall and weighs .\n\nBased on the fairy tale of the same name by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, the small and unimposing statue is a Copenhagen icon and has been a major tourist attraction since its unveiling in 1913. In recent decades it has become a popular target for defacement by vandals and political activists.\n\n\"Mermaid\" is among iconic statues that symbolize cities; others include: \"Manneken Pis\" in Brussels, the Statue of Liberty in New York and \"Christ the Redeemer\" in Rio de Janeiro. In several cases, cities have commissioned statues for such a purpose, such as with Singapore's \"Merlion\".\n\nThe statue was commissioned in 1909 by Carl Jacobsen, son of the founder of Carlsberg, who had been fascinated by a ballet about the fairytale in Copenhagen's Royal Theatre and asked the ballerina, Ellen Price, to model for the statue. The sculptor Edvard Eriksen created the bronze statue, which was unveiled on August 23, 1913. The statue's head was modelled after Price, but as the ballerina did not agree to model in the nude, the sculptor's wife, Eline Eriksen, was used for the body.\n\nThe Copenhagen City Council arranged to move the statue to Shanghai at the Danish Pavilion for the duration of the Expo 2010 (May to October), the first time it had been moved officially from its perch since it was installed almost a century earlier. While the statue was away in Shanghai an authorised copy was displayed on a rock in the lake in Copenhagen's nearby Tivoli Gardens. \nCopenhagen officials have considered moving the statue several meters out into the harbour to discourage vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it, but as of May 2014 the statue remains on dry land at the water side at Langelinie.\n\nThis statue has been damaged and defaced many times since the mid-1960s for various reasons, but has been restored each time.\n\nOn April 24, 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the Situationist movement, amongst them JÃ¸rgen Nash. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and placed on the statue. On July 22, 1984, the right arm was sawn off and returned two days later by two young men. In 1990, an attempt to sever the statue's head left an deep cut in the neck.\n\nOn January 6, 1998, the statue was decapitated again; the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby television station, and reattached on February 4. On the night of September 10, 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbour's waters. Holes had been blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee.\n\nIn 2004, the statue was draped in a burqa in a protest against Turkey's application to join the European Union. In May 2007, it was again found draped in Muslim dress and a head scarf.\n\nPaint has been poured on the statue several times, including one episode in 1963 and two in March and May 2007. On March 8, 2006, a dildo was attached to the statue's hand, green paint was dumped over it, and the date \"March 8\" were written on it. It is suspected that this vandalism was connected with International Women's Day, which is on March 8. The statue was found drenched in red paint on May 30, 2017 with the message \"Danmark defend the whales of the Faroe Islands\", a reference to whaling in the Faroe Islands (an autonomous country in the Kingdom of Denmark), written on the ground in front of the statue. About two weeks later, on June 14, the statue was drenched in blue and white paint. \"Befri Abdulle\" (\"Free Abdulle\") was written in front of the statue, but it was unclear what this referred to.\n\nAside from the statue on display, which is a replica of the original, more than thirteen undamaged copies of the statue are located around the world, listed by \"Mermaids of Earth\", including Solvang, California; Kimballton, Iowa; Piatra NeamÅ£, Romania; TorrejÃ³n de Ardoz (Madrid), Spain; Seoul, South Korea; and a half-sized copy in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The grave of Danish-American entertainer Victor Borge includes a copy as well. The Copenhagen Airport also has a replica of the mermaid along with a statue of Andersen.\n\nSome statues similar to \"The Little Mermaid\" are In Sicily.\nThe first it placed in 1962 on the seafront in Giardini Naxos, and measures about four meters high over a fountain.\nA second always portraying a mermaid Post on a depth of sea about 18 meters. Inside the Marine Protected Area of Plemmiro of Siracusa.\n\nA copy of the statue forms the Danish contribution to the International Peace Gardens in Salt Lake City. The half-size replica was stolen on February 26, 2010, but was recovered on April 7 abandoned in the park.\n\nThe statue is under copyright until 2029, which is 70 years after the 1959 death of the creator; therefore several copies of the statue have provoked legal actions. , replicas of the statue can be purchased on the internet, authorized for sale by the Eriksen family.\n\nA replica was installed in Greenville, Michigan in 1994 to celebrate the town's Danish heritage, at a cost of $10,000. In 2009 the town was sued by the Artists Rights Society claiming the work violated Eriksen's copyright, and asking for a $3,800 licensing fee. At about in height, the replica in Greenville is half the size of the original, and has a different face and larger breasts as well as other distinguishing factors. The copyright claim was later reported to have been dropped.\n\nThere are similarities between \"The Little Mermaid\" statue and the \"Pania of the Reef\" statue on the beachfront at Napier in New Zealand, and some similarities in the little mermaid and Pania tales. The statue of a (titled \"Girl in a Wetsuit\" by Elek Imredy) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada was placed there when, unable to obtain permission to reproduce the Copenhagen statue, Vancouver authorities selected a modern version.\n\nSocial Democrat politician Mette Gjerskov tried to post a photo of \"The Little Mermaid\" on her Facebook page but was initially told it had \"too much bare skin or sexual undertones\", and the post was blocked; Facebook later rescinded the ban and approved the image for posting.\n\nThe sculpture is seen in the following films:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "85590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85590", "title": "Vertumnus", "text": "Vertumnus\n\nIn Roman mythology, Vertumnus (; also \"Vortumnus\" or \"Vertimnus\") is the god of seasons, change and plant growth, as well as gardens and fruit trees. He could change his form at will; using this power, according to Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" (xiv), he tricked Pomona into talking to him by disguising himself as an old woman and gaining entry to her orchard, then using a narrative warning of the dangers of rejecting a suitor (the embedded tale of Iphis and Anaxarete) to seduce her. The tale of Vertumnus and Pomona has been called the only purely Latin tale in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\".\n\nVertumnus' festival was called the Vertumnalia and was held 13 August.\n\nThe name \"Vortumnus\" most likely derives from Etruscan \"Voltumna\". Its formation in Latin was probably influenced by the Latin verb \"vertÄre\" meaning \"to change\", hence the alternative form \"Vertumnus\". Ancient etymologies were based on often superficial similarities of sound rather than the principles of modern scientific linguistics, but reflect ancient interpretations of a deity's function. In writing about the Festival of Vesta in his poem on the Roman calendar, Ovid recalls a time when the forum was still a reedy swamp and \"that god, Vertumnus, whose name fits many forms, / Wasnât yet so-called from damming back the river\" (\"averso amne\").\n\nVarro was convinced that Vortumnus was Etruscan, and a major god. Vertumnus' cult arrived in Rome around 300 BC, and a temple to him was constructed on the Aventine Hill by 264 BC, the date when Volsinii (Etruscan Velzna) fell to the Romans. Propertius, the major literary source for the god, also asserts that the god was Etruscan, and came from Volsinii.\nPropertius refers to a bronze statue of Vortumnus made by the legendary Mamurius Veturius, who was also credited with the twelve ritual shields \"(ancilia)\" of Mars' priests the Salii. The bronze statue replaced an ancient maple statue \"(xoanon)\" supposed to have been brought to Rome in the time of Romulus. The statue of Vortumnus \"(signum Vortumni)\" stood in a simple shrine located at the Vicus Tuscus near the Forum Romanum, and was decorated according to the changing seasons. In his poem about the god, Propertius has the statue of Vortumnus speak in first-person as if to a passer-by.\n\nThe base of the statue was discovered in 1549, perhaps still \"in situ\", but has since been lost. An inscription commemorated a restoration to the statue under Diocletian and Maximian in the early 4thÂ centuryÂ AD.\n\nThe subject of \"Vertumnus and Pomona\" appealed to European sculptors and painters of the 16th through the 18th centuries, providing a disguised erotic subtext in a scenario that contrasted youthful female beauty with an aged crone. In narrating the tale in the \"Metamorphoses\", Ovid had observed that the kind of kisses given by Vertumnus were never given by an old woman: \"so Circe's smile conceals a wicked intention, and Vertumnus' hot kisses ill suit an old woman's disguise\".\n\nThe subject was even woven into tapestry in series with the generic theme \"Loves of the Gods\", of which the mid-16th-century Brussels tapestry at Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, woven to cartoons attributed to Jan Vermeyen, must be among the earliest. FranÃ§ois Boucher provided designs for the tapestry-weaver Maurice Jacques at the Gobelins tapestry manufactory for a series that included \"Vertumnus and Pomona\" (1775â1778). A similar theme of erotic disguise is found with \"Jupiter wooing Callisto in the guise of Diana\", an example of which is at the J. Paul Getty Museum.\nMme de Pompadour, who sang well and danced gracefully, played the role of \"Pomone\" in a pastoral presented to a small audience at Versailles; the sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne (1760) alludes to the event. \nCamille Claudel sculpted a sensual marble version of \"Vertumnus and Pomona\" in 1905 (MusÃ©e Rodin, Paris).\n\nJoseph Brodsky wrote a poem about Vertumnus.\n\nDavid Littlefield finds in the episode a movement from rape to mutual desire, effected against an orderly, \"civilised\" Latian landscape\n\nConversely, Roxanne Gentilcore reads in its diction and narrative strategies images of deception, veiled threat and seduction, in which Pomona, the tamed hamadryad now embodying the orchard, does not have a voice.\n\n"}
{"id": "10865932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10865932", "title": "Vietnamese art", "text": "Vietnamese art\n\nVietnamese art is visual art that, whether ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in Vietnam or by Vietnamese artists.\n\nVietnamese art has a long and rich history, the earliest examples of which date back as far as the Stone Age around 8,000 BCE .\n\nWith the millennium of Chinese domination starting in the 2nd century BC, Vietnamese art undoubtedly absorbed many Chinese influences, which would continue even following independence from China in the 10th century AD. However, Vietnamese art has always retained many distinctively Vietnamese characteristics.\n\nBy the 19th century, the influence of French art took hold in Vietnam, having a large hand in the birth of modern Vietnamese art.\n\nPottery dating to the Stone Age (c. 8000 BCE) has been found in Bac Son, Vietnam. This pottery was made from clay, and in its beginnings was largely basic and lacking any artistic flare. Moving into the neolithic era, however, Vietnamese pottery and ceramics started to develop rapidly, showing signs of decor.\n\nThe highly developed ÄÃ´ng SÆ¡n culture that flourished in North Vietnam (from about 1000 BC to the 4th century BC) was the civilization responsible for the world-famous ÄÃ´ng SÆ¡n drums, a product of their advanced bronze-casting skills.\n\nThese drums give us an important peek into early Vietnamese life. They were elaborately decorated with geometric patterns, and most importantly, depicted scenes of everyday life such as farming, warriors donning feather headdresses, construction of ships, musicians, etc.\n\nArchaeological evidence from this period also shows that people in the area had long been weaving cloth. Many of the people depicted on the drums are shown as wearing elaborate clothing.\n\nDuring the ten centuries of rule by the Chinese, Vietnamese began to apply newly learned Chinese techniques to art and specifically ceramics, however this was in conjunction with the continued production of art based on native methods; this is proven by excavation of Chinese tombs in the area.\n\nVietnamese art and ceramics during this period of independence (approximately 10th to 15th centuries) flourished. The ceramics from this period were thought to have been largely influenced by both ancient native styles and the Tang and later Song Dynasty's art, including applying the \"three colors\" concept to its ceramics. Chinese-influenced philosophies adopted by the Vietnamese such as Confucianism, Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism all had a lasting impression on Vietnamese art. Some also claim there are small traces of Cham influences to be found as well.\n\nThe LÃ½ Dynasty, beginning in the 11th century is viewed specifically as the golden age of Vietnamese art, and its ceramics became famous across East and Southeast Asia. The LÃ½ Dynasty also saw the construction of many of Vietnam's landmark structures, including the Temple of Literature, One-pillar pagoda, and Quynh Lam pagoda. The Tráº§n Dynasty that immediately followed in the 13th century saw a more subdued approach to art.\n\nThe fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam was quite short-lived, lasting only about 2 decades, yet it was also seen as the harshest domination. Many if not most classical Vietnamese books were burnt, and thus much documentation of the era of independence lost. It is said that a more extreme than-ever process of sinicization was enforced, and countless Vietnamese resources and goods were removed and taken to China.\n\nConsequently, much of the art in this period and even after liberation by the LÃª Dynasty was heavily influenced by the Ming Dynasty's art.\n\nThe Nguyá»n Dynasty, the last ruling dynasty of Vietnam, saw a renewed interest in ceramics and porcelain art. Imperial courts across Asia imported Vietnamese ceramics.\n\nDespite how highly developed the performing arts (such as imperial court music and dance) became during the Nguyá»n Dynasty, some view other fields of arts as beginning to decline during the latter part of the Nguyá»n Dynasty.\n\nVietnam Modern Art includes artistic work materialized during colonial period between 1860s to 1970s, and significantly ascribed to the founding of âEcole SupÃ©rieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochineâ in October 1925. Before 1925, paintings and carvings were mainly created for religious purpose, in a decorative manner for example lacquered furniture and utilitarian ceramic and porcelains, subordinated to demands by the local temples and pagodas use.\n\nA striking âshiftâ was obvious after the founding of Ecole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine EBAI, observing a gradual change in perception of art, and the beginning recognition of art for artâs sake. Vietnamese artists experimented with new ways of seeing, with ideas from 2 important French teachers, it marks an intensifying cultural transfer and modernity. \n\nEcole des Beaux-Arts de l'Indohine EBAI was founder by Victor Tardieu, a French academic and naturalist painter. With a report commission sent to the general Government of Indochina, Victor Tardieu recommended setting up a school âEBAI in Indochinaâ to train real artists. Unlike, Ecole professionnelleâ in Hanoi, âEcole des Arts CambodgeinsâÂ  and other three schools set up in Cochinchina between 1902 â 1913 these schools were professional schools to train craftsmen. Tardieuâs idea was to adapt exiting curriculum used in âEcole des Beaux-Arts in Parisâ by including art history; technical course like oil painting and perspective, to train student into real artist. He planned to âhelp the Vietnamese artist to get back in touch with the deep meaning and fundamental inspiration of their own traditionsâ.\n\nNgay Nay (Nowadays) Phong Hoa (mores) which was associated with Tu Luc Vaan Doan (Self Reliance Literary Association), were committed to modernising Vietnamese culture through the crucial assessment of both Vietnam's tradition and Western modernity.Students in the EBAI were columnist in this 2 weekly magazines, illustrating cartoons and exhibition information. The stylized cartoon illustration were in fact very modern, depicting simple messages.\n\nFollowing closely to the curriculum of Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, oil painting was first introduced to students as a completely new medium. Although western art, in this case, oil painting, was likely first encountered by Le Van Mien (1873-1943) in LâEcole Nationale Superieure des Beaux- Arts de Paris, who returned to Hanoi in 1895, no record shows that he taught and trained craftsman in Bien Hoa or Gia Dinh this western medium. This medium was thoroughly unknown to the students, and Joseph Inguimberty though it would be hard to assimilate the oil painting techniques to them. \nArtist like To Ngoc Van was able to combine western aesthetic techniques like linear perspective, imitation of nature and modelling in the round into his own oriental traditionsÂ with oil medium. Stylized as the âpoetic realityâ style, his works sets female ideals into a linear perspective in an enclosed space, juxtapositioned with flat coloured area, his works emulates with the tendency idealization imagery.\n\nSimilarly, en plein air was another major practice instituted in EBAIâs curriculum.Â  Students were brought outdoor for field trips to develop their painting sense of the environment. As noted by art historian Nora Taylor, â[He â¦ propped his easel under a tree by rice paddy, took off his shirt and proceeded to sketch farmers planting their rice seedlings. Needless to say he earned quite a few giggles and embarrassed glances from his subjects.â Nobody took off their shirts in public, not even the farmers in the fields. The French did and so did To Ngoc Van.â This example quoted by Taylor, argues that the tendency of idealization, we see in To Nga Vanâs painting reflects a distancing and detachment with the subject matter, a result of artistâs attempt to emulate their French teachers inclusive of whatever they do.\nOther than oil medium and en plein air painting method, significant assimilation and adaption of local culture were encouraged by Victor Tardieu and his successor Joseph Imguimberty. \n\nJoseph Imguimberty was fascinated by the lacquered cultural objects and architecture fixtures after visiting the Temple of Literature in Hanoi. He encouraged his students to start using lacquer as a fine art medium, and set up workshops in EBAI with old artisans, playing an renaissance role in Lacquer painting. âfalling back on the past will be efficient only if it is used as a starting point for a new research, for an evolution in line with the contemporary eras; to summarise, the question is to evolve as contemporaries within an extensive of tradition.â\"Victor Tardieu\"\nMaking lacquer painting takes several months, using resin from Son tree taken from the plantation from Son Mai region, numerous layers of application are applied to acquire the desired colour and effects.Â  Most notable artist who excelled in this medium is Nguyen Gia Tri. Although artists like Tran Quang Tran, Le Pho, Phan Hau, Nguyen Khang and Nguyen Van Que attempted lacquer painting, Nguyen Gia Tri's achievement in lacquer painting is remarkable for his research on pigments and exploration of new lacquer colours. Nguyen Gia Tri's aim â was to obtain the same level of painting as with the oil medium regarding perspective, modelling in the round, and infinite variation of coloursâ. \n\nOther artists like Nguyen Phanh Chanh, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Tan Van Can, Le Van De, Â who were the first batch of students to be admitted in EBAI, are most notable for their silk painting.\n\nLike lacquer painting, silk painting was much encouraged for exploration in the school. Different from similar practice of silk painting in China and Japan, an intensifying of cultural transfer was observed in Vietnamese silk painting, artist like Nguyen Phan Chan blended western composition principle with eastern tradition like calligraphy and brush paintings.\nIn 1931, Paris International Colonial Exhibition, Nguyen Phan Chanâs work titled \"Children Playing a Game of Squares\" was well-received and this recognition firmly established the medium as a modern Vietnamese expression.\n\nBetween 1930 â 1936, Nguyen Phan Chan, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu and Nguyen Gia Tri, graduated from EBAI. Victor Tardieu passed away in 1937 and he was took after by Evariste Jonchere. To Ngoc Van begin teaching in EBAI in 1937. Artists like Bui Xuan Phai and Nguyen Tu Nghiem who entered EBAI in 1941 was unable to complete the full five-year programme due to the 1945 revolution.\n\nA bombing of Hanoi that was intended for Japanese target destroyed part of the EBAI painting department in 1943, resulting the sculpture department to be moved to Son Tay; Architecture and sculpture department to Dalat while applied arts went to Phu Ly.\n\nResistance war uproar marks the official close down of EBAI in 1945. Democratic Republic of Vietnam reopened a fine arts school in Hanoi for a short period of time in September 1945 ruled by To Ngoc Van. However, artist were sympathetic of the Viet Minh and decided to leave Hanoi to join the resistance movement against French in the Hills of Tay Bac. \n\nNotable group of artists in the North during the Cold War were TÃ´ Ngá»c VÃ¢n, Tráº§n VÄn Cáº©n, Huá»³nh PhÆ°Æ¡ng Äong, Pháº¡m Thanh TÃ¢m, Minh Tuyen, Hoang Trung. Another small number of artists from well-to-do backgrounds had the opportunity to go to France and make their careers there for the most part. Examples include Le Thi Luu, Le Pho, Mai Trung Thu, Le Van De, Le Ba Dang and Pham Tang.\n\nWhen Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnamâs independence in 2 September 1945,Â  Vietnamese artist begin to resist the influence of romantic realism, tendency for nostalgia past and melancholic dreams. Artist like To Ngoc Van shook off his romantic style and turned towards modern realism, he moved the closed EBAI (after the Japanese coup de force in March 1945) to Viet Bac in 1950, the military base of the Revolutionary Army under Ho Chi Minh.â[He]â¦ decided that art, as the French saw it, died in 1945 when Viet Nam declared its independence and was reborn in 1946 when the Viet Minh moved the art school to the hills of Viet Bac, the seat of the revolutionary movement. In 1946, He declared proudly âtradition starts now.ââÂ \n\nTo Ngoc Van begin teaching resistance art classes in the Northern zone during the war with the French. This includes setting up the \"School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone\", and combating against decadent art being scientific, national and popular, art have to abandon religion, mythical and idealists theme, focusing solely on the inspiration and needs of the revolution and being appealing and educational to a majority of people. Hence artists like Nguyen Hiem, Nguyen Sang, Phan Van Don and Tran Van Can created works that depicted the countrysides, portraits of peasants, soldiers battles scenes, they uphold the belief that artist should show the reality of society instead of idealised imageries.\nTo Ngoc Van died in 1954 as the result of injuries received at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, School of Fine Arts in the Resistance Zone was later moved to Hanoi in 1955 and named as the âVietnam College of Fine Artsâ with Tran Van Can as the principal.\nFirst National Art Exhibition in the Democratic Republic of Vietna in 1955, after the victory at Dien Bein Phu where Meeting (Gap Nhau) by Mai Van Hien was praised as the ideal painting that illustrates the idea of community and solidarity between the soldiers and the common people. \"The mood of the painting is reflected in the artistâs simple descriptive style, which lends itself well to its content.\"\n\nIn a Painting Exhibition that in happened December 10, 1951, Ho Chi Minh sent a message to the artists that \"you, in the artistic field, have your own responsibilities - to serve the resistance, the Fatherland and the people, first and foremost the workers, peasants and soldiers,\"However, various debates erupted in Hanoi on the role of artists in Society in 1956, during the first meeting of the writers and artist associations, members demanded for greater freedom of expression which went against what Ho Chi Minh had earlier laid down. Two art and literature journals Nhan Van (humanism) and Gia Pham (Art Works) that supported the argument were subsequently banned. \n\nFollowing year, Vietnam Association of Fine Arts in Hanoi or National Arts Association was established with 108 member headed by Thai Ba Van. These members were required to be members of the association if they wished their works to be exhibited or sold. There were no private galleries where artists can displayed their work formally. Eventually, this association was governed with official rules and regulations, members are obligated to hold one exhibition at local level annually and another at national level every 5 years. Non members were not considered artist, hence they have no opportunity to display any form of art publicly.\n\nBetween 1950 to 70s, members were paid as âart workersâ for the poster designs and illustrations, among few were elites who painted paintings for state visitors. \n\nRealist style, which corresponded with Northern artists initial aspirations, was vital in the early days of revolution, however, due to the strict constraints by the DVR regime and decreasing subsidies, realist trend reached an apex in the 60s. Strict guidelines were attempted to established in 1962, on the productions of artists artworks, they need to portray a \"National Character\", subject matters were usually the countryside, battle scene, portrait of Uncle Ho.\n\nAnti-colonial and resistance war culminated the appropriation of ânationalâ art. It was a period to essentially erase the impact and influence of the French. Works painted by Nam Son, Tran Van Can, Nguyen Sang, Tran Dong Luon were in fact in the medium Lacquer, silk and oil medium. The 3 media, encouraged and culturally transferred by the French during colonial period were renamed as ânationalâ.\nIn Tran Van Canâs Portrait painting â\"Militia women of a costal region\"â, the artist depicted a robust figure and confronting gaze, she is a comrade ready to face the enemy. It is a politically correct painting, filled with characteristic that fulfills the national painting.\n\nAnother theme commonly captured by artist was the landscape around Viet Bac. In the Diep Minh Chauâs âUncle Hoâs House in Viet Bacâ show clear proficiency with the medium oil painting, the impressionist strokes of capturing the light through filtering leaves. \n\nIn Duong Huong Minhâs âHauling Up Canonsâ a work on lacquer captures dramatic scene of soldiers hauling heavy weapons up a steep slope. The bravery of the men eventually brought the Viet Minh their victory against the French in Bien Dien Phu.\n\nSimilarly, in watercolour painting painted by Pham Thanh Tam during resistance war âshows a clear French influence. His professors in the resistance zone were trained from the EBAIâ the drawings and diary clearly contents âlyrical and poetic qualityâ it was regarded as ideal paintings. \n\nHence, art curator Joyce Fan argues that âthe realist techniques thus imparted by the French continue to manifest in the paintings with the sense of detachment and distancing, unlike the social realist use of emotive values to heighten the pathos in the imagery.â Likewise, the undeniable fact that, the intense cultural transfer during colonial period continues to influence local artist after the exit of the French. \n\nPropaganda poster painted during the period of âoperation rolling thunderâ in 1965 reflects a clear anti-colonial and anti-imperial messages. Likely inspired by the Soviet and Communist Chinese, they carried a political intention. Following strictly to the culture of new Vietnam in Ho Chi Minhâs concept, was to \"stimulate intellectual and artistic creativity for art and cultural development\".\n\nâCulture is seen as a powerful motor of development, and cultural identity as a constant in the harmonious development of society and the individual.â \n\n\"images such as those presented in the propaganda posters and paintings of the time were key indicators of how the population was to perceive the environment, the government, and the future. the posters and paintings were sometimes the only voices the people heard, the only clues they had to knowing and how to respond.\"\n\nVietnam was divided at the 17 parallel after the Geneva Conference in 1954 separating themselves into the Soviet and Chinese supported North against the Southern Republic reinforced by the United Stated of America. This divided Vietnam forced some artists to fled to Saigon and continue their practices in the republic of Vietnam, most notable artist is Ta Ty, who \" considerably bolstered the Southâs artistic development in the following years and profoundly contributed to the foundation of the Young Artists Association in 1966, though he chose to remain anonymous in its list of founding members due to privacy reasons.\" \n\nNguyen Gia Tri decided to move to Gia Dinh and eventually became the director for âEcole des beaux-art in Gia Dinh\" founded in 1954. Evident in their works, due to accessibility of information, their artworks were styled as western influenced, more eclectic, experimental, subjective and individualism. They enjoyed more freedom in the subject matters and exhibited freely until 1975.\n\nIn 1962, the first international Exhibition of Fine Arts of Saigon was held with 21 countries participating it. Southern artist encountered abstract painting for the first time. Following up, a second exhibition was planned for 1966, but unfortunately cancelled due to the increase intensity of the war. In 1966, Saigon Society of Young Artist (Hoi Hoa Si Tre Saigon) was founded campaigning to develop modern art, members include Nguyen Trung and Trinh Cung.\n\nBetween 1960s - 70s artists in Saigon experimented abstraction and other contemporary expressions. As noted by Vietnamese art historian Hyunh-Beattie, Southern artists did not readily accepted and took in American culture, which they deem as inferior to the French. Although Americans were heavily involved in Saigon, Beattie argues that little had influenced on the art scene in republic.\n\nAfter the reunification of Vietnam, southern artists were sent for re-education in 1975. \n\n1976, Hanoi government merged Ho Chi Minh city and Gia Dinh National School for decorative Arts and the Saigon College of Fine Arts into Ho Chi Minh City Fine Arts College, and established Ho Chi Minh City branch of The Vietnam Association of Fine Arts.\n\nArtists benefited greater freedom of expression after the launch of Doi Moi Campaign. The establishment of open market allowed artist a greater outlet of creative expressions. \n\nHowever, Nguyen Quan who was elected into the executive committee of Vietnam Association of Fine Arts and holding position as the chief editor of the Association's Magazine My Thuat (Fine Arts) was removed from his position after organizing a workshop with 30 artist in Dai Lai, North of Hanoi in 1986. The workshop was not acceptable by authority for \"the retreat not only promoted individual expression and art for art's sake, it also went against what the state had instituted over the past three decades in that it allowed for artists to explore their individuality rather than represent that collective sentiments of their community.\"\n\nNowadays, besides working with traditional material like oil, acrylic, lacquer on wood, the younger generation of Vietnamese artists have become very active in involving different forms of arts, such as installation, performance and video art with many of them attaining international recognition for their artworks and exhibitions worldwide. For example, Nha San Collective (formerly Nha San Studio) - established in 1998, was the first artist-led, non-profit initiative to be run in Vietnam. Nha San studio nurtured the first generation of Vietnamese avant-garde artists emergent in the early 1990s\nRMIT University Vietnam art collection is one of the most prestigious collections of contemporary Vietnamese art in the world. This collection is not only historically important, but one that will continue to grow the understanding of Vietnamese culture for generations to come. The Vietnamese artists in the collection range from established and mid-career artists, whose works feature in significant exhibitions and notable private collections and public institutions worldwide, to young emerging artists who continue to tackle issues with fresh and new interpretations.\nRMIT University is at the forefront of creative education and this collection allows both students and the wider community to experience the artistic expression of an important generation of contemporary Vietnamese artists. The art collection is managed by the RMIT Library Vietnam.\n\nIt is believed that in prehistoric times, Vietnamese people lived in stilt-houses, as depicted on the bronze Dong Son drums. Similar kinds of houses can still be found in Vietnam today.\n\nWhen Chinese influence permeated Vietnam, Chinese architecture had a large influence on the basic structure of many types of Vietnamese buildings, mostly pagodas and temples, communal houses, houses of scholar-bureaucrats, aristocracy, and imperial palaces and quarters. Nevertheless, these structures combined both Chinese influences and native style.\nWith French colonization of Vietnam in the 19th century, many French-styled buildings were constructed, including villas, government buildings, opera houses, etc. Many of these buildings still stand in Vietnam and are one of the clearest remnants of the French colonial legacy.\n\nSome of Vietnam's most notable architectural structures include:\n\n\nThe citadel formerly sprawled a vast estate, but during subsequent wars and conflicts, much of it has been destroyed and later turned into rice paddies. The remaining areas are currently being restored by UNESCO.\n\n\nThe beauty of the Perfume Pagoda and surrounding area have served as the subject in many Vietnamese poems.\n\nCalligraphy has had a long history in Vietnam, previously using Chinese characters along with chá»¯ nÃ´m. However, most modern Vietnamese calligraphy instead uses the Roman-character based quá»c ngá»¯, which has proven to be very popular.\n\nIn the past, with literacy in the old character-based writing systems of Vietnam being restricted to scholars and elites, calligraphy nevertheless still played an important part in Vietnamese life. On special occasions such as the Lunar New Year, people would go to the village teacher or scholar to make them a calligraphy hanging (often poetry, folk sayings or even single words). People who could not read or write also often commissioned scholars to write prayers which they would burn at temple shrines.\n\nVietnamese silk painting is one of the most popular forms of art in Vietnam, favored for the mystical atmosphere that can be achieved with the medium. During the 19th and 20th centuries, French influence was absorbed into Vietnamese art and the liberal and modern use of color especially began to differentiate Vietnamese silk paintings from their Chinese, Japanese and Korean counterparts. Vietnamese silk paintings typically showcase the countryside, landscapes, pagodas, historical events or scenes of daily life.\n\nA folk art with a long history in Vietnam, Vietnamese woodblock prints have reached a level of popularity outside of Vietnam. Organic materials are used to make the paint, which is used on wood and pressed on paper. The process is repeated with different colors.\n\nPhotographic technology was introduced to Vietnam in the mid 19th century by French and Chinese commercial photographers. Since its introduction a diverse range of photography practices have emerged such as fine art photography, documentary photography, and landscape photography. The development of such practices have been accelerated following Äá»i Má»i, that has resulted in a diversification of funding for artists and increased international exposure.\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music is extremely diverse, consisting of many different styles varying from region to region. Some of the most widely known genres include:\n\n\nGenres include:\n\nVietnam has 54 different ethnics, each with their own traditional dance. Among the ethnic Vietnamese majority, there are several traditional dances performed widely at festivals and other special occasions, such as the lion dance.\n\nIn the imperial court there also developed throughout the centuries a series of complex court dances which require great skill. Some of the more widely known are the imperial lantern dance, fan dance, and platter dance, among others.\n\nWater puppetry is a distinct Vietnamese art which had its origins in the 12th century. In water puppetry, a split-bamboo screen obscures puppets which stand in water and are manipulated using long poles hidden beneath the water. Epic storylines are played out with many different characters, often depicting traditional scenes of Vietnamese life. Despite nearly dying out in the 20th century, it has been saved by efforts of preservation and is now largely seen by tourists to Vietnam.\n\nVietnamese literature is literature, both oral and written, created largely by Vietnamese-speaking people, although Francophone Vietnamese and English-speaking Vietnamese authors in Australia and the United States are counted by many critics as part of the national tradition. For much of its history, Vietnam was dominated by China and as a result much of the written work during this period was in Classical Chinese. Chá»¯ nÃ´m, created around the 10th century, allowed writers to compose in Vietnamese using modified Chinese characters. Although regarded as inferior to Chinese, it gradually grew in prestige. It flourished in the 18th century when many notable Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in \"chá»¯ nÃ´m\" and when it briefly became the official written script. While the quá»c ngá»¯ script was created in the 17th century, it did not become popular outside of missionary groups until the early 20th century, when the French colonial administration mandated its use in French Indochina. By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in \"quá»c ngá»¯\".\n\nSome defining works of literature include \"The Tale of Kieu\" by Nguyá»n Du, and \"Lá»¥c VÃ¢n TiÃªn\" by Nguyá»n ÄÃ¬nh Chiá»u.\n\nPoet Há» XuÃ¢n HÆ°Æ¡ng (born during the end of the 18th century) composed much of her poetry in Chá»¯ NÃ´m, and most of it has been translated into quá»c ngá»¯ for modern Vietnamese. Her poetry continues to be widely popular. Other poets such as the famous Mandarin official Duong Khue had some of his poetry adapted into songs that are still famous today, such as the Ca trÃ¹-genre song \"Há»ng há»ng, tuyáº¿t tuyáº¿t\".\n\nMany Vietnamese poems, along with folk \"literature\" in general, tends to be much more of an oral tradition - as literacy (as it is defined today) in the past was restricted mostly to scholars and the elite.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28459264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28459264", "title": "Vision Forum (art organisation)", "text": "Vision Forum (art organisation)\n\nVision Forum is an organisation that carries out research in contemporary art and organises events that transgresses the boundaries between performance, exhibition, workshops and education. It grew from a series of events organised by Curatorial Mutiny in collaboration with KSM at Campus NorrkÃ¶ping, LinkÃ¶pings Universitet in Sweden 2005-2007. Vision Forum took its present form in 2008. It does not have a physical location or a program, but responds to the needs of the group of artists, curators and researchers that are part of the network at any given moment. Its members are mostly based in Europe and have carried out projects all over the continent, in North America, Australia and Asia. In 2009, neuroscientist Stephen Whitmarsh joined the group, showing that the organisation can host members outside of the artistic community. A strategy that has been developed further in subsequent years.\n\nIn 2008-09, Vision Forum organised two major projects. (Anti)Realism brought together young contemporary visual artists based in Sweden, China, Great Britain, the Netherlands and France. The first part of the project was a practical workshop that took place in Guangzhou, China, in September 2008. The European participants developed collaborative projects with their Chinese peers that focused on time-based art.\n\nâThe title and the conceptual framework of the workshop (Anti)Realism was created to look into the differences and similarities of how we look at reality (both as individuals and as members of different cultures) and how that can be used to further our understanding and appreciation of life. The project allowed the participants to both understand differences between European cultures, as well as how these differ from Chinese contemporary art and life.â\n\nThe results of the workshop were presented to the public at Guangzhou Academy of Fine Art and a second were later developed into an exhibition which was shown at Verkstad in Sweden, Ãcole RÃ©gional de Beaux Arts de BesaÃ§on in France and at Adele C in Italy. Parallel to (Anti)Realism Vision Forum created four workshops in Rome, ZÃ¼rich, Amsterdam, and Stockholm. These involved a completely different group of artists and curators from (Anti)Realism and focused on architecture, artistic production, curation and presentation respectively.\n\nIn 2009-10, Vision Forum focused on four major projects or ânodesâ. They were each made up of a number of artists and curators who, like the Vision Forum workshops in 2008-09 met regularly. The nodes were held together by all doing research on time and temporality in different ways. âIf you donât want God, youâd better have a multiverseâ was curated and developed by in Rome. The project was focused on workshops in Rome, Skopje and Paris. At the last meeting, the participants reformulated themselves into âOuUnPoâ (Workshop for Alternative Universes), inspired by French literary group Oulipo. The participants organised a public event at MACRO in Rome and at Tate Britain in London in spring 2010 under the new name. Ouunpo has since then carried out events in Porto, Athens, Belgrade, Amsterdam-Nijmegen, Stockholm-NorrkÃ¶ping in collaboration with art and science institutions like Deste Foundation and Max Planck Institute. Australian artist duo A Constructed World started âSpeech and What Archive?â which continued its activities in 2010-13. The node focused on alternative forms of communication and organised events in Paris, Nice, San Francisco and Melbourne working with art institutions like Villa Arson and CCA. Curator Claire Louise Staunton carried out research which later lead to the creation of the temporary gallery âInheritance Shenzhenâ in the Chinese region of Guangdong. This project was developed in Milton Keynes in 2011 with a large exhibition, seminar and publication. They then travelled to Chandigar and as an outcome of this research the node presented an exhibition about British architect Jane Drew and the artistic work that flourished around her at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London in 2014.\n\nThe fourth major project realized in 2009-10 was The Invisible Generation. It was conceived by artist Per HÃ¼ttner and Curator Daniele Balit and created new meeting places between art and its audiences. A great number of projects were realized in Melbourne, Shenzhen, Beijing and Kiev in 2009-2010. For each city the program and artist list was totally new. No, project was ever repeated twice. The project always allowed the audience to meet art in new and unexpected situations and played with or confused the audiencesâ expectations about what art is, where it normally appears and what shape it should take. In the introduction to the project in the catalogue Gerrie van Noord writes:\n\nSince September 2011 Vision Forum organizes two international workshops a year in ÃstergÃ¶tland in Sweden. These bring together members of the different international nodes (in 2012 Vision Forum ran 10 nodes) and interact with local institutions and art organizations. This means that the research carried out in the individual nodes have started cross referencing and exchanging methodology between each other. Vision Forum, through its structure, develops modes of communication and knowledge production that make use of current technology. The nodes of the network also allow a deeper dialogue with their audiences that, in their turn, are inscribed into in numerous interconnected networks. It has become increasingly clear that the network focuses on research about how art uses, retains, distributes and develops knowledge along with how this can be fed back into the everyday lives of art's audience. This ties in with Vision Forum's founder Per HÃ¼ttner's work that can be exemplified by projects like I am a Curatorâ, Democracy and Desire and (In)Visible Dialogues and have allowed them to participate in collective work in the Caribbean and in biennials in Brazil. The methodology builds on Deleuzian ideas about knowledge and creativity and has been developed in Vision Forumâs nodes and networks, particularly in OuUnPo. This idea of exchange is based on co-producing knowledge with the collaborating institutions and audiences, rather than a top down knowledge distribution. The strategy that they call \"collapsing the global with the local\" is currently being developed by the network in collaboration with Global Art and the Museum at ZKM in Karlsruhe.\n\nIn 2011 Vision Forum started publishing books and catalogues regularly to document its activities. The organisation also started to produce experimental films in a separate node called Vision Forum Film. Two films were in Production in 2012: \"Effektivia\" directed by Jesper Frilund and Marcus Fernstad and \"The River\" by Sino-Swedish director Ting Ting Yang (æ¨å©·å©·). In June 2013 Vision Forum opened an international residency program called \"NorrkÃ¶ping Air.\" The program was initiated in collaboration with KSM at LinkÃ¶pings universitet, IASPIS and offers three artists the opportunity to work in parallel Sweden for 3 months during the Swedish summer months. The project focuses on experimental art in public spaces, drawing inspiration from the Invisible Generation and similar projects and was developed in close dialogue with the centenary of NorrkÃ¶ping Art Museum.\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014 \n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\n2005\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28557692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28557692", "title": "Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman", "text": "Wise Old Man and Wise Old Woman\n\nIn Carl Jung's theory of analytical psychology, the Wise Old Woman and the Wise Old Man are archetypes of the Collective Unconscious. 'The \"wise old woman\"...[or] helpful \"old woman\" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'. The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity' is her male counterpart.\n\nIn Jung's thought, the individuation process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'. Thus, starting with the intermediate position of 'anima or animus...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the shadow, so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior' still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed \"Mana\" personalities or \"supraordinate\" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the \"mother\" (\"Primordial Mother\" and \"Earth Mother\") as a supraordinary personality...as the \"self\"'.\n\nAs von Franz put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure â a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian \"guru\"), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.\n\nThe masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'. Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by Hecate or the Crone ...the Great Mother' stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent â as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'. Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore \"for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality\"'.\n\nIn Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'. Thus 'the \"good Wise Man\" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure', and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the \"terrible mother\"'. Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'. \n\nBut judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' â so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the \"supraordinate personality\", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'. Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a \"coniunctio oppositorum\", a union of opposites. 'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'. Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.\n\nComing to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious â with the parental imagos â thus meant overcoming a psychic splitting, so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.\n\n"}
