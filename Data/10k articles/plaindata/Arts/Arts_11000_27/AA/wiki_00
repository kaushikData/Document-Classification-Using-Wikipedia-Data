{"id": "2404374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2404374", "title": "Academy of Music (Philadelphia)", "text": "Academy of Music (Philadelphia)\n\nThe Academy of Music, also known as American Academy of Music, is a concert hall and opera house located at 240 S. Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its location is between Locust and Manning Streets in the Avenue of the Arts area of Center City.\n\nThe hall was built in 1855–57 and is the oldest opera house in the United States that is still used for its original purpose. Known as the \"Grand Old Lady of Locust Street,\" the venue is the home of the Pennsylvania Ballet and Opera Philadelphia. It was also home to the Philadelphia Orchestra from its inception in 1900 until 2001, when the orchestra moved to the new Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts. The Philadelphia Orchestra still retains ownership of the Academy.\n\nThe hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962.\n\nThe Academy of Music held an inaugural ball on January 26, 1857. At the time \"The New York Times\" described the theater as \"magnificently gorgeous, brilliantly lighted, solidly constructed, finely located, beautifully ornamented\" but went on to lament \"all that lacks is a few singers to render it 'the thing'.\" The theatre had its first opera production, and what was billed as its formal opening, a month later on February 25, 1857, with a performance by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company of Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" starring Marietta Gazzaniga as Leonora, Alessandro Amodio as Count di Luna, Zoë Aldini as Azucena, Pasquale Brignoli as Manrico, and Max Maretzek conducting. Maretzek, who was already presenting operas at the Academy of Music in New York City and at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia since 1850, brought his company back annually to the Academy of Music in Philadelphia through 1873. Due to his association with both the Philadelphia and New York City Academy of Music venues, his company was sometimes referred to as the Academy of Music Opera Company.\n\nThe Academy has been in continuous use since 1857, hosting many world-famous performers, conductors and composers, and a significant number of American premieres of works in the standard operatic and classical repertoire. Noted operas that had their American premieres there include Strauss's \"Ariadne auf Naxos\", Gounod's \"Faust\", and Wagner's \"The Flying Dutchman\". In 1916, Leopold Stokowski conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the American premiere of Mahler's Eighth Symphony (the \"Symphony of a Thousand\").\n\nThe list of artists who have performed at the Academy of Music, from the 20th century, includes such figures as Marian Anderson, Maria Callas, Enrico Caruso, Aaron Copland, Vladimir Horowitz, Gustav Mahler, Anna Pavlova, Edith Piaf, Luciano Pavarotti, Tony Bennett (in 1962), Itzhak Perlman, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Joan Sutherland, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, among many others. After the Philadelphia Orchestra moved to the Kimmel Center, the 21st century brought more non-classical artists to the Academy, among them Noel Gallagher who appeared there in 2011.\n\nOutside of arts events, it hosted various public meetings including the 1872 Republican National Convention. Possibly America's first indoor football game took place here in 1889 between the University of Pennsylvania and a club from Princeton resulting in a 0-0 tie. In addition, parts of Martin Scorsese's 1993 film \"The Age of Innocence\" were filmed in the Academy. Despite its name, the Academy has never contained a music school. Various voice and instrumental competitions have taken place there, including the Pavarotti competition.\n\nAn architectural competition for the Academy's design was announced in October 1854 and was won by the Philadelphia firm of Napoleon LeBrun and Gustavus Runge. A style of architecture that originated in Runge's native Germany now known as Rundbogenstil (\"round arch style\") was used for the exterior here and in a number of American buildings of the Civil War Era. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 18, 1855, with President Franklin Pierce in attendance and the venue opened with a grand ball on January 26, 1857. The first opera performed there was the Western Hemisphere premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Il Trovatore\", on February 25 of the same year.\n\nIn order to reserve as much of the budget for the interior as possible, the architects designed a relatively plain brick and brownstone exterior that could be clad in marble if funds became available later. The ornate auditorium has an \"open horseshoe\" shape and proscenium columns with elliptical cross-sections in order to provide more direct sight lines from the seats in the side balconies. The auditorium is enclosed by a solid three-foot brick wall with studding and pine boards lining the inner sides to prevent echoes and absorb sound. The upper balconies are recessed in a tiered fashion and supported by 14 Corinthian columns. An unusual feature was that the boxes were originally placed against the rear wall on the second and third levels (Balcony and Family Circle). They were divided from each other by walls that curved down from the ceilings. These have since been removed and boxes created elsewhere. The front of the first balcony is highly ornamented. The hall currently has a seating capacity of 2,389 which can be expanded to 2,509 when seats are placed in the orchestra pit and proscenium boxes. An 1860 account by Runge mentioned that the full auditorium, then nearly 3,000 persons, could be emptied in four minutes in \"great calmness and order\" owing to the wide corridors and stairways.\n\nThe auditorium is graced by a large crystal chandelier, which measures in diameter, and weighs . When installed, the chandelier contained 240 gas jets, which were converted to electricity in 1900, and rewired in 1957. That same year, it was fitted with an electric-powered winch. It previously required 12 people working four-hours to lower it by hand. The fixture was restored to its original form and missing crystals replaced in 2008. The heat produced by the original gas fixtures helped to ventilate the hall by causing air to rise to various vents along the back walls and in the center of the ceiling.\n\nAtop the proscenium is a bas-relief bust of Mozart. Seated on the cornice above are the figures of Poetry, on the left, and Music, on the right. The elaborate carvings and gilded wood sculpture decorations throughout the auditorium are the work of Charles Bushor and Joseph A. Bailly and the ceiling murals of allegorical figures were completed by Karl Hermann Schmolze.\n\nThe original stage curtain was of crimson fabric with heavy golden fringe, ropes, tassels, etc. by J. R. Martin of Berlin. A secondary curtain had a scene of Lake Como, Italy, painted by Russell Smith of Philadelphia.\n\nThe original seating on the Parquet and first balcony had arms and upholstery with springs and a covering of dark red plush fabric. The second balcony had \"sofas without arms\" and the third, pew-like seating. These were mostly replaced with more typical theater seating. The installation of more spacious seating began in 2018.\n\nA 2007 donation of $5.3 million by Leonore Annenberg was designated for restoration of the Academy's ballroom. This was part of the almost $12 million (USD) in donations raised at the 150th anniversary concert for the Academy of Music.\n\nFor many decades, Philadelphia regarded the Academy as having excellent acoustics that were wrongly attributed to a circular brick chamber under the floor of the auditorium. It was intended by the architects that sound penetrating the \"elastic floor\" would reverberate in this chamber and emerge into the auditorium. Unfortunately, this device was ineffective as little sound could pass through the floor in either direction. The ceiling of the auditorium was deliberately designed not to be a sound reflector for fear of echoes.\n\nSome have found the Academy's sound problematic for orchestra:\n\n\"The Academy of Music in Philadelphia is a beautiful, historic, charming building with wholly unsuitable acoustics for orchestra...The dry, unreverberant acoustics results from the roughly 2,900 audience members, who completely surround the volume of the auditorium, soaking up sound as they sit.\"\n\nThe Academy was built as an opera house which typically has a lower reverberation than a concert hall, the venue's primary use for many years. The reverberation time has been measured at 1.4 seconds compared to 1.2 at La Scala, Milan, and 1.75 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Consequently, the \"Philadelphia Sound\" of the Philadelphia Orchestra was, at least in part, the result of long-term efforts by Stokowski, later sustained by Eugene Ormandy, to compensate for this weakness. After some remodeling in the mid-1950s, Ormandy refused to make recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the Academy. Riccardo Muti, Ormandy's successor, also made his commercial recordings with the orchestra elsewhere.\n\nVarious conductors have commented on the quality of the orchestral sound in the hall, as collected by Leo L. Beranek in his book \"Music, Acoustics & Architecture\":\n\nExtensive renovations beginning in 1994 have maintained the building's architecture and made acoustic improvements. Although many programs at the hall are amplified and the Academy is no longer home to the Philadelphia Orchestra, the opera, ballet and other classical concerts still rely on the hall's native acoustics.\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

Executed in 1443-1445, it was originally placed in the Cathédrale Saint-Sauveur, Aix-en-Provence, southern France. Now it is divided between the Église de la Madeleine in the same city (central panel with the \"Annunciation\"), the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (part of the left panel with the prophet Isaiah) at Rotterdam, the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam (upper part of the left panel), while the right panel is in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. Side panels are painted on both sides, showing Christ on the right and Mary Magdalene on the left (the upper part, on reverse of the Amsterdam panel, does not survive); together they used to form a \"Noli me tangere\" scene when the triptych was folded shut.\n\nThe work was commissioned by Pierre Corpici, a cloth-merchant who knew Barthélemy's stepfather, and combines influences from the Early Netherlandish art of Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck with those of Claus Sluter who worked at Dijon, and Colantonio from Naples (although some see this last influence as flowing in the other direction). Many of the iconographic details follow those from Annunciations by Jan van Eyck and his circle, such as the Washington \"Annunciation\". Together with a fine portrait dated 1456 (Lichtenstein Collection, Vienna), and a fragment with a small crucified Christ in the Louvre, this is the only surviving panel painting associated with Barthélemy d'Eyck; most of his later works are illuminated manuscripts commissioned by René of Anjou.\n\nThe central panel depicts the Annunciation inside a Gothic church, the angel appearing under a vault. \nAbove him, from a holed rose window, God and two angels are coming in, while the Madonna is kneeling at the right, with two perspectically painted naves in the background.\n\nWhen used as an altarpiece, side panels of the triptych would be kept closed most of the time, displaying a \"Noli me tangere\" scene with kneeling Mary Magdalene on the left and Christ walking away from her on the right. The two panels do not form a continuous scene, however; Mary Magdalene is placed among lush green hills, while Christ is surrounded by a more desolate, desert-like landscape. Both Brussels and Rotterdam panels are painted on both sides, the reverse of the Amsterdam fragment does not survive.\n\nThe characters' sizes, like in other contemporary Flemish paintings, are not realistic if compared with the background, but are larger. The wide clothes show the inspiration by the Burgundian school. The light is of clearly Flemish derivation (Robert Campin), such as (although with some Provençal elements) the minute details, including the winged devil and the bat in the left arch.\n\n\n"}

Author Neal Gabler focuses on the psychological motivations of these film moguls, arguing that their background as Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe shaped their careers and influenced the movies they made.\n\nGabler's main thesis is that these producers (whom Gabler terms \"Hollywood Jews\") generally came from poor, fatherless backgrounds, and felt like outsiders in America because of their Jewishness. In Hollywood, these producers were able to run their own industry, assimilate into the American mainstream, and produce movies that fulfilled their vision of the American Dream. Gabler asserts that the nature of their business and their movies can often be traced back to their feelings of alienation as immigrants.\n\nThe book also explains that the business background of the Hollywood Jews in theatre-ownership, retail distribution, and the garment industry shaped the approach these studio owners took to crafting movies for a popular audience, one similar to the marketing of films as commodities as well as works of art.\n\nThe title of the book is a reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel \"The Last Tycoon\", in which Fitzgerald describes his protagonist, Monroe Stahr (a character inspired by the producer Irving Thalberg) as \"coming home to an empire of his own—an empire he has made.\" The book won the 1989 \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Prize for history and the 1989 Theatre Library Association Award.\n\nThe book was adapted into a documentary film in 1998, a decade after the book was published. The movie has two titles: \"Hollywoodism: Jews, Movies and the American Dream\" (original title for A&E) and \"Hollywood: An Empire of Their Own\" (title for video/DVD). The documentary won an award for Best Jewish Experience Documentary at the 1998 Jerusalem Film Festival.\n\n\n"}

Three of the cardinal virtues are personified as statuesque women seated in a bucolic landscape and the theological virtues are depicted by putti. The fresco was a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the private apartments of Pope Julius II. These rooms are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello. After completing his three monumental frescoes \"Disputation of the Holy Sacrament\", \"The Parnassus\", and \"The School of Athens\" in the Stanza della Segnatura, Raphael painted the \"Cardinal and Theological Virtues\" in 1511.\n\nThe walls containing frescoes in the \"Stanza della Segnatura\" depict four branches of human knowledge: Philosophy (\"School of Athens\"), Religion (\"Disputation\"), Poetry (\"Parnassus\"), and Law (\"Virtues\"). The fourth wall containing the \"Virtues\" addresses both the civil law of the secular state and the canon law of the Church. Accordingly, three classical cardinal virtues (Fortitude, Prudence and Temperance) are attended by five putti, three of whom depict the theological virtues of Charity, Hope, and Faith.\n\nOn the left, Raphael painted Fortitude. Armor-clad, she caresses a lion with her left hand while grasping a sapling of black oak with her right. The oak tree symbolizes strength and alludes to the Della Rovere family to which Pope Julius II belonged. A putto representing Charity harvests acorns from the oak branch. Fortitude's seated posture and the folds of her clothing are copied directly from a modello Raphael had seen of Michelangelo's \"Moses\".\n\nProminently seated in the center is Prudence. On her breast is an effigy of a winged Gorgon to ward off deceit and fraud. Janus-like, her head has two faces shown in profile. Her youthful feminine face looks forward into a mirror. This is an allegory of wisdom and knowledge of the present. The backward-facing visage of the old man peers into a past for sound judgment predicated on experience. His view is enhanced by the flaming torch held by a putto depicting Hope.\n\nTemperance sits on the right. She holds the bridle of restraint and is accompanied by a putto portraying Faith who points upward to heaven with his right hand.\n\nThe fourth cardinal virtue, Justice, isn't included in the scene. Instead, she is depicted holding scales and a sword in a tondo on the ceiling directly above the fresco. The more prominent position of Justice is explained by the emphasis Plato placed on this fourth virtue. He introduced it to ensure the other three cardinal virtues existed in harmony.\n\nThe other two frescoes found lower on the wall also portray scenes concerning the law. To the left of the window is a fresco designed by Raphael but executed by his studio. It depicts the Emperor Justinian receiving the civil code known as the Pandects of the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" from Tribonian. To the right of the window, Pope Gregory IX (as portrayed by Julius II) receives the code of canon law known as the \"Decretals\" from Raymond of Penyafort.\n"}

{"id": "8444504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8444504", "title": "Character sketch", "text": "Character sketch\n\nThe word character sketch means a rough-and-ready rendering or thumbnail portrayal of an individual, capturing, in brief, that person's physical characteristics, psychological attributes, and the like. The brief descriptions often capitalize on the more unusual or humorous aspects of the person’s character. Character sketches are usually identified by irony, humor, exaggeration, and satire. The term originates in portraiture, where the character sketch is a common academic exercise. The artist performing a character sketch attempts to capture an expression or gesture that goes beyond coincident actions and gets to the essence of the individual.\n\nThe first English writer to delve into the form was Joseph Hall in his book Characters of Virtues and Vices which was published in 1608. However, the character sketch didn’t become popular amongst the literate public until the late seventeenth century. The public appreciated sketches for their humor and readable style. As Pat Rogers notes, Henry Fielding, in book I, chapter 14 of \"Joseph Andrews\", invokes William Hogarth to create a character sketch of Mrs. Tow-wouse: \"Indeed, if Mrs. Tow-wouse had given no Utterance to the Sweetness of her Temper, Nature had taken such Pains in her Countenance, that Hogarth himself never gave more Expression to a Picture.\" Thomas Overbury, John Earle, Richard Steele, and Joseph Addison also wrote notable character sketches. Addison and Steele’s sketches appeared in a periodical that was issued twice a week under the name “The Spectator Papers.” They created several personas such as Roger de Coverly, Mr. Spectator, and Captain Sentry who represented different classes in English society. From the point of view of these personas, Addison and Steele wrote sketches that addressed important events in the social and political atmospheres. In America, Walt Whitman published a series of remarkable character sketches in 1856. Whitman’s sketches involved mostly physical descriptions, however, like Addison and Steele, his sketches were written with a purpose. Rather than make social or political commentary, Whitman used the opportunity to provide sketches that publicly praised his friends and ridiculed his enemies.\n\nIn later literature, a character sketch became a short story or narrative presented without significant action or plot, as the purpose of the writing is solely to present a character at his or her typical. Character sketches of this sort are also frequently found in journalism and regionalist humor (e.g., sketches of \"Big John\" or \"the country rube\" or \"the wise Squire\"). Each of these attempts to delineate a model of a type (a category of person) rather than a realistic person.\n\nToday, the character sketch appears mostly in the writings of satiric novelists such as Thomas Pynchon. The character sketch has also been adapted to appear on television in both dramatic and comedic forms such as TV serial,movies etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "8408318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8408318", "title": "Cretan School", "text": "Cretan School\n\nCretan School describes an important school of icon painting, under the umbrella of post-Byzantine art, which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, El Greco, was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.\n\nThere was a substantial demand for Byzantine icons in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and, as a Venetian possession since 1204, Crete had a natural advantage and soon came to dominate the supply. A probable early example is the famous icon of the Virgin in Rome known as Our Mother of Perpetual Help, which was certainly well known in Rome by 1499. At this date there is little to distinguish Cretan work from other Byzantine icons stylistically, and the quality of work is lower than that associated with Constantinople.\n\nThis period also saw considerable numbers of wall-paintings in local churches and monasteries - altogether some 850 from the 14th and 15th centuries survive in Crete, far more than from earlier or later periods.\n\nBy the late 15th century, Cretan artists had established a distinct icon-painting style, distinguished by \"the precise outlines, the modelling of the flesh with dark brown underpaint and dense tiny highlights on the cheeks of the faces, the bright colours in the garments, the geometrical treatment of the drapery, and, finally the balanced articulation of the composition\", or \"sharp contours, slim silhouettes, linear draperies and restrained movements\". The most famous artist of the period was Andreas Ritzos\n(c. 1421–1492), whose son Nicholas was also well known. Angelos Akotantos, until recently thought to be a conservative painter of the 17th century, is now, after the discovery of a will dated 1436, seen to have been an innovative artist in fusing Byzantine and Western styles, who survived until about 1457, when the will was actually registered. The will was made in anticipation of a voyage to Constantinople; several icons were bequeathed to church institutions, some Catholic but mainly Orthodox, and the disposition of his stock of pattern drawings was carefully specified. Andreas Pavias (d. after 1504) and his pupil Angelos Bizamanos, and Nicholas Tzafuris (d. before 1501) were other leading artists.\n\nEven before the fall of Constantinople there is evidence that leading Byzantine artists were leaving the capital in order to settle in Crete. The migration of Byzantine artists to Crete continued increasingly the next years and reached its peak after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, when Crete became \"the most important centre of art in the Greek world\", influencing artistic developments in the rest of the Greek world. Cretan icons were commissioned for monasteries on Mount Athos and elsewhere. The Cretan school had a smaller rival; until it fell to the Turks in 1522, Rhodes also had a community of artists, but not so large or significant. \nThe Venetian archives preserve considerable documentation on the trade of artistic icons between Venice and Crete, which by the end of the 15th century had become one of mass production. There is documentation of a specific order in 1499, of 700 icons of the Virgin, 500 in a Western style, and 200 in Byzantine style. The order was placed with three artists by two dealers, one Venetian and one from mainland Greece, and the time between contract date and delivery was set at only forty-five days. Probably the quality of many such commissioned icons was fairly low, and the dismissive term Madonneri was devised to describe such bulk painters, who later practised in Italy also, often using a quasi-Byzantine style, and apparently often Greek or Dalmatian individuals. Production of icons at these levels seems to have led to a glut in the market, and in the following two decades there is much evidence that the Cretan trade declined significantly, as the European demand had been reduced. But at the top end of the market Cretan icons were now the finest in the Byzantine world.\n\nAbout 120 artists can be documented working in Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day Herakleion), in the period 1453–1526, and they had organized a \"Schuola di San Luca\" painter's guild, based on the Italian model. The blending of the Eastern and the Western traditions, and a relaxed interchange between Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic rites led to the \"Cretan Renaissance\", a golden period for the arts on the island, where both literature and painting flourished. Some of these painters chose to continue the Byzantine tradition of Constantinople, while others were influenced by the masters of the Venetian Renaissance, such as Giovanni Bellini and Titian. Later Veronese was to be a particular influence. Works by these masters or copies were in monasteries and churches of the island, while examples of Early Netherlandish painting decorated the Catholic churches of Candia or were to be found in the private collections of rich Venetians and Greeks. In particular, Candia contained a large Franciscan church and a large Orthodox monastery, a daughter-house of Saint Catherine's Monastery, both of which had strong collections from their respective traditions.\n\nContemporary documents refer to two styles in painting: the \"maniera greca\" (\"alla greca\", in line with the Byzantine idiom) and the \"maniera Latina\" (\"alla Latina\", in accordance with Western techniques), which artists knew and utilized according to the circumstances; as a result some kind of \"eclecticism\" appeared. Indeed, sometimes both styles could be found in the same icon, the one right next to the other. The fame of the most prominent Cretan painters spread throughout Greece, the Mediterranean and Europe. After the beginning of the 16th century, the Cretan artists once again had more commissions and their works were avidly sought, since they had started to use new motives and to adjust their iconography to the new trends of their era. To an extent quantity was probably replaced by quality compared with the previous century.\n\nApart from El Greco, the most famous Cretan artists during the century were Theophanis Strelitzas (Θεοφάνης Στρελίτζας), known as Theophanes the Cretan, Michael Damaskenos (Μιχαήλ Δαμασκηνός), and Georgios Klontzas (Γεώργιος Κλόντζας). Various members of the Lambardos family were also significant artists. Fortunately for art historians, many Cretan painters adopted the practice, perhaps as early as Western painters, of signing their work, which was not a traditional Byzantine practice.\n\nTheophanes the Cretan was a relatively conservative Cretan artist, whose first dated work is from 1527, and all of whose known works were done on the mainland or smaller islands. He was the most important Greek wall painter of his day, incorporating some Western iconographic and stylistic elements, but remaining essentially Byzantine in spirit.\n\nThe intellectual and artistic personality of the young El Greco was formed in this artistic environment. In 1563, at the age of twenty-two, El Greco was described in a document as a \"master\" (\"maestro Domenigo\"), meaning he was already an enrolled master of the local guild, presumably in charge of his own workshop. He left for Venice a few years later, and never returned to Crete. His \"Dormition of the Virgin\", of before 1567 in tempera and gold on panel (61,4 x 45 cm, Holy Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin, Hermoupolis, Syros) was probably created near the end of El Greco's Cretan period. The painting combines post-Byzantine and Italian Mannerist stylistic and iconographic elements, and incorporates stylistic elements of the Cretan School.\n\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, many Cretan artists went to Venice, in the hope of gaining commissions and recognition. Unlike El Greco, the other Cretan painters who moved there did not substantially alter their styles or working methods. They simply incorporated more Italian motifs into a consistent Byzantine framework. Jonathan Brown provides a perceptive analysis of the ways that El Greco distinguished himself from other Cretan artists active in Venice, while Richard Mann argues that \"none of these painters accepted Renaissance ideas about the relevance of change to the creation of art works\". Michael Damaskenos returned to Crete after three years, and remained there for the rest of his life.\n\nProminent representatives of the Cretan School during the 17th century were Father Emmanuel Tzanes (Εμμανουήλ Τζάνες, 1610–1690), Emmanuel Lambardos and Theodoros Poulakis (Θεόδωρος Πουλάκης, 1622–1692). The Cretan icon painters continued to flourish, until the mid-century, when the Ottoman Turks occupied all the island except for Candia, which finally fell after twenty years of siege in 1669. After the Ottoman occupation of Crete, the centre of Greek painting moved to the Ionian Islands, which remained under Venetian rule until the Napoleonic Wars. A new artistic movement was created called the Heptanese School which was mostly influenced by Western European artistic trends. Many Cretan artists migrated to the Heptanese or Western Europe to enjoy the artistic freedom. A successive occupation of the Ionian islands by the French and the British allowed the Heptanese to remain the centre of Greek Art until the independence of Greece in 1830.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Made in conjunction with a line of \"Hanazuki\" toys, it is based on characters and concepts which were developed by Hanneke Metselaar and Niko Stumpo before Hasbro purchased them in 2010. Set in a fictional galaxy comprising countless moons, the series follows Hanazuki, a childlike being called a Moonflower who uses her emotion-based powers to protect her home from being obliterated by a dark force known as the \"Big Bad\".\n\nThe series debuted on YouTube on January 12, 2017, and was produced in conjunction with a line of merchandise to be released later the same year, including a toyline and digital app. The web series received praise from critics, drawing favorable comparisons to other animated series such as \"\" and \"Steven Universe\" for its storytelling, visual aesthetic, and darker undertones. As of May 2017, the series has amassed over 120 million views. It has been renewed for a second season, which will premiere in 2018. A third season and a feature-length film are also in development.\n\n\"Hanazuki\" began airing on Discovery Family on December 1, 2018, marking its American televised debut.\n\nThe series is set in a fictional galaxy of moons that is beset by the \"Big Bad\", a black, inky miasma that drains the life and color of anything it touches. Each moon is protected by a Moonflower, a plantlike child who uses his or her emotional states to activate magical \"treasures\" that are supplied by an infantile being named Little Dreamer, which can then be planted to grow trees that ward off the Big Bad. The series opens with Hanazuki, a newly born Moonflower, arriving on a moon populated by numerous denizens, including colorful rabbit-like creatures called Hemka. Several episodes focus on Hanazuki and her friends' escapades as she learns about her responsibilities and emotions, ending with her growing a colored Treasure Tree that corresponds with her mood in that episode. As the series progresses, Hanazuki encounters other Moonflowers that have failed at saving their own moons and seek to learn from Hanazuki in order to properly harness their powers against the Big Bad.\n\nMoonflowers are childlike beings who are guardians of the galaxy's moons. Created by Little Dreamer, they have white flowers on their heads and highlights that change color depending on their moods, enabling them to grow Treasure Trees that protect their moons from the Big Bad.\n\n\nThe Hemka (or Hemkas) are small, rabbit-like creatures that inhabit Hanazuki's moon. They speak in gibberish that others except Hanazuki can fully understand, and they have malleable bodies that allow them to merge and change into different objects. Each Hemka is of a different color and represents a specific personality trait that Hanazuki reflects.\n\n\nUnicorns in the series are native to Kiyoshi's moon. They possess the same colors and personality traits as the Hemka, with the additional ability to perform magic using their horns. Most unicorns in the series are voiced by Debi Derryberry.\n\n\n\nThe original concept of \"Hanazuki\" was first developed in 2005 as an independent toy line by Norwegian art director Niko Stumpo and his Dutch partner, Hanneke Metselaar, under the self-formed Hanazuki Company in the Netherlands. Hasbro purchased the rights to the \"Hanazuki\" brand in 2010, with The Hanazuki Company being rebranded Thisisarobot. By 2013, \"Hanazuki\" was being developed as an interactive game for children from ages 7 to 12, with a scheduled release date for Fall 2014. A preview of Hanazuki was included in the 2013 United States home media release of Hasbro Studios' \"\".

The remaining nine episodes were released weekly from May 19 to July 14, 2017.\n\nIn Canada, \"Hanazuki: Full of Treasures\" aired as a sneak peek on January 28, 2017 on YTV, Teletoon, Cartoon Network and Disney Channel, all operated by Corus Entertainment.\n\nIn the United States, Discovery Family began broadcasting the first season on December 1, 2018.\n\nThe web series was made in conjunction with a line of \"Hanazuki\" toys first announced at the 2017 New York Toy Fair, which will launch in June the same year. A digital app for the series was released for iOS and Android on April 4, 2017, offering a tie-in interactive video game along with episodes of the web series. A companion book authored by Brandon T. Snider, titled \"Hanazuki: Book of Treasures – The Official Guide\", was released on November 7, 2017. A series of four chapter books set within the universe of the web-series was also announced, with the first book written by Stacy Davidowitz, titled \"Hanazuki: A Spark in the Dark\", released on May 8, 2018.\n\nA \"Hanazuki\" short was released theatrically with Hasbro Studio's \"\" on October 6, 2017, the plot of which focuses on Hanazuki as she tries to get a treasure back from the playful Yellow Hemka.

As of May 2017, the series has accumulated over 120 million views on YouTube.\n\nIn her review of the web series, Lauren Orsini of \"Forbes\" commented on the involvement of \"Friendship Is Magic\" writer Dave Polsky as a story editor, considering \"Friendship Is Magic\" to be lucrative to Hasbro's success, and concluding that the series was an attempt by the company to incite similar success with \"Hanazuki\". In a later article, Orsini attributed the series' popularity on YouTube to its \"spunky characters and high production values\". Mercedes Milligan of \"Animation Magazine\" said of the series, \"\"Hanazuki\" puts a modern, cross-platform spin on a premise that will be familiar to '80s kids who grew up with Rainbow Brite, et al.\" Ella Anders of BSC Kids praised the opening episodes for its setting, lore, characters, and overarching storytelling. She additionally interpreted the series as a Western magical girl series that \"doesn't play off the traditional magical girl path or tropes\". Nathalie Medina of \"iDigitalTimes\" gave the series a score of 4 out of 5, complimenting the characters and hints of a more complex underlying story, and comparing its visual style to \"a Lisa Frank folder with a 2000s aesthetic\".\n\n"}
{"id": "26195094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26195094", "title": "Holy Allegory", "text": "Holy Allegory\n\nThe Holy Allegory is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Giovanni Bellini, dating from c. 1490 to 1500. It is in the Uffizi gallery in Florence, Italy.\n\nThere is no documentation about the commission and the original location of the work, which is known to have been part of the Austrian Imperial collections in Vienna in the 18th century. In 1793 the director of the Uffizi, Luigi Lanzi, exchanged it with another work in order to improve the Venetian Renaissance presence in the museum. At the time, it was attributed to Giorgione. \n\nThe Italian art historian Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle was the first to identify it as a Bellini. Today his attribution is widely recognized, although another name sometimes mentioned is that of Marco Basaiti.\n\nThe scene is set on a wide terrace with a polychrome marble pavement, in perspective, separated from a lake shore by a parapet. On the left Mary is enthroned, under a baldachin whose support is in cornucopia shape, a symbol of her fertility. The baldachin has four steps, and on its side is a frieze with scenes of the myth of Marsyas, interpreted as a parallel with Jesus' Passion. Near to Mary are two unidentified female figures, which could represent two saints or two virtues. One of them looks to be floating in the air, although the effect could stem from a loss of color near her legs and feet. \n\nIn the middle of the scene are four children playing with a small tree and its silver fruits, perhaps a symbol of the knowledge tree, a symbol of life and wisdom. On the right are Job and St. Sebastian. Outside the parapet, are St. Joseph (or St. Peter) and St. Paul, the latter with his attribute of a sword. He is advancing to the left, where a man with a turban perhaps symbolizes an infidel.\n\nIn the background, beyond a large lake, is a landscape with rocky spurs with men and animals. On the shores are a shepherd in a grotto, and a centaur.\nThe exact meaning of the painting had not been yet completely understood, although several hypotheses have been made by art historians. What is sure is that the painting was made for a refined élite, whose education allowed them to understand any subtle detail included in it.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Ludwig interpreted it as a pictoral transcription of the early 14th French poem \"Le Pèlerinage de l'Âme\" (\"Pilgrimage of the Soul\"), by Guillaume de Deguileville. According to him, the painting represents the ideal path of purification of the soul. The hermit shepherd would be St. Anthony the Abbot, descending from his hermitage in the spiritual path inspired to the first hermit, St. Paul, and overcoming several obstacles including the centaur which waits for him at the end of the staircase. The terrace would represent the Paradise Garden, where the souls in Purgatory, symbolized by the children, wait before they are admitted to heaven. Mary, advocate of the men before God, judges the souls with the help of the crowned Justice coronata. Amongst the children, who are playing with the mystic fruits, the one at the tree would be a soul called to the eternal beatitude. The two saints standing on the left would be the patrons, perhaps connected to the works' commissioners, while the two behind the parapet would be Peter and Paul, who guard the gate of Paradise. The river in the background would be Lethe, which surrounds Paradise. The animals would represent the hermits' virtue: the mule for the patience, and the sheep for humility.\n\nAccording to other scholars, the painting would represent a common holy conversation or a vision of the Paradise. Some see Jesus in the children on the cushion, giving to the work the meaning of a meditation about incarnation and redemption.\n\n"}

Only natural dyes are used in \"Kalamkari\" and it involves twenty three steps. \n\nThere are two distinctive styles of kalamkari art in India - Srikalahasti style and the Machilipatnam style. The Srikalahasti style of \"Kalamkari\"(Kalankari), wherein the \"\"kalam\" or pen is used for freehand drawing of the subject and filling in the colors, is entirely hand worked. This style flowered around temples and their patronage and so had an almost religious identity - scrolls, temple hangings, chariot banners and the like, depicted deities and scenes taken from the Hindu epics - Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas and the mythological classics. This style owes its present status to Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay who popularized the art as the first Chairperson of the All India Handicrafts Board. \n\nHistorically, Kalamkai use to be known as \"Pattachitra\", an art form still found in neighboring Odisha and other parts of India and Nepal. The term \"Pattachitra\"\" in (Sanskrit:पट्टचित्र) translates to \"Patta\" meaning \"cloth\" and \"Chitra\" means \"picture\". Paintings made on fabric and fabric scrolls finds mentioned in ancient Hindu, Buddhist and Jain literature. \n\nUnder medieval Islamic rule, the term Kalamkari Persian, which is derived from the words k\"alam\" (pen) and \"kari\" (craftmanship), meaning drawing with a pen came to be in popular use under the patronage of Golconda sultanate.\n\nIn ancient times, groups of singers, musicians and painters, called \"chitrakars\", moved from village to village to tell the village dwellers, the great stories of Hindu mythology. They illustrated their accounts using large bolts of canvas painted on the spot with simple means and dyes extracted from plants. In the same way, one found in the Hindu temples large panels of \"kalamkari\" depicting the episodes of Indian mythology, similar to Buddhist Thangka paintings.\n\nAs an art form it found its peak in the wealthy Golconda sultanate, Hyderabad, in the Middle Ages. The Mughals who patronized this craft in the Coromandel and Golconda province called the practitioners of this craft \"\"qualamkars\", from which the term \"kalamkari\"\" evolved. The Pedana Kalamkari craft made at Pedana nearby Machilipatnam in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, evolved with the patronage of the Mughals and the Golconda sultanate. Owing to the said patronage, this school was influenced by Persian art under Islamic rule.\n\n\"Kalamkari\" art has been practiced by many families in Andhra Pradesh, some villages in Tamilnadu (Sickinaickanpettai) by migrants from Telugu speaking families and over the generations has constituted their livelihood. \"Kalamkari\" had a certain decline, then it was revived in India and abroad for its craftsmanship. Since the 18th century the British have enjoyed the decorative element for clothing.\n\nIn middle ages the term is also used to refer, incorrectly, to the making of any cotton fabric patterned through the medium of vegetable dyes by free-hand painting and block-printing, produced in many different regions of India. In places where the fabric is block printed the \"kalam\" (pen) is used to draw finer details and for application of some colours.First it was introduce \nin blue colour.\n\nIn modern times it's replaced by digital. The art took a turn-over and updated digitally to fit in the glove of time. In this era new types and new techniques are introduced and the \"digital files\" of kalamkari (pen work) is totally introduced widely all over the regions of India and Iran (Persia).\n\nSeeping it in astringents and buffalo milk and then drying it under the sun. Afterwards, the red, black, brown, and violet portions of the designs are outlined with a mordant and cloth is then placed in a bath of alizarin. The next step is to cover the cloth, except for the parts to be dyed blue, in wax, and immerse the cloth in indigo dye. The wax is then scraped off and remaining areas are painted by hand, similar to Indonesian \"batik\".\n\nTo create design contours, artists use a bamboo or date palm stick pointed at one end with a bundle of fine hair attached to this pointed end to serve as the brush or pen. This pen is soaked in a mixture of fermented jaggery and water; one by one these are applied, then the vegetable dyes.\n\nIn Iran, the fabric is printed using patterned wooden stamps.\n\nDyes for the cloth are obtained by extracting colors from various roots, leaves, and mineral salts of iron, tin, copper, and alum. Various effects are obtained by using cow dung, seeds, plants and crushed flowers to obtain natural dye. Along with buffalo milk, myrobalan is used in \"kalamkari\". \"Myrobalan\" is also able to remove the odd smell of buffalo milk. The fixing agents available in the \"myrobolan\" can easily fix the dye or color of the textile while treating the fabric. Alum is used in making natural dyes and also while treating the fabric. Alum ensures the stability of the color in \"kalamkari\" fabric.\n\n\"Kalamkari\" specifically depicts epics such as the Ramayana or Mahabharata. However, there are recent applications of the \"kalamkari\" technique to depict Buddha and Buddhist art forms.\n\n"}

Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of Hittite art. \n\nThe monument originally consisted of four parts: two ruler figures carved into the cliff (Karabel A and B) and two inscriptions on boulders (Karabel C and C). During the construction of a road through the pass between 1977 and 1982, all the reliefs except for Karabel A were destroyed. Karabel A shows a warrior marching to the right with a bow in his right hand and a spear in his left. There are Luwian hieroglyphs inscribed above his left arm. The relief is 1.5 m wide and 2.5 m high\n\nHerodotus interpreted the figure as the Egyptian Pharaoh Sesostris. The relief was visited by the French traveller Charles Texier in 1839 - he published a description in 1862. After him, Karl Richard Lepsius visited it in 1840. Both accepted it as Egyptian. Heinrich Kiepert disproved this in 1843 by comparing it with the reliefs of Yazılıkaya. Subsequently, when the relief was accepted as Hittite, the place was visited and described by several scholars, including Kurt Bittel, Helmuth Theodor Bossert, Hans Gustav Güterbock, Ekrem Akurgal, Heinrich Otten and Annelies Kammenhuber.\nAccording to the latest research, the relief depicts Tarkasnawa, the king of the Hittite vassal state of Mira under the Hittite empire (13th century BC). In 1998 John David Hawkins was able to read the inscription as follows: \nNo traces of the name of the grandfather survive, but other evidence indicates that it was Kubantaruntija.\n\nThe relief has wider historical significance as evidence that the kingdom of Mira was south of the Seha river land (probably the Gediz River). From Hittite diplomatic letters, chiefly the Milawata letter, it is known that the Seha river land was bordered on one side by the kingdom of Mira and on the other side by Wilusa. The relief proves that Wilusa cannot have been south of the Gediz river, but must have been to the north of the river, in the Troad. This aids in the identification of Wilusa with the city of \"Ilion\", another name for Troy in Homer's \"Iliad\".\n\n\n"}

The artists of this offshoot of the Hague School chose the inhabitants of Laren and the surrounding landscape as the subject of their art.\n\nDiscovered by painter, Jozef Israëls, the area around Laren School was distinguished by its unspoiled beauty and diversity of landscape, and was considered ideally situated by many members of the Hague School. After 1898, it was rediscovered by young artists known as the second generation of the Laren School, their work extending far into the 20th century. This colony of artists is significant in Dutch Impressionism, being seen as part of this international movement. The ideas fostered in the area found their way to the Modernist art movement.\n\nThe industrialisation of Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other regions of the Netherlands affected landscapes that had remained untouched for centuries. Many of these landscapes disappeared, and with them, the inspiration for earlier landscape and genre painting.\n\nAfter 15 years of fame, from 1855 to 1870, the artists of the Oosterbeek School were looking for a new place to paint. Around 1870, the painter, Jozef Israëls, discovered the village of Laren. He visited often with his son, Isaac, whom he instructed in outdoor painting. His enthusiasm for Laren, and the surrounding landscape and agricultural activity, was infectious, and other artists from the Pulchri Studio began to join him. Albert Neuhuys and Anton Mauve were the first to follow Israëls in 1877 and in 1882. Later, Hein Kever, Willem Steelink, Hendrik Valkenburg, Wally Moes, Etha Fles, Arina Hugenholtz and Tony Offermans Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, Willem Roelofs, and Max Liebermann (the first foreign painter at the Laren School and an old friend of Israël) came to work in Laren. Thus, the Laren School as an artist colony was born. Some of these painters settled in the region; their Laren-inspired works were shown to the public at the Pulchri Studio and affiliated galleries.\n\nNeuhuys concentrated on farm life as a genre subject, but the others turned to the landscape. Art historians describe this as the Laren Style, which is regarded as part of the Hague School.\n\nAround 1885, the first colony ceased to produce new work based on Laren and its environs.\n\nAround 1898, Laren was rediscovered by a group of young painters who gave new life to the Laren Style school of painting for the next 40 years, including , Evert Pieters, Bernard de Hoog, Hendrik Theodorus de Court Onderwater, , Salomon Garf, Franz Deutmann, Lammert van der Tonge, and Bernard Pothast. Most of these were genre painters in the agricultural tradition, like Neuhuys. However some were landscape painters, notably , and .\n\nThe second generation of the Laren School diverged, one group following the traditions of the Hague School while the rest painted in the new style of Impressionism, embracing modernity with an enthusiasm now considered typical of the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1903, under the initiative of August Johannes le Gras (1864–1915), the Gooische Painters Association, \"De Tien\" (The Ten), was founded. This group organized exhibitions across the country to create new opportunities for the work of its members. The Ten included , , and .\nWilliam Henry Singer, an American painter and art collector, came to Laren in 1901. In 1911, he built a villa called \"De Wilde Zwanen\" (The Wild Swans) which, after World War II, was converted into the Singer Museum and concert hall.\n\nAt De Wilde Zwanen, painters such as Co Breman and Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig differed from the mainstream of Impressionism, painting in the style of Pointillism and Luminism. specialized in the representation of factories. For modernists, like Piet Mondriaan, Jan Sluyters and Leo Gestel, this studio and its location were significant in the direction they took in their art.\n\nIn 1921, the Association of Visual Artists, Laren, Blaricum, was founded by Co Breman. In 1935, the Gooische Painters Association fractured, and the members formed several distinct groups. August Johannes le Gras specialised in African landscapes and animals, Jan Pieter Veth in portraits, in still life.\n\nToday, the Singer Museum exhibits works of the Laren School.\n\nFrom art collectors and authors, the term is often used for all painters active in Laren, and as shorthand for the continuation of the Hague School and the Oosterbeek School. Several founders of this artist colony — Jozef Israëls and his son, Isaac, along with Albert Neuhuys and Anton Mauve — were already known as Hague painters.\n\nThis artists of the Laren School are linked together by the relationship between their ideas of art, style and techniques. In Laren, the countryside was the main theme of the landscape painters. Therefore, the term 'Laren' applies primarily as a place of landscape painting. The lightening of color, by adding gold yellow, red and blue, is essential to the Laren School. Another striking feature of Laren School paintings is the romantic view of social life in this tough region of Gooiland.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17186338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17186338", "title": "Mythos (Aristotle)", "text": "Mythos (Aristotle)\n\nMythos is the term used by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" (c. 335 BCE) for the plot of an Athenian tragedy. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.\n\n“In \"Poetics\" 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”. In \"Poetics\" 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear. According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in \"Poetics\" 13 and a different set in \"Poetics\" 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”. Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of \"Poetics\" as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”. A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune. The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”. Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four. Aristotle contends in \"Poetics\" 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to hamartia, “error.” Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’ \"Poetics\" 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, \"Poetics\" 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent. “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of pathos:\n\n1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.\n\n2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.\n\n3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.\n\n4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.\n\nThe emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.\n\nAristotle’s notion of mythos in \"Poetics\" differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s \"Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion\", Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”. Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”. Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to Meir Sternberg, Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events. Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”. Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves. Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.\n\nGerman idealist philosopher G. W. F. Hegel believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good. Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater. In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.\n\nAs well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as Vladimir Propp, who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”. Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in \"Poetics\" because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.\n\n"}
{"id": "3651239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3651239", "title": "Re-edited film", "text": "Re-edited film\n\nA re-edited film is a film that has been modified from its original theatrical release. These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer, \"\"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content\".\" Reasons for this type of editing may range from the distributor's demands to accommodating different audience groups. Fan-made movie edits are often met with controversy, as they bring up issues of copyright law.\n\nThere are three main types of film editing: format, length, and content.\n\nThere are two main techniques for re-editing films:\n\nPurchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station hard drive and third-party editors manually re-edit the video and audio tracks, removing objectionable content. The re-edited version is then copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or purchase provided an original version has been purchased in correlation with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see \"The Phantom Edit\") to cut a film to their own – or their peers – specifications.\n\nAlthough the recent court ruling prohibits business from manually re-editing commercial films, the law still allows for individuals to self censor and edit their own films for personal use.\n\nProgrammed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content on-the-fly according to pre-programmed instruction sets which are knowingly used by the consumer.\n\nIn any case, theatrical films that aired on television in the 1970s and most of the 1980s would simply have an \"Edited For Television\" disclaimer superimposed right after the opening credits, or, in a few cases, superimposed over the movie title card itself, just below the title. However, today, when a theatrical film or television special is aired on network or syndicated television or is re-issued on video in a form different from its original version, variations of the following disclaimers appear:\n\nEarly cases of this practice go back to the Nazis, who regularly stole prints of American movies from European countries during their Blitzkrieg raids. They would then either cheaply reanimate the movie (see \"Hochzeit im Korallenmeer\"), or they would change the names in the credits (as with Max and David Fleischer's cartoons).\n\nAs theatrical movies began to air on television, networks successfully sought permission to air shortened versions of movies. These TV version of theatrical films had scenes or sections of movies cut out, in order to provide a length short enough to fit in fixed number normal television half-hour-based time slots (often four half-hour slots). This also allowed scenes unsuitable for television to be cut or trimmed such as those with sex or graphic violence. On the other hand, networks would also often add footage deleted from a film's theatrical release to pad out a certain running time (3 to 4 hours).\n\nIn response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS tapes literally by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for this activity has been Utah with its conservative and entrepreneurial population. When \"Titanic\" was released on VHS, a video store owner in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the film for a $5 service fee. The service became very popular. Before long, several video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re-edited for their rental club/co-op members to watch.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, some small companies began selling copies of movies, without the violent, indecent or foul language parts, to appeal to the family audience. By 2003, Hollywood reacted against these unauthorized modifications, as it considered them to be a destruction of the filmmakers work, and a violation of the controls an author has over his or her works. Famous directors and producers, such as Steven Spielberg, have publicly criticized this practice in magazines.\n\nWhen DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering for sale or rental a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the film on a coupled DVD-R Several companies attempted this business. First, some tried to do it via physical brick and mortar stores, the most successful being the deal model and proprietary stores owned by CleanFlicks, Inc. of Utah. Clean Films later became the largest and most successful company in the business by employing an online rental model (similar to Netflix) and avoiding any physical stores. CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were sued with several others and a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the companies were violating copyright. Those named in the lawsuit ceased renting and selling edited films. The legal argument was that the editing resulted in a derivation on a fixed media. At all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited films with a legitimately purchased original copy. Furthermore, every rented unit in edited format had a corresponding original copy that was purchased at retail. The judge ruled that the fixed media caused the violation. ClearPlay was not affected by this ruling, as they did not sell fixed media, and editing took place as the unaltered streamed media was altered by the consumer's control of ClearPlay's software.\n\nThe lawsuit started because a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado pre-emptively sued major directors. The franchisee feared the directors were going to sue because the DGA's website said as much. The Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association of America counter-sued and also included several edited film companies for copyright infringement and claims regarding derivative works. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado ruled that it was a copyright violation to distribute re-edited films without the consent from the film studios (key was the fixed media aspect of the businesses).\n\nIn an odd twist, despite Judge Matsch's decision and order to the re-editing companies to destroy all their re-edited inventory, shortly after the studios' victory in the Denver court, the lawyers for the studios negotiated with lawyers for the re-editing companies allowing for the sale of existing inventory. One of the companies in the first three days of a \"going out of business sale\" generated more than a quarter of a million dollars in revenue and eventually sold enough re-edited movies to provide original investors a five times or better return on investment. This is an unexpected investor outcome given the loss of a major infringement case.\n\nLess controversial than external bodies editing movies were the rise of director's cut editions of movies, which flourished with the advent of DVDs. These restore (and occasionally also shorten or omit, as in the case of Alien) scenes or footage from movies which had been shortened for whatever reason (including studio interference with the directors creative vision, inability to finish what was intended due to technology, or even the reactions of test audiences).\n\nClearPlay was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot by The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, which clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer its products to consumers in the U.S. while others have discontinued for legal reasons.\n\nAnother aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits, which are called fan edits (or fanedits). It is when consumers load the films into their computers and use video editing software to produce mostly a version with changed content for their own entertainment. Fan edits are becoming more popular since they are spread over the internet.\n\nIt is unclear where this industry is headed. There is demand for the product. A 2005 ABC News poll of 1,002 adults from across the United States found that 39% of those polled were interested in purchasing re-edited films, while 58% of respondents said that would not be interested in such a purchase (with a 3-point error margin).\n\nDespite the aforementioned legal rulings, companies continue to sell re-edited movies via the Internet. Some have been shut down as well. Yet, search engine results on the web reveal companies continue to provide fixed media products, such as Clean Play DVDs. Sometimes they use \"going out of business\" tactics to move inventory. However, physical \"brick and mortar\" stores have been shut down, such as Cougar Video in Provo, Utah, which remained open long after the named companies in the aforementioned lawsuit were closed down.\n\nOne company, Swank, offers re-edited movies created by the studios themselves, supposedly for showings in correctional facilities and other non-theatrical locations. It is not clear if these versions are the same re-edited versions that studios create for airlines or television showings.\n\n"}

The final mix must achieve a desired sonic balance between its various elements, and must match the director's or sound designer's original vision for the project. For material intended for broadcast, the final mix must also comply with all applicable laws governing sound mixing (e.g., the CALM Act in the United States and the EBU R128 loudness protocol in Europe). \n\nThe different names of this profession are both based on the fact that the mixer is not mixing a live performance to a live audience nor recording live on a set. That is, he or she is re-recording sound already recorded elsewhere (the basis of the North American name) after passing it through mixing equipment such as a digital audio workstation and may dub in additional sounds in the process (the basis of the European name). While mixing can be performed in a recording studio or home office, a full-size mixing stage or dubbing stage is used for feature films intended for release to movie theaters in order to help the mixer envision how the final mix will be heard in such large spaces. \n\nDuring production or earlier parts of post-production, sound editors, sound designers, sound engineers, production sound mixers and/or music editors assemble the tracks that become raw materials for the re-recording mixer to work with. Those tracks in turn originate with sounds created by professional musicians, singers, actors, or foley artists. \n\nThe first part of the traditional re-recording process is called the \"premix.\" In the dialog premix the re-recording mixer does preliminary processing, including making initial loudness adjustments, cross-fading, and reducing environmental noise or spill that the on-set microphone picked up. In most instances, audio restoration software may be employed. For film or television productions, they may add a temporary/permanent music soundtrack that will have been prepared by the music editor, then the resulting work will be previewed by test audiences, and then the film or television program is re-cut and the soundtrack must be mixed again. Re-recording mixer may also augment or minimize audience reactions for television programs recorded in front of a studio audience. In some cases, a laugh track may augment these reactions.\n\nDuring the \"final mix\" the re-recording/dubbing mixers, guided by the director or producer, must make creative decisions from moment to moment in each scene about how loud each major sound element (dialog, sound effects, laugh track and music) should be relative to each other. They also modify individual sounds when desired by adjusting their loudness and spectral content and by adding artificial reverberation. They can insert sounds into the three-dimensional space of the listening environment for a variety of venues and release formats: movie theaters, home theater systems, etc. that have stereo and multi-channel (5.1, 7.1, etc.) sound systems.\n"}

He wrote many successful musical burlesques, comic operas, farces and adaptations from the French, including the English-language adaptation of the operetta \"Les cloches de Corneville\", which became the longest-running piece of musical theatre in history up to that time. He sometimes collaborated with Henry Brougham Farnie or others.\n\nReece was born in the island of Barbados, West Indies. His father, Robert Reece (1808–1874), was a barrister of the Inner Temple. Reece matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford in 1857 and received his B.A. in 1860 and his M.A. in 1864. He was admitted a student at the Inner Temple in 1860 but was not called to the bar. For a short time he was a medical student. Between 1861 and 1863, he was an extra clerk in the office of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and from 1864 to 1868 an extra temporary clerk to the emigration commissioners.\n\nFrom the 1860s to the 1880s, Reece wrote comic pieces for the stage with fair success, often adapting three-act European operettas into two-act English-language pieces. He even scored a number of hits, including his adaptation of \"Les cloches de Corneville\", which ran for over 700 performances in 1878–79, the longest run in the history of musical theatre up to that time.\n\nReece's first professionally produced effort was the libretto of an operetta, \"Castle Grim\", with music by G. Allen, produced at the Royalty Theatre in 1865. Among his subsequent contributions to the same stage were the burlesques \"Prometheus\" (1865), \"The Lady of the Lake\" (1866), and \"Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat\" (1871, starring Fred Sullivan and Henrietta Hodson). He also wrote for the Royalty \"Dora's Device\", a comedietta (1871), \"Little Robin Hood\", a burlesque (1871), revived at the Gaiety Theatre (1882), and \"Paquita, or Love in a Trance\", a comic opera with music by J. A. Mallandine (1871).\n\nAt the Queen's Theatre, he produced \"The Stranger, stranger than Ever,\" a burlesque (1868). Another burlesque the same year at the Prince of Wales's Theatre was \"Agamemnon and Cassandra\"\n\nHe wrote many other burlesques for the Globe Theatre, the Olympic Theatre (including \"Richelieu\" in 1873 and \"Clockwork\" in 1877), the Vaudeville Theatre (including \"Green Old Age\", with music by Frederic Clay, in 1874; and a burlesque, \"Ruy Blas Righted\"), the Strand Theatre, and the Gaiety. At the Gaiety, he produced fourteen pieces between 1872 and 1884, among them the pantomimes \"Ali Baba\" (1872), \"Don Giovanni in Venice\" (1873), \"The Forty Thieves,\" (written with F. C. Burnand, H. J. Byron and W. S. Gilbert) (1878) and another version of the same story, with music by Meyer Lutz in 1880; and the burlesques \"Aladdin,\" (1881); \"Little Robin Hood,\" (1882); and \"Valentine and Orson,\" (1882).\n\nHe collaborated with Henry Brougham Farnie on 15 libretti or adaptations and occasionally joined with other dramatic writers. With Farnie, for the Folly Theatre in London, he wrote \"Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea\" (1877); \"Stars and Garters\" (1878); his biggest success, \"Les cloches de Corneville\" (1878); and \"The Creole\". For the Comedy Theatre, he wrote \"Boccaccio\", with music by Franz von Suppé (1882). He also wrote the successful burlesque, \"Carmen; or Sold for a Song\" (1879) for the Folly Theatre. \"The Highest Bidder\" played in New York in 1887, starring E. H. Sothern.\n\nIn 1875, he wrote \"Cattarina\", a comic opera with music by Frederic Clay, produced at the Charing Cross Theatre, and in 1879 he wrote the comic opera \"La Petite Mademoiselle\", together with Henry Sambrooke Leigh, for the Alhambra Theatre. Also for the Alhambra, in 1881 he wrote an English-language adaptation of \"Jeanne, Jeannette and Jeanneton\", a grand opera by P. Lacome after an original libretto by Clairville & Delacour.\n\nDespite all of his successful work, Reece fell on hard times in the 1880s. He died in London at the age of 53 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1920 as the Rochester, New York, chapter of the Poetry Society of America, the group ceased its affiliation with the Society in the 1980s in order to accept a wider variety of members. At that time, the organization adopted its current name.\nFrom June 2005 to May 2013, meeting/workshops were held monthly on the third (later fourth) Saturday at the Center at High Falls Gallery; the Gallery closed in June 2013, and subsequent meetings were held at various venues such as Panera Bread restaurants in the Rochester area.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005, the organization held monthly readings at Writers & Books. In January 2006, the venue was changed to St. John Fisher College in Pittsford, NY, where it held a reading on the third Sunday of each month in the Ross Art Gallery of the Skalny Welcome Center. In August, 2015, the group moved to the Clover Center for Arts & Spirituality in Brighton, NY, and in March, 2017 moved to the Legacy at Clover Blossom complex, also in Brighton. \n\nA large portion of the Rochester Poetry Society and Rochester Poets correspondence, minutes and other documents from 1922 to 1973 are archived in the Rare Books and Special Collection Department of the Rush Rhees Library located at the University of Rochester.\n\nRochester Poets sends out regular email flyers of area literary events, publishes a monthly newsletter and \"The Pinnacle Hill Review\"*, an annual anthology of selected member work. The group maintains a website, a mailing list (informing subscribers of area literary events) which can be joined via the website, and a blog.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2011, Rochester Poets sponsored an annual Poets Against the War event for the Rochester area. From April 2007 until September 2009, they co-sponsored a monthly series of readings at the Anti-War Storefront of the Peace, Action & Education Committee of Rochester MetroJustice.\n\nIn 2006, they began sponsoring annual World Poetry Day and National Poetry Month celebrations at St. John Fisher College in March and April of each year; the World Poetry Day event was merged with the April National Poetry Month event in 2009. The Celebration is open to poets, musicians and singers of all ages and levels from throughout the region.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, the group sponsored an Emerging Poets event in December of each year at St. John Fisher College. The event was open to poets of all ages; the primary criterion for eligibility was that participants were not yet \"established\" with a published volume of poems or had a significant number of poems appear in literary journals. From 2007 to 2011, the group also hosted the weekly Free Speech Zone series each Tuesday at the Tango Cafe in Rochester; the series moved to Mondays in 2011 before it was suspended in December 2011 pending finding a new venue.\n\nThe group's anthology has had various titles over the years, among them \"The Oracle\", \"Touchstone\", \"The Gleam\", \"In Between Seasons\", \"Images\", \"Daylight Burning Lanterns\", \"Disguised As Shapes You Love\", and, most recently, \"The Pinnacle Hill Review\". Many of the volumes are held by the Rochester Public Library, Central Branch Literature Collection.\n\nThe group was founded by Edith Willis Forbes, who was also active in the Women's Education and Industrial Union, the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Door of Hope; its first president was Carl Lamson Carmer. Past and current members of note include Al Poulin, Jr. (1938–1996), Patricia Janus (1932–2006), Dale Davis, Leah Zazulyer, Cornelius Eady, Dane Gordon, Jordan Smith, James Lavilla-Havelin, Etta Ruth Weigl, Israel Emiot (1909–1978), Gary Lehmann, John Roche, Vincent Golphin, Anne Coon, Carol Oliver, Gerald Clarke, Robert Koch, Wynne McClure, Ruth Kennedy, Francesca Gulì (ca 1921–2009), Paul Humphrey (1915–2001), Eleanor McQuilken (1908–2004), George Monagan (1925–2005), David Michael Nixon, W.

The majority of the project would be along the sidewalks bordering two sides of Rochester's Memorial Art Gallery. The relationship between the City and Art Walk deteriorated, and eventually, a new entity, The Art Walk Extension Project, was created. Two of the proposed development for the Extension were a Poets Walk, to be constructed in 2012 as a redesigned front sidewalk of MAG on University, and a Fiction Writers Walk, still in development, on the east side of the Gallery along Goodman.\n\nMany of those nominated for inclusion in Poets Walk were poets (several of them deceased) who were members of Rochester Poets or had been honored by or affiliated with the group in some way. And many of those nominees were among the first inductees honored in November 2011. They included: Sam Abrams, Linda Allardt, John Ashbery, Anne C. Coon, Adelaide Crapsey, Finvola Drury, Cornelius Eady, Israel Emiot, Vincent F. A. Golphin, Dane Gordon, Anthony Hecht, William Heyen, M. J.

{"id": "58325916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58325916", "title": "Scottish jewellery", "text": "Scottish jewellery\n\nScottish jewellery is jewellery created in Scotland or in a style associated with Scotland, which today often takes the form of the Celtic style. It is often characterised by being inspired by nature, Scandinavian mythology, and Celtic knot patterns. Jewellery has a history in Scotland dating back to at least the Iron Age.\n\nTraditional examples of Scottish jewellery are often functional objects that have been decorated and over time have become jewellery items. Over time, these necessary objects took on more and more decorative appearances, and are now considered an aesthetic item that is more of an accessory.\n\nThe kilt pin is a functional object that weighs down the edge of the apron of a kilt to keep it in place during movement.\n\nThe ring and pin style penannular brooch, also known as the Celtic or Viking brooch, had the original purpose of being a fastener for clothing. Also native to Ireland, it's design was meant to mirror that of the torc. The first examples of this style of brooch date from circa 700CE. These items were first produced for the elite class out of precious metals, and over time the more simple item of the thistle brooch emerged out of this tradition.\n\nThe thistle brooch as a simpler version of the penannular brooch, with less surface decoration, which gained popularity around 1100. The thistle is the national flower of Scotland and acts as an emblem. Today, thistle brooches are often made of silver and contain a thistle motif, and are not necessarily a penannular brooch.\nThe Luckenbooth brooch is a style of brooch that originated on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. It is a kind of annular brooch that is heart shaped. It often comes in the form of two hearts woven together, with more ornate brooches also containing a crown pattern. The name Luckenbooth comes from the locked booths along the royal mile that had a similar pattern. This style first gained popularity in the 17th century, and had a revival in the 19th century in the form of pebble jewellery. They were traditionally given as a token of love or as an engagement present.\nPebble jewellery, featuring the stones agate or \"Scotch Pebbles\", Cairngorm, jasper, jaspagate, and sometimes bloodstone, freshwater pearls, gold, silver and granite, is a style of jewellery that has a long history associated with Scotland. Pebble jewellery refers to a style rather than a specific item, with many examples of pebble brooches and bracelets, though other items such as pendants have also been known to be decorated in this style.\n\nThe materials traditionally used to create jewellery in Scotland are also found in the local area, for example the agate mined from volcanic rocks north of Dundee.\n\nThe most common forms of metal in Scottish jewellery are silver, enamel, gold, pewter. These are often the backing to a stone setting in the case of rings and brooches, but can also provide decoration through casting and other decorative methods. Gold can be found locally in Scotland around the areas of Lowther Hills, Wanlockhead and Leadhills. The first documentation of gold in the area is from the 16th century, and this gold was made into the Scottish Crown and supported a community of goldsmiths around the country who are still active today. There was even a short lived gold rush in the 1860s. Silver was also actively mined in Scotland, with over 5 individual sites that over time have had silver extracted from them.\n\nStones such as agate, cairngorm citrine, jasper, malachite and granite were mined in the hills of Scotland and were popular in jewellery. Agate was made popular in Scottish jewellery styles in the 19th century, popularised by Queen Victoria. These stones are often found on bracelets, pendants and brooches.\n\nSapphires, although rare in Scotland, can be mined from the Isle of Harris. Pearls are often common in jewellery in Scotland, with the addition of them to the Scottish Crown in the 16th century. They come from a pearl bearing mussel, half the population of which are native to Scotland.\n\nThroughout history, metalworkers did not only produce jewellery, but also work to produce handles and decorative cookware. Cold metalworking techniques can be used to make penannular brooches, beginning with wire and then flattening the ends to create the brooch shape.\n\nThe crafting of jewellery or fictional items that could have been embellished to create a form of jewellery has a history in Scotland at least dating back to at least 300BCE, with the emergence of the \"Celtic\" style of decoration. The Celtic style and the Pictish style are very similar and both have this influence in Scottish jewellery today. Pictish has been discovered through archaeological investigation since the 18th century, and is commonly made of silver. A sizeable example of a discovery of Pictish jewellery was found at the Gaulcross hoard in Aberdeenshire, with examples of fragments of silver bracelets brooches, and pendants from the post-Roman period. These finds contain examples of chain work, and ornate decoration on the fragments. They are now on display at the National Museum in Edinburgh. Other Pictish hoards have often found torcs, and different kinds of penannular brooches, some zoomorphic, though bronze brooches are more common than silver.\n\nIn the middle ages, ornate jewellery was a sign of a high class, lower class people tended to wear more simple items that were primarily functional and made of more simple materials such as copper or pewter, compared to richer materials such as silver or gold.\n\nDuring the 1800s, a boom in the production of Scottish style jewellery resulted due to the building of railways in Britain and increased access to travel. Scotland became a holiday destination, and jewellery was in demand as a souvenir. As a result, the styles of Scottish jewellery started to be produced in England, specifically Birmingham and Exeter.\n\nA resurgence of Celtic and medieval style Scottish jewellery occurred in the 19th century, as did the popularisation of agate pieces, also known as \"pebble jewellery\". During this period there was a rise in creation and wear of agate brooches and bracelets due to Queen Victoria's interest in the stone. The interest in agate re-emerged again in the 1970s. The Victoria and Albert Museum has many examples of Scottish jewellery from the later half of the 19th century, both pebble styles and celtic designs.\n\nThe modernist period of jewellery making began in Britain in the 1950s, inspired by the sleek, simple style of Scandinavian designs from earlier in the 20th century. According to the National Museum of Scotland \"British Modernist jewellery became defined by the use of textural, sculptural gold work, inspired by nature and often incorporating large gemstones\".\n\nToday, Scotland are offers a wide range of styles of jewellery, ranging from the traditional Celtic style, to vintage Victorian and Edwardian pieces, to contemporary art deco and art nouveau styles.\n\nThe tradition of jewellery making in Scotland continues today with many courses offered in Colleges around Scotland in various levels of difficulty in jewellery making.\n\nDespite the Honours of Scotland being often referred to as the \"crown jewels\", there are no pieces of pure jewellery in the usual sense in the set. It consists of the crown, the sceptre and the Sword of State. The crown is the only object of the three that is supposed to have been made in Scotland, it was originally dating from approximately 1503, but was remodelled due to damage in 1540 by the Edinburgh goldsmith John Mosman. Over six weeks, Mosman added 68 Scottish freshwater pearls, 41 ounces of gold, and 44 gemstones to the new crown, but also made use of the gold and jewels from the original state crown.\n\nThis section contains information on other famous pieces of jewellery that either originate from or are associated with Scotland.\n\nThe Stewart Jewels are items of jewellery that originate from the Stewart dynasty who ruled Scotland for generations and went on to rule England after the death of Elizabeth I. The set consists of three items, all of which are on display with the Honours at Edinburgh Castle: the St. Andrew Jewel, a collar of the Order of the Garter, and a ring with a ruby set into it.\n\nThe Lorne Jewels, part of the Secondary Honours of Scotland, were gifted to the nation in the 1930s by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyle. The jewels consist of a single necklace with a pendant and a locket that was made in London in the 1870s and was a gift from the 9th Duke of Argyll to his soon to be wife. It consists of a chain made of diamonds studded with pearls, the pendant has a pearl set in the centre which is surrounded by two rows of diamonds of different shapes. The locket hangs from the bottom of the pendant and is attached by 2 emeralds shaped into the likeness of bog myrtle. The locket itself is shaped like a pear and is encrusted with diamonds, with extra decoration in sapphires depicting the motto of the House of Lorne and the Galley of Lorne. This piece is also on display at Edinburgh Castle.\n\nThe two Mossman men, John and James, both were goldsmiths who worked in Edinburgh in the 16th century. Both served as court jewellers to the Stewart family during their Scottish rule. They are also known for owning the John Knox House in Edinburgh. The identities of the two men are often confused, with many sources being unclear on who is the father and who is the son.\n\nJohn Mossman was an Edinburgh based goldsmith who is most famous for remodelling the Scottish crown in 1540.\n\nJames Mossman was the son of John Mossman, and was the Court Jeweller, and was executed for his loyalty to Mary, Queen of Scots during the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1573, in which he played the part of defending the castle. He was hanged on 3 August 1573. He was the court jeweller for Mary of Guise, and reportedly produced pieces for both her and the royal family.\n\nAlthough Charles Rennie Mackintosh was not a jeweller himself, he made a significant contribution to influencing the style of jewellery through his work as a designer. Today, \"Charles Rennie Mackintosh\" jewellery is sold that are pieces made to replicate decorative work he did on furniture, buildings, and light fixtures.\n\n\n"}

In the final year of his master's program, Farthing won a scholarship to study at the British School in Rome for one year.\n\nSince his return from Italy in 1977, Farthing has had one-man shows in the UK, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the United States. Farthing's work featured in the 1989 São Paulo Biennale and that same year he served as the Artist in Residence at the Hayward Gallery in London. He also won prizes in the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition on eight separate occasions between 1976 and 1999.\n\nFarthing was elected as a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1998. Farthing's work is in the National Portrait Gallery (London) and he also showed at the Tate Britain in 2006 as part of a project called \"Drawing from Turner,\" that he designed and curated. Farthing also painted large murals for the Cleveland Browns Football Club in Cleveland, Ohio (2004) and Aston Villa Football Club in Birmingham, UK (2008).\n\nStephen Farthing's teaching career began at Canterbury College of Art (1977–1979) where he was a lecturer of painting. He went on to teach at the Royal College of Art (1980–1985) before becoming the Head of Painting and later the Head of Fine Art at West Surrey College of Art and Design (1985–1989). Farthing spent the next ten years at Oxford University serving as the Ruskin Master at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. He was also made a Professorial Fellow of Oxford's St Edmund Hall (1990–2000). Upon leaving the university in 2000, Farthing was made a professor emeritus of St Edmund Hall.\n\nFarthing moved to New York in 2000 to become the Executive Director of the New York Academy of Art and led the Academy until he became the Rootstein Hopkins Research Chair of Drawing at the University of the Arts London in 2004, a position he held until 2017.\n\nFarthing has published extensively. Most known for his authorship of \"1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die\" and \"501 Great Artists\". He also authored the Intelligent Person's Guide to Modern Art, published in 2000 in addition to numerous academic essays and journal articles.\n\nStephen Farthing continues to live and work in both the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nFarthing described his work in a 2005 interview, saying \"I have dined with the devil in terms of becoming a modern artist. I have taken hold of history, tried to understand it—and then used and abused it.\"\n\nFarthing's work reflects his education, personal experience and perspective on historical events that have captured his imagination. After spending a period of study at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris while a student at the Royal College of Art, Stephen Farthing inadvertently fell upon what one could later describe as a postmodernist relationship with history. In Paris, he painted an interpretation of Hyacinthe Rigaud's portrait of Louis XV that as a student won him a prize at the John Moores Exhibition in Liverpool, today this painting stands as an early example of British post modernist painting.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s whilst showing with Edward Totah in London, Farthing showed works that positioned Latin American vernacular culture within a modernist idiom and classicism within the vernacular.\n\nDuring the 1990s, he reinvented history painting as a viable contemporary narrative taking on subject matters as diverse as the Battle of Trafalgar, swagger portraiture, and the topographical mapping of cities. His most recent work makes explicit a theme that has consistently sat between Farthing and his audience, the \"narrative\" and \"text\".\n\nFarthing commented that his work is, \"not this thing about 'Oh, let's let the audience make up their mind what it is'…\" but about \"degrading it on purpose so it becomes not more ambiguous, but less what it was in the first place.\"\n\nToward the end of 2009, Farthing had his first one-person show at the Purdy Hicks Gallery in London where, for the first time, he showed the \"back-story\" paintings. The \"back-story\" paintings are a series of images painted with a text in reverse sitting on the picture plane between the audience and the image. The text tells us what is going on not in the picture but behind it, so compromising and at the same time informing the image with text. His technically very skilled paintings all seem to be grounded on one guiding principle - that what we see will always be always conditioned by what we know.\n\nIn November 2010, Farthing became the second living Royal Academician to be featured in the \"laboratory\" series of one man shows at the Royal Academy of Arts London. \"The Back Story,\" featured an epic 30 foot painting of the Atlantic ocean.\n\nFarthing's work as a painter sits midway between the conservative and the cutting edge between a classical and radical painting.\n\n\n"}

As such, \"The Magic Monastery\" can be read as part of a whole course of study.\n\n\"The Magic Monastery\" with the subtitle \"Analogical and Action Philosophy of the Middle East and Central Asia\", contains traditional teaching stories as well as pieces composed by Idries Shah. The author writes in the preface: \"It consists of a representative cross-section of Sufi teaching which constitutes a harmonized whole rather than a selection of typical extracts.\"\n\nIn the August 1972 edition of \"Encounter\" magazine, Doris Lessing described the work as \"a particularly and intriguingly informative\" \"textbook for students\".\n\nThe book was featured in \"The Observer Review\"'s Book of the Year on 17 December 1972, where it was described as \"remarkable for its precise response to the real and inner needs of the time.\"\n\nIn October 1972, writing in the journal \"Asian Affairs\", historian L.

He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... The Sufis transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces.\"\n\nNoted psychiatrist Arthur Deikman, in his book \"The Observing Self\" , also mentions tales found in \"The Magic Monastery\" as examples of stories that can indirectly communicate important teachings, for instance, by illustrating the difficulty in describing mystical perception to those who've never experienced it.\n\n"}

It was Debord's first feature-length film. It uses found footage and détournement in a radical Marxist critique of mass marketing and its role in the alienation of modern society.\n\nThe 88 minute film took a year to make and incorporates an apparent jumble of footage from feature films juxtaposed with still photographs, industrial films, early 1970s glossy 'lifestyle' TV ads, and news footage of unrest in the streets. The feature films include \"The Battleship Potemkin\", \"\", \"Chapaev\", \"The New Babylon\", \"The Shanghai Gesture\", \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\", \"Rio Grande\", \"They Died with Their Boots On\", \"Johnny Guitar\", and \"Mr. Arkadin\", as well as other Soviet films.\n\nThroughout the film, there are intertitles consisting of quotations from \"The Society of the Spectacle\", along with Debord (in voice-over) reading texts from Marx, Machiavelli, the 1968 Occupation Committee of the Sorbonne, Tocqueville, Émile Pouget, and Sergey Solovyov and others. Without citations, these quotes are hard to decipher, especially with the conflicting subtitles (which exist even in the French version): but that is part of Debord's goal to \"problematize reception\" (Greil and Sanborn) and force the viewer to be active. In addition, the words of some of the authors are détourned through deliberate misquoting.\n\nFootage of historical events is included, such as the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald (the assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963), the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the Paris riots in May 1968, along with clips of people such as Mao Zedong, Richard Nixon and the Spanish anarchist Durruti.\n\nIn 1984, Debord withdrew his films from circulation because of the negative press and the assassination of his friend and patron Gerard Lebovici. Since Debord's suicide in 1994, Debord's wife Alice Becker-Ho has been promoting Debord's film.

The three-day event was sponsored by the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war. The conference was organized by Elizabeth Simpson, an archaeologist and professor at the Bard Graduate Center.\n\nWorldwide interest in the subject was generated by announcements in 1991 of the location of objects confiscated by Soviet Trophy Brigades from German territory at the end of the war. The unification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were followed by a number of goodwill agreements between Germany and the countries of the former USSR, as well as the opening of official negotiations on repatriation. It was this spirit of openness and cooperation that made the New York symposium possible. This initial gathering of concerned parties would be followed by a series of conferences, initiatives, agreements, and repatriations that continue into the present.\n\nThe program featured 48 notable speakers—government officials, diplomats, journalists, art historians, archaeologists, lawyers, and independent researchers—from Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Australia, England, and the United States. The combined testimony laid bare another horrifying dimension to the anguish of human suffering wrought by the Second World War.\n\nThe symposium was the first to address the issue in a public forum, and led to numerous initiatives on provenance research by the governments involved as well as museums, libraries, and art dealers internationally. As a result, the art world was changed irrevocably. Acquisitions policies were revised and organizations restructured to facilitate the identification of artistic and cultural objects that had been stolen or transferred illegally during and after the war. Processes were established to allow families to claim their missing property; such claims have resulted in many works being restored to the heirs and descendants of the rightful owners. \n\nThe conference proceedings were published in an award-winning volume edited by Elizabeth Simpson (Harry N. Abrams, 1997). The book includes 17 treaties, conventions, and other official documents relating to the protection and return of cultural property. These begin with the \"Lieber Code\" of 1863 and the \"Hague Convention of 1907,\" and continue with the treaties following World War I, the \"Hague Convention and Protocol of 1954\" for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict, the \"1970 UNESCO Convention\" on the prevention of illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property, and the UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects of 1995.\n\nElizabeth Simpson and lawyer Jeanette Greenfield, author of \"The Return of Cultural Treasures\", provided introductory comments on the subject, along with Lynn Nicholas, author of \"The Rape of Europa\", who discussed the massive displacement of art and cultural property that occurred during World War II. Individual countries detailed the damage to their national patrimony, as well as losses suffered by individuals. A talk on Jewish ceremonial art and private property was given by Vivian Mann, then Chair of Judaica at The Jewish Museum, New York. These reports were followed by a series of contributions on laws, directives, and conventions in place at the beginning of World War II, directives in force in Germany during the war, and laws enacted by the Allies to counter German appropriations. These and all the conference presentations are published in the proceedings (see list of contributors below).\n\nA group of the so-called \"Monuments Men\" (which in fact included several women) detailed their firsthand accounts of the work of the art-specialist officers of the Western Allies. Members of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Section of the Office of Military Government, United States, recounted the discovery of looted art and stashed bullion in German mines, bunkers, castles, and churches, along with the redistribution and repatriation of these finds through the Munich and Wiesbaden Collecting Points.

Lane Faison (d. 2006), and Bernard Taper (d. 2016)—none survives today.\n\nOther repatriations occurred at the end of the war, effected by the US State Department, the USSR, and other countries. Case studies include fascinating discussions of the Quedlinburg Church Treasures, the Soviet Secret Repositories, and the \"Treasure of Priam,\" which was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann at Troy in 1873, shipped out of Turkey illegally by Schliemann, ended up in Berlin, transferred to Moscow by the Soviet Trophy Brigades after the fall of Berlin, held in secret in the Pushkin Museum, and finally brought out of the secret repository and exhibited in the museum in 1996. Despite claims to ownership of the Trojan treasures by Turkey, Germany, and Greece, the objects remain in Moscow with the issue unresolved.\n\nThe conference concluded with a series of presentations on current and proposed efforts to mitigate the losses suffered. Lyndel Prott, then Chief of the International Standards Section of the Cultural Heritage Division of UNESCO, offered a list of \"Principles for the Resolution of Disputes Concerning Cultural Heritage Displaced during the Second World War\":\n\n\nThe \"Spoils of War\" symposium was covered extensively in the international press, including articles carried by the Associated Press and in \"The New York Times\", \"New York Newsday\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Christian Science Monitor\", \"The Observer\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", \"The Art Newspaper\", \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\", \"Die Zeit\", and \"Pravda\". The \"Jewish Forward\" published a critique that appeared on the first day of the conference; at issue was whether or not the conference gave sufficient weight to Jewish wartime losses, since these losses were detailed within the greater context of the Second World War and the damages experienced by the peoples of the many nations involved.\n\nThis issue sparked a second conference in Washington, DC, in 1998. Sponsored by the United States Department of State and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the \"Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets\" assembled participants from the New York symposium along with others to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets. This resulted in a further set of \"Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art,\" outlined by organizer Stuart E. Eizenstat, as well as \"Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research.\"\n\nThe New York conference has remained influential, however, due to its broader scope—dealing as it did with losses that occurred throughout Europe, inflicted not only by the Germans but also by the Soviets and western Allies, and affecting all those peoples who suffered as a result of the Second World War. The volume of conference proceedings was reviewed widely by publications in the United States and Europe, as well as \"The Jerusalem Post\", \"Yeni Yüzyıl\", \"ITAR-TASS\", and others. As the only comprehensive treatment of the subject, it is cited frequently, considered one of the most important books on World War II and its aftermath—and the loss, reappearance, and recovery of cultural property relating to the war.\n\n\n"}

Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, Kenya and neighboring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter Edward Said Tingatinga.\nTingatinga is traditionally made on masonite, using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for a brilliant and highly saturated colors. Many elements of the style are related to requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to the Europeans and Americans (e.g., the big five and other wild fauna). In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of \"airport painting\". The drawings themselves can be described as both naïve and caricatural, and humor and sarcasm are often explicit.\n\nEdward Tingatinga began painting around 1968 in Tanzania (Dar es Salaam). He employed low cost materials such as masonite and bicycle paint and attracted the attention of tourists for their colorful, both naïve and surrealistic style. When Tingatinga died in 1972, his style was so popular that it had started a wide movement of imitators and followers, sometimes informally referred to as the \"Tingatinga school\".\n\nThe first generation of artists from the Tingatinga school basically reproduced the works of the school's founder. In the 1990s new trends emerged within the Tingatinga style, in response to the transformations that the Tanzanian society was undergoing after independence. New subjects related to the new urban and multi-ethnic society of Dar es Salaam (e.g., crowded and busy streets and squares) were introduced, together with occasional technical novelties (such as the use of perspective). One of the most well known second-generation Tingatinga painters is Edward Tingatinga's brother-in-law, Simon Mpata.\n\nBecause of his short artistic life, Tingatinga left only a relatively small number of paintings, which are sought-after by collectors. Today it is known that fakes were produced from all famous Tingatinga paintings like \"The lion\", \"Peacock on the Baobab Tree\", \"Antelope\", \"Leopard\", \"Buffalo\", or \"Monkey\".\n\nIt is controversial whether Tingatinga's style is completely original or a derivative of traditional forms of East Africa. In his seminal paper \"Tingatinga and His Followers\", Swedish critic Berit Sahlström claimed that Tingatinga was of Mozambican origin and thus suggested that his style might have connections with modern Mozambique. The claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent is nevertheless rejected by most scholars and by the Tingatinga Society. Art trader Yves Goscinny suggested that Edward Tingatinga might have been influenced by Congolese paintings that were sold in Dar es Salaam at his times. The source of this claim could be some articles by Merit Teisen, where she also claims that Tingatinga decorated two house walls for payment before he started painting on masonite boards.\n\nThe claim by Teisen about Tingatinga decorating house walls might also be interpreted as a clue of another origin of Tingatinga's paintings, namely the traditional hut wall decorations of Makua and Makonde people. These paintings were first witnessed by Karl Heule in 1906 and described in his book \"Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika\". Also ethnologist Jesper Kirknaes and Japanese painting curator Kenji Shiraishi, as well as modern travellers, have seen and documented these paintings in several locations of southern Tanzania, including Ngapa, a village where many relatives of Tingatinga's father still live today.\n\nJesper Kirknaes also documented those painting being done in Dar es Salaam by Makua and Makonde migrants. Shiraishi is one of the scholars who most firmly supported the theory that Tingatinga's art is connected to traditional Makua wall paintings. Among other considerations, Shiraishi observed that it is unlikely that a style emerged and spread so quickly over most East Africa without any connection to traditional art. He claimed that his studies provided evidence for this claim.\n\nIn 2010 Hanne Thorup interviewed Tingatinga student Omari Amonde, who confirmed that Tingatinga used to paint on hut walls as a young boy (around 12 years old).\n\nFurther elaborating on the Makua painting hypothesis, Shiraishi also suggested a connection between hut walls painting and traditional rock paintings, an art form that in Africa has continued past stone age to at least the 19th century. Based on this connection, Shiraishi concludes that Tingatinga art might be seen as the \"longest artist trend ever\".\n\nAfter Tingatinga's death, his direct 6 followers Ajaba Abdallah Mtalia, Adeusi Mandu, January Linda, Casper Tedo, Simon Mpata, and Omari Amonde tried to organize themselves. Relatives of Tingatinga also joined this group, which would be later called the \"Tingatinga (or Tinga Tinga) Partnership\". Not all of Tingatinga followers agreed to be in the partnership; some created a new group at Slipway. In 1990, the Tingatinga Partnership constituted itself into a society, renamed to Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society (TACS). While the TACS is usually recognized as the most authoritative representative of the Tingatinga heritage, only a small fraction of Tingatinga artists are directly linked to this society.\n\nThe Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society launched their own website on May 2018: www.tingatingaArt.com\n\nAlthough the internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artist George Lilanga was not a student of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists, and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974). This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of enamel paint and square hardboards. Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colors and its composition style, that shares the same horror vacui of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as Noel Kapanda and later Mchimbi Halfani, who collaborated with him. The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.\n\n"}

The Shakur Center's mission was to provide opportunities for young people through the arts, and offers programs such as drama, dance, and creative writing classes. The organization also ran a Performing Arts Day Camp for youth ages twelve to eighteen. \n\nThe center, located off of Memorial Drive was named in honor of the late American Hip Hop artist Tupac Amaru Shakur, and was founded by his mother Afeni Shakur.\n\nThe center was founded in 1997 by Tupac Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur in the interest of preserving her son's legacy. It is designed to bring quality arts training to young people including some students that face many social-economic issues such as poverty. Many students have enriched their artistic abilities through this center and some have even received part-time jobs. \n\nIn July 1999 the foundation began its first annual summer session of PA camps with twenty campers. The camp continued to grow throughout the years. On June 11, 2005 The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts Peace Garden and visitor centre was opened. The peace garden was designed as a tribute to Tupac Shakur as well as others who have died. In 2006 the music video for the single Pac's Life for the self-titled album was shot at the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts. Tupac's mother Afeni Shakur also went to Africa in 2006 and fostered a relationship between The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts and The Nelson Mendela foundation.\n\nAfter 2006 the foundation showed signs of growth as many additional programs were created such as after school programs, dance classes and cultural exchange programs. Fees for these program resemble prices similar to those of joining a local sports league. The foundation has also held Tupac birthday concert celebrations since 2009.\n\nThe foundation offered acting, after school and dancing classes. In addition, they offer yearly leadership and arts programs. They had also set up cross cultural exchanges with Japan and South Africa.\n\n"}
{"id": "11084385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11084385", "title": "Vanity gallery", "text": "Vanity gallery\n\nA vanity gallery is an art gallery that charges artists fees to exhibit their work and makes most of its money from artists rather than from sales to the public. Some vanity galleries charge a lump sum to arrange an exhibition, while others ask artists to pay regular membership fees and then promise to organise an exhibition with a certain period. There is debate as to whether galleries that ask artists to contribute to expenses, e.g. by arranging for announcements of the exhibition themselves, fall into the same category.\n\nVanity galleries are an offshoot of cooperative galleries (also called artist-run initiatives), galleries which are operated by artists who pool their resources to pay for exhibits and publicity. Unlike cooperative galleries, which carefully jury their members, vanity galleries will exhibit anyone who pays. In 1981, \"Village Voice\" reporter Lisa Gubernick posed as an artist and \"within 20 minutes\" of contacting the Keane Mason Woman Art Gallery was handed a contract for \"$720 for 16 feet of wall\". Occasionally a vanity gallery will appear to have a selection process. This is because \"if every participant is promised a one- or two-person show every two years, the number of artists on the membership roster cannot exceed the available time slots for shows.\"\n\nCommercial art galleries derive their profit from sales of artwork and therefore take great care to select art and artists that they believe will sell and will enhance their gallery's reputation. They spend time and money cultivating collectors. If the artwork sells, the gallery makes a profit, and the artist is then paid.\n\nVanity galleries have no incentive to sell art, as they have already been paid by the artist. Vanity galleries are not selective because they do not have to be. Many professional artists recommend that new artists avoid exhibiting work in them, primarily because professional critics and reviewers tend to avoid them.\n\n"}

{"id": "34563243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34563243", "title": "Women in early radio", "text": "Women in early radio\n\nWomen have been active participants in the development of radio (initially called \"wireless\") communications since its beginning. The age of radio communication began with the development of wireless telegraphy around 1900, in which Morse code could be transmitted over large distances using simple spark gap or carbon arc transmitting equipment, and various types of detectors for reception. Guglielmo Marconi achieved international fame in 1901 when he succeeded in sending a simple message in Morse code - the letter \"s\" - across the Atlantic from Cornwall in England to Newfoundland.\n\nWomen had worked as telegraph operators since the late 1840s, and it was not long before women telegraphers began to work as wireless operators as well. In early 1901, the announcement of the inauguration of a Hawaiian inter-island communications system noted that four of the fourteen operators were women. In 1906, Anna Nevins, who had worked as a telegrapher for Western Union, began work as a wireless operator for Lee de Forest's station \"NY\", located at 42 Broadway in New York City. She was later employed as a wireless operator at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.\n\nOne of the earliest applications of wireless telegraphy was enabling communication between ships at sea and land stations. While early ships' operators were mostly male, some women entered the field as well. The primary requirement was a knowledge of Morse code and equipment operation, which many female telegraph operators possessed. Perhaps the earliest woman to operate on shipboard was Medora Olive Newell, an experienced telegrapher who was a passenger on the Cunard liner Slavonia in 1904, when Hungarian members of the Hague Peace Commission wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary.\nMedora Olive Newell (1872 - December 31, 1946) began work as a telegraph operator in Durango, Iowa, in 1886 at the age of fourteen. In 1897, she moved to Chicago and became a commercial operator for the Postal Telegraph Company.\n\nNewell’s first-class operator pay enabled her to live a fairly affluent lifestyle; as \"Telegraph Age\" reported in 1909, “Miss Newell has been in the habit of spending her vacations abroad, and has always made these trips the occasion for investigating telegraph and railway management and operation in European countries.” On her return voyage from Europe in 1904, she found herself aboard the Cunard liner Slavonia together with members of the Hague Peace Commission, who were on their way to the United States to persuade President Theodore Roosevelt to call another international conference to continue the work begun at the Hague in 1899. The Hungarian members of the delegation wished to send a birthday greeting to Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary by wireless, but the ship’s wireless operator was unable to send the message. Newell, who, according to \"Telegraph Age\", “had a good working knowledge of wireless,” took her place at the key and soon had successfully transmitted the greeting. The grateful delegates thanked her for her assistance, and the secretary of the Hungarian parliament invited her to visit Hungary as the guest of the nation.\n\nIn the United States, the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 required US ships to be equipped with wireless equipment for the first time, and to have an operator on board who was capable of sending and receiving messages. The first woman to be officially employed as a shipboard wireless operator was Graynella Packer, a telegrapher from Jacksonville, Florida, who was employed as a wireless operator for the United Wireless Telegraph Company aboard the steamship Mohawk from November 1910 to April 1911. Packer started practicing telegraphy in order to send messages in code to her school friends as a young girl. She eventually took on telegraphy as a career because her eyes were not strong and 'handling a key is no strain on the sight'. She became manager of the Postal Telegraph office in Sanford, Florida, before hiring onto the Mohawk as the first woman wireless operator to serve aboard a steamship in a commercial capacity. After operating in full charge of the wireless, she eventually moved on to become an elected member of the Oklahoma State Bar Association from Oklahoma City in 1922.\n\nThe Radio Act of 1912 required radio operators in the U.S. to be licensed for the first time. The first woman to be licensed as a shipboard operator was Mabelle Kelso, who passed the operator's examination and received her operating license in January 1912. Mabelle Kelso was a native of Seattle, Washington, and had been previously employed as a stenographer. After passing a U.S. Navy Department examination, she was hired by the United Wireless Telegraph Company and assigned a position as an operator on board the SS Mariposa, a steamship which travelled between Seattle and Alaska. Her appointment as shipboard operator generated some opposition from members of Congress who wished to bar women from holding such positions on seagoing ships; however, she received support from the Pacific Coast Wireless Inspector of United Wireless, who stated that \"he knew of no law which would bar Miss Kelso from her position.\" By 1913, over 30 women had been licensed as shipboard operators.\n\nAmateur radio became a popular hobby in the early years of the twentieth century, and many hobbyists built their own transmitting and receiving equipment. Some of the earliest women radio amateurs, called \"YLs,\" were Mrs. M.J. Glass of San Jose, California, who operated as station FNFN in 1910, and Olive Heartburg, who operated as station OHK in New York City in the same year. M.S. Colville, of Bowmanville, Ontario, who began to operate as XDD in 1914, was one of the earliest Canadian YLs.\n\nThe Radio Act of 1912 also required radio amateurs to be licensed. Gladys Kathleen Parkin (September 27, 1901 - August 3, 1990) was one of the earliest women to obtain a government issued license. In 1916, while a fifteen-year-old high school student at the Dominican College in San Rafael, California, she obtained a first class commercial radio operators' license with the call sign 6SO.\nParkin was quoted in an article titled \"The Feminine Wireless Amateur,\" which appeared in the October 1916 issue of \"The Electrical Experimenter\":\n\n\"With reference to my ideas about the wireless profession as a vocation or worthwhile hobby for women, I think wireless telegraphy is a most fascinating study, and one which could very easily be taken up by girls, as it is a great deal more interesting than the telephone and telegraph work, in which so many girls are now employed. I am only fifteen, and I learned the code several years ago, by practising a few minutes each day on a buzzer. I studied a good deal and I found it quite easy to obtain my first grade commercial government license, last April. It seems to me that every one should at least know the code, as cases might easily arise of a ship in distress, where the operators might be incapacitated, and a knowledge of the code might be the means of saving the ship and the lives of the passengers. But the interest in wireless does not end in the knowledge of the code. You can gradually learn to make all your own instruments, as I have done with my 1/4 kilowatt set. There is always more ahead of you, as wireless telegraphy is still in its infancy.\" Use of the term \"YL\" to refer to female radio amateurs was formally adopted by the American Radio Relay League in 1920.\n\nAs the U.S. prepared to enter World War I, the Navy Department began a program to train women as radio operators who could be called into action in the event of war. The Girls' Division of the United States Junior Naval Reserve established training camps at the Martha Washington Post, in Edgewater, New Jersey, and the Betsy Ross Post, at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where young women were trained to become wireless operators.\n\nIn January 1917, the National League for Women's Service (NLWS) was created from the Woman’s Department of the National Civic Federation readiness and relief activities and modelled on similar groups in Britain and elsewhere. The League was divided into thirteen national divisions, one of which was \"Wireless and Telegraphy\". When the US entered the war in April 1917, the NLWS established training program for female wireless operators at Hunter College in New York. Although they were not strictly government employees, these female wireless operators were allowed to transmit in order to help the war effort.\n\nBy 1920, the technology had evolved to the point where voice and music could be transmitted as well as Morse telegraphy, and several radio stations began to broadcast regular programs of music and news. In 1920, Eunice Randall (1898-1982), an employee of The American Radio and Research Company, or AMRAD, became an engineer and announcer for the AMRAD radio station, 1XE. Her interest in radio had begun at the age of nineteen, when she built her own amateur radio equipment and operated with the call sign 1CDP. In addition to her technical duties at 1XE, which included repairing equipment and occasionally climbing the transmitting tower, she read stories for children as \"The Story Lady,\" and gave the police report over the air.\n\nIn 1922, the AMRAD station changed its call sign to WGI. Eunice Randall remained as engineer and assistant chief announcer until 1925, when the company went bankrupt and the station was taken off the air. However, she continued to work as an engineer and draftsman, and resumed her amateur radio activities under the call sign of W1MPP.\n\nFlorence Violet Mackenzie OBE (1890–1982), Australia's first female electrical engineer, founded the Women's Emergency Signalling Corps (WESC) and trained thousands of service personnel in her Sydney signal instruction school. She later corresponded with Albert Einstein.\n\n"}
{"id": "44652340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44652340", "title": "Wooden tomb model", "text": "Wooden tomb model\n\nWooden tomb models were an Egyptian funerary custom throughout the Middle Kingdom in which wooden figurines and sets were constructed to be placed in the tombs of Egyptian royalty. These wooden models represented the work of servants, farmers, other skilled craftsman, armies, and religious rituals. The different types of models served as symbols and were believed to perform various functions for the deceased.\n\nDuring the Protodynastic and Early Dynastic period (3200–2686 BC) the funerary sacrifice of servants was practiced to provide for the deceased royal retainers to accompany him into the afterlife. At Abydos and Saqqara (3100–2890 BC), the tombs of 1st-Dynasty rulers suggest this practice with shared-roof subsidiary burials surrounding the tombs. The practice of human sacrifice was later superseded by the wooden model representations of servants instead.\n\nEgyptian royalty likely felt a pressing need for servants in the afterlife, having been waited on hand and foot by them during their entire lifetime. This seems to have led to the diverse variety of models found in tombs to perform various functions. Originally royal tombs were provided only one model servant, but as time went on the number of wooden models increased, some containing 365, one for every day of the year. Additional scenery, animals, and objects also began to be provided. As the practice of wooden models moved into the New Kingdom, numbers continued to increase. More than 700 figurines are said to have populated the tomb of Sety I (1294–1279 BC).\n\nAs the practice of funerary models increased in popularity, especially during the Middle Kingdom, so did the variety of the models and their functions. In addition to models of servants, models of bakeries, farms, granaries, factories, military, and religious worship complete with workers, tools, weapons, and animals were made. Each model had a different purpose in the belief of the Egyptians and was provided to perform its specific function. Model houses were included to ensure existence in the afterlife. Farmers, artisans, and craftsmen models were said to increase the material wealth of the individual. If the tombs resident needed to perform a specific task in the afterlife, a wooden model would be included to perform that task for him. Funerary boat models reflected the mythological beliefs of the Egyptians, that they would help to further the deceased's progression in the underworld. The best known wooden models come from the tomb of the chancellor Meketre, over half of which are funerary boats.\n\nDuring the New Kingdom and into the Late Period (747–332 BC), the wooden models were developed into what are known as Shabti or Ushabti. Shabti, similarly, were funerary models provided in the tombs of Egyptian royalty to spare the tomb owner from labor in the next life. Shabtis were inscribed with chapter 6 of The Book of the Dead providing them with instructions that enabled them to perform their labors. \"Overseer\" models were also provided to ensure the shabti performed their labors. Shabtis were composed of wood, clay, wax, stone, bronze, faience, or glass. The practice died out during the Ptolemaic period (332–30 BC).\n"}
