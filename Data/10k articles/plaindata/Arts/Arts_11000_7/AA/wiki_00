{"id": "44661257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44661257", "title": "Art market", "text": "Art market\n\nThe art market is represented by a marketplace of buyers and sellers trading in the commodities, services, and works-of-art commonly associated with the various arts. The art market is also concerned with the production of new art which enters the art market. The art market is an example of one type of marketplace, among many different types of markets which occur in economics. In particular, the art market has many similarities with other marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet, as well as significant distinguishing factors indicative of its differences from other types of markets in economics.\n\nThe art market operates in an economic model that considers more than supply and demand: it is a hybrid type of prediction market where art is bought and sold for values based not only on a work's perceived cultural value, but on both its past monetary value as well as its predicted future value. The market has been described as one where producers don't make work primarily for sale, where buyers often have no idea of the value of what they buy, and where middlemen routinely claim reimbursement for sales of things they have never seen to buyers they have never dealt with. Moreover, the market is not transparent; private sales data is not systematically available and private sales represent about half of market transactions.\n\nUnlike the volumes in the securities market where millions of people and firms participate in buying and selling financial interests, or the commodities market where measures of raw or primary products are exchanged using standardized contracts, art market activity largely follows the demands of a more limited array of private collectors, museums, and large corporate interests as the principal market participants. Corporate collectors, however, can have a disparately large market impact, for instance, \"Spear's\" reported in 2015 that British Rail began investing in art for its pension fund beginning in 1974 (prior to privatization), spending about £40M or approximately 3% of its funds on art, before selling those assets between 1987–1999. British Rail's efforts realized profits, particularly due to the Impressionist portfolio, but the collection was liquidated because it came to be seen as an illegitimate investment area, particularly as alternative investments became available. Also, because original artworks are not fungible like stocks, they have valuation challenges not similarly affecting securities, with dynamics of what Karpik calls singularities.\n\nThus, because the art market's participants are far more limited in number than the securities or commodities markets, because artworks are not fungible, and because art valuation relies to a great extent on the advice and enthusiasm of a variety of specialized market analysts, these limitations each in turn dictate the size of the market and increase the risk that some items may be over or undervalued.\n\nThe art market moves in cycles with activity generally peaking in the spring and autumn when the major auction houses traditionally schedule auctions, and results in the market being seasonal rather than ongoing. While private sales take place all year, those sales are often not publicized as auctions are and thus do not affect the market until they become known.\n\nArt valuations made for an autumn auction may be unrealistic for the following spring auction season because fortunes in the financial markets during one season can affect the art market in the following season, and equity markets do significantly impact the art market. Volatility in the financial markets often causes volatility in the art market as happened in the contraction of the art market during the 2008-2009 recession when sales at Sotheby's, Christie's, and Phillips de Pury & Company were less than half the previous year: November 2008, $803.3 million compared to November 2007, $1.75 billion; and between 2000 and 2003 when the annual volume of art works sold at auction dropped 36%. In other instances, the art market can fare reasonably well despite volatility in the stock market such as happened from January 1997 through May 2004 when the average quarterly fluctuation in the Artprice Global Index was two to three times smaller than the same statistic for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.\n\nAs art market participants' fortunes wax and wane in the financial markets, buying power evolves and affects participants' ability to afford highly valued works, resulting in new buyers and sellers entering, leaving, or re-entering the market, and an artwork sold to offset losses in the financial market might be sold for substantially more or substantially less than its last at auction. In the late 1980s during the stock-market boom, the art market expanded in turn with prices soaring to new heights, and investment firms took a greater interest in the art market and began to study it in-depth. Concurrently, the previously non-transparent art market became more accessible via the increasing availability of indices and online data although researchers discovered biased price estimates in the auction houses.\n\nArt sometimes has transient fashionability that also can affect its value: what sells well for a time may be supplanted in the market by new styles and ideas in short order. For instance, in the spring of 2008 a collector offered over $80 million for Jeff Koons' stainless-steel \"Rabbit\", and yet a year later, of four works in the fall auctions at Christie's and Sotheby's in New York, only two of his pieces sold well and one failed to sell entirely. In 2011, Christie's sold Koons' \"Balloon Flower\" sculpture for $16.9 million.\n\nThe art market as a whole is affected by its two main parts: the primary art market, where new art comes to the market for the first time, and the secondary market, for existing art that has been sold at least once before. Once a work is sold on the primary market it enters the secondary market, and the prices for which it sold in the primary market have a direct bearing on the work's value in the secondary market. Supply and demand affect the secondary market more than the primary market because works new to the market, mainly contemporary art, have no market history for predictive analysis and thus valuation of such work is more difficult, and more speculative. Gallery, dealer, consultant, and agent promotion as well as collectors acting as alpha consumers (trend-setters) are the forces at work in valuing primary market works.\n\nAs with blue-chip stocks, works by \"blue-chip\" or well-known artists are generally valued more highly than works by unknown artists since it is hard to predict how an unknown artist's work will sell, or whether it will sell at all. High barriers to market entry for artists create scarcity in the supply and demand portion of the market, in turn driving up prices and raising questions of efficiency. While a high market entry barrier may result in having a smaller pool of artwork producers in the auction-level portion of the market, and in greater market predictability by virtue of that smaller pool and thus more reliable valuation measures, its axiomatic effect is of lesser artistic diversity negatively impacting the size of the buyer pool. For this reason, gallerists and art dealers consider what types of works are currently in vogue before deciding to represent a new artist and are highly selective in those choices in order to maintain a level of quality that is saleable. All these concerns are in play when gallerists set prices for emerging artists at a much lower level than for established artists.\n\nWith the 2007–2012 global financial crisis, the art market faced criticism for its lack of transparency, its Byzantine valuation methods, and a perceived lack of ethical behavior enabled by structural inadequacies in the market itself. In response, a 2009 debate occurred between valuation-setting members of the art market on the proposition that \"the art market is less ethical than the stock market\". At the end of the debate the audience determined that those debating in agreement with the proposition won the debate. Of particular note in the debate was the identification of \"chandelier bidding\" as a practice perceived as ethically questionable. The debaters described \"chandelier bidding\" as bids from the chandelier, or bids from an unknown source, meaning both the bidding by the auction houses on behalf of the sellers whose items the houses are auctioning (a conflict of interest), and bidding by unidentified bidders having no intention of buying but bidding in order to drive prices up, all practiced because the auction houses keep secret from bidders a seller's reserve price.\n\nIn 2011, also in response to criticism on the lack of market transparency and counterarguments that more transparency would ruin the market, \"The Art Newspaper\" in association with the Art Dealers Association of America convened an Art Industry Summit panel discussion between major art market decision makers, where panelists discussed whether there was a need for more transparency. The panelists argued over whether auction houses have built-in conflicts of interest by representing sellers with secret reserves, while at the same time representing to buyers initial valuations on those works at auction time. The debate also included the issue of first and third-party guaranteed bids, and whether sellers' reserve prices should be disclosed so that participants no longer bid on an object they have no chance of buying. In response to criticisms regarding chandelier bidding and unidentified third-party guaranteed bids, Christie's International chairman Edward Dolman countered that, without a secret reserve, illegal cartels of bidders would know in advance information that could facilitate their manipulation of the market and corruption of final valuation by selling price at auction.\n\nWith the art market's weaknesses (especially lack of transparency and conflicts of interests) becoming better known, serious external conversations about market regulation have begun among major market players; for example, the \"Financial Times\" noted that in early 2015, participants at the January World Economic Forum meeting attended a lunch seminar where the speaker warned that the global art market needs to be regulated because of systemic weaknesses which enable inside information trading, tax evasion, and money laundering.\n\nIn terms of academic research, there is work on the opacity of price formation in finance and economics.\n\nThe late 1980s were a boom period for art auction houses. However, in early 1990, the market collapsed. The US overtook the EU as the world's largest art market with a global share of 47 per cent by 2001. Ranking second, the UK's world market share hovers around 25 per cent. In continental Europe, France was the market leader while in Asia, Hong Kong continues its dominance. France’s share of the art market has been progressively eroded since the 1950s, when it was the dominant location and sales at Drouot surpassed those of Sotheby’s and Christie’s combined. In 2004, the global fine art market turnover was estimated at almost billion. Art auction sales reached a record billion in 2007, fueled by speculative bidding for artists such as Damien Hirst, Jeff Koons, and Richard Prince. The recent rise of the Chinese art market, both in terms of the size of its domestic sales and the international significance of its buyers, has, combined with a rich cultural heritage of art and antiques, produced a huge domestic market and ended the duopoly held by London and New York for over 50 years.\n\nChristie's and Sotheby's are the leading auction venues. In 2002, LVMH acquired Swiss art advisory firm de Pury & Luxembourg and merged it with Phillips to form Phillips de Pury & Company, with the aim of breaking the duopoly at the top of the market.\n\nFine art auctions are generally held separately for Impressionist and Modern art as well as for Post-war and Contemporary Art. Pablo Picasso's works remain the most coveted lot as of 2004. In 2008 just over million of art by Damien Hirst was sold at auction, a world record for a living artist; however in 2009, Hirst’s annual auction sales had shrunk by 93%.\n\n\"Estimates\" often reflect the consignor's ambitions as much as the auction specialist's considered opinion. They do not reflect commissions. To secure consignments, auction houses concede high estimates to suit the requirements of art owners. Before an auction, interested buyers typically turn for advice to the auction house specialist who quotes the estimate and often recommends going beyond in order to secure the item.\n\nAuction houses operate contractually on behalf of sellers of goods, charging sellers a fixed commission (fee) amounting to a percentage of the “hammer price” for which a lot is sold. Christie's published its commissions in September 1995, with its fees ranging from 20% on the least expensive lots to 2% on lots sold for over m; Sotheby's followed suit. For Phillips de Pury & Company, final prices include commission of 25% of the first 20% of the next to million, and 12% of the rest, with estimates not reflecting commissions.\nObjects sold are also subject to a further fee called the \"buyer's premium\", 15% being typical, with the term implying that by virtue of selling an object, the auction house performs a service for the buyer subject to remuneration. Thus, both the seller and the buyer of an object or lot sold by the major auction houses pay a fee. First implemented in 1975 by Christie's, the assessment of a buyer's premium is one of several auction-house practices to which art dealers object.\n\nBeginning in 2014, Christie's charged 2 percent of the hammer price of a work that meets or exceeds its high estimate. The fee does not apply to online only sales.\n\nAn auction house may offer a guaranteed selling price, or \"guaranteed minimum\", a practice designed to give sellers confidence to consign works and to give potential bidders reassurance that there are others willing to buy an item. Auction houses have offered guarantees since the early 1970s to encourage collectors to sell their artworks: \"The Art Newspaper\" reported that guarantees were first introduced in 1971 at Sotheby’s, when 47 Kandinskys and other works from the Guggenheim Museum were offered with a guaranteed minimum; similar arrangements followed in 1972 and 1973 for the Ritter and Scull collections. A guaranteed amount is generally close to the lower estimate, with the seller and the auction house sharing any amount exceeding the guaranteed minimum. In autumn 2008 when the market turned sour, Christie's and Sotheby's had to pay out at least million on works for which they guaranteed a minimum price but which failed to sell. In order to reduce their exposure to such losses, boost the market, and reduce volatility, the main auction houses now prefer that third parties take on this financial risk via \"third-party guarantees\" or \"irrevocable bids\": using this practice the auction houses sell a work to a third party for a minimum price prior to the auction and this selling price then becomes the “reserve” below which the artwork will not be sold. If bidding for specified works stops at the minimum price, which remains undisclosed, the \"third party\" acquires the lot; if bidding exceeds the reserve, the third party splits any profit from its sale with the consignor and with the auction house, the percentage going to each party varying with the deal. These proportions, never disclosed to the public, are negotiated before an auction and specified in the contract signed by the auction house and the third party.\n\nIn May 1999, Teo Spiller sold a web art project Megatronix to Ljubljana Municipal Museum, which was by the New York Times announced as the first sell of an Internet art net.art.\n\nIn 2003, Sotheby's abandoned its partnership with eBay after it lost millions through its various attempts to sell fine art over the internet.\nThe art market can also be used to understand what “counts” as part of art history. Art dealers and auctioneers organize material for distribution to collectors. Two of the largest, and oldest, art auction houses are Sotheby's and Christie's, and each hold frequent sales of great antiquities and art objects.\n\nIn addition to upstanding practices, a black market exists for great art, which is closely tied to art theft and art forgery. No auction houses or dealers admit openly to participating in the black market because of its illegality, but exposés suggest widespread problems in the field. Because demand for art objects is high, and security in many parts of the world is low, a thriving trade in illicit antiquities acquired through looting also exists. Although the art community nearly universally condemns looting because it results in destruction of archeological sites, looted art paradoxically remains omnipresent. Warfare is correlated with such looting, as is demonstrated by the recent archaeological looting in Iraq.\n\n\n"}

Born in London and brought up in Düsseldorf, Germany and Surrey, Mulligan developed an interest in acting as a child and was the student head of the drama department at Woldingham School. She made her professional acting debut on stage in the Kevin Elyot play \"Forty Winks\" at the Royal Court Theatre in 2004. Her film debut was in the role of Kitty Bennet in \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005), followed by supporting roles in numerous television series, including \"Bleak House\" (2005), \"The Amazing Mrs Pritchard\" (2006), and \"Doctor Who\" (2007). She made her Broadway debut in \"The Seagull\" in 2008 to critical acclaim, and her West End performance garnered her an Ian Charleson Commendation Award.\n\nMulligan's breakthrough performance was as Jenny Mellor in the coming-of-age drama \"An Education\" (2009), for which she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her leading role in the dystopian romantic-drama \"Never Let Me Go\" (2010) earned her a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film, and she garnered further acclaim for her supporting performances in the action film \"Drive\" (2011), for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and the drama \"Shame\" (2011). Her appearances in \"The Great Gatsby\" (2013), \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" (2013), \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (2015), and \"Suffragette\" (2015) earned her further praise and recognition. In 2015, she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in the Broadway revival of David Hare's \"Skylight\". In 2017, she starred in the critically acclaimed period drama film \"Mudbound\", and the following year starred in the thriller series \"Collateral\".\n\nApart from her acting career, Mulligan is noted for her philanthropic efforts, and has been an ambassador for Alzheimer's Society since 2012, and an ambassador for War Child since 2014. She has been married to English singer-songwriter Marcus Mumford since 2012, with whom she has two children.\n\nMulligan was born in Westminster, London, the daughter of Nano (née Booth) and Stephen Mulligan. Her father is of Irish descent and was originally from Liverpool. Her mother is from Llandeilo, Wales. Her mother is a university lecturer and her father is a hotel manager. Her parents met while they were both working in a hotel in their twenties. When she was three years old, her family moved to Germany when her father was hired to manage a hotel there. While living in Germany, Mulligan and her brother attended the International School of Düsseldorf. When she was eight, she and her family moved back to England. As a teenager, she was educated at Woldingham School in Surrey.\n\nHer interest in acting sparked from watching her brother perform in a school production of \"The King and I\" when she was six. During rehearsals, she pleaded with his teachers to let her be in the play. They let her join the chorus. While enrolled in Woldingham School as a teen, she was heavily involved in theatre. She was the student head of the drama department there, performing in plays and musicals, conducting workshops with younger students, and helping put on productions. When she was 16, she attended a production of \"Henry V\" starring Kenneth Branagh. His performance emboldened her and reinforced her belief that she wanted to pursue a career in acting. She wrote a letter to Branagh asking him for advice. \"I explained that my parents didn't want me to act, but that I felt it was my vocation in life,\" she said. Branagh's sister replied: \"Kenneth says that if you feel such a strong need to be an actress, you must be an actress.\"\n\nMulligan's parents disapproved of her acting ambitions and wished for her to attend a university like her brother. At age 17, she applied to three London drama schools, instead of the universities that she was expected to submit an application to, but did not receive a subsequent offer. During her final year at Woldingham School, actor/screenwriter Julian Fellowes delivered a lecture at the school on the production of the film \"Gosford Park\". Mulligan briefly talked to him after the lecture and asked him for advice on an acting career. However, Fellowes dissuaded her from the profession and suggested that she \"marry a lawyer\" instead. Undeterred, she later sent Fellowes a letter in which she stated that she was serious about acting and that the vocation was her purpose in life. Several weeks later, Fellowes's wife Emma invited her to a dinner for young, aspiring actors that she and her husband were hosting to offer advice. The event facilitated an introduction between Mulligan and a casting assistant that led to an audition for a role in \"Pride and Prejudice\". She auditioned on three occasions and was eventually given the role of Kitty Bennet. During her late teens and early twenties, she worked as a pub barmaid and an errand-runner for Ealing Studios in between acting jobs.\n\nIn 2004, at the age of 19, Mulligan began her acting on stage in the play \"Forty Winks\" at the Royal Court Theatre in London. She made her film debut the following year in \"Pride & Prejudice\", the 2005 film adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, portraying Kitty Bennet. Later that year, she auditioned for and won the role of orphan Ada Clare in the BAFTA award-winning BBC adaption of Charles Dickens' \"Bleak House\", her television debut. Among her 2007 projects were \"My Boy Jack\", starring Daniel Radcliffe, that features her in a supporting role, and \"Northanger Abbey\". She identified with her role Elsie, the daughter of writer Rudyard Kipling, who vociferously opposes her brother going to war. She earned a Constellation Award for playing the main character Sally Sparrow in the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Blink\". She rounded out 2007 by appearing in an acclaimed revival of \"The Seagull\", in which she played Nina to Kristin Scott Thomas's Arkadina and Chiwetel Ejiofor's Trigorin. \"The Daily Telegraph\" said her performance was \"quite extraordinarily radiating'\" and \"The Observer\" called her \"almost unbearably affecting.\" While in the middle of the production, she had to have an appendectomy, preventing her from being able to perform for a week. For her debut Broadway performance in the 2008 American transfer of \"The Seagull\", she was nominated for a Drama Desk Award, but lost to Angela Lansbury.\n\nHer big breakthrough came when, at 22, she was cast in her first leading role as Jenny in the 2009 independent film \"An Education\", directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig and written by Nick Hornby. Over a hundred actresses auditioned for the part, but Mulligan's audition impressed Scherfig the most. The film and her performance received rave reviews, and she was nominated for an Academy Award, Screen Actors Guild, Golden Globe, and won a BAFTA Award. Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" and Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" both compared her performance to that of Audrey Hepburn. \"Rolling Stone\"'s Peter Travers described her as having given a \"sensational, starmaking performance,\" while Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" felt that Mulligan had one of the year's best performances, and Toby Young of \"The Times\" felt she anchored the film. Writing in \"The Guardian\", Peter Bradshaw concluded that she gave a \"wonderful performance.\" Mulligan was a recipient of the Shooting Stars Award from the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival and received a BAFTA Rising Star Award nomination, which is voted on by the British public.\n\nMulligan next starred in independent film \"The Greatest\" (2009) as the pregnant girlfriend of a boy who dies. Her involvement with the project helped it \"tremendously\", according to the director. After being selected to join The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, she won a British Independent Award for \"Never Let Me Go\", an adaption of the 2005 Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, in which she starred and narrated. It was released in September 2010, competing against her other project, the Oliver Stone-directed film \"\". Screened out of competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, it was her first major studio project. Later that year she also provided vocals for the song \"Write About Love\" by Belle & Sebastian.\n\nShe returned to the stage in the Atlantic Theater Company's off-Broadway play adaptation of Ingmar Bergman's \"Through a Glass, Darkly\", from 13 May – 3 July 2011. Mulligan played the central character, a mentally unstable woman, and received glowing praise from reviewers. Ben Brantley, theater critic for \"The New York Times\", wrote that Mulligan's performance was \"acting of the highest order\"; he also described her as \"extraordinary\" and \"one of the finest actresses of her generation.\",\n\nMulligan co-starred in the critically acclaimed 2011 neo-noir thriller \"Drive\", directed by Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. She was nominated for her second BAFTA award—Best Supporting Actress—for the film. \"Drive\" garnered a total of 4 BAFTA award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. She began filming Steve McQueen's sex-addiction drama \"Shame\" alongside Michael Fassbender in New York in January 2011. \"Drive\" debuted at 2011 Cannes Film Festival and \"Shame\" debuted at 2011 Venice Film Festival, both to good reviews. Of her performance in \"Shame\", \"Rolling Stone\" film critic Peter Travers wrote, \"Mulligan is in every way sensational.\"\n\nShe starred as Daisy Buchanan, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, in \"The Great Gatsby\", which was released in May 2013. Mulligan auditioned for the role of Daisy in late 2010. While attending a \"Vogue\" fashion dinner in New York City in November, Baz Luhrmann’s wife, Catherine Martin, told her she had the part. In May 2012, she was a co-chair, alongside Anna Wintour, for the Gatsby-themed 2012 Met Ball Gala.\n\nShe starred in the film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" with Tom Sturridge, Matthias Schoenaerts, and Michael Sheen for director Thomas Vinterberg and Fox Searchlight.\nShe starred in the June 2014 revival of the play \"Skylight\" with Bill Nighy and Matthew Beard, directed by Stephen Daldry, at Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End. It won the 2014 Evening Standard Theatre Award for Revival of the Year and was nominated for the 2014 Olivier Award for Best Revival. She returned to Broadway when Skylight transferred in April 2015. Her performance as Kyra Hollis was received with critical acclaim and she has received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play.\n\nShe starred in \"Suffragette\" for director Sarah Gavron and screenwriter Abi Morgan, released in October 2015.\nIn September 2016, it was announced that she would star opposite Jake Gyllenhaal in the independent film \"Wildlife\", the adaptation of a Richard Ford novel of the same name. The film would be directed by Paul Dano with a screenplay written by Dano and Zoe Kazan.\nIn November 2017, Mulligan was cast as Gloria Steinem in \"An Uncivil War\"; the project reunited her with Mudbound director Dee Rees.\nMulligan's steely performance as a detective inspector in Collateral, a BBC Two limited series, received plaudits from American and British critics, though the series itself garnered mixed reviews. Mulligan praised showrunner Sir David Hare for seamlessly accommodating her pregnancy into the script.\n\nMulligan is married to Marcus Mumford, the lead singer of Mumford & Sons. They were childhood pen pals who lost touch and reconnected as adults. A few weeks after wrapping production on the film \"Inside Llewyn Davis\", in which they were both involved, they married on 21 April 2012. They have a daughter, Evelyn Grace, born in September 2015, and a son, Wilfred, born in August 2017.\n\nShe has an older brother, Owain, who was formerly a Captain in the British Army. He served in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAside from acting, Mulligan was among the actresses who took part in the Safe Project—each was photographed in the place she feels safest—for a 2010 series to raise awareness of sex trafficking. She donated the Vionnet gown she wore at the 2010 BAFTAs to the Curiosity Shop, which sells its donations to raise money for charity.\n\nMulligan became the ambassador of the Alzheimer's Society in 2012, with the goal of raising awareness and research funding for Alzheimers and dementia. Her grandmother lives with Alzheimer's disease and no longer recognises her. She helped host and participated in the 2012 Alzheimer's Society \"Memory Walk\" and was one of the sponsored Alzheimer's Society runners in the 2013 Nike \"Run to the Beat\" half-marathon in London.\n\nIn 2014, Mulligan became an ambassador for the charity War Child; in 2014 she visited the Democratic Republic of Congo in this role.\n\n\n"}

The belief that a dream will foretell a baby's birth originates from Ancient India and is found in some Asian countries.\n\nAncient India believes that conception dream predicts the child character. Maya (mother of the Buddha) dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side.\n\nIn Jainism dreams are connected with the births of Tirthankaras and the other prominent people including \"chakravarti\", \"Balabhadra\"s and \"Vāsudevas\". They are 63 in total and called \"Shalakapurusha\". Their mothers see a certain number of dreams on conception of their soul in womb. They are described in the great detail in Kalpasutra. 12th century Jain monk Hemchandracharya described and interpreted them in detail in \"Trishashthishalakapurush\". \"Avashyak-niryukti\", an early verse-commentary in Prakrit, explains relation of names of some Tirthankaras and these dreams.\n\nRathore ruler Simhaji's queen dreamt 3 lions before birth of his 3 son. Ramakrishna parents experienced supernatural incidents and visions before his birth. In Gaya his father Khudiram had a dream in which Lord Gadadhara (a form of Vishnu), said that he would be born as his son. Chandramani Devi is said to have had a vision of light entering her womb from Shiva's temple. Nahusha mother Indumati had conception dream. According to Dashakumaracharita Queen vasumati conceiving her first son hamsavahana, dreams that she has bathed in the water of all pilgrimages.while conceiving her second so Rajavahana she dreams that she swallowed the orb of universe.\n\nIn Korea conception dreams are known as 태몽(\"taemong\"). Many women in Korean culture report having such dreams themselves. Popular topics of the dreams include fruit (such apples, persimmons, cherries, chestnuts), animals (tigers, snakes, goldfish), nature (rivers, rainbows), children and jewels. The dreamer might eat or take fruits, embrace animals, or interact with nature. The topic is believed to influence the gender or the future of the baby; for example, fruits are seen as a sign for a baby girl.\n\nThe person having the dream can be the mother herself, but close family members such as her mother or the husband can also have conception dreams instead of the mother.\n\nDreams are often considered to be omens, and sometimes people will \"buy\" dreams from friends, if they feel it is a good omen or a good conception dream.\n\nAccounts of conception dreams can be found in numerous old histories. One example is the conception dream of Kim Yushin, from the 6th century CE, documented in the Samguk Sagi.\n"}

More serious than a simple slip of the pen or typographical error, a crux (probably deriving from Latin \"crux interpretum\" = \"cross of the interpreters\") is difficult or impossible to interpret and resolve. Cruxes occur in a wide range of pre-modern (ancient, medieval, and Renaissance) texts, printed and manuscript.\n\nThough widely exposed to readers and scholars, the texts of William Shakespeare's plays yield some of the most famous literary cruxes. Some have been resolved fairly well. In \"Henry V,\" II.iii.16-7, the First Folio text has the Hostess describe Falstaff on his death-bed like this:\n\nLewis Theobald's editorial correction, \"and 'a [he] babbl'd of green fields\", has won almost universal acceptance from subsequent editors. Similarly, the \"dram of eale\" In \"Hamlet\" I, iv, 36 can be sensibly interpreted as \"dram of ev'l [evil].\"\n\nOther Shakespearean cruxes have not been so successfully resolved. In \"All's Well That Ends Well,\" IV.ii,38-9, Diana observes to Bertram,\n\nEditors have reached no consensus on exactly what \"ropes in such a scarre\" can mean, or how it should be amended: \"no satisfactory explanation or emendation has been offered.\" Perhaps the best alternative that has been proposed is \"may rope 's [us] in such a snare.\" Another unresolved Shakespearean crux is the \"runaway's eyes\" in \"Romeo and Juliet,\" III, ii, 6.\n\nSometimes a crux will not require emendation, but simply present a knotty problem of comprehension. In \"Henry IV, Part 1,\" IV, i, 98-9, Sir Richard Vernon describes Prince Hal and his comrades as appearing:\n\nThis is most likely a reference to some obscure assertion about animal behavior, and has sent researchers poring through dusty volumes in search of an explanation.\n\nIn editions of Greek and Roman authors, a crux is marked off by obeli, to indicate that the editor is not confident enough either to follow the manuscript reading or to print a conjecture.\n\n"}
{"id": "32019995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32019995", "title": "Dacian art", "text": "Dacian art\n\nDacian art is the art associated with the peoples known as Dacians or North Thracians; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of Scythians and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in floral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins. \n\nThe Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the Balkans to the northern Carpathians and from the Black Sea and the river Tyras to the Tisa plain, sometimes even to the Middle Danube. Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.\n\nDacian civilization went through several stages of development, from the Thracian stage in the Bronze Age to the classical period of the Geto-Dacians (the first century BC to the first century AD). In the Bronze Age, proto-Thracian populations emerged from the fusion of the local Eneolithic (Chalcolithic) stock with the intruders of the transitional Indo-Europeanization Period. From these proto-Thracians, in the Iron Age, there were developed the Dacians of the Danubian-Carpathian Area on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula on the other.\n\nNorth Thracian population was chiefly an Early Bronze Age mix of the descendants of intrusive stockbreeding people and of survivors of the autochthonous Chalcolithic culture that the newcomers had destroyed. In this ethnic synthesis which gave birth to the Thracian people, the former predominated but, especially in the more mountainous areas, vestiges of Chalcolithic traditions survived through the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age.\n\nThe local, Daco-Thracian art should not be mistaken for the art of the Thracians south of the Balkans although mutual influences had undoubtedly appeared.\nThracian art was typically geometric in its decoration, a taste which was a remnant of Late Bronze Age traditions. While the Thracian tribes adopted-no doubt from the Scythians-some aspects of mounted nomadism in the first millennium B.C., they also preserved many traditions of the European Bronze Age and belonged more to the world of European cultures than to that of the East.\n\nThe 1st century BC silver work from the lower Danube region consists mostly of bracelets and fibulae alongside of a small number of decorative disks, plaques, and bowls. To distinguish it from earlier Thracian silver work, one might label this later silver work as Geto-Dacian or Geto-Thracian depending on whether is found above or below the lower Danube.\nThe design of Geto-Dacian helmets (i.e. Ciumesti, Iron Gate) is sufficiently unusual in ancient art to offer the opportunity to trace it to its origin, and, thereby, provide some insight into the Scythian elements that went into the formation of early Dacian art and the means by which ancient Oriental motifs survived and were transmitted into Europe Almost identical in decoration and details of craftsmanship are the two silver beakers, now in Bucharest and New York and unquestionably were made in the same metalsmith shop as the helmet.\n"}

{"id": "5103330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5103330", "title": "German art", "text": "German art\n\nGerman art has a long and distinguished tradition in the visual arts, from the earliest known work of figurative art to its current output of contemporary art.\n\nGermany has only been united into a single state since the 19th century, and defining its borders has been a notoriously difficult and painful process. For earlier periods German art often effectively includes that produced in German-speaking regions including Austria, Alsace and much of Switzerland, as well as largely German-speaking cities or regions to the east of the modern German borders.\n\nAlthough tending to be neglected relative to Italian and French contributions from the point of view of the English-speaking world, German art has played a crucial role in the development of Western art, especially Celtic art, Carolingian art and Ottonian art. From the development of Romanesque art, France and Italy began to lead developments for the rest of the Middle Ages, but the production of an increasingly wealthy Germany remained highly important. The German Renaissance developed in rather different directions to the Italian Renaissance, and was initially dominated by the central figure of Albrecht Dürer and the early German domination of printing. The final phase of the Renaissance, Northern Mannerism, was centred around the edges of the German lands, in Flanders and the Imperial capital of Prague, but, especially in architecture, the German Baroque and Rococo took up these imported styles with enthusiasm. The German origins of Romanticism did not lead to an equally central position in the visual arts, but German participation in the many broadly Modernist movements following the collapse of Academic art have been increasing important. \n\nThe area of modern Germany is rich in finds of prehistoric art, including the Venus of Hohle Fels. This appears to be the oldest undisputed example of Upper Paleolithic art and figurative sculpture of the human form in general, from over 35,000 years BP, which was only discovered in 2008; the better-known Venus of Willendorf (24–22,000 BP) comes from a little way over the Austrian border. The spectacular finds of Bronze Age golden hats are centred on Germany, as was the \"central\" form of Urnfield culture, and Hallstatt culture. In the Iron Age the \"Celtic\" La Tène culture centred on Western Germany and Eastern France, and Germany has produced many major finds of Celtic art like the elite burials at Reinheim and Hochdorf, and \"oppida\" towns like Glauberg, Manching and Heuneburg. \n\nAfter lengthy wars, the Roman Empire settled its frontiers in Germania with the Limes Germanicus to include much of the south and west of modern Germany. The German provinces produced art in provincial versions of Roman styles, but centres there, as over the Rhine in France, were large-scale producers of fine Ancient Roman pottery, exported all over the Empire. Rheinzabern was one of the largest, which has been well-excavated and has a dedicated museum.\n\nNon-Romanized areas of the later Roman period fall under Migration Period art, notable for metalwork, especially jewellry (the largest pieces apparently mainly worn by men). \n\nGerman medieval art really begins with the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne (d. 814), the first state to rule the great majority of the modern territory of Germany, as well as France and much of Italy. Carolingian art was restricted to a relatively small number of objects produced for a circle around the court and a number of Imperial abbeys they sponsored, but had a huge influence on later Medieval art across Europe. The most common type of object to survive is the illuminated manuscript; wall paintings were evidently common but, like the buildings that housed them, have nearly all vanished. The earlier centres of illumination were located in modern France, but later Metz in Lorraine and the Abbey of Saint Gall in modern Switzerland came to rival them. The Drogo Sacramentary and Folchard Psalter are among the manuscripts they produced.\n\nNo Carolingian monumental sculpture survives, although perhaps the most important patronage of Charlemagne was his commissioning of a life-size gold figure of Christ on a crucifix for his Palatine Chapel in Aachen; this is only known from literary references and was probably gold foil around a wooden base, probably modelled with a gesso layer, like the later and rather crumpled Golden Madonna of Essen. Early Christian art had not featured monumental sculptures of religious figures as opposed to rulers, as these were strongly associated by the Church Fathers with the cult idols of Ancient Roman religion. Byzantine art and modern Eastern Orthodox religious art have maintained the prohibition to the present day, but Western art was apparently decisively influenced by the example of Charlemagne to abandon it. Charlemagne's circle wished to revive the glories of classical style, which they mostly knew in its Late Antique form, and also to compete with Byzantine art, in which they appear to have been helped by refugee artists from the convulsions of the Byzantine iconoclasm. As Charlemagne himself does not appear to have been very interested in visual art, his political rivalry with the Byzantine Empire, supported by the Papacy, may have contributed to the strong pro-image position expressed in the Libri Carolini, which set out the position on images held with little variation by the Western Church for the rest of the Middle Ages, and beyond.\n\nUnder the next Ottonian dynasty, whose core territory approximated more closely to modern Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, Ottonian art was mainly a product of the large monasteries, especially Reichenau which was the leading Western artistic centre in the second half of the 10th century. The Reichenau style uses simplified and patterned shapes to create strongly expressive images, far from the classical aspirations of Carolingian art, and looking forward to the Romanesque. The wooden Gero Cross of 965–970 in Cologne Cathedral is both the oldest and the finest early medieval near life-size crucifix figure; art historians had been reluctant to credit the records giving its date until they were confirmed by dendrochronology in 1976. As in the rest of Europe, metalwork was still the most prestigious form of art, in works like the jewelled Cross of Lothair, made about 1000, probably in Cologne.\nRomanesque art was the first artistic movement to encompass the whole of Western Europe, though with regional varieties. Germany was a central part of the movement, though German Romanesque architecture made rather less use of sculpture than that of France. With increasing prosperity massive churches were built in cities all over Germany, no longer just those patronized by the Imperial circle. The French invented the Gothic style, and Germany was slow to adopt it, but once it had done so Germans made it their own, and continued to use it long after the rest of Europe had abandoned it. According to Henri Focillon, Gothic allowed German art \"to define for the first time certain aspects of its native genius-a vigorous and emphatic conception of life and form, in which theatrical ostentation mingled with vehement emotional frankness.\" The Bamberg Horseman of the 1330s, in Bamberg Cathedral, is the oldest large post-antique standing stone equestrian statue; more medieval princely tomb monuments have survived from Germany than France or England. Romanesque and Early Gothic churches had wall paintings in local versions of international styles, of which few artists' names are known.\nThe court of the Holy Roman Emperor, then based in Prague, played an important part in forming the International Gothic style in the late 14th century. The style was spread around the wealthy cities of Northern Germany by artists such Conrad von Soest in Westphalia and Meister Bertram in Hamburg, and later Stefan Lochner in Cologne. Hamburg was one of the cities in the Hanseatic League, then at the height of its prosperity, and Bertram was succeeded in the city by artists such as Master Francke, the Master of the Malchin Altar, Hans Bornemann, Hinrik Funhof and Wilm Dedeke who survived into the Renaissance period. Hanseatic artists painted commissions for Baltic cities in Scandinavia and the modern Baltic states to the east. In the south, the Master of the Bamberg Altar is the first significant painter based in Nuremberg, while the Master of Heiligenkreuz and then Michael Pacher worked in Austria. \n\nLike that of Pacher, the workshop of Bernt Notke, a painter from the Hanseatic city of Lübeck, both painted altarpieces or carved them in the increasingly elaborate painted and gilded style used as frameworks or alternatives for painted panels. South German wood sculpture was important in developing new subjects that reflected the intensely emotional devotional life encouraged by movements in late medieval Catholicism such as German mysticism. These are often known in English as andachtsbilder (devotional images) and include the \"Pietà\", \"Pensive Christ\", \"Man of Sorrows\", \"Arma Christi\", \"Veil of Veronica\", the severed head of John the Baptist, and the \"Virgin of Sorrows\", many of which would spread across Europe and remain popular until the Baroque and, in popular religious imagery, beyond. Indeed \"Late Gothic Baroque\" is a term sometimes used to describe hyper-decorated and emotional 15th-century art, above all in Germany.\n\nMartin Schongauer, who worked in Alsace in the last part of the 15th century, was the culmination of late Gothic German painting, with a sophisticated and harmonious style, but he increasingly spent his time producing engravings, for which national and international channels of distribution had developed, so that his prints were known in Italy and other countries. His predecessors were the Master of the Playing Cards and Master E. S., both also from the Upper Rhine region. German conservatism is shown in the late use of gold backgrounds, still used by many artists well into the 15th century.\n\nThe concept of the Northern Renaissance or German Renaissance is somewhat confused by the continuation of the use of elaborate Gothic ornament until well into the 16th century, even in works that are undoubtedly Renaissance in their treatment of the human figure and other respects. Classical ornament had little historical resonance in much of Germany, but in other respects Germany was very quick to follow developments, especially in adopting printing with movable type, a German invention that remained almost a German monopoly for some decades, and was first brought to most of Europe, including France and Italy, by Germans. \n\nPrintmaking by woodcut and engraving (perhaps another German invention) was already more developed in Germany and the Low Countries than anywhere else, and the Germans took the lead in developing book illustrations, typically of a relatively low artistic standard, but seen all over Europe, with the woodblocks often being lent to printers of editions in other cities or languages. The greatest artist of the German Renaissance, Albrecht Dürer, began his career as an apprentice to a leading workshop in Nuremberg, that of Michael Wolgemut, who had largely abandoned his painting to exploit the new medium. Dürer worked on the most extravagantly illustrated book of the period, the Nuremberg Chronicle, published by his godfather Anton Koberger, Europe's largest printer-publisher at the time. \n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship in 1490, Dürer travelled in Germany for four years, and Italy for a few months, before establishing his own workshop in Nuremberg. He rapidly became famous all over Europe for his energetic and balanced woodcuts and engravings, while also painting. Though retaining a distinctively German style, his work shows strong Italian influence, and is often taken to represent the start of the German Renaissance in visual art, which for the next forty years replaced the Netherlands and France as the area producing the greatest innovation in Northern European art. Dürer supported Martin Luther but continued to create Madonnas and other Catholic imagery, and paint portraits of leaders on both sides of the emerging split of the Protestant Reformation. \nDürer died in 1528, before it was clear that the split of the Reformation had become permanent, but his pupils of the following generation were unable to avoid taking sides. Most leading German artists became Protestants, but this deprived them of painting most religious works, previously the mainstay of artists' revenue. Martin Luther had objected to much Catholic imagery, but not to imagery itself, and Lucas Cranach the Elder, a close friend of Luther, had painted a number of \"Lutheran altarpieces\", mostly showing the Last Supper, some with portraits of the leading Protestant divines as the Twelve Apostles. This phase of Lutheran art was over before 1550, probably under the more fiercely aniconic influence of Calvinism, and religious works for public display virtually ceased to be produced in Protestant areas. Presumably largely because of this, the development of German art had virtually ceased by about 1550, but in the preceding decades German artists had been very fertile in developing alternative subjects to replace the gap in their order books. Cranach, apart from portraits, developed a format of thin vertical portraits of provocative nudes, given classical or Biblical titles.\n\nLying somewhat outside these developments is Matthias Grünewald, who left very few works, but whose masterpiece, his \"Isenheim Altarpiece\" (completed 1515), has been widely regarded as the greatest German Renaissance painting since it was restored to critical attention in the 19th century. It is an intensely emotional work that continues the German Gothic tradition of unrestrained gesture and expression, using Renaissance compositional principles, but all in that most Gothic of forms, the multi-winged triptych.\n\nThe Danube School is the name of a circle of artists of the first third of the 16th century in Bavaria and Austria, including Albrecht Altdorfer, Wolf Huber and Augustin Hirschvogel. With Altdorfer in the lead, the school produced the first examples of independent landscape art in the West (nearly 1,000 years after China), in both paintings and prints. Their religious paintings had an expressionist style somewhat similar to Grünewald's. Dürer's pupils Hans Burgkmair and Hans Baldung Grien worked largely in prints, with Baldung developing the topical subject matter of witches in a number of enigmatic prints.\n\nHans Holbein the Elder and his brother Sigismund Holbein painted religious works in the late Gothic style. Hans the Elder was a pioneer and leader in the transformation of German art from the Gothic to the Renaissance style. His son, Hans Holbein the Younger was an important painter of portraits and a few religious works, working mainly in England and Switzerland. Holbein's well known series of small woodcuts on the \"Dance of Death\" relate to the works of the Little Masters, a group of printmakers who specialized in very small and highly detailed engravings for bourgeois collectors, including many erotic subjects.\n\nThe outstanding achievements of the first half of the 16th century were followed by several decades with a remarkable absence of noteworthy German art, other than accomplished portraits that never rival the achievement of Holbein or Dürer. The next significant German artists worked in the rather artificial style of Northern Mannerism, which they had to learn in Italy or Flanders. Hans von Aachen and the Netherlandish Bartholomeus Spranger were the leading painters at the Imperial courts in Vienna and Prague, and the productive Netherlandish Sadeler family of engravers spread out across Germany, among other counties. This style was continued for another generation by Bartholomeus Strobel, an example of an essentially German artist born and working in Silesia, in today's Poland, until he emigrated to escape the Thirty Years War and become painter at the Polish court. Adam Elsheimer, the most influential German artist in the 17th century, spent his whole mature career in Italy, where he began by working for another émigré Hans Rottenhammer. Both produced highly finished cabinet paintings, mostly on copper, with classical themes and landscape backgrounds. \n\nIn Catholic parts of South Germany the Gothic tradition of wood carving continued to flourish until the end of the 18th century, adapting to changes in style through the centuries. Veit Stoss (d. 1533), Tilman Riemenschneider (d.1531) and Peter Vischer the Elder (d. 1529) were Dürer's contemporaries, and their long careers covered the transition between the Gothic and Renaissance periods, although their ornament often remained Gothic even after their compositions began to reflect Renaissance principles.\n\nTwo and a half centuries later, Johann Joseph Christian and Ignaz Günther were leading masters in the late Baroque period, both dying in the late 1770s, barely a decade before the French Revolution. A vital element in the effect of German Baroque interiors was the work of the Wessobrunner School, a later term for the stuccoists of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Another manifestation of German sculptural skill was in porcelain; the most famous modeller is Johann Joachim Kaendler of the Meissen factory in Dresden, but the best work of Franz Anton Bustelli for the Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory in Munich is often considered the greatest achievement of 18th-century porcelain.\n\nBaroque painting was slow to arrive in Germany, with very little before about 1650, but once established seems to have suited German taste well. Baroque and Rococo periods saw German art producing mostly works derivative of developments elsewhere, though numbers of skilled artists in various genres were active. The period remains little-known outside Germany, and though it \"never made any claim to be among the great schools of painting\", its neglect by non-German art history remains striking. Many distinguished foreign painters spent periods working in Germany for princes, among them Bernardo Bellotto in Dresden and elsewhere, and Gianbattista Tiepolo, who spent three years painting the Würzburg Residence with his son. Many German painters worked abroad, including Johann Liss who worked mainly in Venice, Joachim von Sandrart and Ludolf Bakhuisen, the leading marine artist of the final years of Dutch Golden Age painting. In the late 18th century the portraitist Heinrich Füger and his pupil Johann Peter Krafft, whose best known works are three large murals in the Hofburg, had both moved to Vienna as students and stayed there.\n\nNeoclassicism appears rather earlier in Germany than in France, with Anton Raphael Mengs (1728–79), the Danish painter Asmus Jacob Carstens (1754–98), and the sculptor Gottfried Schadow (1764–1850). Mengs was one of the most highly regarded artists of his day, working in Rome, Madrid and elsewhere, and finding an early Neo-Classical style that now seems rather effete, although his portraits are more effective. Carstens' shorter career was turbulent and troubled, leaving a trail of unfinished works, but through pupils and friends such as Gottlieb Schick, Joseph Anton Koch and Bonaventura Genelli, more influential. Koch was born in the mountains of the Austrian Tyrol and became the leading Continental painter of landscapes, concentrating on mountain views, despite spending much of his career in Rome. \n\nDaniel Chodowiecki was born in Danzig, and at least partly identified as Polish, although he only spoke German and French. His paintings and hundreds of prints, book illustrations and political cartoons are an invaluable visual record of the everyday life and the increasingly complex mentality of Enlightenment Germany, and its emerging Nationalism. The Swiss-born Anton Graff was a prolific portraitist in Dresden, who painted literary figures as well as the court. The Tischbein family dynasty were solid all-rounders who covered most of the 18th century between them, as did the Zick family, initially mainly painters of grand Baroque ceilings, who were still active in the 20th century in the person of the illustrator Alexander Zick. Both the Asam brothers, and Johann Baptist Zimmermann and his brother, were able between them to provide a complete service for commissions for churches and palaces, designing the building and executing the stucco and wall-paintings. The combined effect of all the elements of these buildings in South Germany, Austria and Bohemia, especially their interiors, represent some of the most complete and extreme realizations of the Baroque aspiration to overwhelm the viewer with the \"radiant fairy world of the nobleman's dwelling\", or the \"foretaste of the glories of Paradise\" in the case of churches.\n\nThe earliest German academy was the Akademie der Künste founded in Berlin in 1696, and through the next two centuries a number of other cities established their own institutions, in parallel with developments in other European nations. In Germany the uncertain market for art in a country divided into a multitude of small states meant that significant German artists have been to the present day more likely to accept teaching posts in the academies and their successor institutions than their equivalents in England or France have been. In general German academies imposed a particular style less rigidly than was for long the case in Paris, London, Moscow or elsewhere. \n\nThe Enlightenment period saw German writers becoming leading theorists and critics of art, led by Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who exalted Ancient Greek art and, despite never visiting Greece or actually seeing many Ancient Greek statues, set out an analysis distinguishing between the main periods of Ancient Greek art, and relating them to wider historical movements. Winckelmann's work marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture; he was read avidly by Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the Laocoon occasioned a response by Lessing. Goethe had tried to train as an artist, and his landscape sketches show \"occasional flashes of emotion in the presence of nature which are quite isolated in the period\". The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Judgment\" in 1790, and was furthered by Hegel's \"Lectures on Aesthetics\". In the following century, German universities were the first to teach art history as an academic subject, beginning the leading position that Germany (and Austria) was to occupy in the study of art history until the dispersal of scholars abroad in the Nazi period. Johann Gottfried Herder championed what he identified in the Gothic and Dürer as specifically Germanic styles, beginning an argument over the proper models for a German artist against the so-called \"Tyranny of Greece over Germany\" that would last nearly two centuries.\n\nGerman Romanticism saw a revival of innovation and distinctiveness in German art. Outside Germany only Caspar David Friedrich is well-known, but there were a number of artists with very individual styles, notably Philipp Otto Runge, who like Friedrich had trained at the Copenhagen Academy and was forgotten after his death until a revival in the 20th century. Friedrich painted almost entirely landscapes, with a distinctive Northern feel, and always a feeling of quasi-religious stillness. Often his figures are seen from behind – they like the viewer are lost in contemplation of the landscape. Runge's portraits, mostly of his own circle, are naturalistic except for his huge-faced children, but the other works in his brief career increasingly reflected a visionary pantheism. Adrian Ludwig Richter is mainly remembered for his portraits, and Carl Wilhelm Kolbe was purely an etcher (as well as a philologist), whose later prints show figures almost swallowed up by gigantic vegetation.\n\nThe Nazarene movement, the coinage of a mocking critic, denotes a group of early 19th-century German Romantic painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. The principal motivation of the Nazarenes was a reaction against Neoclassicism and the routine art education of the academy system. They hoped to return to art which embodied spiritual values, and sought inspiration in artists of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, rejecting what they saw as the superficial virtuosity of later art. Their programme was not dissimilar to that of the English Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in the 1850s, although the core group took it as far as wearing special pseudo-medieval clothing. In 1810 Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Franz Pforr, Ludwig Vogel and the Swiss Johann Konrad Hottinger moved to Rome, where they occupied the abandoned monastery of San Isidoro. They were joined by Philipp Veit, Peter von Cornelius, Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and a loose grouping of other German artists. They met up with the Austrian romantic landscape artist Joseph Anton Koch, (1768–1839) who became an unofficial tutor to the group. In 1827 they were joined by Joseph von Führich, and Eberhard Wächter was later associated with the group. Unlike the strong support given to the Pre-Raphaelites by the dominant art critic of the day, John Ruskin, Goethe was dismissive of the Nazarenes: \"This the first case in the history of art when real talents have taken the fancy to form themselves backwards by retreating into their mother's womb, and thus found a new epoch in art.\"\n\nLed by the Nazarene Schadow, son of the sculptor, the Düsseldorf school was a group of artists who painted mostly landscapes, and who studied at, or were influenced by the Düsseldorf Academy, founded in 1767. The academy's influence grew in the 1830s and 1840s, and it had many American students, several of whom became associated with the Hudson River School.\nBiedermeier refers to a style in literature, music, the visual arts and interior design in the period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and the revolutions of 1848. Biedermeier art appealed to the prosperous middle classes by detailed but polished realism, often celebrating domestic virtues, and came to dominate over French-leaning aristocratic tastes, as well as the yearnings of Romanticism. Carl Spitzweg was a leading German artist in the style.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century a number of styles developed, paralleling trends in other European counties, though the lack of a dominant capital city probably contributed to even more diversity of styles than in other countries.\n\nAdolph Menzel enjoyed enormous popularity both among the German public and officialdom; at his funeral Wilhelm II, German Emperor walked behind his coffin. He dramaticised past and contemporary Prussian military successes both in paintings and brilliant wood engravings illustrating books, yet his domestic subjects are intimate and touching. He followed the development of early Impressionism to create a style that he used for depicting grand public occasions, among other subjects like his \"Studio Wall\". Karl von Piloty was a leading academic painter of history subjects in the latter part of the century who taught in Munich; among his more famous pupils were Hans Makart, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Defregger, Gabriel von Max and Eduard von Grützner. The term \"Munich school\" is used both of German and of Greek painting, after Greeks like Georgios Jakobides studied under him. \n\nThe Berlin Secession was a group founded in 1898 by painters including Max Liebermann, who broadly shared the artistic approach of Manet and the French Impressionists, and Lovis Corinth then still painting in a naturalistic style. The group survived until the 1930s, despite splits, and its regular exhibitions helped launch the next two generations of Berlin artists, without imposing a particular style. Near the end of the century, the Benedictine Beuron Art School developed a style, mostly for religious murals, in rather muted colours, with a medievalist interest in pattern that drew from Les Nabis and in some ways looked forward to Art Nouveau or the Jugendstil (\"Youth Style\") as it is known in German. Franz von Stuck and Max Klinger are the leading German Symbolist painters. \n\nEven more than in other countries, German art in the early 20th century developed through a number of loose groups and movements, many covering other artistic media as well, and often with a specific political element, as with the Arbeitsrat für Kunst and November Group, both formed in 1918. In 1922 The November Group, the Dresden Secession, Das Junge Rheinland, and several other progressive groups formed a \"Cartel of advanced artistic groups in Germany\" (Kartell fortschrittlicher Künstlergruppen in Deutschland) in an effort to gain exposure.\n\nDie Brücke (\"The Bridge\") was one of two groups of German painters fundamental to expressionism, the other being Der Blaue Reiter group. Die Brücke was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905 by architecture students who wanted to be painters: Fritz Bleyl (1880–1966), Erich Heckel (1883–1970), Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880–1938) and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff (1884–1976), with Max Pechstein and others later joining. The notoriously individualistic Emil Nolde (1867–1956) was briefly a member of Die Brücke, but was at odds with the younger members of the group. Die Brücke moved to Berlin in 1911, where it eventually dissolved in 1913. Perhaps their most important contribution had been the rediscovery of the woodcut as a valid medium for original artistic expression. \n\nDer Blaue Reiter (\"The Blue Rider\") formed in Munich, Germany in 1911. Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin and others founded the group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgment from an exhibition by Neue Künstlervereinigung—another artists' group of which Kandinsky had been a member. The name Der Blaue Reiter derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses, and from Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, blue is the colour of spirituality—the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal (see his 1911 book On the Spiritual in Art). Kandinsky had also titled a painting Der Blaue Reiter (see illustration) in 1903. The intense sculpture and printmaking of Käthe Kollwitz was strongly influenced by Expressionism, which also formed the starting point for the young artists who went on to join other tendencies within the movements of the early 20th century.\n\n\"Die Brücke\" and \"Der Blaue Reiter\" were both examples of tendency of early 20th-century German art to be \"honest, direct, and spiritually engaged\" The difference in how the two groups attempted this were telling, however. The artists of Der Blaue Reiter were less oriented towards intense expression of emotion and more towards theory- a tendency which would lead Kandinsky to pure abstraction. Still, it was the spiritual and symbolic properties of abstract form that were important. There were therefore Utopian tones to Kandinsky's abstractions: \"We have before us an age of conscious creation, and this new spirit in painting is going hand in hand with thoughts toward an epoch of greater spirituality.\" \"Die Brücke\" also had Utopian tendencies, but took the medieval craft guild as a model of cooperative work that could better society- \"Everyone who with directness and authenticity conveys that which drives him to creation belongs to us\". The Bauhaus also shared these Utopian leanings, seeking to combine fine and applied arts (Gesamtkunstwerk) with a view towards creating a better society. \n\nA major feature of German art in the early 20th century until 1933 was a boom in the production of works of art of a grotesque style. Artists using the Satirical-Grotesque genre included George Grosz, Otto Dix and Max Beckmann, at least in their works of the 1920s. Dada in Germany, the leading practitioners of which were Kurt Schwitters and Hannah Höch, was centered in Berlin, where it tended to be more politically oriented than Dada groups elsewhere. They made important contributions to the development of collage as a medium for political commentary- Schwitters later developed his \"Merzbau\", a forerunner of installation art. Dix and Grosz were also associated with the Berlin Dada group. Max Ernst led a Dada group in Cologne, where he also practiced collage, but with a greater interest in Gothic fantasy than in overt political content—this hastened his transition into surrealism, of which he became the leading German practitioner. The Swiss-born Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger and others experimented with cubism. \n\nThe New Objectivity, or Neue Sachlichkeit (new matter-of-factness), was an art movement which arose in Germany during the 1920s as an outgrowth of, and in opposition to, expressionism. It is thus post-expressionist and applied to works of visual art as well as literature, music, and architecture. It describes the stripped-down, simplified building style of the Bauhaus and the Weissenhof Settlement, the urban planning and public housing projects of Bruno Taut and Ernst May, and the industrialization of the household typified by the Frankfurt kitchen. Grosz and Dix were leading figures, forming the \"Verist\" side of the movement with Beckmann and Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter, Georg Scholz (in his early work), Elfriede Lohse-Wächtler, and Karl Hubbuch. The other tendency is sometimes called Magic Realism, and included Anton Räderscheidt, Georg Schrimpf, Alexander Kanoldt, and Carl Grossberg. Unlike some of the other groupings, the Neue Sachlichkeit was never a formal group, and its artists were associated with other groups; the term was invented by a sympathetic curator, and \"Magic Realism\" by an art critic.\n\nPlakatstil, \"poster style\" in German, was an early style of poster design that began in the early 20th century, using bold, straight fonts with very simple designs, in contrast to Art Nouveau posters. Lucian Bernhard was a leading figure. \n\nThe Nazi regime banned modern art, which they condemned as degenerate art (from the German: entartete Kunst). According to Nazi ideology, modern art deviated from the prescribed norm of classical beauty. While the 1920s to 1940s are considered the heyday of modern art movements, there were conflicting nationalistic movements that resented abstract art, and Germany was no exception. Avant-garde German artists were now branded both enemies of the state and a threat to the German nation. Many went into exile, with relatively few returning after World War II. Dix was one who remained, being conscripted into the Volkssturm Home Guard militia; Pechstein kept his head down in rural Pomerania. Nolde also stayed, creating his \"unpainted pictures\" in secret after being forbidden to paint. Beckmann, Ernst, Grosz, Feininger and others went to America, Klee to Switzerland, where he died. Kirchner committed suicide.\n\nIn July, 1937, the Nazis mounted a polemical exhibition entitled \"Entartete Kunst\" (Degenerate art), in Munich; it subsequently travelled to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. The show was intended as an official condemnation of modern art, and included over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums. Expressionism, which had its origins in Germany, had the largest proportion of paintings represented. Simultaneously, and with much pageantry, the Nazis presented the \"Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung\" (Great German art exhibition) at the palatial \"Haus der deutschen Kunst\" (House of German Art). This exhibition displayed the work of officially approved artists such as Arno Breker and Adolf Wissel. At the end of four months \"Entartete Kunst\" had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby \"Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung\".\n\nPost-war art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into Socialist realism , Neo-expressionism and Conceptualism. \nNotable socialist realism include or included Walter Womacka, Willi Sitte, Werner Tübke and Bernhard Heisig.\n\nEspecially notable neo-expressionists include or included Georg Baselitz, Anselm Kiefer, Jörg Immendorff, A. R. Penck, Markus Lüpertz, Peter Robert Keil and Rainer Fetting. Other notable artists who work with traditional media or figurative imagery include Martin Kippenberger, Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, and Neo Rauch. \n\nLeading German conceptual artists include or included Bernd and Hilla Becher, Hanne Darboven, Hans-Peter Feldmann, Hans Haacke, and Charlotte Posenenske.\n\nThe Performance artist, sculptor, and theorist Joseph Beuys was perhaps the most influential German artist of the late 20th century. His main contribution to theory was the expansion of the Gesamtkunstwerk to include the whole of society, as expressed by his famous expression \"Everyone is an artist\". This expanded concept of art, known as social sculpture, defines everything that contributes creatively to society as artistic in nature. The form this took in his oeuvre varied from richly metaphoric, almost shamanistic performances based on his personal mythology (\"How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare\", \"I Like America and America Likes Me\") to more direct and utilitarian expressions, such as 7000 Oaks and his activities in the Green party. \n\nFamous for their happenings are HA Schult and Wolf Vostell. Wolf Vostell is also known for his early installations with television. His first installations with television the \"Cycle Black Room\" from 1958 was shown in Wuppertal at the Galerie Parnass in 1963 and his installation \"6 TV Dé-coll/age\" was shown at the Smolin Gallery in New York also in 1963.\n\nThe art group Gruppe SPUR included: Lothar Fischer (1933–2004), Heimrad Prem (1934–1978), Hans-Peter Zimmer (1936–1992) and Helmut Sturm (1932). The SPUR-artists met first at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and, before falling out with them, were associated with the Situationist International. Other groups include the Junge Wilde of the late 1970s to early 1980s. \n\ndocumenta (sic) is a major exhibition of contemporary art held in Kassel every five years (2007, 2012...), Art Cologne is an annual art fair, again mostly for contemporary art, and Transmediale is an annual festival for art and digital culture, held in Berlin. \n\nOther contemporary German artists include Jonathan Meese, Daniel Richter, Albert Oehlen, Markus Oehlen, Rosemarie Trockel, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Blinky Palermo, Hans-Jürgen Schlieker, Günther Uecker, Aris Kalaizis, Katharina Fritsch, Fritz Schwegler and Thomas Schütte. \n\nThe case of Wolfgang Beltracchi became known as one of the biggest art forger lawsuits in history. \n\n\n"}

They were known by the Greeks as gnomes, from the Greek word for \"an opinion\". A \"gnome\" was defined by the Elizabethan critic Henry Peacham as \"a saying pertaining to the manners and common practices of men, which declareth, with an apt brevity, what in this our life ought to be done, or not done\".\n\nIt belongs to the broad family of wisdom literature, which expresses general truths about the world. Topics range over the divine and secular, from moral aphorisms to hierarchical social relationships.\n\nThe gnomic poets of Greece, who flourished in the 6th century BCE, were those who arranged series of sententious maxims in verse. These were collected in the 4th century, by Lobon of Argos, an orator, but his collection has disappeared. Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" is considered to be one of the earliest works of this genre.\n\nThe chief gnomic poets were Theognis, Solon, Phocylides, Simonides of Amorgos, Demodocus, Xenophanes and Euenus. With the exception of Theognis, whose gnomes were fortunately preserved by some schoolmaster about 300 BCE, only fragments of the gnomic poets have come down to us. There is at least one known woman gnomic poet, Kassia; nearly 789 of her verses survive.\n\nThe moral poem attributed to Phocylides, long supposed to be a masterpiece of the school, is now known to have been written by a Jew in Alexandria. Of the gnomic movement typified by the moral works of the poets named above, Gilbert Murray has remarked that it receives its special expression in the conception of the Seven Wise Men, to whom such proverbs as \"Know thyself\" and \"Nothing in excess\" were popularly attributed, and whose names differed in different lists.\n\nThese gnomes or maxims were extended and put into literary shape by the poets. Fragments of Solon, Euenus and Mimnermus have been preserved, in a very confused state, from having been written, for purposes of comparison, on the margins of the manuscripts of Theognis, whence they have often slipped into the text of that poet. Theognis enshrines his moral precepts in his elegies, and this was probably the custom of the rest; it is improbable that there ever existed a species of poetry made up entirely of successive gnomes. But the title gnomic came to be given to all poetry which dealt in a sententious way with questions of ethics. It was, unquestionably, the source from which moral philosophy was directly developed, and theorists upon life and infinity, such as Pythagoras and Xenophanes, seem to have begun their career as gnomic poets.\n\nGnomes, in their literary sense, belong to the dawn of literature, in their naiveté and their simplicity and moralizing. Many of the ethical reflections of the great dramatists, and in particular of Sophocles and Euripides, are gnomic distiches expanded. The ancient Greek gnomes are not all solemn; some are voluptuous and some chivalrous. Those of Demodocus of Leros had the reputation of being droll.\n\nJ. A. Symonds writes that the gnomic poets mark a transition from Homer and Hesiod to the dramatists and moralists of Attica.\n\nGnomes are frequently to be found in the ancient literatures of Arabia, Persia and India, in Anglo-Saxon/Old English poetry and in the Icelandic staves. Comparable with the Anglo-Saxon examples are the Early Welsh gnomic poems. The priamel, a brief, sententious kind of poem, which was in favor in Germany from the 12th to the 16th centuries, belonged to the true gnomic class, and was cultivated with particular success by Hans Rosenblut, the lyrical goldsmith of Nuremberg, in the 15th century. Gnomic literature, including \"Maxims I\" and \"Maxims II\", is a genre of Medieval Literature in England.\n\nThe gnomic spirit has occasionally been displayed by poets of a homely philosophy, such as Francis Quarles (1592–1644) in England and Gui de Pibrac (1529–1584) in France. The once-celebrated \"Quatrains\" of the latter, published in 1574, enjoyed an immense success throughout Europe; they were composed in deliberate imitation of the Greek gnomic writers of the 6th century BCE.\n\nWith the gnomic writings of Pibrac it was long customary to bind up those of Antoine Faber (or Favre) (1557–1624) and of Pierre Mathieu (1563–1621).\n\n\n"}

She is primarily renowned for her avant-garde poetry in the 90s. Her award winning debut feature film \"My Tehran for Sale\" is an internationally acclaimed Australian-Iranian co-production.\n\nGranaz was born in December 1976 in Tehran to TV parents, her father, Hashem Moussavi, was a well-known sound engineer in the Iranian National TV (Jam e Jam) and in the film industry, and her mother, Parvin Chegini Farahani, a video grader. At the age of 17, she started writing professionally as a book review writer and literary critic at \"Donyaye Sokhan literary magazine مجلهٔ ادبی دنیای سخن\" in Tehran. Her first poems were published in 1989 and since then, she has continued writing and publishing poetry in various magazines and collections both in Iran and other countries . In Tehran, Granaz went to Razi primary school and Hadaf high-school. Her love for cinema and theatre made her change her mind about the field of tertiary schooling. She withdrew from a B.S. at Alzahra University and took various Drama courses in Tehran focusing on acting, including Hamid Samandarian's drama workshops at The Theatre Organization of Tehran, and Mahin Oskoui's underground acting classes held in her apartment.\n\nIn 1997, Granaz immigrated to Australia with her family. She changed her focus from pursuing acting to Screen Studies and filmmaking. In 2002, she made her Honors film \"A Short Film About Colour\", shot by the renowned Iranian cinematographer Firooz Malekzadeh. The short film earned Granaz the best director award from Flinders University and an honorary membership to the Australian Screen Directors Association (ASDA).\n\nGranaz published her first book, \"Khatkhati Rooye Shab خط خطی روی شب\" (\"Sketching On Night\"), underground in Tehran in 1996 to had an extensive reception. Her second book, \"Paberahneh Ta Sobh پابرهنه تا صبح\" (\"Barefoot Till Morning\"), was the winner of جایزه شعر کارنامه یاجایزه شعر امروز ایران \"Karnameh’s best poetry book of the year award\" in 2001 and is currently in its fourth edition. She published her third collection, \"Avazhaye Zan e Biejazeh آوازهای زن بی اجازه \" (\"The Songs of the Forbidden Woman\"), in 2003. It has reached its second edition so far. Her poems have been anthologised worldwide and her solo bi-lingual collection was published in France by MEET publishers. Granaz published \"Les Rescapes De La Patience\" (translated by Farideh Rava, and with a preface by Jean Baptiste Para) after a sponsored literary residency in Saint Nazaire, France. Also, in 2004 a DEA thesis at Sorbonne University (Paris III) was lodged on her poetry (by Etienne Forget).\n\nAfter receiving an Honours degree from Flinders University, Granaz got accepted in AFTRS, the Australian Film TV and Radio School in Sydney. She graduated with a postgraduate degree in film editing in 2006. Currently, she is a doctoral candidate with a scholarship at the University of Western Sydney researching \"The Aesthetics of Poetic Cinema\". She has made several short films and documentaries and has participated in various roles in a few feature films. In the field of poetry, she has conducted many poetry readings worldwide, including her participation in the Paris Autumn Festival in 2000 (introduced and translated by Media Kashigar, managed by Alain Lance), SOAS/London University in 2001, Vienna and Mondorf/Luxembourg in 2003, Saint Nazaire, Nantes, Marseille, Arles/France in 2004-5, Sydney/Australia in 2005, “Caravan of poetry” through Paris, La Rochelle, Marseille, Poitier, and Nantes/France in 2006, the Fifth International Festival of Poetry “Merci Poesie”, Göteborg/Sweden in 2008, the Iranian Arts and Literature Festival, San Francisco/USA in 2009, and Luxemburg in 2009. Her latest presentation was a lecture followed by poetry reading at Stanford University in February 2009 and University of California at Irvine in January 2011.\n\nThere are a number of accounts, articles, and critiques written on Granaz's poetry including the articles of some renowned Iranian writers and critics such as M. Azad, Dr. Jalil Doustkhah, Mohammad Rahim Okhovat, Shahrnoush Parsipour, and Ali Babachahi.

{"id": "7372761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7372761", "title": "Hortus conclusus", "text": "Hortus conclusus\n\nHortus conclusus is a Latin term, meaning literally \"enclosed garden\". At their root, both of the words in \"hortus conclusus\" refer linguistically to enclosure.\n\n\"Hortus conclusus\" is both an emblematic attribute and a title of the Virgin Mary in Medieval and Renaissance poetry and art, suddenly appearing in paintings and manuscript illuminations about 1330 as well as a genre of actual garden that was enclosed both symbolically and as a practical concern, a major theme in the history of gardening.\n\nThe term \"hortus conclusus\" is derived from the Vulgate Bible's \"Canticle of Canticles\" (also called the \"Song of Songs\" or \"Song of Solomon\") 4:12, in Latin: \"Hortus conclusus soror mea, sponsa, hortus conclusus, fons signatus\" (\"A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.\" This provided the shared linguistic culture of Christendom, expressed in homilies expounding the \"Song of Songs\" as allegory where the image of King Solomon's nuptial song to his bride was reinterpreted as the love and union between Christ and the Church, the mystical marriage with the Church as the Bride of Christ. \n\nThe verse \"Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee\" (4.7) from the \"Song\" was also regarded as a scriptural confirmation of the developing and still controversial doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception - being born without Original Sin (\"macula\" is Latin for spot).\n\nChristian tradition states that Jesus Christ was conceived to Mary miraculously and without disrupting her virginity by the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Holy Trinity. As such, Mary in late medieval and Renaissance art, illustrating the long-held doctrine of the Perpetual virginity of Mary, as well as the Immaculate Conception, was shown in or near a walled garden or yard. This was a representation of her \"closed off\" womb, which was to remain untouched, and also of her being protected, as by a wall, from sin. In the Grimani Breviary, scrolling labels identify the emblemmatic objects betokening the Immaculate Conception: the enclosed garden (\"hortus conclusus\"), the tall cedar (\"cedrus exalta\"), the well of living waters (\"puteus aquarum viventium\"), the olive tree (\"oliva speciosa\"), the fountain in the garden (\"fons hortorum\"), the rosebush (\"plantatio rosae\"). Not all actual medieval \"horti conclusi\" even strove to include all these details, the olive tree in particular being insufficiently hardy for northern European gardens.\n\nThe enclosed garden is recognizable in Fra Angelico's \"Annunciation\" (\"illustration, above left\"), dating from 1430-32.\n\nTwo pilgrimage sites are dedicated to Mary of the Enclosed Garden in the Dutch-Flemish cultural area. One is the statue at the hermitage-chapel in Warfhuizen: \"Our Lady of the Enclosed Garden\". The second, \"Onze Lieve Vrouw van Tuine\" (literally \"Our Lady of the Garden\"), is venerated at the cathedral of Ypres.\n\nAll gardens are by definition enclosed or bounded spaces, but the enclosure may be somewhat open, and consist of columns, low hedges or fences. An actual walled garden, literally surrounded by a wall, is a subset of gardens. The meaning of \"hortus conclusus\" suggests a more private style of garden.\n\nIn the history of gardens the High Medieval \"hortus conclusus\" typically had a well or fountain at the center, bearing its usual symbolic freight (see \"Fountain of Life\") in addition to its practical uses. The convention of four paths that divided the square enclosure into quadrants, was so strong that the pattern was employed even where the paths led nowhere. All medieval gardens were enclosed, protecting the private precinct from public intrusion, whether by folk or by stray animals. The enclosure might be as simple as woven wattle fencing or of stout or decorative masonry; or it might be enclosed by trelliswork tunneled pathways in a secular garden or by an arcaded cloister, for communication or meditative pacing.\n\nThe origin of the cloister is in the Roman colonnaded peristyle, as every garden history notes; the ruined and overgrown Roman villas that were so often remade as the site of Benedictine monasteries had lost their planted garden features with the first decades of abandonment: \"gardening, more than architecture, more than painting, more than music, and far more than literature, is an ephemeral art; its masterpieces disappear, leaving little trace.\" Though \"when, in 1070, the abbey of Cassino was rebuilt,\" Georgina Masson observed, \"the garden was described as 'a paradise in the Roman fashion'\", it may have been merely \"the aura of the great classical tradition\" alone that had survived. The ninth-century idealised plan of Saint Gall (\"illustration\") shows an arcaded cloister with a central well and cross paths from the centers of each range of arcading, but when a consciously patterned garden was revived for the medieval cloister, the patterning came through Norman Sicily and its hybrid culture that adapted many Islamic elements, in this case the enclosed North African courtyard gardens, ultimately based on the Persian garden tradition.\n\nThe practical enclosed garden was laid out in the treatise by Pietro Crescenzi of Bologna, \"Liber ruralium commodorum\", a work that was often copied, as the many surviving manuscripts of its text attest, and often printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Late medieval paintings and illuminations in manuscripts such as for \"The Romance of the Rose\"— where the garden in the text is largely allegorical— often show a turfed bank for a seat as a feature of the \"hortus conclusus\". Only in the fifteenth century, at first in Italy, did some European gardens begin to look outward.\n\nSitting, walking and playing music were the activities most often portrayed in the numerous fifteenth-century paintings and illuminated manuscripts, where strenuous activities were inappropriate. In Rome, a late fifteenth-century cloister at San Giovanni dei Genovesi was constructed for the use of the Genoese \"natio\", an \"Ospitium Genoensium\", as a plaque still proclaims, which provided shelter in cubicles off its vaulted encircling arcades, and a meeting place and shelter reuniting those from the distant home city.\n\nSomewhat earlier, Pietro Barbo, who became Pope Paul II in 1464, began the construction of a \"hortus conclusus\", the Palazzetto del Giardino di San Marco, attached to the Venetian Cardinals' Roman seat, the Palazzo Venezia. It served as Paul's private garden during his papacy; inscriptions stress its secular functions as \"sublimes moenibus hortos...ut relevare animum, durasque repellere curas\", a garden of sublime delights, a retreat from cares, and praise it in classicising terms, as the home of the dryads, suggesting that there was a central grove of trees, and mentioning its snowy-white stuccoed porticoes. An eighteenth-century engraving shows a tree-covered central mount, which has been recreated in the modern replanting, with box-bordered cross and saltire gravelled paths.\n\nThe Farnese Gardens (\"Orti Farnesiani sul Palatino\"—or \"Gardens of Farnese upon the Palatine\") were created by Vignola in 1550 on Rome's northern Palatine Hill, for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (1520–89). These become the first private botanical gardens in Europe (the first botanical gardens of any kind in Europe being started by Italian universities in the mid-16th century, only a short time before). Alessandro called his summer home at the site \"Horti Farnesiani\", probably in reference to the \"hortus conclusus.\" These gardens were also designed in the Roman peristylium style with a central fountain.\n\nAgain in the age of the automobile, the enclosed garden that had never disappeared in Islamic society, became an emblem of serenity and privacy in the Western world.\n\nThe \"hortus conclusus\" was one of a number of depictions of the Virgin in the late Middle Ages developed to be more informal and intimate than the traditional hieratic enthroned Virgin adopted from Byzantine icons, or the Coronation of the Virgin. The subject began as a specific metaphor for the Annunciation, but tended to develop into a relaxed \"sacra conversatione\", with several figures beside the Virgin seated, and less specific associations. Germany and the Netherlands in the 15th century saw the peak popularity of this depiction of the Virgin, usually with Child, and very often a crowd of angels, saints and donors, in the garden - the garden by itself, to represent the Virgin, was much rarer. Often walls, or trellises close off the sides and rear, or it may be shown as open, except for raised banks, to a landscape beyond. Sometimes, as with a Gerard David's \"The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor\" (Below) the garden is very fully depicted; at other times, as in engravings by Martin Schongauer, only a wattle fence and a few sprigs of grass serve to identify the theme. Italian painters typically also keep plants to a minimum, and do not have grass benches. A sub-variety of the theme was the German \"Madonna of the Roses\", sometimes attempted in sculptured altarpieces. The image was rare in Orthodox icons, but there are at least some Russian examples.\n\nOne type of depiction, not usually compatible with correct perspective, concentrates on showing the whole wall, and several garden structures or features that symbolize the mystery of Christ's conception, mostly derived from the \"Song of Songs\" or other Biblical passages, as interpreted by theological writers. These may include one or more temple or church-like buildings, an Ivory Tower (SS 7.4), an open-air altar with Aaron's rod flowering, surrounded by the bare rods of the other tribes, a gatehouse \"tower of David, hung with shields\" (SS 7.4), with the gate closed, the Ark of the Covenant, a well (often covered), a fountain, and the morning sun above (SS 6.10).\nThis type of depiction usually shows the Annunciation, although sometimes the child Jesus is held by Mary. The miniature at right shows a relatively simple example; below a large Spanish altarpiece is able to combine many of the usual features (others no doubt contained in the many chapels) with correct perspective.\n\nA rather rare, late 15th century, variant of this depiction was to combine the Annunciation in the \"hortus conclusus\" with the \"Hunt of the Unicorn\" and \"Virgin and Unicorn\", so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many \"prima facie\" secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The Council of Trent finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction, partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal. In the 16th century the subject of the \"hortus conclusus\" drifts into the open air \"Sacra Conversazione\" and the Madonnas in a landscape of Giovanni Bellini, Albrecht Dürer and Raphael, where it is hard to say if an allusion is intended.\n\nAn exhibition of later medieval visual representations of \"hortus inclusus\" was mounted at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington DC; the exhibition drew a distinction between \"garden representations as thematic reinforcements and those that seemingly treat the garden as a subject in itself\"; in reviewing it Timothy Husband, warned against uncritical interpretation of the refined detail in manuscript illuminations' \"seemingly objective representation\". \"Late medieval garden imagery, by subjugating direct observation to symbolic or allegorical intention, reflects more a state of mind than reality,\" if a disjunct can be detected where the objects of the world shimmered with pregnant allegorical meaning. South Netherlandish illuminations and painting appear to document the \"turf benches, fountains, raised beds, 'estrade' trees, potted plants, walkways, enclosing walls, trellises, wattle fences and bowers\" familiar to contemporary viewers, but assembled into an illusion of reality.\n\nThe concept for the 2011 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion was the hortus conclusus, a contemplative room, a garden within a garden. Designed by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor and with a garden created by Piet Oudolf, the Pavilion was a place abstracted from the world of noise and traffic and the smells of London – an interior space within which to sit, to walk, to observe the flowers.\n\n\n"}

She trained at Brighton College of Art in the 1920s under Louis Ginnett, and received her first artistic commission at eighteen to draw local Sussex characters for the \"Sussex County Magazine\". Pannett maintained a studio in Hove and was elected a member of the Society of Graphic Artists in 1934. She was a professional artist until her marriage in 1938.\n\nPannett married Major Rick Pannett who had been injured in the First World War when he was shot in the mouth. The bullet had pierced his cheek and missed all his bones. Pannett gave up painting after the birth of her children. Suffering from depression, it was alleviated when she resumed painting. In 1949 the family moved to Croydon where she built a studio in her garage. The Pannett family later moved to Angmering in Sussex in 1964.\n\nAmong her subjects were Field-Marshal Montgomery, film director Jean Cocteau, athlete Chris Chataway, Louis Armstrong and Leonard Bernstein. Pannett was a keen cricketer and drew such cricketers as Maurice Tate and Bob Wyatt. Pannett preferred to paint men rather than women, describing men as she found them \"less troublesome as sitters...They never ask me not to put in their double chin or to leave out their wrinkles.\"\n\nBefore the televised proceedings of the House of Commons Pannett was employed by the Illustrated London News from 1957 to 1964 to sketch the events of the House. Sitting in the gallery of the Commons Pannett drew such historically significant events as Winston Churchill's last appearance in the house in 1964. Pannett later formally drew several other British Prime Ministers, including Alec Douglas-Home, who told her that he had \"the biggest head in London\" and could never find a hat to fit him. Later Prime Ministers painted by Pannett included Edward Heath, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher.\n\nFor several years around 1960, Pannett supplied the Radio Times with drawings of musicians and other figures being broadcast on BBC radio. In February 1963, she was commissioned by \"The Illustrated London News\" to do several sketches of C. S. Lewis.\n\nShe painted Queen Elizabeth II in 1989 for the Chartered Insurance Institute. Pannett had previously drawn Princes Andrew and Edward. Upon seeing the portrait Prince Philip commissioned a pastel drawing from her of the Queen for the 25th anniversary of the Independence of Malta.\n\nDue to her failing eyesight her last major portrait was of General Sir John Wilsey. She was appointed an MBE in 1993, and was a member of the Pastel Society and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers, who awarded her their gold medal in 1995.\n\nAt the time of her death in 2005 she was the oldest living artist to have work in the National Portrait Gallery's collection. Her husband had died in 1980, she was survived by her two children, who are both artists.\n\nHer autobiography, \"My Colourful Life\" was published in 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "18182651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18182651", "title": "Latte art", "text": "Latte art\n\nLatte art is a method of preparing coffee created by pouring microfoam into a shot of espresso and resulting in a pattern or design on the surface of the latte. It can also be created or embellished by simply \"drawing\" in the top layer of foam. Latte art is particularly difficult to create consistently, due to the demanding conditions required of both the espresso shot and milk. This, in turn, is limited by the experience of the barista and quality of the espresso machine. The pour itself, then, becomes the last challenge for the latte artist. The term is not reserved to latte coffee only, it also applies for other beverages containing milk foam like cappuccino and hot chocolate.\n\nLatte art developed independently in different countries, following the introduction of espresso and the development of microfoam, the combination of crema (which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee) and microfoam allowing the pattern; it presumably was initially developed in Italy.\n\nIn the United States, latte art was developed in Seattle in the 1980s and 1990s, and particularly popularized by David Schomer. Schomer credits the development of microfoam (\"velvet foam\" or \"milk texturing\") to Jack Kelly of \"Uptown espresso\" in 1986, and by 1989 the heart pattern was established and a signature at Schomer's \"Espresso Vivace.\" The rosette pattern was then developed by Schomer in 1992, recreating the technique based on a photograph he saw from Cafe Mateki in Italy. Schomer subsequently popularized latte art in his course \"Caffe Latte Art\". At the same time Luigi Lupi from Italy met Schomer on the internet and they exchanged videos they made on Latteart and Cappuccini Decorati.\n\nLatte art is a mixture of two colloids: the crema, which is an emulsion of coffee oil and brewed coffee; and the microfoam, which is a foam of air in milk. Milk itself is an emulsion of butterfat in water, while coffee is a mixture of coffee solids in water. Neither of these colloids are stable – crema dissipates from espresso, while microfoam separates into drier foam and liquid milk – both degrading significantly in a matter of seconds, and thus latte art lasts only briefly.\n\nLatte art requires first producing espresso with crema and microfoam, and then combining these to make latte art. See microfoam: procedure for how microfoam is made; this article concentrates on the latte art once the foam is made.\n\nBefore the milk is added, the espresso shot must have a creamy brown surface, an emulsion known as crema. As the white foam from the milk rises to meet the red/brown surface of the shot, a contrast is created and the design emerges. As the milk is poured, the foam separates from the liquid and rises to the top. If the milk and espresso shot are \"just right\", and the pitcher is moved during the pour, the foam will rise to create a pattern on the surface. Alternatively, a pattern may be etched with a stick after the milk has been poured, rather than during the pour.\n\nSome controversy exists within the coffee community as to whether or not there is excessive focus on latte art amongst baristas. The argument is that too much focus on the superficial appearance of a drink leads some to ignore more important issues, such as taste. This is especially relevant with new baristas.\n\nThere are two main types of latte art: free pouring (pattern created during the pour) and etching (using a tool to create a pattern after the pour). Free pouring is far more common in American cafés, and requires little additional time in preparing a drink.\n\nThe two most common forms of poured latte art are a heart shape and the \"rosetta\" or \"rosette\", also known as \"fern\" which resembles a type of flower or fern. Of these, hearts are simpler and more common in macchiatos, while rosettes are more complex and more common in lattes.\n\nFor free pouring, the cup is either kept level or tilted in one direction. As the milk is poured straight into the cup, the foam begins to surface on one side (due to the tilt). The barista then moves the pitcher from side to side as they level the cup, or simply wiggle the spout back and forth, and finishes by making a quick strike through the previously poured pattern. This \"strike\" creates the stem portion of the flower design, and bends the poured zig-zag into a flower shape.\n\nA more direct pour and less wiggling yields a heart shape, and minor variation (reduced lobes, larger stem) yields an apple shape.\n\nMore complex patterns are possible, some requiring multiple pours. Some examples of advanced latte art techniques are that of the tulip, wave heart, swan, or even a scorpion.\n\nEtched patterns range from simple geometric shapes to complicated drawings, such as crosshatching, images of animals and flowers, and are generally performed with a coffee stirrer of some sort. Etched latte art typically has a shorter lifespan than free poured latte art as the foam dissolves into the latte more quickly.\n\nA crude but quick method with cappuccino is to pour chocolate powder through a metal cutout in which an image, typically a flower, has been incised. This is favoured by chain coffee shops like Costa where speed is of the essence when serving large numbers of clients during peak times.\n\nLatte art is made by adding microfoam to espresso. Similar patterns, though much fainter, can be achieved by adding microfoam to brewed coffee, as in a café au lait or tea. Alternatively, patterns can be etched in the crema of an espresso, without adding any milk, in order to yield espresso art.\n\n"}

He was one of the first exponents of Symbolist art in Russia.\n\nHe was born to a strongly patriarchal merchant family. His father was a draper and haberdasher, but always had a strong interest in history and literature. As a result, he was sympathetic to his son's desire to be an artist, but insisted that he acquire practical skills first and, in 1874, he was sent to Moscow where he enrolled at the Voskresensky Realschule.\n\nIn 1877, his counselors suggested that he transfer to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he studied with Pavel Sorokin, Illarion Pryanishnikov and Vasily Perov, who was his favorite teacher. In 1879, he began to participate in the school's exhibitions. Two years later, he entered the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, where he worked with Pavel Chistyakov. He was disappointed at the teaching there and returned to Moscow, only to find Perov on his deathbed, so he took lessons from Alexei Savrasov. \n\nAfter a brief stay in Ufa, where he met his future wife, Maria, he returned to Moscow and studied with Vladimir Makovsky. While creating a series of historical paintings, he supported himself doing illustrations for magazines and books published by , including a collection of fairy tales by Pushkin. In 1885, he was awarded the title \"Free Artist\" and married, against his parent's wishes. The following year, his wife died after giving birth to his daughter, Olga. Several of his works from this period feature his wife's image.\n\nHis first major success came with his painting, \"The Hermit\" which was shown at the seventeenth exhibition of the Peredvizhniki in 1889. It was purchased by Pavel Tretyakov and the money enabled Nesterov to take an extended trip to Austria, Germany, France and Italy. Upon returning, his painting, \"The Vision to the Youth Bartholomew\", the first in a series of works on the life of Saint Sergius, was shown at the eighteenth Peredvizhniki exhibition and also purchased by Tretyakov. This series would eventually include fifteen large canvases and occupy him for fifty years.\n\nIn 1890, Adrian Prakhov, who was overseeing work at St Volodymyr's Cathedral, became familiar with Nesterov's paintings and invited him to participate in creating murals and icons there. After some hesitation, he agreed, then travelled to Rome and Istanbul to acquaint himself with Byzantine art. This project would take twenty-two years to complete. Although it brought him great popularity, he apparently came to feel that the images required were too clichéd and beneath his dignity as an artist, so he occasionally introduced some minor innovations, such as setting portraits of saints in a recognizable landscape. \nDespite this, he undertook other religious commissions. In 1898, Grand Duke George Alexandrovich asked him to work at the Alexander Nevsky church in Abastumani. He spent six years there, off and on, creating 50 small murals and the iconostasis, but was dissatisfied with the results. He was apparently much more pleased with later work at the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent. He refused to work on the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Warsaw, because he did not approve of building an Orthodox cathedral in a predominantly Catholic city.\n\nIn 1901, he wanted to deepen his spiritual appreciation of the monastic life, so he spent some time at the Solovetsky Monastery on the coast of the White Sea. He painted numerous works there and the influence of his visit could be seen in his canvases for many years after. He was also inspired by the novels of Pavel Ivanovich Melnikov, dealing with the lives of the Old Believers in the Volga Region. In 1902, he married Ekaterina Vasilyeva, whom he had met admiring his works at an exhibition.\n\nIn 1905, after the Revolution began, he joined the Union of the Russian People, an extreme right-wing nationalist party that supported the Tsar. As a result, he was in some danger after the October Revolution. In 1918, he moved to Armavir, where he became ill and was unable to work. He returned to Moscow in 1920 and was forced to give up religious painting, although he continued to work on his Saint Sergius series in private. From then until his death, he painted mostly portraits; notably Ivan Ilyin, Ivan Pavlov, Otto Schmidt, Sergei Yudin, Alexey Shchusev and Vera Mukhina. \n\nIn 1938, toward the end of the Great Purge, his son-in-law, Vladimir Schroeter, a prominent lawyer, was accused of being a spy and shot. His daughter was sent to a prison camp in Zhambyl, where she was brutally interrogated before being released. He was also arrested and held for two weeks at Butyrka Prison.\n\nIn 1941, he was awarded the Stalin Prize for his portrait of Pavlov (created in 1935). It was one of the first given to an artist. Shortly after, he received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. As the war progressed, his health and financial situation deteriorated rapidly. He had a stroke while working on his painting \"Autumn in the Village\" and died at .\n\nHis unfinished memoirs, which he had begun in 1926, were published later that year under the title \"Bygone Days\". In 1962, he was honored with a postage stamp. In 1996, his likeness appeared on the 50 Ural franc banknote and, in 2015, a monument to him was unveiled at the in Ufa.\n\n \n\n\n"}
{"id": "557746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=557746", "title": "Music and politics", "text": "Music and politics\n\nThe connection between music and politics, particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures. Although music influences political movements and rituals, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music on a political level. Music can express anti-establishment or protest themes, including anti-war songs, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as topical songs.\n\nSongs can be used to portray a specific political message. However, there may be barriers to the transmission of such messages; even overtly political songs are often shaped by and reference their contemporary political context, making an understanding of the history and events that inspired the music necessary in order to fully comprehend the message. The nature of that message can also be ambiguous because the label \"political music\" can be applied either to songs that merely observe political subjects, songs which offer a partisan opinion, or songs which go further and advocate for specific political action. Thus a distinction has been made, for example, between the use of music as a tool for raising awareness, and music as advocacy.\n\nFurthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way Western pop/rock bands such as The Beatles were censored by the State in the Eastern Bloc in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change. This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience, reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.\n\nIt is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues. For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that \"counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers\", suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that \"It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically\".\n\nHowever, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that \"given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities\".\n\nRecent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, music education has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling patriotism in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive jingoism. \n\nPlato wrote: \"musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;\" although this was written as a warning this can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but a much more important movement in the life of all human beings.\n\nThe song \"We Shall Overcome\" is perhaps the best-known example of political folk music, in this case a rallying-cry for the US Civil Rights Movement. Pete Seeger was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was Joan Baez. During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and class struggle lead to the growth of the Labour movement and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century \"Wobblies\" was Joe Hill. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the Almanac Singers and The Weavers were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie's socialistic patriotism. Pete Seeger's \"Where Have All the Flowers Gone?\", was a popular anti-war protest song. Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. \"Blowin' in the Wind\", by Bob Dylan, was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary, and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation. In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK with \"There but for Fortune\" (by Phil Ochs); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies. Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the folk music revival of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, and others.\n\nThe folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by Left-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as Sing Out! and Broadside. The revival began in the 1930s and continued after World War II. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions. Archivists and artists such as Alan Lomax, Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers. This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support. In the UK, Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist and MacColl (often with Peggy Seeger) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their Communist activism.\n\nIn the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation. Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the Cold War era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired. Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, Earl Robinson and Irwin Silber were or had been members of the Communist Party, while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine New Masses), Lee Hays and Paul Robeson were considered fellow travellers. As McCarthyism began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music. Artists were blacklisted, denounced by politicians and the media, and in the case of the 1949 Peekskill Riots, subject to mob attack.\n\nIn general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by rock and roll. However, during the popular folk revival's last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.\n\nBlues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. Bessie Smith recorded protest song \"Poor Man Blues\" in 1928. Josh White recorded \"When Am I Going to be Called a Man\" in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as \"boy\" – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's \"Chain Gang\" and 1941's \"Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues\". Lead Belly's \"Bourgeois Blues\" and Big Bill Broonzy's \"Black, Brown and White\" (aka \"Get Back\") protested racism. Billie Holiday recorded and popularised the song \"Strange Fruit\" in 1939. Written by Communist Lewis Allan, and also recorded by Josh White and Nina Simone, it addressed Southern racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including Madison Square Gardens. In the post-war era, J.B. Lenoir gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single \"Eisenhower Blues\" due to its title and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War. John Lee Hooker also sang 'I Don't Wanna Go To Vietnam\" on 1969 album \"Simply the Truth\".\n\nPaul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the FBI and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his outspoken political views. The State Department denied Robeson a passport and issued a \"stop notice\" at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia on May 18, 1952. Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953, and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.\n\nDisco, contrary to popular opinion, originated in Black queer communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the Bronx and other parts of New York. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of \"absorbing the feeling\", but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it's important to note that disco, for many, was a \"form of escape\" and noted a \"dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people\". The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of Vietnam and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another's diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.\nThe eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.\n\nAlthough public attention shifted to rock music from the mid 1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez's 1974 \"Gracias a la Vida\" album was a response to events in Chile and included versions of songs by Nueva Canción Chilena singer-songwriters Violeta Parra and Victor Jara. Paxton albums such as \"Outward Bound\" and \"Morning Again\" continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as Holly Near, Ray Korona, Charlie King, Anne Feeney, Jim Page, Utah Phillips and more recently David Rovics.\n\nIn Ireland, the Wolfe Tones is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/rebel music tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by Dominic Behan on albums such as \"Let the People Sing\" and \"Rifles of the I.R.A.\" Christy Moore has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album \"Paddy on the Road\", produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as \"Ride On\" (including \"Viva la Quinta Brigada\"), \"Ordinary Man\" and various artists LP \"H Block\" to which Moore contributed \"Ninety Miles from Dublin\", in response to the Republican prisoners' blanket protest of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, The Barleycorn had held the #1 spot on the Irish charts for five weeks in 1972 with their first release \"The Men Behind the Wire\", about internment, with all profits going to the families of internees; Republican label R&O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album \"Smash Internment\", recorded in Long Kesh, and The Wolfhounds' recording of Paddy McGuigan's \"The Boys of the Old Brigade\".\n\nIn the UK, the Ewan MacColl tradition of political folk has been continued since the 1960s by singer-songwriters such as Roy Bailey, Leon Rosselson and Dick Gaughan. Since the 1980s, a number of artists have blended folk protest with influences from punk and elsewhere to produce topical and political songs for a modern independent rock music audience, including Billy Bragg, Attila the Stockbroker, Robb Johnson, Alistair Hulett, The Men They Couldn't Hang, TV Smith, Chumbawamba and more recently Chris T-T and Grace Petrie.\n\nFolk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. Hungary, for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late Cold War era, which was reflected in much of their folk music. During the late twentieth century folk music was crucial in Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.\n\nIn Communist China, exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent \"re-education\". In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.\n\nAn example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of Edward Lansdale, a CIA chief who dedicated part of his career to counter-insurgency in the Philippines and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government's best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president Ramon Magsaysay, an important US anti-communist ally. In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of 'applied folklore' as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as Phạm Duy to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the anti-French struggle but then broke with the Communist-dominated Viet Minh.\n\nMany rock artists, as varied as Roger Waters, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven, Rage Against the Machine, Manic Street Preachers, Megadeth, Enter Shikari, Architects (British band), Muse, System of a Down and Sonic Boom Six have had openly political messages in their music. The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the 1960s counterculture, specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan, itself shaped by the politicised folk revival.\n\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as John Lennon commonly expressed protest themes in their music, for example on the Plastic Ono Band's 1969 single \"Give Peace a Chance\". Lennon later devoted an entire album to politics and wrote the song Imagine, widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.\nIn 1962-63, Bob Dylan sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the Beat writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era. In turn, while Dylan's political phase comes under the 'folk' category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the British Invasion bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.\n\nThe MC5 (Motor City 5) came out of the Detroit, Michigan underground scene of the late 1960s, and embodied an aggressive evolution of garage rock which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs \"Motor City Is Burning\", (a John Lee Hooker cover adapting the story of the Detroit Race Riot (1943) to the 1967 12th Street Detroit Riot), and \"American Ruse\" (which discusses U.S. police brutality as well as pollution, prison, materialism and rebellion). They had ties to radical leftist groups such as Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers and John Sinclair's White Panther Party. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, as part of the Yippies' Festival of Life where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the recent assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Vietnam War.\n\nOther rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – often in regard to the Vietnam War – include The Fugs, Country Joe and the Fish, Jefferson Airplane, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Third World War, while some bands, such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Hawkwind, referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like \"Revolution\", \"Street Fighting Man\", \"Salt of the Earth\" and \"Urban Guerrilla\".\n\nNotable punk rock bands, such as Crass, Conflict, Sex Pistols, The Clash, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Refused, American Standards, Discharge, MDC, Aus-Rotten, Anti-Flag, and Leftover Crack have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.\n\nSince the late 1970s, punk rock has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies, including anarchism and socialism. Punk's DIY culture held an attraction for some on the Left, suggesting affinity with the ideals of workers' control, and empowerment of the powerless (though it is arguable that the punk movement's partial focus on apathy towards the establishment, combined with the fact that in many situations, punk rock music generated income for major record companies, and the notable similarities between some strains of anarchism and capitalism, meant that the punk movement ran contrary to left-wing ideologies) – and the genre as a whole came, largely through the Sex Pistols, to be associated with anarchism. The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology – but bands such as Crass and Dead Kennedys later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK anarcho-punk and US hardcore subgenres, respectively.\n\nThe Sex Pistols song \"God Save the Queen\" was banned from broadcast by the BBC in 1977 due to its presumed anti-Royalism, partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a \"fascist regime\". The following year, the release of debut Crass album The Feeding Of the 5000 was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content. Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their Penis Envy album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their Frankenchrist album artwork.\n\nThe Clash are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or nihilistic attack of many early punk bands. Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/new wave bands such as The Jam, The Ruts, Stiff Little Fingers, Angelic Upstarts, TRB and Newtown Neurotics, and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as racial tension, unemployment, class resentment, urban alienation and police violence, as well as imperialism. Partially credited with aligning punk and reggae, The Clash's anti-racism helped to cement punk's anti-fascist politics, and they famously headlined the first joint Rock Against Racism (RAR)/Anti Nazi League (ANL) carnival in Hackney, London, in April 1978. The RAR/ANL campaign is credited with helping to destroy the UK as a credible political force, aided by the support received from punk and reggae bands.\n\nMany punk musicians, such as Vic Bondi (Articles of Faith), Joey Keithley (DOA), Tim McIlrath (Rise Against), The Crucifucks, Bad Religion, The Proletariat, Against All Authority, Dropkick Murphys and Crashdog have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, as well as T.S.O.L. frontman Jack Grisham, have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more populist and conservative opinions, and an ambiguous form of patriotism, beginning in the U.S with many of the groups associated with 1980s New York hardcore, and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the Oi! movement.\n\nAn extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) Skrewdriver and Skullhead, have held far-right and anti-communist stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.\n\nRock the Vote is an American 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities. Rock the Vote's stated mission is to \"build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country.\"\n\nHip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when \"The Message\" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”. However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.\n\nLater in the decade hip hop band Public Enemy became \"perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group\" and released a series of records whose message and success \"directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture's signature throughout the next decade,\" helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as X Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers, Brand Nubian, 2 Black 2 Strong and Paris.\n\nPopular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga's song Born This Way (song) has often been known as the international gay anthem, as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina received a great political response from the Hip hop music community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath. This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.\n\nRacist music or white power music is music associated with and promoting neo-Nazism and white supremacy ideologies. Although musicologists point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with 'white power rock' the most commonly represented band type, followed by National Socialist black metal. 'Racist country music' is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands. Other music genres include 'fascist experimental music' and 'racist folk music'. Contemporary white-supremacist groups include \"subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music.\" According to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission \"racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits.\" The news documentary \"VH1 News Special: Inside Hate Rock\" (2002) noted that Racist music (also called 'Hate music' and 'Skinhead rock') is \"a breeding ground for home-grown terrorists.\" In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched \"Project Schoolyard\" to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, \"We just don't entertain racist kids … We create them.\" Brian Houghton, of the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, \"Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life.\"\n\nAmerican country music contains numerous images of \"traditional\" life, family life, religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as Merle Haggard's \"The Fightin' Side of Me\", and \"Okie from Muskogee\" have been perceived as patriotic songs which contain an \"us versus them\" mentality directed at the counterculture \"hippies\" and the anti-war crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.\n\nBeethoven's third symphony was originally called \"Bonaparte\". In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed \"Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man\".\n\nVerdi's chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera \"Nabucco\" is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the \"Risorgimento\". Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.\n\nRichard Taruskin of the University of California accused John Adams of \"romanticizing terrorists\" in his opera \"The Death of Klinghoffer\" (1991).\n\nRAPM (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. Shostakovich had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvardi. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in \"The Worker and the Theatre\", Shostakovich's \"The Tahitit Trot\" (from the ballet \"The Golden Age\") was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of \"ideology harmful to the proletariat\"\". Shostakovich's response was to write his third symphony, \"The First of May\" (1929) to express \"the festive mood of peaceful construction\".\n\nProkofiev wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including \"Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution\" (1937). Khachaturian's ballet \"Spartacus\" (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar. Similarly Prokofiev's music for the film \"Alexander Nevsky\" concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR. In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.\n\nStravinsky stated in 1930, \"I don't believe anyone venerates Mussolini more than I\"; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, Carl Orff's cantata \"Carmina Burana\" was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem. In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of Goebbels, who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933-45 the music of Gustav Mahler, a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic. Richard Strauss's opera \"Die Schweigsame Frau\" (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, Stefan Zweig, was a Jew.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "317947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317947", "title": "Music journalism", "text": "Music journalism\n\nMusic journalism (or \"music criticism\") is media criticism and reporting about popular music topics, including pop music, rock music, and related styles. Journalists began writing about music in the eighteenth century, providing commentary on what is now thought of as classical music. In the 2000s, a more prominent branch of music journalism is an aspect of entertainment journalism, covering popular music and including profiles of singers and bands, live concert, and album reviews.\n\nMusic journalism has its roots in classical music criticism, which has traditionally comprised the study, discussion, evaluation, and interpretation of music that has been composed and notated in a score and the evaluation of the performance of classical songs and pieces, such as symphonies and concertos .\n\nBefore about the 1840s, reporting on music was either done by musical journals, such as \"Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung\" (later the \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\"), founded by Robert Schumann, and in London journals such as \"The Musical Times\" (founded in 1844 as \"The Musical Times and Singing-class Circular\"); or else by reporters at general newspapers where music did not form part of the central objectives of the publication. An influential English 19th-century music critic, for example, was James William Davison of \"The Times.\" The composer Hector Berlioz also wrote reviews and criticisms for the Paris press of the 1830s and 1840s.\n\nModern art music journalism is often informed by music theory consideration of the many diverse elements of a musical piece or performance, including (as regards a musical composition) its form and style, and for performance, standards of technique and expression. These standards were expressed, for example, in journals such as \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\" founded by Robert Schumann, and are continued today in the columns of serious newspapers and journals such as \"The Musical Times\".\n\nSeveral factors—including growth of education, the influence of the Romantic movement generally and in music, popularization (including the 'star-status' of many performers such as Liszt and Paganini), among others—led to an increasing interest in music among non-specialist journals, and an increase in the number of critics by profession of varying degrees of competence and integrity. The 1840s could be considered a turning point, in that music critics after the 1840s generally were not also practicing musicians. However, counterexamples include Alfred Brendel, Charles Rosen, Paul Hindemith, and Ernst Krenek; all of whom were modern practitioners of the classical music tradition who also write (or wrote) on music.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a decline in the quantity of classical criticism began occurring \"when classical-music criticism visibly started to disappear\" from the media. At that time, magazines such as \"Time\" and \"Vanity Fair\" employed classical music critics, but by the early 1990s, classical critics were dropped in many magazines, in part due to \"a decline of interest in classical music, especially among younger people\".\n\nAlso of concern in classical music journalism was how American reviewers can write about ethnic and folk music from cultures other than their own, such as Indian ragas and traditional Japanese works. In 1990, the World Music Institute interviewed four \"New York Times\" music critics who came up with the following criteria on how to approach ethnic music:\n\n\nA key finding in a 2005 study of arts journalism in America was that the profile of the \"average classical music critic is a white, 52-year old male, with a graduate degree\". Demographics indicated that the group was 74% male, 92% white, and 64% had earned a graduate degree. One critic of the study pointed out that because all newspapers were included, including low-circulation regional papers, the female representation of 26% misrepresented the actual scarcity, in that the \"large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics\", with the notable exceptions of Anne Midgette in the \"New York Times\" and Wynne Delacoma in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\".\n\nIn 2007, \"The New York Times\" wrote that classical music criticism, which it characterized as \"a high-minded endeavor that has been around at least as long as newspapers\", had undergone \"a series of hits in recent months\" with the elimination, downgrading, or redefinition of critics' jobs at newspapers in Atlanta, Minneapolis, and elsewhere, citing \"New York\" magazine's Peter G. Davis, \"one of the most respected voices of the craft, [who] said he had been forced out after 26 years\". Viewing \"robust analysis, commentary and reportage as vital to the health of the art form\", \"The New York Times\" stated in 2007 that it continued to maintain \"a staff of three full-time classical music critics and three freelancers\", noting also that classical music criticism had become increasingly available on blogs, and that a number of other major newspapers \"still have full-time classical music critics\", including (in 2007) the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Washington Post\", \"The Baltimore Sun\", \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", and \"The Boston Globe\".\n\nMusic writers only started \"treating pop and rock music seriously\" in 1964 \"after the breakthrough of the Beatles\". In their book \"Rock Criticism from the Beginning\", Ulf Lindberg and his co-writers say that rock criticism appears to have been \"slower to develop in the U.S. than in England\". One of the early British music magazines, \"Melody Maker\", complained in 1967 about how \"newspapers and magazines are continually hammering [i.e., attacking] pop music\". From 1964, \"Melody Maker\" led its rival publications in terms of approaching music and musicians as a subject for serious study rather than merely entertainment. Staff reporters such as Chris Welch and Ray Coleman applied a perspective previously reserved for jazz artists to the rise of American-influenced local rock and pop groups, anticipating the advent of rock critics. Among Britain's broadsheet newspapers, pop music gained exposure in the arts section of \"The Times\" when William Mann, the paper's classical music critic, wrote an appreciation of the Beatles in December 1963. In early 1965, \"The Observer\", the country's highbrow Sunday newspaper, signalled a reversal of the establishment's cultural snobbery towards pop music by appointing George Melly as its \"critic of pop culture\". Following Tony Palmer's arrival at \"The Observer\", the first daily newspaper to employ a dedicated rock critic was \"The Guardian\", with the appointment of Geoffrey Cannon in 1968.\n\n\"Melody Maker\"s writers advocated the new forms of pop music of the late 1960s. \"By 1999, the 'quality' press was regularly carrying reviews of popular music gigs and albums\", which had a \"key role in keeping pop\" in the public eye. As more pop music critics began writing, this had the effect of \"legitimating pop as an art form\"; as a result, \"newspaper coverage shifted towards pop as music rather than pop as social phenomenon\".\n\nIn the world of pop music criticism, there has tended to be a quick turnover. The \"pop music industry\" expects that any particular rock critic will likely disappear from popular view within five years; in contrast, according to author Mark Fenster, the \"stars\" of rock criticism are more likely to have long careers with \"book contracts, featured columns, and editorial and staff positions at magazines and newspapers\". \nAuthor Bernard Gendron writes that in the United States \"the emergence of a 'serious' rock press and the rock critic\" began in 1966, presaged by Robert Shelton, the folk music critic for \"The New York Times\", writing articles praising the Beatles and Bob Dylan, the last of whom had just embraced rock 'n' roll by performing with electric backing at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Paul Williams, an eighteen-year-old student, launched the pop journal \"Crawdaddy!\" in February 1966; in June, Richard Goldstein, a recent graduate and New Journalism writer, debuted his \"Pop Eye\" column in \"The Village Voice\", which Gendron describes as \"the first regular column on rock 'n' roll ... to appear in an established cultural publication\". Rock journalist Clinton Heylin, in his role as editor of \"The Penguin Book of Rock & Roll Writing\", cites \"the true genesis of rock criticism\" to the emergence of \"Crawdaddy!\" Lindberg et al. say that, while Williams is widely considered to be the first American rock critic, he \"nevertheless looked to England for material\".\n\nAccording to Gendron, Goldstein's most significant early pieces were a \"manifesto\" on rock 'n' roll and \"pop aestheticism\", and a laudatory assessment of the Beatles' \"Revolver\" album. Published in late August, the latter article provided \"the first substantial rock review devoted to one album to appear in any nonrock magazine with accreditory power\". Whereas Williams could be sure of a sympathetic readership, given the nature of his publication, Goldstein's task was to win over a more highbrow readership to the artistic merits of contemporary pop music. At this time, both Goldstein and Williams gained considerable renown in the cultural mainstream and were the subject of profile articles in \"Newsweek\".\n\nThe emergence of rock journalism coincided with an attempt to position rock music, particularly the Beatles' work, in the American cultural landscape. The critical discourse was further heightened by the respectful coverage afforded the genre in mainstream publications such as \"Newsweek\", \"Time\" and \"Life\" in the months leading up to and following the release of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album in June 1967. Within this discourse, Richard Meltzer, in an essay for \"Crawdaddy!\" in March, challenged the highbrow aesthetic of rock proposed by Goldstein. The latter's mixed review of \"Sgt. Pepper\" in \"The New York Times\" was similarly the subject of journalistic debate, and invited reprisals from musicologists, composers and cultural commentators.\n\nAmong other young American writers who became pop columnists following Goldstein's appointment were Robert Christgau (at \"Esquire\", from June 1967), Ellen Willis (\"The New Yorker\", March 1968) and Ellen Sander (\"Saturday Review\", October 1968). Christgau was the \"originator of the 'consumer guide' approach to pop music reviews\", an approach that was designed to help readers decide whether to buy a new album.\n\nAccording to popular music academic Roy Shuker in 1994, music reference books such as \"The Rolling Stone Record Guide\" and \"\" played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers in the music industry, \"constructing their own version of the traditional high/low culture split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism\". These review collections, Shuker continues, \"became bibles in the field, establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists. Record collectors and enthusiasts, and specialisation and secondhand record shops, inevitably have well-thumbed copies of these and similar volumes close at hand.\"\n\nIn the realm of rock music, as in that of classical music, critics have not always been respected by their subjects. Frank Zappa declared that \"Most rock journalism is people who can't write, interviewing people who can't talk, for people who can't read.\" In the Guns N' Roses song \"Get in the Ring\", Axl Rose verbally attacked critics who gave the band negative reviews because of their actions on stage; such critics as Andy Secher, Mick Wall and Bob Guccione Jr. were mentioned by name.\n\nIn the 2000s, online music bloggers began to supplement, and to some degree displace, music journalists in print media. In 2006, Martin Edlund of the \"New York Sun\" criticized the trend, arguing that while the \"Internet has democratized music criticism, it seems it's also spread its penchant for uncritical hype\".\n\nCarl Wilson described \"an upsurge in pro-pop sentiment among critics\" during the early 2000s, writing that a \"new generation [of music critics] moved into positions of critical influence\" and then \"mounted a wholesale critique against the syndrome of measuring all popular music by the norms of rock culture\".\n\n\"Slate\" magazine writer Jody Rosen discussed the 2000s-era trends in pop music criticism in his article \"The Perils of Poptimism\". Rosen noted that much of the debate is centered on a perception that rock critics regard rock as \"normative ... the standard state of popular music ... to which everything else is compared\". At a 2006 pop critic conference, attendees discussed their \"guilty pop pleasures, reconsidering musicians (Tiny Tim, Dan Fogelberg, Phil Collins) and genres (blue-eyed soul, Muzak)\" which rock critics have long dismissed as lightweight, commercial music. Rosen stated that \"this new critical paradigm\" is called \"popism\" – or, more evocatively (and goofily), \"poptimism\". The poptimism approach states: \"Pop (and, especially, hip-hop) producers are as important as rock auteurs, Beyoncé is as worthy of serious consideration as Bruce Springsteen, and ascribing shame to pop pleasure is itself a shameful act.\"\nIn 2008, Ann Powers of the \"Los Angeles Times\" argued that pop music critics \"have always been contrarians\", because \"pop music [criticism] rose up as a challenge to taste hierarchies, and has remained a pugilistic, exhibitionist business throughout pop's own evolution\". Powers claimed that \"[i]nsults, rejections of others' authority, bratty assertions of superior knowledge and even threats of physical violence are the stuff of which pop criticism is made\", while at the same time, the \"best [pop criticism] also offers loving appreciation and profound insights about how music creates and collides with our everyday realities\". She stated that pop criticism developed as a \"slap at the establishment, at publications such as the hippie homestead \"Rolling Stone\" and the rawker outpost \"Creem\"\", adding that the \"1980s generation\" of post-punk indie rockers had in the mid-2000s \"been taken down by younger 'poptimists,' who argue that lovers of underground rock are elitists for not embracing the more multicultural mainstream\". Powers likened the poptimist critics' debates about bands and styles to a \"scrum in rugby\", in that \"[e]verybody pushes against everybody else, and we move forward in a huge blob of vehement opinion and mutual judgment\".\n\nMusic critic and indie pop musician Scott Miller, in his 2010 book \"\", suggested, \"Part of the problem is that a lot of vital pop music is made by 22-year-olds who enjoy shock value, and it's pathetic when their elders are cornered into unalloyed reverence\". Miller suggested that critics could navigate this problem by being prepared \"to give young artists credit for terrific music without being intimidated into a frame of mind where dark subject matter always gets a passing grade\", stating that a critic should be able to call a young artist \"a musical genius\" while \"in the same breath declaring that his or her lyrics are morally objectionable.\" Reacting to the state of pop music criticism, Miller identified a major issue as critics' failure to \"credit an artist with getting a feeling across\", specifically pointing out critic Lester Bangs as \"a ball of emotion at all times\", who nonetheless \"never really related to his favorite artists as people who develop a skill of conveying feelings. You don't feel that he comfortably acknowledged being moved as a result of their honest work. Artists in his writing were vaguely ridiculous, fascinating primitives, embodying an archetype by accident of nature.\"\n\n\"Jezebel\"s Tracy Moore, in 2014, suggested that one of the virtues of writing about how music made one feel, in contrast with linking it to the sounds of other artists, was to avoid excluding readers who may not have musical knowledge as broad as that of the writer. In contrast, Miller believed that analytical readers would appreciate \"more music talk in music criticism\", suggesting that \"sensitively modest doses\" of musical analysis would provide helpful support for a conclusion \"that great melody writing occurred or it didn't\". For example, Miller noted that critics rarely \"identify catchy melodies as specific passages within a song\", in the way that working musicians might discuss \"the A-minor in the second measure of the chorus\".\n\nStevie Chick, a writer who teaches music journalism at City University London, said, \"I think more than any other journalism, music journalism has got a really powerful creative writing quotient to it.\"\n\nTris McCall of the \"Newark Star-Ledger\" discussed his approach to music criticism in a 2010 interview, stating, \"Most of us [critics] begin writing about music because we love it so much. We can't wait to tell our friends and neighbors about what we're hearing.\" According to McCall, even over the course of a long professional career, the enthusiastic impulse to share \"never fades\". McCall expressed his interest in \"examining why people respond to what they respond to. I hazard guesses. Sometimes I'm wrong, but I hope I'm always provocative.\"\n\nApplying critical theory (\"e.g.\", critical gender studies and critical race theory) to music journalism, some academic writers suggest that mutual disrespect between critics and artists is one of many negative effects of rockism. In 2004, critic Kelefa Sanneh defined \"rockism\" as \"idolizing the authentic old legend (or underground hero) while mocking the latest pop star\". Music journalism \"infected\" with rockism has become, according to Yale professor Daphne Brooks, a challenge \"for those of us concerned with historical memory and popular music performance\".\n\nSimon Frith said that pop and rock music \"are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour\". According to Holly Kruse, both popular music articles and academic articles about pop music are usually written from \"masculine subject positions\". Kembrew McLeod analyzed terms used by critics to differentiate between pop music and rock, finding a gendered dichotomy in descriptions of \"'serious,' 'raw,' and 'sincere' rock music as distinguished from 'trivial', 'fluffy,' and 'formulaic' pop music\". McLeod found that a likely cause of this dichotomy was the lack of women writing in music journalism: \"By 1999, the number of female editors or senior writers at \"Rolling Stone\" hovered around a whopping 15%, [while] at \"Spin\" and \"Raygun\", [it was] roughly 20%.\" Criticism associated with gender was graphically discussed in a 2014 \"Jezebel\" article about the struggles of women in music journalism, written by music critic Tracy Moore, previously an editor at the \"Nashville Scene\". Moore described how another female music blogger, an \"admitted outsider\" who threatened no stereotypes, was greeted with enthusiasm by men, in contrast with Moore's own experiences as a self-described \"insider\" who was nevertheless expected to \"prove\" or \"earn\" her way into a male-dominated journalism scene.\n\nAccording to Anwen Crawford, music critic for Australia's \"The Monthly\", the \"problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago\"; as a result, \"most famous rock-music critics – Robert Christgau, Greil Marcus, Lester Bangs, Nick Kent – are all male\". Crawford points to \"[t]he record store, the guitar shop, and now social media: when it comes to popular music, these places become stages for the display of male prowess\", and adds, \"Female expertise, when it appears, is repeatedly dismissed as fraudulent. Every woman who has ever ventured an opinion on popular music could give you some variation [of this experience] ...and becoming a recognized 'expert' (a musician, a critic) will not save [women] from accusations of fakery.\"\n\nDaphne Brooks, in her 2008 article \"The Write to Rock: Racial Mythologies, Feminist Theory, and the Pleasures of Rock Music Criticism\", wrote that in order to restructure music criticism, one must \"focus on multiple \"counter\"narratives\" to break away from racial and gender biases as embodied in \"contemporary cultural fetishizations of white male performative virtuosity and latent black male innovations\". Brooks focused on \"the ways that rock music criticism has shaped and continues to shape our understandings of racialized music encounters, and what are the alternative stories that we might tell\". Brooks pointed to Christgau's statement that, after the Beatles' arrival in America, \"rock criticism embraced a dream or metaphor of perpetual revolution. Worthwhile bands were supposed to change people's lives, preferably for the better. If they failed to do so, that meant they didn't matter.\" Unsurprisingly, according to Brooks, \"the history of women who've been sustaining a tradition of writing about rock since the 60's\" has been \"largely hidden in American culture\".\n\nBrooks theorized that perceptions of female artists of color might be different if there were more women of color writing about them, and praised Ellen Willis as a significant feminist critic of rock's classic era. Willis, who was a columnist for the \"New Yorker\" from 1968 to 1975, believed society could be enlightened by the \"ecstatic experience\" of visions expressed through music's rhythm and noise and that such joy would lead people to different ways of sharing. Brooks wrote that \"the confluence of cultural studies, rock studies, and third wave feminist critical studies makes it possible now more than ever to continue to critique and reinterrogate the form and content of popular music histories\". In Brooks' view, \"By bravely breaking open dense equations of gender, class, power, and subcultural music scenes\", music journalists, activists and critics such as Ellen Willis have been \"able to brilliantly, like no one before [them], challenge the intellectual and political activism and agency\" of the entire music industry.\n\n"}

{"id": "1337267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1337267", "title": "Needle time", "text": "Needle time\n\nNeedle time was created in the United Kingdom by the Musicians' Union and Phonographic Performance Limited to restrict the amount of recorded music that could be transmitted by the BBC during the course of any 24-hour period. The number of hours per week allowed gradually increased over the years from below 30 hours in the 1950s. Until 1967 the BBC was allowed to play only five hours per day of commercial gramophone records on the air. It continued to affect BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2 and the Independent Local Radio stations until 1988.\n\nThe result was that the BBC had to use \"cover\" versions of popular songs by groups such as Shane Fenton and the Fentones recorded at the BBC studios, or orchestral versions by one of the in-house orchestras, to fill in the hours.\n\nThe term \"needle time\" comes from the use (at the time) of gramophone records as the main source of recorded music, which were played on gramophone record players using a gramophone needle.\n\nUnlike American records, British records at the time carried a warning message around the edge of the record label in the centre of the record itself to the effect that: \"Unauthorised public performance or broadcasting of this record is strictly prohibited.\"\n\nAlthough the record industry in Britain wanted the public to buy its records, it had to give them some airtime so that the public could find out about their existence. To that end the record industry used the commercial nighttime signals from Radio Luxembourg whose powerful AM signal could be heard in the UK. The \"208\" shows on Luxembourg were mainly fifteen minutes to thirty minutes in length and presented under names such as the \"Decca Records Show\" or the \"Capitol Records Show\". These prerecorded programmes resembled what later became known as Infomercials, because they normally only featured a little over half of the record, with heavy plugging for title, artist and label.\n\nBecause all the hours of transmission were booked up by the major record companies (EMI, Decca, Pye, Philips etc.) groups and artists had to sign to them to get any exposure. This was one of the driving forces for Ronan O'Rahilly and others to start the first pirate radio station to get exposure for artists he represented.\n\nUnlike the BBC or Radio Luxembourg, the offshore pirate radio stations of the 1960s operated not only outside the three-mile limit of territorial waters, but also in a grey area of the law. Because the studios and transmitters were located on board the ships or offshore structures, the personnel on board were only under the authority of the captain of that ship or structure. In the case of ship stations such as Wonderful Radio London which introduced top 40 radio to Britain, the ship was actually registered in a foreign country and therefore subject to the laws of that country, which of course did not recognize \"needle time\". Payola operated on several of these stations.\n\n"}
{"id": "555566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555566", "title": "On the Sublime", "text": "On the Sublime\n\nOn the Sublime (Περì Ὕψους Perì Hýpsous) is a Roman-era Greek work of literary criticism dated to the 1st century AD. Its author is unknown, but is conventionally referred to as Longinus (; \"Longĩnos\") or Pseudo-Longinus. It is regarded as a classic work on aesthetics and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the sublime.\n\nThe author's identity has been debated for centuries. The oldest surviving manuscript, from the 10th century, indicates the original author was named \"Dionysius or Longinus\", which was later misread as \"Dionysius Longinus\". Subsequent interpretations have attributed the work to Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1st century) or Cassius Longinus (c. 213–273 AD), though neither is now widely accepted.\n\nThe author is unknown. In the 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports \"Dionysius or Longinus\", an ascription by the medieval copyist that was misread as \"by Dionysius Longinus.\" When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to Cassius Longinus (c. 213–273 AD). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named \"Dionysius\", some have attributed the work to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a writer of the 1st century AD. There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the Roman Empire, likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the codex was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology.\n\nAmong further names proposed, are Hermagoras (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), Aelius Theon (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of \"On the Sublime\"), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius).\n\nDionysius of Halicarnassus wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of \"On the Sublime\", since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work \"On the Sublime\" in style and thought.\n\nCredited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was disciple of Plotinus, and considered \"the most distinguished scholar of his day.\" He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to Zenobia, the queen of Palmyra. Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned (the latest is Cicero, who died in 43 BC) and the work is now usually dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as Tacitus, Petronius and Quintilian, who also dealt with the subject, were alive. Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD were on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor.\n\n\"On the Sublime\" is both a treatise on aesthetics and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost.\n\nThe treatise is dedicated to Posthumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. \"On the Sublime\" is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted. Along with the expected examples from Homer and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from \"Genesis\", which is quite unusual for the 1st century:\n\nGiven his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture. As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have \"moral excellence\". In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world \"either by modesty or by prudential motives\". Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem \"bold, lawless, and original\". As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, \"never did a slave become an orator\". On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the sublime writer.\n\nLonginus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing. Longinus ultimately promotes an \"elevation of style\" and an essence of \"simplicity\". To quote this famous author, \"the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions.\" The concept of the sublime is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself \"above the ordinary\". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: \"great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement\".\n\nThe effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by Sappho, the so-called \"Ode to Jealousy\", defined as a \"Sublime ode\". A writer's goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience.\n\nIn the treatise, the author asserts that \"the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone's grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener\".\n\nAccording to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a \"great soul\" (, \"megalophrosunēs apēchēma\"). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources (\"aspiration to vigorous concepts\" and \"strong and enthusiastic passion\") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and \"dignified and high composition\").\n\nThe author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of personal freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If Petronius pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, Tacitus was nearer to Longinus in thinking that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.\n\nTranslators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The \"sublime\" in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word sublime, argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus' objective broadly concerns \"the essentials of a noble and impressive style\" than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing; Longinus' segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining. Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus' contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way.\n\nDespite Longinus' critical acclaim, his writing is far from perfect. Longinus' occasional enthusiasm becomes \"carried away\" and creates some confusion as to the meaning of his text. Furthermore, 18th-century critic Edward Burnaby Greene finds Longinus, at times, to be \"too refined\". Greene also claims that Longinus' focus on hyperbolical descriptions is \"particularly weak, and misapplied.\" Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of \"tediousness\" in treating his subjects. The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers. Finally, Longinus' treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of \"practical rules of a teachable kind.\"\n\nDespite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its \"noble tone,\" \"apt precepts,\" \"judicious attitude,\" and \"historical interests\". One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote \"On the Sublime\" is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains \"personal and fresh,\" unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole. Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on \"greatness of style\" than \"technical rules.\" Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a \"master of candor and good-nature\". Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times. In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.\n\nAs far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic Koine Greek to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation.\n\nIn reading \"On the Sublime\", critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a \"great hero\" to Longinus. Not only does Longinus come to Plato's defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus' rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, Caecilius of Calacte.\n\n\nGerman film director Werner Herzog claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled \"On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth\", presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus's notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: \"For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33846270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33846270", "title": "Oxide jacking", "text": "Oxide jacking\n\nThe expansive force of rusting, which may be called oxide jacking or rust burst, is a phenomenon that can cause damage to structures made of stone, masonry, concrete or ceramics, and reinforced with metal components. A definition is \"the displacement of building elements due to the expansion of iron and steel products as the metal rusts and becomes iron oxide\". Corrosion of other metals such as aluminum can also cause oxide jacking.\n\nAccording to metallurgist Jack Harris, \"Oxidation is usually accompanied by a net expansion so that when it occurs in a confined space stresses are generated in the metal component itself or in any surrounding medium such as stone or cement. So much energy is released by oxidation that the stresses generated are of sufficient magnitude to deform or fracture all known materials.\"\n\nAs early as 1915, it was recognized that certain modern metal alloys are more susceptible to excessive oxidation when subjected to weathering than other metals. At that time, there was a trend to replace wrought iron fasteners with mild steel equivalents, which were less expensive. Unexpectedly, the mild steel fasteners failed in real world use much more quickly than anticipated, leading to a return to use of wrought iron in certain applications where length of service was important.\n\nIn a 1987 article in \"New Scientist\", Jack Harris reported that oxide jacking has caused significant damage to many historic structures in the United Kingdom, including St Paul's Cathedral, the British Museum and the Albert Memorial in London, Gloucester Cathedral, St. Margaret's Church in King's Lynn, Winchester Cathedral, and Blackburn Cathedral.\n\nHarris also wrote that oxide jacking also damaged the ancient Horses of Saint Mark on the exterior of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice. Expansive rusting of iron and steel bolts and reinforcements affected the structural integrity of the copper horse sculptures, which were relocated indoors and replaced with replicas. Poorly-designed early 20th-century renovations also led to oxide jacking damage to the Acropolis of Athens.\n\nIn the United States, rusting of iron pegs inserted into holes in the stone entrance stair in order to support handrails resulted in cracking of the steps at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Notre Dame, Indiana.\n\nOxide jacking damaged the terra cotta cornice on the Land Title Building in Philadelphia, designed in 1897 and expanded in 1902 by pioneer skyscraper architect Daniel Burnham. The Land Title complex, with its two interconnected towers, is on the National Register of Historic Places. By 1922, experts on architectural terra cotta were warning that the rusting of embedded iron fasteners could cause decorative building components to fail. This 1902 cornice is nearly high, projects from the facade of the building and is long. The cornice was stabilized, steel anchors subject to rusting were replaced with new stainless steel anchors, and the cornice was completely renovated. The project was completed in 1991.\n\nFlooding in 2007 damaged the modernist Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, designed in 1945 by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and now owned by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Among the damage discovered by an architect inspecting the house in 2007 was oxide jacking at the corners of the house's steel framework. The house flooded again in 2008.\n\nStructures built of concrete and reinforced with metal rebar are also subject to damage by oxide jacking. Expansion of corroded rebar causes spalling of the concrete. Structures exposed to a marine environment, or where salt is used for de-icing purposes, are especially susceptible to this type of damage.\n\nResearch in the 1960s showed that 22% of concrete bridge decks in Pennsylvania showed signs of spalling due to oxide jacking within four years of construction. Oxide jacking caused widespread damage to concrete council houses built in the United Kingdom in the post World War II era.\n\nAccording to an expert in the field, the problem resulted in \"intensive worldwide research into the causes and repair of reinforcement corrosion, which in turn led to a vast output of research papers, conferences and publications on the subject.\"\n\nCountertop components fabricated out of granite and other natural stones are sometimes reinforced with metal rods inserted into grooves cut into the underside of the stone, and bonded in place with various resins. This procedure is called \"rodding\" by countertop fabricators. Most commonly, these rods will be placed near sink cutouts to prevent cracking of the brittle stone countertop during transportation and installation. Data published by the Marble Institute of America shows that this technique results in a 600% increase in the deflection strength of the component.\n\nHowever, if a metal rod subject to oxidation or other forms of corrosion is used, and moisture from a sink or faucet reaches the rod, oxide jacking can crack the countertop directly above the rod. Mild steel and some grades of aluminium rods are known to cause oxide jacking failures in granite countertops. Skilled stone repair professionals can disassemble the cracked stone, remove the metal rod, and reassemble the stone using various resins tinted to match the colors of the stone. This type of problem can be prevented by using reinforcing rods made of stainless steel or fiberglass in the rodding procedure.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1866206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1866206", "title": "Pipe rolls", "text": "Pipe rolls\n\nThe Pipe rolls, sometimes called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls of the Pipe, are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.\n\nThey were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.\n\nThe Pipe rolls are named after the \"pipe\" shape formed by the rolled up parchments on which the records were originally written. There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they \"piped\" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or pipe of wine. They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.\n\nThe Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually conducted at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.\n\nThe earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129–30, and the continuous series begins in 1155–56, and continued for almost seven hundred years.\n\nCombined with the Domesday Survey, the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the Norman kings (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s. The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England, although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear. A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) and Richard I (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the Duchy of Normandy in France. It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start. An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.\n\nThe \"Dialogus de Scaccario\" or \"Dialogue concerning the Exchequer\", written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The \"Dialogue\" was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the \"Dialogue\", the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The \"Dialogue\" also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.\n\nThe main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king. Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded. The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock. The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of geld, a form of land tax dating from Anglo-Saxon times, although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld. By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the Assizes, or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls. Scutage payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.\n\nAlthough they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, wardships, and ecclesiastical vacancies. Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate. A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the Forest Law, which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared royal forest. However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.\n\nExpenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses, wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons, hunting expenses, payments to acquire a governmental office, payments to mercenaries, and the costs of bags and casks to transport silver pennies about the kingdom.\n\nInformation about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons. The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles. The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as William Longchamp, who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.\n\nCertain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.\n\nAlthough the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years. An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the Cotton Library at the British Museum. Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign, but others feel that they were introduced by King William I (reigned 1066–1087). The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian Pauline Stafford argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of Cnut (reigned 1016–1035), Æthelred II (reigned 978–1016), and Edgar the Peaceable (reigned 959–975). There is a reference to the king's \"rolls\" in a writ from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of Westminster of ten shillings, but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later cartulary, and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.\n\nAfter the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).\n\nThe surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of £24,500. This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850. The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225. Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.\n\nBy the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of \"receipt rolls\" and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls. A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate \"Estreat rolls\", and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls. In 1284 the \"Statutes of Rhuddlan\" were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls. At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a \"d\" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.\n\nYet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the \"Cowick Ordinance\" of June 1323, along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that Walter de Stapledon held the office of Treasurer. Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the \"Cowick Ordinance\" attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts. Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of customs receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls. New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records. The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.\n\nIn 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.\n\nThe Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.\n\nThey were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about wide. The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe. They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the Patent Rolls were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.\n\nSometimes they are referred to, in Latin, as \"magnus rotulus pipae\". Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, Adelard of Bath, who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.\n\nThe rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650. During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the Chancellor, and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor. The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material.\n\nThe example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the Bishop of Winchester, which are extant from 1208, and form a continuous series from that date. They started under Peter des Roches, who was also a royal clerk and administrator. They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for Eleanor of England, wife of Simon de Montfort, survive for part of the year 1265.\n\nA number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.\n\nThe Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.\n\nThe earliest Pipe rolls were published by the Record Commission in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the Public Record Office in 1844 (the rolls for 1155–58). The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.\n\nIn 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a text publication society) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of Walford Dakin Selby and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls. It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224. Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the Yale University Press. Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in \"record type\", designed to produce a near-facsimile of the original manuscript, including its scribal abbreviations. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.\n\nThe Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II. Rolls for the Irish Exchequer and the Norman Exchequer have also been published.\n\n\n"}

It is listed by the National Trust of Australia and is on the Victorian Heritage Register.\n\nEntertainment on the site of today's Princess Theatre dates back to the Gold Rush years of 1854, when entrepreneur Tom Moore constructed a large, barn-like structure called Astley's Amphitheatre. The venue featured a central ring for equestrian entertainment and a stage at one end for dramatic performances. It was named in honour of the Astley Royal Amphitheatre, also known as Astley's Amphitheatre, near Westminster Bridge, London.\n\nIt was soon leased by the prolific actor-manager George Coppin, who had already established himself as an actor at the Queen's Theatre, and would go on to build the Olympic (known as the 'Iron Pot') on the corner of Exhibition and Lonsdale Streets - the future site of the Comedy Theatre, build the Haymarket Theatre and Apollo Music Hall, and lease (and eventually rebuild) the Theatre Royal in Bourke Street.\n\nIn 1857, the amphitheatre was extensively renovated and the facade extended, re-opening as the Princess Theatre and Opera House. \n\nBy 1885, the theatre came under the control of 'The Triumvirate', a partnership between J. C. Williamson, George Musgrove and Arthur Garner. The existing theatre had become rundown, and so the Triumvirate resolved to demolish the existing building. \n\nThe new theatre, designed by architect William Pitt, interiors designed by George Gordon, and built by Cockram and Comely, was completed in 1886 at a cost of £50,000. The design is in the exuberant Second Empire style, and the theatre forms part of the Victorian streetscape of Spring Street.\n\nWhen completed, it featured Australia's first sliding or retractable roof and ceiling. It also featured state-of-the-art electrical stage lighting.\n\nThe theatre re-opened, again, on 18 December 1886, with a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado\". The marble staircase and foyer was hailed as equal to that of the Paris Opera, the Frankfurt Stadt and the Grand in Bordeaux.\n\nWilliamson left the Triumvirate in 1899 to form his own company, and Musgrove continued operate the theatre until 1910. The Princess came under a rapid succession of different owners until 1915, when Ben Fuller took control. Fuller then went into partnership with Hugh J. Ward, and in 1922 they engaged the architect Henry Eli White to extensively renovate the auditorium and foyers, and add the grand copper awning. The New Princess Theatre reopened on 26 December 1922 with a performance of \"The O'Brien Girl\".\n\nThe theatre was purchased from Fuller in 1933 by Efftee Films, the film production company of F. W. Thring, the theatrical and film entrepreneur, who had his initials FT carved over the proscenium arch. He produced several musicals there, and made it the first home of his radio station 3XY, founded 1935.\n\nWhen F.W. Thring died, Ben Fuller and Garnett Carroll took over the lease of the Princess in Melbourne and in 1946 they formed another partnership forming Carroll-Fuller Theatres Ltd to purchase the Princess Theatre.\n\nAfter Sir Ben Fuller's death in 1952, Garnet H. Carroll assumed complete control For the following 12 years, often in association with other entrepreneurs, he presented an eclectic array of opera, ballet, musical comedy and drama, though he was constrained by the lack of an interstate circuit. At the Princess in 1954 he hosted the National Theatre Movement’s gala performance of \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Other notable productions included Ballet Rambert (1947-48), the Old Vic Theatre Company with Sir Laurence (Lord) Olivier and Vivien Leigh (1948), the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company (1949), the Vienna Boys' Choir (1954), the Chinese Classical Theatre (1956) and the Sadler's Wells Opera Company (1960 and 1962). Garnett Carroll often staged elaborate American musicals—among them \"Kismet\" (which he himself produced in 1954), \"The Sound of Music\" (1960), \"The King and I\" (1960) and \"Carousel\" (1964)—while they were still in their early months on Broadway, and tried unknown singers and actors.\n\nGarnett Carroll died on 23 August 1964 and ownership passed to his son, John Carroll. For some years he maintained the pattern set by his father, but in 1969 the family company, Carroll Freeholds Pty Ltd, leased the Princess to the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. Over time, the theatre was used less frequently, and the theatre fell into disrepair.\n\nIn 1986, David Marriner purchased the theatre and commenced a renovation and refurbishment to restore the building to its 1922 state, and improve its technical capacity. The refurbished theatre reopened on 9 December 1989 with the musical \"Les Misérables\", followed by \"The Phantom of the Opera\", which established a new record for the longest running show ever staged in Victoria.\n\nThe Princess Theatre continues to be owned and operated by the Marriner Group as a venue for major musical theatre productions, including \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"MAMMA MIA!\", \"Jersey Boys\" and \"The Book of Mormon\". \n\nIn 2017, it was announced that the international production \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" would open at the Princess Theatre in early 2019 for an exclusive Australian season, as just the third location for the production after London and New York. The theatre underwent a comprehensive internal and external refurbishment in 2018 in preparation for the production.\n\nThe theatre has experienced several reported ghost sightings.\n\nOn the evening of 3 March 1888, the baritone Frederick Baker, known under the stage name \"Frederick Federici\", was performing the role of Mephistopheles in Gounod's opera \"Faust\". This production ended with Mephistopheles sinking dramatically through a trapdoor returning to the fires of hell with his prize, the unfortunate Dr Faustus. As Federici was lowered down through the stage into this basement, he had a heart attack and died almost immediately. He never came back onstage to take his bows, but when the company was told of what had happened at the end of the opera, they said that he had been onstage and taken the bows with them. Since then, various people have claimed to see a ghostly figure in evening dress at the theatre. For many years, a third-row seat in the dress circle was kept vacant in his honour.\n\nNotable productions at the Princess Theatre include:\n\nIt has also been used as a venue for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, including the stage show Puppet Up! in 2007.\n\n"}
{"id": "37110651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37110651", "title": "Public bookcase", "text": "Public bookcase\n\nA public bookcase is a cabinet which may be freely and anonymously used for the exchange and storage of books without the formalities associated with libraries. When in public places these cabinets are of a robust and weatherproof design which are available at all times. However, cabinets installed in public or commercial buildings may be simple, unmodified book-shelves and may only be available during certain periods.\n\nClosely allied with the BookCrossing concept, the original public bookcases were conceived as artistic acts. Very early examples are the creations of performance artist duo Clegg & Guttmann in 1991. Collections of bookcases were conceived as \"free open-air libraries\" in Darmstadt and Hannover in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2002, the Bonn Community Foundation awarded Trixy Royeck funding for her idea \"outdoor books – books in the open\" which she submitted while studying interior design in Mainz and since this time the concept has been widely replicated. A public bookcase opened in 2010 in Vienna, Austria. In Basel, Switzerland, where many coffee shops and other venues host open bookshelves, a public bookcase was unveiled in June 2011.\n\nOpen bookcases are financed by a wide range of organisations (individuals, foundations, Lions Clubs, civic associations, and so on). Visitors to the bookcases decide which books to deposit and borrow, and whether to return or exchange borrowed books for others.\n\nIf a public bookcase is centrally and accessibly located and is stocked with sufficient material, public bookcases are quickly and widely appreciated. Vandalism has occurred in some places and, in successful cases, is countered by \"bookcase sponsors\" or \"godfathers\" who devote their time and attention to care of the collection.\n\nThe acceptance, motivation and user-profile of public bookshelves was examined in 2008 by a study at the University of Bonn. It was found that the system had developed as a notable alternative to conventional bookstores. One cannot equate public bookcases with classic peer-to-peer exchange, but they certainly represent the voluntary transfer of goods. Surveyed users also indicated that they believed that regular use of public bookcases could function as an example for similar schemes for other desirable goods. This acceptance has led to a rapid dissemination of public bookshelves throughout Germany. It has been found that durable construction and storm-resistance promote sustained use.\n\nIn Oerlinghausen there is a modified version of the public bookcase. A small bookcase has been installed in Simon Square by the Friends of The Public Library, in collaboration with the Cohabitation/Society/Culture group of the local Agenda 21. These groups stock the bookcase as needed from a so-called \"book exchange\", a larger public event which has taken place in the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Haus in Oerlingsausen-South every Saturday since 2007. One may also deposit book requests to be matched from stock by the operators of the exchange.\n\nThe Salbke Bookmark is a large, open-air construction which includes a number of public bookcases. Originally built on the site of a demolished library in a depopulated district of Magdeburg, the local civic association has moved much of the stock to a nearby vacant shop where more than 10000 donations are securely housed.\n\nA cafe in Marburg includes a public bookcase. The city library now includes a cabinet of books which may be freely taken or exchanged by patrons rather than organising complex book disposal events. The operation of this variant combines the library's daily operations with community control. As the bookcase is located in a protected space it does not require sponsorship or weather protection.\n\nIn the United States, small enclosed bookcases, usually in front of residences, have become a common sight in many cities. Some of these are officially registered with the Little Free Library network. In Europe many public bookcases are registered via the Open Book Case project. The Open source /crowdsourcing mapping project OpenStreetMap has a designated tag for registering the location types and more of public bookcases. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "9881948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9881948", "title": "Rival Poet", "text": "Rival Poet\n\nThe Rival Poet is one of several characters, either fictional or real persons, featured in William Shakespeare's sonnets. The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the Fair Youth group in sonnets 78–86. Several theories about these characters, the Rival Poet included, have been expounded, and scholarly debate continues to put forward both conflicting and compelling arguments. In the context of these theories, the speaker of the poem sees the Rival Poet as a competitor for fame, wealth and patronage.\n\nAmong others, George Chapman, Christopher Marlowe, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Barnabe Barnes, Gervase Markham, and Richard Barnfield have been proposed as identities for the Rival Poet.\n\nChapman was a prominent poet and translator of Homer. Scholars speculate that Shakespeare was familiar with his work, having read part of his translation of the \"Iliad\" for his own \"Troilus and Cressida\", a dramatic reworking of Chaucer's epic poem. Chapman wrote \"Ovid's Banquet Of Sense\", a metaphysical poem seen as a response to the erotic \"Venus and Adonis,\" which incidentally features Shakespeare's most quoted poet, Ovid. In \"Shakespeare and the Rival Poet\", Acheson conjectures that Chapman's erotic poems were written with a view to gaining Southampton's patronage. The moral tone of \"Ovid's Banquet of Sense\" eschews the amatory tone of Shakespeare's, and seeks to instill spiritual seriousness in a work that takes the five senses as its Conceits. Chapman's patrons also moved in the same circles as Shakespeare's; thus Shakespeare may have felt insecure about the stability of his own income versus a talented rival. Chapman was both then and now regarded as being particularly erudite, whereas, as Ben Jonson writes, Shakespeare had \"small Latine and lesse Greeke\".\n\nMarlowe was more highly regarded as a dramatist than a poet, his chief poetical work, \"Hero and Leander,\" remaining incomplete at the time of his death (it was subsequently completed by Chapman). Due to Marlowe's relatively small dramatic output as compared with Shakespeare, it's unlikely that he would have been the subject of Shakespeare's sonnets, i.e. considered a serious rival. By the time Shakespeare began his works Marlowe was a well-established playwright but the two had a very important artistic relationship. In his book \"The Genius of Shakespeare\", Jonathan Bate notes \"the two-way traffic between Marlowe and Shakespeare until the latter’s death\". Shakespeare strove to outdo Marlowe and through their artistic competition they would push one another to higher achievements in dramatic literature. This competition could have also motivated the Rival Poet sonnets.\n\nIt has also been suggested that the Rival Poet is an amalgam of several of Shakespeare’s contemporaries instead of a single person. This is indicated by the fluctuation between singular and plural addresses of the rival(s) in the sonnet sequence. In Sonnet 78 the Speaker refers to other poets who have gained inspiration from the Fair Youth but in 79 the Speaker is only concerned with one \"he\", a potentially \"worthier pen\". Sonnet 80 continues the singular reference but by 82 the Speaker reverts to the plural \"writers\". In 83 he refers to \"both your poets\" indicating that the Speaker is one poet and the Rival is the other. According to MacD. P. Jackson, Sonnet 86 is \"the most powerful of the group [and] the most detailed in its characterization of one specific Rival Poet\". While arguably the most powerful of this sonnet grouping, one cannot neglect the oscillation between singular and plural seen throughout the group as a whole. This discrepancy makes it difficult to isolate one specific poet to claim the title of Rival.\n\nThe Speaker's attitude towards the Rival is also difficult to pinpoint. Some critics, such as R. Gittings, believe that much of the Poet’s comments on his rival should be read as ironic or satiric. Jackson maintains that the Poet's feelings toward the Rival shift between varying degrees of admiration and criticism. This also indicates a multitude of rivals. As the Poet's confidence ebbs and flows along with his impression of his rival(s), the identity of the rival(s) also fluctuates.\n\nA final defense for the Multiple Rivals Theory relies on a dating of the Rival Poet sonnets between 1598–1600. While this frame of reference has support, so do other possible dates and there will always be controversy regarding dating of individual sonnets. However, if it is assumed that this grouping was published between 1598 and 1600, a publication by Francis Meres comes into play. In 1598, Meres published \"Palladis Tamia; Wits Treasury\" with a chapter titled \"A Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with the Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets\" in which he documents the critical esteem of the poets of the day. Shakespeare received high praise for his dramatic work but Marlowe and Chapman were deemed England's \"two excellent poets\". This, according to Jackson, \"must surely have helped provoke the Rival Poet series\".\n\n"}

She was the daughter of Chief Verifier of the brännvin manufacturing in Sweden, Emil Anderson (1843–1910), called \"Mille\". She had two siblings when her mother died in childbirth and gained three half siblings after her father remarried. Her brother was the sculptor Carl Milles (1875–1955) and her half brother Evert Milles (1885–1960) was an architect. Unlike her brother Carl, Milles was a college educated artist. She studied at the \"Tekniska Skolan\" (the Technical School), predecessor to the Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm in 1892–93, after which she went on to the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1894–98, where she was considered talented enough to skip a year. She would also visit the Theosophical Society which became influential for her future works.\n\nIn the autumn of 1898, Milles left for Paris, approximately a year after her brother Carl had moved there. She studied at the Académie Colarossi and École des Beaux-Arts, and used Paris as base for journeys through France and Germany. Milles and her brother spent much time together in Paris where they collaborated, artistically and economically, in a joint company they started. Among other things, the company sold small bronze figurines, depicting children and characters from fairy tales made by her. She spent the summers in the fishing village Briac in Bretagne where she would draw inspiration from the local fishers' life for her sculptures. Her sculptures were made in an early Impressionistic style. While in France, she and her brother changed their surname to Milles after their father's nickname. In 1902, she received an honorary award at the Salon in Paris. The next year she fell ill with tuberculosis. She travelled back to Sweden and settled down in Islinge on Lidingö, where she set up a studio which she sometimes shared with the wife of her brother Carl, Olga Milles.\n\nMilles got many commissions from cultural institutions in Stockholm, among them the Royal Dramatic Theatre for medallions and busts of the singer Jenny Lind and the actor Georg Dahlqvist. In 1904–16, she participated in a number of international exhibitions like in St. Louis (1905) and Buenos Aires (1910), where she received silver medals for her work, Rome (1911), the world's fair in San Francisco (1915) and the Swedish art exhibition in Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition, Denmark (1916). However, her failing health forced her to abandon her sculpturing and she turned first to painting and later to writing instead. She also made illustrations for books, her own and those of other writers.\n\nIn 1932, she moved to Rome. Her health deteriorated, among other things she contracted gangrene and had one of her legs amputated. Milles died in Rome in 1941 and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome.\n\nMilles is represented in the Nationalmuseum and the Thielska Galleriet.

It is situated in the Baraga Seminary, which was built by architect Jože Plečnik in the center of Ljubljana. In the 1980s, it became a center of theatrical research and politically-engaged theater. It is known for a wide range of innovative poetics of different directors and an ensemble energy, a Peter Brook-like approach to acting with a laboratory for theatre research for actors, directors, choreographers and musicians to research, develop, and create.\n\nMladinsko Theatre was founded in 1955 by Balbina Baranovič, the directress who also founded the first experimental theatre company in Slovenia. Throughout its history, the theatre has collaborated with the theatre reformers that shaped the Slovenian theatre during the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe Mladinsko Theatre's development progressed with contemporary theatre practices of the reformers of the Slovenian theatre during the second half of the 20th century, including directors Žarko Petan, Mile Korun, Dušan Jovanović, Ljubiša Ristić, Meta Hočevar, Paolo Magelli, Janez Pipan, Vito Taufer, Tomaž Pandur, Eduard Miler, Matjaž Pograjc, Martin Kušej, Dragan Živadinov, Emil Hrvatin, Tomi Janežič, Matjaž Berger, Jan Decorte, Diego de Brea, Jernej Lorenci, Ivica Buljan, Silvan Omerzu, Oliver Frljić, Borut Šeparović and Damjan Kozole.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Slovenian playwright Dominik Smole became managing director of the theatre and ensured that the Mladinsko presented artistically demanding youth performances. The Mladinsko was on the theatre margin, which allowed many different creative energies to congregate there. The political powers deemed the theatre unimportant, which enabled organizational and programmatic changes to be made. The 1970s also marked a time of crisis at the Drama Ljubljana (the Slovene National Theatre, Ljubljana), where circumstances prevented the development of the kind of contemporary theatre which Mladinsko started developing with the arrival of Dušan Jovanović.\n\nDuring the next decade – when Petar Jović became the managing director and Dušan Jovanović the artistic director (with the help of the dramaturg Marko Slodnjak), followed by Ivo Svetina – was marked by the projects by Ljubiša Ristić, especially \"Missa in a minor\", which began the series of projects that marked the Mladinsko as the nexus of the political and at experimental theatre. Around the mid-1980s, poetics that were not bound to \"actual political\" began to appear, first with the projects by Vito Taufer, then the performances by Janez Pipan and \"Scheherezade\" by Ivo Svetina, directed by Tomaž Pandur, and Dragan Živadinov's projects. This line has continued from the 1990s through the present in the form of diversity and auto-poetics in performances such as those by Eduard Miler, Matjaž Pograjc, Emil Hrvatin]], Tomi Janežič, Matjaž Berger, Diego de Brea and a wide range of contemporary theatre artists.\nUnder the artistic leadership of Eduard Miler, Tomaž Toporišič, Matjaž Berger, and, in the last few seasons of the current director of the theatre Uršula Cetinski, Mladinsko became a setting for the wealth of diversity, while remaining the Slovenian centre of theatre research. The strong accents of Martin Kušej (\"Scandal after Cankar\"), Meta Hočevar (\"A Family Album\"), Matjaž Pograjc (\"Roberto Zucco, Fragile!\"), Emil Hrvatin (\"Male Fantasies\"), Eduard Miler (\"Susn, The Mission\"), Tomi Janežič (\"Oedipus Rex, Utva\"), Matjaž Berger (\"Galileo Galilei, Interpretacija sanj\"), Diego de Brea (\"The Damned, Crime and Punishment\"), Ivica Buljan (\"Young Flesh\"), Jernej Lorenci (\"Gilgamesh\"), Vinko Möderndorfer (\"Blasted\"), Barbara Novakovič, Vlado Repnik, Ivan Peternelj, Jan Decorte, Sebastijan Horvat, Damjan Kozole, Silvan Omerzu, and many others, have, together with Taufer's research of an extremely wide territory of theatre function (such as the performances \"Silence Silence Silence\", \"Pippi\", and \"Midsummer Night's Dream\") and the projects of Dragan Živadinov resulted in the aesthetically most diverse period in the history of the theatre that the critical machinery in Slovenia – due to the limited tools with which it was operating, and ideological altercations of the political left, connected to the so-called independent or \"dependent\" production – didn't know to contextualize or couldn't analyse.\n\nTogether with several representatives of the so-called independent scene, the Mladinsko Theatre of the last two-and-a-half decades has been a place of creation which has brought strong impulses into the more institutional Slovenian theatre. The impulses moved in the direction of Richard Kostelanetz's \"theatre of combined ways of expression for the post-literary age\". On the one hand, it emphasises \"meta-theatricality\" as defined by Bonnie Marranca, (for instance, the focusing upon the third paradigm of the spectator and their perception and, on the other hand, the double coding of theatre springing from the tactics of the historical neo-avant-gardes, post-avant-gardes and political performances of the second half of the 20th century.\n\nThe tactics of epicization, formalist and energy theatre, the stage of the landscape, of parataxis, simultaneity, play with the density of signs, musicalization, visual dramaturgy, intrusions of the real, the scenic essay, heterogeneity, metonymic space, framing, scenic montage, aesthetics of speed, aesthetics vs. the real body, intermediality – to use the terminology used by Hans-Thies Lehmann for the analysis of the postdramatic – all this has taken the Mladinsko Theatre into the heterogeneous spheres of contemporary performing arts at the meeting points of various artistic mediums that have constantly enriched and added to the theatrical field.\n\nThe placement of these phenomena into the international and festival theatre space was extremely important. Today, when audience members are ensconced in the post post-socialist era of the so-called transition period in Slovenia, the historic distance enables them to claim that without this support from abroad, Mladinsko as an example of contemporary theatre wouldn't have survived. The positive response in Europe and the Americas was critical for the continuation of the research. Thus, the duality occurred: Mladinsko was relatively marginalized in Slovenia, while abroad it represented Slovenian art, culture and even the country.\n\nIn 1969, the city of Ljubljana gave the theatre the Župančič Award for special achievements as an “exceptional example of communal creative will for quality conveying theatre art to wider circles”. In 2008, the European Commission awarded the theatre the honorary title of European Cultural Ambassador, on the grounds of its international activity and the quality of its performances.\n\n\n\n"}

StoryCorps grew out of Sound Portraits Productions as a project founded in 2003 by radio producer David Isay. Its headquarters are located in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York.\n\nStoryCorps is modeled—in spirit and in scope—after the efforts of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) of the 1930s, through which oral history interviews across the United States were recorded. Another inspiration for the organization was oral historian Studs Terkel, who cut the ribbon at the opening of StoryCorps’ first recording booth in Grand Central Terminal. To date, StoryCorps has recorded more than 60,000 interviews among more than 100,000 participants in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and several American territories.\n\nStoryCorps interviews usually take place between two people who know and care about each other. They can be friends, family, or mere acquaintances. A trained StoryCorps facilitator guides participants through the interview process. At the end of each 40-minute recording session, participants receive a complimentary CD of their interview and are requested to make a $50 donation to offset the recording costs. With participant permission, a second copy of each interview is archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress for future generations to hear. Segments of select interviews may air nationally on NPR’s \"Morning Edition\". These interviews can also be heard on the StoryCorps website.\n\nThere are several ways by which participants can record their stories.\n\nParticipants can visit StoryBooths, which are small, publicly accessible recording studios located in public places. The first StoryBooth opened in New York City’s Grand Central Terminal on October 23, 2003, and was moved to Lower Manhattan’s Foley Square in July 2005. The second StoryBooth opened at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco in October 2008. The third StoryBooth opened at Atlanta’s public radio station WABE in October 2009.\n\nIn May 2005, two StoryCorps MobileBooths built from converted Airstream trailers began traveling the country, recording stories in various cities year-round.\n\nStoryCorps offers three additional recordings services for those who are unable to visit a StoryCorps booth. The Door-to-Door service sends teams of StoryCorps facilitators to temporary recording locations throughout the United States for several days at a time. The StoryKit service ships a professional quality, portable recording device to participants around the country. The “Do-It-Yourself” service allows individuals to download free step-by-step interview instructions, equipment recommendations, and a “Great Question” list to conduct interviews using their own recording equipment.\n\nWith the support of the 2015 TED Prize and the 2014 Knight Prototype Fund, StoryCorps has developed a free app that allows users to record interviews on a smartphone. The app helps users prepare questions and provides tips for setting up the right recording environment. Users can upload their interviews to the StoryCorps.me website, and all interviews are archived at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The StoryCorps App and StoryCorps.me are currently in public beta.\n\nStoryCorps collaborates with groups, organizations, and institutions all over the country. Specifically, StoryCorps currently supports seven major initiatives that seek to reach out to the widest range of participants.\n\nStoryCorps currently has four community programs.\n\nStoryCorps has been criticized on multiple fronts. While it has been called been called “an oral history of America,” oral historians have critiqued the project’s methodology, specifically the \"highly sculpted techniques of the interviews\", such as the pre-scripted questions, the 40-minute time limit, and the presence of a StoryCorps staff member in the recording booth. The result of the technique is that interviews often elicit \"an often-rehearsed moment, story, or memory.\" \n\nHistorians are also critical of the post-interview editing process, which they argue favor highly emotional and predictable narrative arcs. StoryCorps stories typically feature tales of survival, which, as one historian has argued, perpetuates an “interpretive straightjacket of the neoliberal belief that people have their fates in their own hands.”\n\nStoryCorps has also been criticized for how its stories are framed on Morning Edition. For example, in a 2016 story, an elderly man confessed to having stolen $2 from his home that had been left for Pearl, his family’s female, African American domestic servant. When Pearl insisted that she had not been paid that week, she was fired. The title NPR gave the story - \"A Lifelong Secret: Can You Help This Ailing 94-Year-Old Man Make Amends?\" - as well as Steve Inskeep’s closing request for listeners to help find Pearl drew ire from listeners, who found the sympathetic portrayal of the man to be misguided and offensive. One user wrote “waiting nearly a century to try to seek amends is horrific.” Another user suggested changing StoryCorps’ hashtag from #FindPearl to “FindJUSTICEforPearl.” In response to criticism, NPR acknowledged that “the segment comes across, even if this was not the attempt, as trying to manufacture a “feel good” feature.”\n\nStoryCorps has also published five books:\n\nIn 2007, StoryCorps was awarded a rare institutional award at the 66th Annual Peabody Awards. It won another Peabody Award in 2011 for StoryCorps' 9/11 Initiative.\n\nIn 2015, Dave Isay won the 2015 TED prize to fulfill his wish for people to have meaningful conversations worldwide using the StoryCorps app.\n\n\n"}

The King slips through the gates to go look for something interesting because he finds that his kingdom is the “dullest and ugliest and the most wearisome place in the world.”\n\nThe King, now outside, surveys his kingdom, commenting on how stupid his kingdom is, and feeling sorry for himself, then he hears a voice. The voice is from a little girl singing. The little girl is singing for the little King Wistful to come and play.\n\nWhen the girl comes into sight the King notices that she has the “brightest brown eyes” that he had ever seen. The little girl introduces herself as Eyebright and when asked where she learned her song, she replies that the magician taught her and that she needed to sing it every day until the King came.\n\nThe two talk for a time and the King tells Eyebright about how stupid his kingdom is while Eyebright tries to change his mind about it. Eyebright does not manage to change the little King's mind but does get him to follow her to go to see the Magician. The two children travel to the middle island, through woods and into a boat to get to the Magician’s cave.\n\nThe two enter the cave and Eyebright tells the Magician that she brought the King and that he must disenchant the King so that he can see what a wonderful kingdom he has. After shaking hands with the King the Magician invites them to sit with him for tea. The Magician performs some magic for a table and chairs to appear. The King and Eyebright set the table and the three proceed to have a delightful tea-party.\n\nAfter tea the children tell the Magician just why they came in the first place. The Magician tells them that the reason that the King cannot see his kingdom for the wonderful place that it is, was because the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a baby. The Magician explains why the wymps would do such a thing and tells them where they have to go to try to get the wymps to reverse what they did, Wympland, and how they were to get there. The Magician then sends the children to Wympland on a flash of lightning.\n\nThe King and Eyebright, now in Wympland, look around and find a wymp to talk to. They to talk with the wymp and the King tells him that the wymps threw dust in his eyes as a child. The wymp reveals to them that there is only one thing to do; they must exchange eyes, only thing to be done. The Wymp tells them how to exchange eyes and without hesitation Eyebright switches their eyes. The King is unhappy about this as he did not want Eyebright to have to see things through his eyes but at this point he has little choice.\n\nThe King and Eyebright suddenly appear back home, looking over the kingdom. The King can now see just how wonderful and beautiful his kingdom is. Eyebright thought she could only see five round islands in a row, but the King cannot possibly be mistaken so she agrees that it is a beautiful kingdom. Eyebright then runs off and the King returns home to bed.\n\nThe final lines tell of how there is now a Queen as well as a King of the Monotonous Isles. This Queen always agrees with the King when he tells of how beautiful the kingdom is. While this may be remarkable it needs to be remembered that “the Queen sees everything with the King's eyes.”\n\nThe fairy tale “The Magician’s Tea-Party” was written by Evelyn Sharp as part of a set of fairy tales in her book \"The Other Side of the Sun\".\nEvelyn Jane Sharp (1869-1955) was a children’s writer in England. Evelyn was the ninth of eleven children, and the youngest of four girls. Her sisters taught her until she was twelve, then she attended a school in London for three years, before attending the College de France in Paris\n\nEvelyn Sharp wrote over twenty books and hundreds of short stories for children. Her children’s stories are known for treating children as intelligent and creative rather than patronizing and moralistic. Evelyn also wrote for several newspapers, she was the Manchester Guardians’ first regular women's page writer, she wrote for the Daily Herald for eight years, and wrote for the Daily Chronicle in the 1930s. She became a women’s suffragist in 1906, lecturing and writing towards the goal of women’s suffrage.\n\nEvelyn continued in this manner, writing and various excursions. She then, after claiming she would be expected to settle down into spinsterhood in her autobiography, married her husband, Henry, on January 18, 1933. At this time Evelyn was a sixty-year-old woman and Henry was seventy-five. The two had eight years together when Henry died in 1941. Evelyn lived out her remaining years in London, where she died in a nursing home June 17, 1955.\n"}

Repeatedly the winner of international competitions, he left behind thousands of images with this technique. His works have adorned calendars, business cards, notepads, postcards and other items.\n\nPolish wycinanki became a popular folk craft in the mid-1800s.\n\nWycinanki originated with shepherds cutting designs out of tree bark and leather. Colorful wycinanki were pasted on furniture or roof beams as decoration, hung in windows, and given as gifts.\n\nWycinanki vary by region. For example, wycinanki created in the Kurpie region are typically all one color, while wycinanki from the Łowicz region are multicolored. Techniques include cutting, clipping, punching, tearing, and carving of paper, as well as \"nalepianki\" in which multiple layers are glued together.\n\nSubject matter includes peacocks, roosters, and other birds; circular or star-shaped medallions (\"gwiazdy\"); flowers; and annual holidays such as Easter and Christmas. In some towns and villages competitions evolved to create the most beautiful wycinanki. Traditionally done for relaxation in rural Poland, the techniques were passed down through generations, with new themes and ideas developing as the papercuttings became more detailed and intricate.\n\nThe Polish Pavilion at the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai is based on a wycinanki design.\n\nHistorical evidence suggests that vytynanky began to be made in Ukraine at the end of the fifteenth to early sixteenth century, but it took quite some time before they became an integral part of the decorative arts practiced at the grass roots level. During the nineteenth century decorative paper cutouts spread all across the Ukrainian countryside.\n\nThe word itself, vytynanky, gained currency in the early twentieth century, but there were many other, regional words that were used too — stryhuntsi, khrestyky or kvity to mention but a few. The vytynanky shapes were of many kinds and represented stylized figures of people, animals and plants. Ethnographers and art historians began to study the art of vytynanky, and artists began to seek inspiration for their art in vytynanky. Articles and essays were published, vytynanky began to be collected. Vytynanky were displayed at exhibitions of the Ukrainian decorative and applied arts alongside traditional pottery, embroidery, rugs and other items.\n\nVytynanky that were made for the occasions of religious feasts and holidays were more decorative than the ones used for everyday decoration. Christmas and Easter called for vytynanky in the shapes of angels, churches or even whole evangelical scenes to be pasted prominently on the walls. Marriages saw vytynanky in the shapes of doves, flowers, or the ones that formed “trees of life.”\n\n"}
{"id": "453968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=453968", "title": "Wearable art", "text": "Wearable art\n\nWearable art, also known as \"Artwear\" or \"art to wear\", refers to individually designed pieces of (usually) handmade clothing or jewellery created as fine or expressive art. While the making of any article of clothing or other wearable object typically involves aesthetic considerations, the term \"wearable art\" implies that the work is intended to be accepted as a serious and unique artistic creation or statement. Pieces may be sold and/or exhibited. The modern idea of wearable art seems to have surfaced more than once in various forms. Marbeth Schon's book on modernist jewellery (see the section on jewellery below) refers to a \"wearable art movement\" spanning roughly the years 1930 to 1960. A 2003 \"The New York Times\" review of a book on knitting refers to \"the 60s Art to Wear movement\".\nMost wearable art is made of fibrous materials and constitutes therefore a branch of the wider field of fiber art, which includes both wearable and non-wearable forms of art using fabric and other fiber products. Wearable art as an artistic domain can also include jewelry, or clothing made from non-fiber materials such as leather, plastic sheeting, metals, etc.\n\nArtists creating wearable fiber art may use purchased finished fabrics or other materials, making them into unique garments, or may dye and paint virgin fabric. Countering the belief that art is something expensive, some clothing artists have started local companies to produce quality art work and clothing for a modest price. Wearable art is not restricted to jewellery but is also seen in graphic T-shirts and even pants.\n\nAs with any other art form, the talent and skills of artists in this field vary widely. Since the nature of the medium requires craft skills as well as artistic skills, an advanced artist may wish to study color theory, chemistry, sewing, clothing design, and computer software such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Classes in clothing design and marketing are offered at colleges such as the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City.\n\nThe New Zealand city of Nelson gained a reputation in the field of wearable art, with its \"World of Wearable Art Awards\", held annually since 1987 and run by Suzie Moncrieff. In 2005, the show moved to Wellington to a larger venue, although a museum of garments remains in Nelson. In Australia, the Shearwater Wearable Arts or W.A.V.E. (Wearable Arts Vision In Education) has developed from a high school initiative to become a leading wearable arts event. It is held at Shearwater, The Mullumbimby Steiner School in Mullumbimby, New South Wales.\n\nSome 20th-century modern artists and architects sought to elevate bodily ornamentation — that is, jewellery — to the level of fine art and original design, rather than mere decoration, craft production of traditional designs, or conventional settings for showing off expensive stones or precious metals. In \"Modernist Jewelry 1930-1960: The Wearable Art Movement\" (2004), author Marbeth Schon explores unique and innovative wearable art objects created by surrealists, cubists, abstract expressionists, and other modernist artists working in the middle decades of the 20th century.\n\nNot all garments created as wearable art are made from traditional fibers or fabrics, and not all such artworks are meant for ordinary, practical use. Performance and conceptual artists have sometimes produced examples which are more provocative than useful. Trashion is another branch of extraordinary wearable art, for example, work by Marina DeBris. The Portland Oregon Trashion Collective, Junk to Funk, has been using creating outrageous art garments out of trash.\n\nA well-known example is the \"Electric Dress\", a ceremonial wedding kimono-like costume consisting mostly of variously colored electrified and painted light bulbs, enmeshed in a tangle of wires, created in 1956 by the Japanese Gutai artist Atsuko Tanaka. This extreme garment was something like a stage costume. Not really wearable in an everyday, practical sense, it functioned rather as part of a daring work of performance art (though the \"performance\" element consisted merely of the artist's wearing the piece while mingling with spectators in a gallery setting).\n\nIn Nam June Paik's 1969 performance piece called \"TV Bra for Living Sculpture\", Charlotte Moorman played a cello while wearing a brassiere made of two small operating television sets.\n\nCanadian artist Andrea Vander Kooij created a group of pieces called \"Garments for Forced Intimacy\" (2006). According to an essay at Concordia University's Faculty of Fine Arts gallery website, these hand-knit articles of clothing are designed to be worn by two people simultaneously, and they, \"as the name states, compel the wearers into uncharacteristic proximity.\"\n\nAs wearable computing technology develops, increasingly miniaturized and stylized equipment is starting to blend with wearable art esthetics. Low-power mobile computing allows light-emitting and color-changing flexible materials and high-tech fabrics to be used in complex and subtle ways. Some practitioners of the Steampunk movement have produced elaborate costumes and accessories which incorporate a pseudo-Victorian style with modern technology and materials.\n\n\n"}

It was intended as an encouragement award for young artists, and was considered as a national counterpart to the Paris Salon. Its existence of more than 71 years proves the success of Amsterdam's art policy . For many of its winners, it was a valuable boost to their careers in the Dutch art world. Some of the prize winners were also recognized abroad and remain well known today.\n\nDuring the \"Second Golden Age of Dutch painting\", the Dutch painters enjoyed considerable arts patronage from the upper class. This can also be seen in the context of the Hague School and the School of Allebé.\n\nThe Amsterdam-born painter Wilhem Ferdinand Willink van Collen (1847–1881) and his wife Anna Weber-van Bosse were great art lovers. After his death, he bequeathed a sum of 30,000 guilders to the society Arti et Amicitiae to set up a trust fund. The aim was to support young artists' income during their difficult initial phase. This also happened at painter's schools like Düsseldorf painter's School[a], Copenhagen School[b], Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School[c], the Munich School[d], Academy of Beaux-Arts to Paris[e], Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze[f] as well as the Barbizon School[g] and the new French Impressionism[h] to give a chance to the Dutch young generation, too.\nThe annual art exhibition of the Paris Salon was the most important event, too. It was the centre of the painters of Europe and it was very difficult to be allowed to exhibit there. The Five prizes awarded there were highly desired. It concerned two \"Gold Medals\" (medals of the 1st class) and three \"Silver Medals\" (medals of the 2nd class). Moreover, \"Recognitions\" and \"Honorable Mentions\" were pronounced. All this needed an answer in the Netherlands.\n\nThe board of Directors of the Association \"Arti et Amiticitae\" decided to hold an annual painting competition for all Dutch artists. Participants were required to reside in the Netherlands, and be under the age of 30. Later, the age limit was raised to 35. The paintings were submitted unsigned, and evaluated by the jury anonymously. Originally, there was a first place, a second place and a third one, a commendation - structured like the prizes of the Paris Salon. Not every prize was awarded every year. This approach was maintained until 1893. The jury had to deal with a problem of a special kind. The standard of entries was quite staggering. In 1891 it was decided to select a more difficult theme, to deter painters with inadequate training.\n\nThe following year, the jury decided to award no first prize. The reason was: It was felt that \"no sufficient artistic value\" was presented in the submitted works.\n\nIn 1893, a competition to design a mural for the organizers' building was announced. Only seven submissions were received, all of which disappointed the jury. For the first time in the history of the award, neither the prize nor the commendation were awarded. In 1894, the executive board decided to proceed differently. Instead of awarding the prize, the award money was spent on acquiring the painting \"The Snow\" by George Hendrik Breitner, a study trip for three Rijksacademie of Amsterdam students, and a small scholarship for Dutch artists living in London.\n\nThis decision upset both painters and the general public. This must be seen in the contemporary social context, because the Willink van Collenprijs had become a national institution. \nAs a consequence, a petition to protest this practice was signed by 29 artists, including famous names like Hendrik Willem Mesdag, the brothers Jacob and Willem Maris, Paul Gabriël and Louis Apol. Giving in to the pressure, a competition was organized again in 1896. According to the new rules, there would only be a first prize, and no other places. In the years 1897, 1906, 1909 and 1910, multiple \"first prizes\" were awarded.\n\nBecause of political events, the award could not be written out consistently. After 71 years, it was awarded for the last time in 1950.\n\nSelected topics were expressed\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Word counting may be needed when a text is required to stay within certain numbers of words. This may particularly be the case in academia, legal proceedings, journalism and advertising. Word count is commonly used by translators to determine the price for the translation job. Word counts may also be used to calculate measures of readability and to measure typing and reading speeds (usually in words per minute). When converting character counts to words, a measure of 5 or 6 characters to a word is generally used for English.\n\nVariations in the operational definitions of how to count the words can occur (namely, what \"counts as\" a word, and which words \"don't count\" toward the total). However, especially since the advent of widespread word processing, there is a broad consensus on these operational definitions (and hence the bottom-line integer result). The consensus is to accept the text segmentation rules generally found in most word processing software (including how word boundaries are determined, which depends on how word dividers are defined). The first trait of that definition is that a space (any of various whitespace characters, such as a \"regular\" word space, an em space, or a tab character) is a word divider. Usually a hyphen or a slash is, too. Different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the text segmentation rule details, and on whether words outside the main text (such as footnotes, endnotes, or hidden text) are counted. But the behavior of most major word processing applications is broadly similar.\n\nHowever, during the era when school assignments were done in handwriting or with typewriters, the rules for these definitions often differed from today's consensus. Most importantly, many students were drilled on the rule that \"certain words don't count\", usually articles (namely, \"a\", \"an\", \"the\"), but sometimes also others, such as conjunctions (for example, \"and\", \"or\", \"but\") and some prepositions (usually \"to\", \"of\"). Hyphenated permanent compounds such as \"follow-up\" (noun) or \"long-term\" (adjective) were counted as one word. To save the time and effort of counting word-by-word, often a rule of thumb for the average number of words per line was used, such as 10 words per line. These \"rules\" have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era; the \"word count\" feature of such software (which follows the text segmentation rules mentioned earlier) is now the standard arbiter, because it is largely consistent (across documents and applications) and because it is fast, effortless, and costless (already included with the application).\n\nAs for which sections of a document \"count\" toward the total (such as footnotes, endnotes, abstracts, reference lists and bibliographies, tables, figure captions, hidden text), the person in charge (teacher, client) can define their choice, and users (students, workers) can simply select (or exclude) the elements accordingly, and watch the word count automatically update.\n\nModern web browsers support word counting via extensions, via a JavaScript bookmarklet, or a script that is hosted in a website. Most word processors can also count words. Unix-like systems include a program, \"wc\", specifically for word counting. There are a wide variety of word counting tools available online.\n\nAs explained earlier, different word counting programs may give varying results, depending on the text segmentation rule details. The exact number of words often is not a strict requirement, thus the variation is acceptable.\n\nNovelist Jane Smiley suggests that length is an important quality of the novel. However, novels can vary tremendously in length; Smiley lists novels as typically being between 100,000 and 175,000 words, while National Novel Writing Month requires its novels to be at least 50,000 words. There are no firm rules: for example, the boundary between a novella and a novel is arbitrary and a literary work may be difficult to categorise. But while the length of a novel is to a large extent up to its writer, lengths may also vary by subgenre; many chapter books for children start at a length of about 16,000 words, and a typical mystery novel might be in the 60,000 to 80,000 word range while a thriller could be well over 100,000 words.\n\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America specifies word lengths for each category of its Nebula award categories:\n\nThe acceptable length of an academic dissertation varies greatly, dependent predominantly on the subject. Numerous American universities limit Ph.D. dissertations to 100,000 words, barring special permission for exceeding this limit.\n\n\n"}
