{"id": "41559702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41559702", "title": "Album era", "text": "Album era\n\nThe album era was a period in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s in which the album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption. It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats, the 33 rpm LP record, the audiocassette and the music Compact disc.\n\nTechnological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl long-playing (LP) album as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, Columbia Records began to bring out 33 rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. Musical film soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as Frank Sinatra quickly utilized the new longer format. However, in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45 rpm seven-inch single sales were considered the primary market for the recorded music industry, while albums were a secondary market. The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as Elvis Presley were driven primarily by single sales.\n\nThe dominance of the single as the primary medium of creative expression in music changed with the release of several albums in the 1960s, such as \"A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector\" (1963), the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\" (1965), the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" (1966), the Mothers of Invention's \"Freak Out!\" (1966), and the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967). In reference to the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\", \"Revolver\" (1966) and \"Sgt. Pepper\" and the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\", writer Bill Martin noted: \"In the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up the 'complete album approach.'\" \"Rolling Stone\" assistant editor Andy Greene felt that \"Sgt. Pepper's\" \"was the beginning of the album era. It was the big bang of albums.\"\n\nAccording to David Howard, writing in his book \"Sonic Alchemy\", \"pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere\" by the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\", resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual filler tracks. In January 1966, \"Billboard\" magazine cited the initial US sales of \"Rubber Soul\" (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format. In the US, no singles were released from the album, which writer David Leaf says created the \"perception that their new work should be viewed as a whole. ... it introduced the possibility to the recording industry that the 45 RPM disc ... preeminent for a decade ... might soon give way to a new king ... the album as a work of art.\" During \"Pet Sounds\"' composition and production, Beach Boys bandleader Brian Wilson found the American version of \"Rubber Soul\" to be \"a collection of songs that…somehow went together like no album ever made before\", which inspired Wilson to briefly shift his focus from singles to albums. \n\nThe mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the \"golden era\" of the album. According to BBC Four's \"The Golden Age\", \"These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood.\" This period, especially the 1970s, is also called the Album Rock Era. Music critic Dave Marsh has called Jimi Hendrix's 1967 \"Purple Haze\" the \"debut single of the Album Rock Era\" while Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Lou Gramm's 1987 \"Midnight Blue\" the \"last great single of the album-rock era\".\n\nAlong with the LP record, the 8-track tape was another format popular in the United States in this period. After the fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s and rise of first the cassette and then the CD as the dominant format for recorded music saw the end of the LP-driven \"golden age\" of the album, the album consolidated its domination of the recorded music market. Seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and were almost totally displaced by cassette singles by the end of the 1980s. Yet these were never as popular as seven-inch singles and they and the subsequent CD singles never amounted to a significant threat to the dominance of the album.\n\nThe primary threat to the album's primacy in the 1980s and early 1990s came from MTV. It was quickly recognized that, \"after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool\".\n\n\"Death of the album\" is a phrase used to describe the perceived decline of album sales in the 21st century, sometimes attributed to internet sharing and downloading, and the changing expectations of music listeners. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry. As opposed to releasing an album, some bands have begun releasing a series of singles or EPs as a way to combat the \"average person's short attention span.\"\n\nBy the middle of the 1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the United States. In 1998, \"Billboard\" magazine ended the requirement of a physical single for charting on its Hot 100 chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles. But, despite the dominance of the CD, technological changes quickly turned the tables. In 1999, the internet peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster allowed internet users to easily download single songs in MP3 format. By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide.\n\nAlthough Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, other music download services took its place. In 2001, Apple Inc.'s iTunes service was introduced and the iPod, a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year. This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats. By 2006, downloaded digital single sales outnumbered CD sales for the first time and buyers of digital music purchased singles over albums by a margin of 19:1. Even music industry executives were forced to admit that the album was on its way out. \"For some genres and some artists, having an album-centric plan will be a thing of the past,\" Capitol-EMI's COO Jeff Kempler said. Other warnings were more dire. Media researcher Aram Sinnreich bluntly predicted that \"the album is going to die. Consumers are listening to play lists\" on their MP3 players.\n\nWith consumers abandoning albums, performers \"started concentrating on dishing out singles as opposed to churning out albums\". Critics of the trend argued that single songs \"never truly showed an artist’s true prowess and every singer or songwriter proved to be a one-hit wonder\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37522784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37522784", "title": "Art and emotion", "text": "Art and emotion\n\nIn psychology of art, the relationship between art and emotion has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian Alexander Nemerov. Emotional or aesthetic responses to art have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally. Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression. Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition. Instead, brain regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.\n\nEvolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.\n\nOther methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. Symmetry is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were bilaterally symmetrical, as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.\n\nAnother example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, relaxation, or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of anxiety and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.\n\nThe optimal visual artwork creates what Noy & Noy-Sharav call \"meta-emotions.\" These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce \"meta-emotions.\" For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of Christ on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's crucifixion are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.\n\nNoy & Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and dance to music for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message ./..\n"}

Founded in 1981 by Matthew Carter and Mike Parker among others, it claims to be the oldest such company. It was located in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The font business, including MyFonts, was acquired by Monotype Imaging in March 2012. The remainder of the business, responsible for Pageflex and Bolt Browser, was spun off to a new entity named Marlborough Software Development Holdings Inc. It was later renamed Pageflex, Inc following a successful management buyout in December 2013.\n\nBitstream created a library of \"classic\" fonts (usually under different names for trademark reasons) in digital form (for example, Times Ten as 'Dutch 801'). The Bitstream font collection is most widely used through its inclusion with the CorelDRAW software. The company received extensive criticism for its strategy of cheaply offering digitisations of pre-existing typefaces that it had not designed. While technically not illegal, font designer John Hudson would describe its selling of large numbers of typefaces on CD as \"one of the worst instances of piracy in the history of type\".\n\nBitstream developed a number of fonts on its own, such as Charter, by Matthew Carter, Iowan Old Style by John Downer and the freeware Bitstream Vera family of fonts.\n\nOne of their best known fonts is Swiss 721 BT, which is a Helvetica clone with condensed versions and a rounded version.

{"id": "7165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7165", "title": "Cartoon", "text": "Cartoon\n\nA cartoon is a type of illustration, possibly animated, typically in a non-realistic or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a \"cartoonist\", and in the second sense they are usually called an \"animator\".\n\nThe concept originated in the Middle Ages, and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window. In the 19th century, beginning in \"Punch\" magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers. In the early 20th century, it began to refer to animated films which resembled print cartoons.\n\nA cartoon (from and —words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy paper as a study or \"modello\" for a painting, stained glass, or tapestry. Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days (\"giornate\").\n\nSuch cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or \"pounced\" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster (\"pouncing\"). Cartoons by painters, such as the Raphael Cartoons in London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the weavers on the loom.\n\nIn print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when \"Punch\" magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages, particularly sketches by John Leech. The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new Palace of Westminster. The original title for these drawings was \"Mr Punch's face is the letter Q\" and the new title \"cartoon\" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.\n\nCartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.\n\nModern single-panel \"gag cartoons\", found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or—less often—a speech balloon. Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by Mel Calman, Bill Holman, Gary Larson, George Lichty, Fred Neher and others. Many consider \"New Yorker\" cartoonist Peter Arno the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself). The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes Charles Addams, Charles Barsotti, and Chon Day.\n\nBill Hoest, Jerry Marcus, and Virgil Partch began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated comic strips. Richard Thompson is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in \"The Washington Post\" before creating his \"Cul de Sac\" comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester \"Chet\" Brown's \"All in Sport\".\n\n\"Editorial cartoons\" are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using irony or satire. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. Editorial cartoonists of note include Herblock, David Low, Jeff MacNelly, Mike Peters, and Gerald Scarfe.\n\n\"Comic strips\", also known as \"cartoon strips\" in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called \"cartoons\" themselves, but rather \"comics\" or \"funnies\". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as comic books and graphic novels—are usually referred to as \"cartoonists\". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are Scott Adams, Steve Bell, Charles Schulz, E. C. Segar, Mort Walker and Bill Watterson.\n\nPolitical cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.\n\nThe pictorial satire of William Hogarth is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England. George Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s. The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon. By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of revolutionary France and Napoleon. George Cruikshank became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.\n\nBy the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. Thomas Nast, in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning. His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the Tweed machine in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons. Sir John Tenniel was the toast of London.\n\nPolitical cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when J. H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of \"Black Friday\", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.\n\nCartoons such as \"xkcd\" have also found their place in the world of science, mathematics, and technology. Cartoons related to chemistry are, for example, the \"Wonderlab\", which looked at daily life in the lab. In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is Sidney Harris. Not all, but many of Gary Larson's cartoons have a scientific flavor.\n\nBooks with cartoons are usually magazine-format \"comic books,\" or occasionally reprints of newspaper cartoons.\n\nIn Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just. D.C. Thomson issued the first \"The Dandy Comic\" in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful. Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product \"The Beano\" in 1938.\n\nOn some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with \"Think Small\", a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by Volkswagen dealers. Bill Hoest and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as H. Allen Smith, Roger Price and Jean Shepherd. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.\n\nBecause of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, \"cartoon\" came to refer to animation, and the word \"cartoon\" is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons. While \"animation\" designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word \"cartoon\" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring anthropomorphized animals, superheroes, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.\n\nIn the 1980s, \"cartoon\" was shortened to \"toon\", referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", followed in 1990 by the animated TV series \"Tiny Toon Adventures\".\n\n\n"}

It is based out of the city of Cusco, Peru where its main offices, museum and shop are located. The CTTC works in support of indigenous weavers from the Cusco region to recover traditional Cusqueñan textiles. The organization currently partners with ten communities from the Cusco region: Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas).\n\nThe CTTC's mission is to \"promote the empowerment of weavers through the sustainable practice of Peruvian ancestral textile traditions in the Cusco region. This enables the weavers to maintain their identity and textile traditions while improving their quality of life through workshops, opportunities, and the promotion of their textile art.\" The CTTC's aim is to revive Pre-Columbian textile traditions and provide support to weaving communities.\n\nDue to racism, colonialism, poverty, and more, textile traditions in the Cusco region were in danger of disappearing during the 20th century. In the Andes, textiles are an important part of everyday life and a key component of local culture. This ancient way of life, passed down for thousands of years from generation to generation, has been at risk since the days of the Conquest. Traditional textiles were such a strong symbol of indigenous identity and resistance to colonial rule, that the Spanish outlawed their creation and use. Despite this, the people of the Andes continued practicing their textile traditions until the 20th century. Under pressure from changes brought about by globalization, including the introduction of chemical dyes and fibers, traditional textiles experienced a dramatic decline in the 1900s.\n\nSince 1996, the CTTC has worked to empower weavers and achieve its vision \"To place the weaver of ancestral textiles as a recognized global artist, forging a just recognition by society and assuring the continuity of the ancestral textile practice.\"\n\nSince the 1960s, an informal group of women weavers from the community of Chinchero gathered together to revive textile traditions and earn an independent income from male relatives through the sale of their textiles in the tourist market. When the husband and wife pair of ethnobotnists Christine and Ed Franquemont arrived in Chinchero in the 1970s to conduct research, they encouraged the weavers to continue their community organizing work. With the support of the Franquemonts and other international friends, the group of weavers founded a cultural center in Chinchero. When this cultural center failed, the weavers re-organized under the leadership of Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez to found the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco (CTTC).\n\nThe CTTC was founded in 1996 as a non-profit organization registered with APCI in Peru by weavers from Chinchero and their international supporters. Key founders of the CTTC include: Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, Elizabeth and David Van Buskirk, Maria Tocco, Christine and Ed Franquemont, Yolanda Jaime Callañaupa, Yenny Callañaupa, Flora Callañaupa de Hendrickson, Betty Doerr, and Tim Wells, amongst many others. The CTTC originally partner with a handful of communities in the Cusco region to revive textile traditions, including the communities of Accha Alta, Chahuaytire, Chinchero and Pitumarca. Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez has served as director of CTTC since 1996. The board of directors includes: Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, Flora Callañaupa de Hendrickson, Yolanda Jaime Callañaupa, Hilda Roque Perez, Miriam Luna, and Betty Doerr.\n\nUntil 2001 the CTTC was run out of the basement of the home of Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez. After an extensive capital campaign, the CTTC purchased and remodeled a building on Av. Sol 603, Cusco, Perú to house its offices, museum, and store.\n\nIn 2010 the CTTC held Tinkuy 2010: Gathering of Weavers, an international conference that gathered together indigenous weavers, textile artists, art historians, anthropologists and others to discuss and share textile traditions from around th world. In 2013, CTTC organized the second Tinkuy titled Tinkuy 2013: Gathering of Weavers.\n\nThe CTTC has partnered with ten communities from the Cusco region: Accha Alta, Acopia, Chahuaytire, Chinchero, Huacatinco, Mahuaypampa, Patabamba, Pitumarca, Santa Cruz de Sallac, and Santo Tomas (Chumbivilcas). In each community the weavers have formed autonomous weaving associations, each registered with the Peruvian government. Each weaving association is self-governed through elected officials (President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer), who are elected once a year. Each weaving association determines its own rules and regulates member participation.\n\nIn each community the CTTC has built a weaving center for the associations where the weavers can gather to meet and work. The weaving centers are composed of a central grassy courtyard for weaving in good weather while the surrounding complex of buildings are used for weaving in poor weather conditions, meetings, and include space for storage and a kitchen. Each association gathers once a week in their weaving center to work and organize.\n\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Munay Pallay Awaqkuna de Accha Alta\"\n\nCommunity: Accha Alta\n\nDistrict: Calca\n\nProvince: Calca\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nAccha Alta is located approximately 2 hours northeast of the city of Cusco. Nestled on a steep mountain slope next to the ruins of Ankasmarka, an ancient Incan granary, this remote mountain community looks out over the valley below. Most people in Accha Alta only speak Quechua, the local indigenous language, and rely on their \"chakras\" (fields) to produce much of the food they need for their families. At 12,930 feet above sea level, very few crops grow in the thin mountain air except for potatoes and other tubers. Accha Alta is well known for its many potato varieties and people from as far away as Cusco come to buy Accha Alta potatoes.\n\nThe community of Accha Alta began working with the Centro de Textiles Tradicionales del Cusco in 1998. In the beginning almost all of the association members knew how to weave, but solely used synthetic fibers. Since 1998, the weavers have returned to using natural materials, which includes natural dyes in sheep, alpaca, and llama wool. Accha Alta weavers are very proud of their traditions, and place great emphasis on the young weavers, ensuring that their traditions are carried on into the future. There are approximately 40 adult members in Accha Alta's weaving association and 35 children.\n\nAccha Alta textiles are recognized for their thin sections of plain weave and wide designs in the \"ley\" (supplementary warp) technique. Traditional textiles from Accha Alta are white and red. Popular designs include patterns of lakes, which are represented as diamonds, for example, \"wasqa qocha\", or long lakes. Accha Alta textile artists manage a number of techniques, including: backstrap weaving in the \"ley\" technique, backstrap weaving in the \"doble cara\" technique, knitting (including the \"Qhurpus\" knitting technique), sling braiding, rope braiding, the tubular border weaving \"chichilla\", and the crotcheted stitch known as \"kumpay\" used on the edges of textiles.\n\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Cuatro Lagunas de Acopia\"\n\nCommunity: Acopia\n\nDistrict: Acopia\n\nProvince: Acomayo\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nAcopia is located about two hours south of the city of Cusco in an area known as the Four Lakes, or land of Valicha after a popular huayno (folk song). The four high mountain lakes provide sustenance to local people who rely on them for fishing and irrigation for their fields. Acopia is located on the banks of the third and smallest lake.\n\nThe weaving tradition in Acopia nearly disappeared completely as the younger generation did not continue in the footsteps of their elders. The CTTC began working with Acopia in 2006, helping the elders pass on their knowledge to younger generations. There are approximately 30 adult members in Acopia’s weaving association and 20 children.\n\nTraditional Acopia blankets are woven with many thin designs in the \"doble cara\" (two sided warp-faced) technique. A distinguishing design from the community is \"organo q’enqo,\" a zig-zag pattern.\n\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Inka Pallay de Chahuaytire\"\n\nCommunity: Chahuaytire\n\nDistrict: Pisac\n\nProvince: Calca\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nChahuaytire is located in the mountains above the valley town of Pisaq approximately 25 miles north of the city of Cusco. There is an Incan trail that leads from the lowlands near Písac to the highlands of Chahuaytire that has been in use since pre-Columbian times. Chahuaytire weavers care for flocks of alpaca, llama and sheep higher in the mountains around their community. The CTTC began working with Chahuaytire in 1999. There are approximately 35 adult members in Chahauytire's weaving association and 40 children.\n\nChahuaytire weavers are well known locally for the high quality of their weavings. Their compact warp-faced weave, careful colour combinations, and detail to border finishes make Chahuaytire textiles some of the finest in the Cusco region. Chahuaytire weavers use both the \"doble cara\" (complementary warp) and \"ley\" (supplementary warp) techniques to create wide designs. Traditional textiles from Chahauytire are dark marooon and white. Designs are woven in dark marroon or purple on white backgrounds, while plain weave \"pampa\" sections are modulations of varying hues in dark purple. maroon and/or black. Chahuaytire weavers are experts in color combination, and in non-traditional textiles deftly modulate color tones to beautiful results. A common design from Chahuaytire is \"tika qocha\", lake with flowers, which often features on blankets and ponchos. Chahauytire blankets are characterized by their unique star, or rose, stich which unites the two sides of the blanket.\n\nAssociation: \"Asociación de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero\"\n\nCommunity: Chinchero\n\nDistrict: Chinchero\n\nProvince: Urubamba\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nChinchero is known as the ‘birthplace of the rainbow’ and is located on a high plain 45 minutes outside the city of Cusco. The town of Chinchero is composed of smaller communities, including: Cuper Bajo, Cuper Alto, Huaypo, Yanacona, and others. Chinchero is located on the road between Cusco and Urubamba, which means that thousands of tourists pass through Chinchero en route from the airport in Cusco to the famed ruins of Machu Picchu beyond Urubamba. Many tourists stop in Chinchero to visit the ruins of the summer residence of Inca Tupac Yupanqui and to witness the town's weaving tradition. Since the CTTC began its work in the textile field, many other small textile centers have emerged in Chinchero and the town has become increasingly commercial.\n\nThe Chinchero weaving association was the founding association of CTTC in 1996. There are approximately 40 adult members in the Chinchero weaving association and 40 children. Since the 1960s until today, the Association \"Asociación de Tejedores Awayriqcharicheq de Chinchero\" (not to be confused with the many other textile centers in Chinchero that sprung up afterward), has succeeded in bringing weaving to the forefront of their community. The town of Chinchero is known internationally as a prominent Andean weaving community where efforts to revive traditions have also revitalized the town itself.\n\nAs Chinchero is located on a major tourist byway, the weavers of the Chinchero weaving association offer demonstrations to visiting tourists and run a small store in their weaving center.\n\nAssociation \"Asociación de Tejedores Wiñay Awaqkuna de Huacatinco\"\n\nCommunity: Huacatinco\n\nDistrict: Ocongate\n\nProvince: Quispicanchis\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nHuacatinco is the latest community to partner with CTTC; it joined the non-profit in 2011. The community is located in the Ocongate district, approximately three hours south of the city of Cusco. While Huacatinco is rich in local culture and natural beauty as it looks out over the snow-capped peaks of the Ausungate mountain range, it is one of the most impoverished areas of Peru. Some parts of the district have been completely abandoned by government services and local families are forced to be self-sufficient. Most rely on their chakra (fields) and flocks of alpaca and llama for survival. Local people mostly speak Quechua, and continue to wear their traditional clothing on a daily basis.\n\nBefore partnering with CTTC, weavers from the Huacatinco association found it difficult to sell their textiles. After traveling the three hours to the city of Cusco, they would search for buyers, often in vain. When a store or merchant was interested in their products, they offered extremely low prices for the detailed work. Rather than paying the weavers upfront, they would withhold payment for months, if they even paid the weavers at all. Some merchants would agree to buy the textiles, but would never follow through with their promise of future payment.\n\nToday approximately 25 adult weavers and 20 children are members of the Huacatinco weaving association. The weavers are working to finish construction on their weaving center and to investigate their textile traditions with elders. Through the fair-trade sale of their textiles with CTTC, they are assured of a steady income for their families.\n\nIn Huacatinco both women and men knit elaborately patterned hats called \"chullo\" and weave fine textiles with the backstrap loom. Both men's and women's traditional clothing are elaborated with embroidery in white beads.\n\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Virgen Inmaculada Concepción de Mahuaypampa\"\n\nCommunity: Mahuaypampa\n\nDistrict: Maras\n\nProvince: Urubamba\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nMahuaypampa is located approximately 50 km to the northwest of the city of Cusco in the Maras district, just off the highway between Cusco and Urubamba. Situated on a high altiplano, the community dedicates itself to agriculture as it is well situated on a wide rolling plain.\n\nThe textile tradition in Mahuaypampa almost disappeared as few children were learning from their elders. The Mahuaypampa association partnered with the CTTC in 2000. Since then the community has worked to recover its weaving tradition. Today there are approximately 30 adult weavers and 12 children in the Mahuaypampa weaving association.\n\nTraditional designs in Mahuaypampa are small and narrow. Because of this, weavers will typically place many designs next to each other in order to build up a wider design composition. The design \"mayu qenqo,\" said to represent the Milky Way, is one of the principal designs of Mahuaypampa. Blankets in Mahuaypampa are characterized by the \"enagua\" seam, which represents petticoats and is used to unite the two halves of the textile.\n\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Away Paccarichiq Pallay Tika de Patabamba\"\n\nCommunity: Patabamba\n\nDistrict: Coya\n\nProvince: Calca\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nPatabamba is located high in the mountains above the Sacred Valley overlooking the town of Pisac. There are many Incan ruins located around the community. A high mountain lake is located above Patabamba. Here locals pasture their flocks of sheep, alpaca and llama while also occasionally fishing for trout. Few traditional festivals are still celebrated in Patabamba. This decline in local culture is attributed to conflicts between the older Catholic tradition and new Evangelical tradition that prohibits the expression of older belief systems.\n\nAs just a handful of elders knew how to weave in Patabamba, the weaving tradition nearly disappeared. The Patabamba association partnered with the CTTC in 2001 and today approximately 40 adult weavers and 15 children are members. They continue to work to revive their weaving tradition.\n\nTraditional \"lliklla\" (blankets) from Patabamba are woven with a wide sections of plain weave in red or green. Design sections are woven in the \"doble cara\" (complementary warp) technique. Often, weavers will sew a strip of blue or green fabric, often velvet, around the edge of their blankets. Over this border frame they will embroider figures in white thread, often images of fish, flowers, and birds. While this embellishment is decorative, it also serves to protect blanket edges from fraying with use.\n\nAssociation: \"Asociación de Tejedores Munay Ticlla del Distrito de Pitumarca\"\n\nCommunity: Pitumarca\n\nDistrict: Pitumarca\n\nProvince: Canchis\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nPitumarca is located approximately two hours south of the city of Cusco, off the main highway passing the town of Checacupe. Pitumarca is now a large town, and weavers from surrounding communities come down from the mountains to participate in the Pitumarca weaving association which partnered with CTTC in 1997. There are approximately 50 adult weavers and 25 children in the Pitumarca weaving association. The weavers of Pitumarca have maintained for thousands of years, from generation to generation, dozens of complex textile techniques that can be directly traced to specific pre-Columbian cultures. These include: \"ley\" (supplementary warp), \"doble cara\", (complementary warp), \"amapolas\" (a weaving technique that allows for designs on both sides of the textiles in up to five colors), \"ticlla\" (discontinuous warp and weft), sling and rope braiding, knitting, and other techniques. Pitumarca textiles are some of the finest and most complex in the Cusco region, and the town's official slogan is the \"Andean capital of textiles.\" Weavers of the Pitumarca association are incredibly proud of their hard work to investigate and revive techniques like ticlla, and wear their traditional clothing with honor and pride.\n\nPitumarca is known internationally for its revival of the \"ticlla\" (discontinuous warp and weft) technique. This complex technique allows a weaver to change the color of their warp thread by inserting sticks into their warp. The weaver warps one color between one set of warp sticks, and another color between the following set of warp sticks. The weaver then weaves the two sections together to create a unified whole. The ticlla technique can be traced as far back as the Chavin culture, and was especially important to the Paracas and Nazca who created stunning textiles solely with ticlla. The technique is unique to the pre-Columbian cultures of Peru, and cannot be found anywhere else in the world.\n\nFor decades modern scholars believed that ticlla was but another unique Andean technique that had been lost to time. After beginning investigative work with the Pitumarca association, elders revealed that they still knew how to weave ticlla. Since then elders have taught younger generations, and Pitumarca is now the only community in Peru that continues to weave with ticlla.\n\nAssociation: \"Centro de Tejedores Watay de Santa Cruz de Sallac\"\n\nCommunity: Santa Cruz de Sallac\n\nDistrict: Urcos\n\nProvince: Quispicanchis\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nSanta Cruz de Sallac is located approximately two and a half hours to the south of the city of Cusco high in the mountains above the regional town of Urcos. Urcos is a market town where highways meet and merchants sell products from the Andes mountains as well as the Amazon jungle. Santa Cruz de Sallac is located on the opposite side of the valley from the highway that leds to Puerto Maldonado and the Amazon jungle.\n\nThere is a great sense of community in Santa Cruz de Sallac and weavers foccus on community organization and assisting each other. The weaving association is very well-organized. There are approximately 45 adult weavers and 20 children in the Santa Cruz de Sallac weaving association. The association partnered with the CTTC in 2005.\n\nWeavers in the Santa Cruz de Sallac association are unique in the Cusco region for their use of embroidery to create their designs. While they also weave patterns in the \"ley\" (supplementary warp) technique, they predominately embroider geometric shapes over plain weave backgrounds. Santa Cruz de Sallac is also well known for its revival of the \"watay\" (ikat) technique. In this dyeing technique, the weaver will prepare a special warp, where he or she tightly wraps up certain sections. The weaver then dyes this warp. The unwrapped sections of warp thread are dyed, but dye cannot enter the tightly wrapped sections which remain undyed. After dyeing, the weaver unwraps the sections of wrapped warp. When the weaver mounts this warp on her or his loom and weaves it as plain weave, the dyed and undyed sections form a design. Besides the Ccatcca district, Santa Cruz de Sallac is one of the only communities in Peru that still maintains the \"watay\" technique which can be traced to dyeing techniques practiced by the Nazca and Huari cultures.\n\nAssociation: \"Asociación de Mujeres Artesanas 'Surphuy' de Chumbivilcas\"\n\nCommunity: Santo Tomas\n\nDistrict: Santo Tomas\n\nProvince: Chumbivilcas\n\nRegion: Cusco\n\nSanto Tomas is the capital of the Chumbivilcas province and is located eight hours southwest from the city of Cusco. The Santo Tomas weaving center is located in the capital, but weavers from the surrounding province travel into the small city to participate. Santo Tomas is located on a high rolling plain and is known for its horseback riding tradition and cattle herds. As communities and homes are spread far apart over the rolling plains and hills, people traditionally rely on their horses for transportation. Many local festivals and traditions are based around horseback riding, and traditional clothing reflects this in the use of leather chaps, spurs, and other riding equipment.\n\nThe Santo Tomas weaving association partnered with CTTC in 2007. Today approximately 20 adults and 15 children are members of the Santo Tomas weaving association. Before working with the CTTC, members of this association used acrylic yarn and chemical dyes in their textiles. After an arduous process, the weavers now use natural dyes and natural sheep wool.\n\nThe textile tradition of Santo Tomas reflects their unique horseback riding tradition. Wide designs in the \"doble cara\" (complementary warp) technique often reflect horses or horses with riders. Women's traditional clothing is distinguished by bold reverse appliqué designs in black velvet over satin-like fabrics in bright reds, blues, and greens, making traditional dress from Santo Tomas highly distinct from other Cusco communities. Both women and men wear boots for horseback riding, while men wear elaborate leather leggings and spurs.\n\nThe mission of the CTTC's Education Department is to \"provide an interactive space between weavers and the public through programs, investigations, and publications that promote the revaluation of ancestral textiles.\" The vision of the Education Department is \"To achieve a future where Peruvian textile culture is valued as a global patrimony.\" The Education Department at the CTTC runs educational events for the weavers, the young weavers and the general public, as well as managing the museum Weaving Lives, the permanent collection of textiles, the library on textile sources, the design catalogue, investigations and publications, classes for visitors, visual materials and the volunteer program.\n\nEach of the ten weaving associations works with a youth group called the Young Weaver Group. These are children and adolescents between the ages of six and thirty who are learning the textile traditions of their community. The CTTC places great emphasis on the young weavers as they will be responsible for carrying on traditions in the future. The Young Weaver Groups began in Chinchero in the 1990s. Since then, each community has organized a youth group. Elder weavers work with the children to teach them designs and techniques. The Education Department organizes various activities for the young weavers each year, including: gatherings of young weavers, weaving competitions, classes on ancient textiles of Peru, field trips to local museums, and more.\n\nLocated on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Perú, the museum Weaving Lives details the backstrap weaving process, unique Peruvian textile techniques, traditional uses of textiles in the Andes, as well as traditions and practices associated with textiles. Opened to the public in 2001, the small museum presents five rooms that display textiles, photography, and text in Spanish and English.\n\nSince its founding in 1996, the CTTC has developed a unique ethnographic collection of traditional textiles from the Andes that include: examples of the traditional clothing from each of the ten communities, examples of the rudimentary textiles made before the CTTC's investigative work, exemplary textiles created after the CTTC's investigative work, pieces from the annual competition \"Weaver Awards,\" amongst others. Pieces from the CTTC Permanent Collection of Textiles have been displayed in local and international exhibits.\n\nThe CTTC maintains a small library of textile sources, used for investigative work with the weavers and visiting scholars. Much of the replication work completed by the weavers of the CTTC is conducted through reference to textual sources.\n\nEach community maintains a unique repertoire of designs that represent their history and culture. Since 1996, the CTTC has worked to create a reference catalogue for each community that documents every design as well as each design variation.\n\nThrough extensive investigative work with the elders of each community, the CTTC works to recover ancient designs, techniques, and styles that were on the brink of being lost to time. The Center has published a number of articles, books and DVDs based on its efforts, including:\n\nSince 2006 CTTC has partnered with Culture Explorers to offer the 'Weaver Awards,' an annual weaving competition, to the ten weaving associations that partner with CTTC. The Weaver Awards inspire the weavers to unite their efforts to create exceptional pieces that are inducted into the CTTC's Permanent Collection of textiles or that are acquired by international collectors and museums. The Weaver Awards help provide additional income to impoverished communities while encouraging excellence in the textile arts.\n\nThe CTTC offers four courses on traditional Andean textiles: spinning, backstrap weaving, knitting, and sling braiding. Each course is one to three days in length, except for the knitting course which is only offered for a full three days. The classes are private and teach the basic skills of spinning with a drop spindle, weaving on a backstrap loom, knitting in the Chinchero style, and braiding ropes and slings from Pitumarca. The CTTC's policy concerning the teaching of traditional techniques is a balance between educating the public and respecting the intellectual property rights of indigenous peoples. The CTTC offers up to three days of instruction in traditional techniques, as this time frame is enough for students to gain greater respect for the complex, millennia old techniques. The CTTC does not offer more than three days of class time, as this would risk compromising the intellectual property rights of the indigenous weavers it works with.\n\nThe CTTC offers two volunteer positions, Education Department Volunteers and Project Volunteers. In the Education Department volunteers assist with various projects and events run for the weavers and the public. Project Volunteers work on unique projects in support of the CTTC.\n\nThe Sales & Marketing Department promotes the sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's textile art. The Sales & Marketing Department manages five physical store locations, as well as an online catalogue. The main CTTC store, which sells woven textiles, is located on Av Sol 603, Cusco, Peru. Directly next door to its main store, the CTTC runs a small knitwear store. Besides the main two stores on Av Sol, the Sales and Marketing Department runs a small museum shop in Museo Inka and another museum shop in Museo de Arte Precolombino, both located in the historic center of Cusco. The fifth CTTC store is located at the weaving complex in the community of Chinchero. The CTTC also exports to stores and companies located in the USA and Canada.\n\nThe sale on a fair-trade basis of the weaver's work has been the main contributing factor in improving the quality of life of member weavers. With improved income, families are able to send their children to school, access better health care, and make improvements to their homes. Women have been provided with independent incomes from their male relatives, which has improved their standing in community life.\n\nThe CTTC offers traditional textiles as well as modern products created in various techniques including: backstrap weaving, knitting, and rope braiding. Each piece is made with natural alpaca, sheep or llama fiber and dyed with natural plant and animal dyes. Each item is authored and includes a photo of the artist, their birthdate, and their community. Traditional textiles offered by the CTTC include: \"lliklla\" (blankets), ponchos, \"unkuna\" (a cloth to carry coca leaves), \"chumpi\" (belts), \"jakima\" (small ribbons), slings, and \"chullo\" (knitted hats), amongst others. Non-traditional products offered by the CTTC include: wall hangings and wall art, home decor, bags and purses, accessories, and modern clothing items, amongst others.\n\nBesides the Education Department and the Sales & Marketing Department, the CTTC runs a number of special projects that seek to revive textile traditions in the Cusco region.\n\nSince 1999, the CTTC has been the leader in the Cusco region in the revival of natural dyes. Weavers from the community of Chinchero, led by Nilda Callañaupa Alvarez, held investigations with elders, attended international workshops and conferences, and conducted many experiments before reviving the natural dyeing process in the Cusco region. The CTTC is recognized internationally as the main force in reviving natural dyeing in the Cusco region where today many weavers once more use ancient dyes once practiced by their ancestors. Natural dyes revived by the CTTC include:\n\nThe strain of indigo found in pre-Columbian textiles is native to South America. After investigations and a long revival process, the CTTC establish a small plantation in the community of Huayro where it farms approximately five acres of native \"Indigófera suffruticosa\" plants. Indigo is the only plant in the world that produces blue dye. The process of extracting the dye from the leaves of the plant is long and laborious. After harvesting, leaves must be oxidized in large vats of water that are left to evaporate. The resultant mixture is then heated to remove remaining excess water and produce a hard cake of indigo dye. This dye is later mixed with human urine and left to ferment underground with the yarn for a month to produce the dyed yarn. The CTTC's Indigo Project seeks to maintain the unique strain of indigo native to South America, and serves to educate the public about the importance of natural dyes.\n\nThe CTTC is known internationally for its work in replicas of Pre-Columbian and Colonial textiles. The CTTC's replica projects include, amongst others: \n\nTinkuy is an international textile conference organized by CTTC approximately every three years starting in 2010. Tinkuy gathers together indigenous weavers, textile artists, anthropologists, art historians and textile enthusiasts. The conference is composed of lectures, presentations, workshops, demonstrations and other events. The next Tinkuy is scheduled for November 2017. During Tinkuy indigenous textile artists from across the world meet to share and celebrate their textile traditions.\n"}

As an individual's role, this refers to the person coordinating all the staff and equipment necessary to make a concert happen; they monitor the schedule, pay the staff, act as a hub for communication between team members, and generally make sure the event runs smoothly. The role of a concert producer or concert promoter is best filled by a person with good organizational skills, a diplomatic demeanor, and plenty of charisma. As a company's role, concert production may also include the responsibility of booking the musicians, marketing the concert, and the financial loss or gain of the event. Over the last 10 years, the number of independent concert producers in the United States has diminished greatly due to acquisition of smaller firms by large national companies.\n"}
{"id": "460263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=460263", "title": "Contemporary dance", "text": "Contemporary dance\n\nContemporary dance is a genre of dance performance that developed during the mid twentieth century and has since grown to become one of the dominant genres for formally trained dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe. Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical, modern, and jazz styles, it has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance. Due to its technical similarities, it is often perceived to be closely related to modern dance, ballet, and other classical concert dance styles.\n\nIn terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to combine the strong but controlled legwork of ballet with modern that stresses on torso. It also employs contract-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristics of modern dance. Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. Additionally, contemporary dance sometimes incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures, such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance, Butoh.\n\nContemporary dance draws on both classical ballet and modern dance, whereas postmodern dance was a direct and opposite response to modern dance. Merce Cunningham is considered to be the first choreographer to \"develop an independent attitude towards modern dance\" and defy the ideas that were established by it. In 1944 Cunningham accompanied his dance with music by John Cage, who observed that Cunningham's dance \"no longer relies on linear elements (...) nor does it rely on a movement towards and away from climax. As in abstract painting, it is assumed that an element (a movement, a sound, a change of light) is in and of itself expressive; what it communicates is in large part determined by the observer themselves.\" Cunningham formed the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in 1953 and went on to create more than one hundred and fifty works for the company, many of which have been performed internationally by ballet and modern dance companies.\n\nCunningham's key ideas include:\n\nOther pioneers of contemporary dance (the offspring of modern and postmodern) include Ruth St. Denis, Doris Humphrey, Mary Wigman, Francois Delsarte, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze, Paul Taylor, Rudolph von Laban, Loie Fuller, Jose Limon and Marie Rambert.\n\nThere is usually a choreographer who makes the creative decisions and decides whether the piece is an abstract or a narrative one. Dancers are selected based on their skill and training. The choreography is determined based on its relation to the music or sounds that is danced to. The role of music in contemporary dance is different from in other genres because it can serve as a backdrop to the piece. The choreographer has control over the costumes and their aesthetic value for the overall composition of the performance and also in regards to how they influence dancers’ movements.\n\nDance techniques and movement philosophies employed in contemporary dance may include Contemporary ballet, Dance improvisation, Modern dance styles from United States such as Graham technique, Humphrey-Weidman technique and Horton technique, Modern dance of Europe Bartenieff Fundamentals and the dance technique of Isadora Duncan (also see Free dance).\n\nContemporary dancers train using contemporary dance techniques as well as non-dance related practices such as Pilates, Yoga, the acting practice of Corporeal mime - Étienne Decroux technique and somatic practices such as Alexander technique, Feldenkrais Method, Sullivan Technique and Franklin-Methode, American contemporary techniques such as José Limón technique and Hawkins technique and Postmodern dance techniques such as Contact improvisation and Cunningham technique, and Release technique.\n\nSome well-known choreographers and creators of contemporary dance created schools and techniques of their own. Paul Taylor developed a dance technique called Taylor technique, which is now taught at modern dance schools like The Ailey School in New York City.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5924571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5924571", "title": "Encastellation", "text": "Encastellation\n\nEncastellation (sometimes castellation, which can also mean crenellation) is the process whereby the feudal kingdoms of Europe became dotted with castles, from which local lords could dominate the countryside of their fiefs and their neighbours', and from which kings could command even the far-off corners of their realms. The ubiquity of the castle is iconic of the Middle Ages. \n\nThe process was rather quick once the castle, as a distinct type of fortress, was introduced. However, it took different forms in different lands. The methods and reasons of encastellation differed based on law (who could legally build a castle), necessity (who needed a castle), and geography (where could castles be effectively built). The stone castle originated probably in the north of France in the tenth century. Older wooden castles, of the motte-and-bailey variety are probably older, though they were far more common until well into the twelfth century.\n\nIn France, encastellation began in the north, in Normandy and Anjou, under the direction both of local barons as well as the Duke of Normandy and the Count of Anjou. Most of these castles were of the motte-and-bailey type, which could be constructed with ease in a few months. Stone castles, however, were built before the end of the tenth century in Anjou. These were originally nothing more than towers, donjons (from whence dungeon) or keeps. The reason for this proliferation was to provide oneself with protection in times of war, primarily as a place of refuge, but also as a strategic headquarters: a place from which to sally forth to raid and plunder before retreating to safety (again, the castle). For example, in Normandy:\nFrom Normandy and Anjou, encastellation spread to the Loire Valley. In Poitou, there were thirty nine castles by the eleventh century, the constructions primarily of local magnates. Fortification had briskly increased in Gaul during the Viking Age (see Edict of Pistres) and this merely continued apace while the Carolingian dynasty declined in importance and regional control devolved to regional lords. \n\nIn Languedoc and the south of France, there were more serious attempts, the Peace and Truce of God movements, to curb feudal warfare. But with the spread of heresy came the spread of castles as fortresses to which heretic barons could flee, such as the \"five sons of Carcassonne.\"\n\nIn Italy, the process of encastellation is known as \"incastellamento\". It has a specific notion, as the \"incastellamento\" describes less the building of castles than the change towards fortified settlements, in which the castle proper (\"rocca\") is a separate part. The term 'incastellamento' for this process was coined by Pierre Toubert. As in France, it was a different process in the north and the south. \n\nIn the north, the castles were originally the seats of the barons. They spread quickly after the disruption of royal authority in Italy in the mid-tenth century. By the eleventh century, the territorial magnates, like the margrave of Tuscany, were supreme and castles dotted the landscape. With the rise of the city-states after the collapse of Tuscan power in the early twelfth century, the powerful merchant families began to construct fortress and towers as residences in the cities. Well-preserved San Gimignano was the result of the struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines. \n\nIn the centre of the peninsula, the Papal States, the agents of encastellation were not large territorial magnates, but the petty nobles who belonged to various families and factions usually associated with Rome in some way. The Crescentii and the Tusculani constructed fortresses throughout Latium to dominate the roads leading to the Eternal City and the Vatican. During the papal nadir of the tenth and eleventh centuries, their hilltop fortresses gave these minor lords far more power than their territories would otherwise permit. In Rome itself, encastellation often led to the fortifying of the ancient monuments which had fallen into disuses, such as the Arch of Constantine and the Colosseum. These fortresses were usually in the hands of one of the powerful lay families, but sometimes of the popes. \n\nIn the Mezzogiorno, the independent principalities of the Lombards and the Greek city-states, which distanced themselves from any central authority, formed an opportune place for the proliferation of castles. Indeed, the nominally Byzantine duchies of Gaeta, Naples, and Amalfi grew around what were originally small coastal fortresses. The decline of ducal authority in these places has been blamed on the tendency to give outlying regions to younger sons (e.g. Docibilis II of Gaeta granting Fondi to Marinus), who then built their own fortresses and thus became independent in fact. Historian G. A. Loud considers \"incastellamento\" as one of the chief reasons for the decline in princely influence in Benevento and Capua (especially the former) during the late tenth century. Historian Barbara Kreutz notes the encastellation of the monastic estates which dominated south Italian politics and contributed to the constant confiscation and invasion of monastic estates as lay barons sought to increase their power against their foes during the war-filled eleventh and twelfth centuries. The arrival of the Normans, adept castle-builders, in the early eleventh century only exacerbated the tendency toward fortification of every hilltop. Together with the Prince of Salerno, they subdued Calabria and encastellated its mountainous territory, leading to the inevitable invasion of Sicily.\n\nThe encastellation of Spain is inextricably linked to the Reconquista. That said, encastellation occurred mostly in the centre of the peninsula. This region, originally a county of the Kingdom of León, even adopted the name Castile because of its many castles. The castles first began to spread quickly in the tenth century, in light of the increasing power of the Castilian counts \"vis-à-vis\" the king. During the long reign of Count Fernán González, Castile became \"de facto\" independent and its castles multiplied.\n\nTrue medieval castles were a somewhat later arrival in Britain than in continental Europe. The process of encastellation in Britain is as inextricably linked to Normanisation (which is, of course, linked to the Norman Conquest) as the encastellation of Spain is to the Reconquista.\n\nNormanisation began in England before the Conquest primarily through the Norman sojourn of Ethelred II and the influence of his Norman queen Emma. During the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066), definite strides were taken in spreading Norman ideas to England. Castles were first built in England in his reign under the direction especially of his Norman marcher lord Ralph the Timid. \n\nEncastellation began in earnest under William the Conqueror in the years immediately following the Battle of Hastings. Castles of the motte-and-bailey were erected quickly all over the country to subdue the locals and prevent foreign invasions by rival claimants to the throne. Within a matter of years, England was fully castled. Most of these castles belonged to the king or one of his tenants-in-chief. The construction of numerous castles by minor lords was a feature, as in most places, of the reign of weaker kings. After the iron hand of William's sons had passed, Stephen took the throne and the Anarchy (1135–1152) of civil war which characterised his reign saw the proliferation of adulterine (unauthorised) castles: to the number of 1,115, according to one chronicler.\n\nThe Welsh Marches had been encastellated from an early date, beginning even before the Conquest. However, the proliferation of castles in Wales dates only from its English conquest, though a few stone castles date from the reign of Llywelyn the Great. \n\nMotte-and-bailey castles existed from before the thirteenth century in those parts of Wales which fell under English authority and they spread in south Wales after its conquest, but the most famous encastellation of Wales occurred in the north under Edward I of England (1272–1307). His famous Edwardian concentric castles, large stoneworks with multiple rings of defences, grew up at strategic locations throughout the north and the local populace was placed securely under English authority. In this case, encastellation was the result, not of weak central authority, but of a strong royal hand and direction.\n\nIn Scotland, the spread of castles came with the Normans who, in the twelfth century, began constructing castles of the motte-and-bailey type in the south, where they received royal support, especially in Galloway. At about the same time, the first stone castles appeared in the north, in Orkney, built not by Normans but by the Norse.\n\nIn Ireland, as in the rest of Britain and most of Europe, encastellation was primarily a Norman venture. The first castles were motte-and-baileys built on the expanding frontier of the English Pale and within it to control the local population, according to Gerald of Wales. Stone castles were slow to develop, appearing in the late thirteenth century.\n\nAs in France, so in Germany: the impetus for encastellation was provided, not by a strong monarch, but by the weakening of royal authority. During the eleventh-century Investiture Controversy in Germany and the resulting decline of the royal power, castle-building exploded as local warlords staked claims to formerly royal prerogatives in their petty states. \n\nIn Prussia, during the Drang nach Osten and the Northern Crusades of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, encastellation was the result of the Margraves of Brandenburg and the Teutonic Knights, who, among others, conquered the land from the pagan Prussians. The construction of castles to control territories occurred at a late point in the development of the castle and these fortresses were large and complex. They were called \"Ordensburgen\" and they served as headquarters and training grounds for initiates into the knightly orders.\n\n"}

As the historian Ignazio De Blasi affirms in his work, they carried the Holy Sacrament and the painting of \"Maria Santissima dello Stellario\" in procession to this Church, to ask her intercession for rain to come. It had not rained for several months: it rained continuously for three consecutive days.\nThe founder also created the homonimous confraternity in the same period. In 1964, before being demolished, the Church was not in bad conditions: in fact, in 1939 Maria De Blasi Casale, a widow, had financed the restoration of its roof.\nThe façade had a fine portal; the Church had a single nave, there were Ionic capitals and two altars on both sides. On the high altar there was a painting of the titular saint, later missing, realized by Giuseppe La Ficara in 1651.The picture, with a low artistic value, represented Mary on a throne of clouds, in the middle of 12 stars and the Infant Jesus in her arms; there were a cardinal and a capuchin friar on the sides, while the Eternal father and the Holy Ghost were portrayed in the upper part.\n\nIn 1769 the Church was embellished with stuccoes; inside it there were also some ancient crypts which were destroyed during the demolition, made after the building had been sold by the Curia of Trapani. With the income they bought a piece of land in viale Europa, in order to provide that area with a parish Church, later called chiesa del Sacro Cuore.\n\nIt was founded on 21 June 1602 in the Mother church and had its oratory inside this Church. From the information that the historian Ignazio De Blasi handed down, we know that its brethren were butchers and farmers. They wore a sack and a visor made with linen cloth, a fabric mantle with the image of Maria Santissima dello Stellario, and a big cordon; they went barefoot, with sandals like capuchin friars, the order which their founder, Father Mariano Bonofino, belonged to.\nThe confraternity dissolved in the forties.\nHere it is the list of their obligations: \n\n"}

{"id": "11275640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11275640", "title": "Flower Drum Song (film)", "text": "Flower Drum Song (film)\n\nFlower Drum Song is a 1961 film adaptation of the 1958 Broadway musical \"Flower Drum Song\", written by the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist/librettist Oscar Hammerstein II. The film and stage play were based on the 1957 novel of the same name by the Chinese American author C. Y. Lee.\n\nIn 2008, \"Flower Drum Song\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\"Flower Drum Song\" became the first major Hollywood feature film to have a majority Asian cast in a contemporary Asian-American story. It would be the last film to do so for a third of a century, until 1993's \"The Joy Luck Club\".\n\nA young woman named Mei Li emigrates from China to Chinatown, San Francisco as an illegal immigrant with her father. After landing, the Lis seek the address of Madam Fong, the mother of Sammy Fong, to whom Mei Li has been promised in an arranged marriage. While asking where to find Madam Fong, Mei Li performs a flower drum song to earn money (\"A Hundred Million Miracles\"). Sammy is the owner of a night club, the Celestial Gardens (inspired by the actual Forbidden City nightclub) and is already romantically involved with his leading showgirl, Linda Low. The Lis arrive at the Celestial Gardens during a show (\"Fan Tan Fannie\").\n\nSammy does his best to dissuade Mei Li from marrying him, introducing her to Madame Liang, the sister-in-law of Master Wang. Liang and Wang bemoan the gap between immigrants and their offspring (\"The Other Generation\") as Master Wang's younger son, Wang San gives his own take on the gap to some younger children. However, dissolving the marriage contract is harder than either of them imagine. Master Wang is persuaded by Madame Liang to allow Mei Li to fall in love naturally with Master Wang's eldest son, Wang Ta, and the Lis move in with Master Wang. But Wang Ta is dazzled by the charms of Linda, who flirts with him (\"I Enjoy Being a Girl\"). He asks her to go on a date, and she convinces him to give her his fraternity pin to symbolize they are \"going steady\" during the date.\n\nWhen Mei Li sees Wang Ta sneaking back in after the date, she mistakes his friendly greeting as a welcome to the household and starts to warm to America (\"I Am Going to Like It Here\"). Linda plans to use Wang Ta to force a real commitment from Sammy Fong out of jealousy, but Sammy gets wind of her scheme when Linda attends a party to celebrate both Wang Ta's graduation from university and Madame Liang's graduation from citizenship classes. Madame Liang compares the citizens of America to a mix of different ingredients (\"Chop Suey\"). At the party, Linda has Frankie Wing, the club emcee, pose as her brother to grant permission for Linda to marry Wang Ta. Mei Li, hearing this, becomes discouraged, while Ta and his father argue over his marriage plans. Ta argues that he is old enough to make his own decisions, but the father says that he will be the one to let Ta know when he is old enough.\n\nAt the New Year's Parade, Linda rides on a float and sings about Grant Avenue, Chinatown's \"western street with eastern manners\" (\"Grant Avenue\"). Sammy, in an effort to keep Linda from marrying Wang Ta, invites Wang Ta and his family to Celestial Gardens, where they see Frankie Wing recall girls he has known (\"Gliding Through My Memoree\") and Linda's nightclub act (\"Fan Tan Fanny\"). Wang Ta is shocked at her performance. He leaves, distraught, accompanied by his friend since childhood, the seamstress Helen Chao. Chao also grew up in America and deeply loves Wang Ta. Ta becomes drunk in his misery over Linda, and Helen ends up letting him stay for the night in her apartment, where she declares her unrequited love (\"Love, Look Away\").\n\nIn the morning, Mei Li comes to deliver a burned coat for Helen to mend, and becomes distressed when she discovers Wang Ta's clothing in Helen's kitchen. When Wang Ta wakes up (seconds after Mei Li leaves), he still does not notice Helen's affections, even as she pleads for him to stay, and he leaves quickly. He goes to speak with Mei Li, now realizing that she is a better match for him than Linda Low (\"You Are Beautiful\"), only to have Mei Li reject him, saying that she once loved him, but not anymore.\n\nShe and her father leave Master Wang's house and pursue the marriage contract between Mei Li and Sammy Fong. Sammy has already proposed to Linda, who daydreams about wedded life (\"Sunday\"). Unfortunately, now that Mei Li is pursuing Sammy again, he and Linda will be unable to marry as the contract with Mei Li is binding. Sammy enumerates his many faults (\"Don't Marry Me\") in a last-ditch attempt to convince Mei Li to break the contract. Before the wedding, Wang Ta goes to see Mei Li, and they both realize that they are deeply in love with one another. They agree to try to come up with a way to get Mei Li out of her marriage contract.\n\nThe day of the wedding, right before she is to sip from a goblet (which would seal her marriage to Sammy), Mei Li declares that, because she entered the United States illegally, the contract is null and void. Wang Ta can thus marry Mei Li, and Sammy decides to marry Linda right there as well, resulting in a double wedding.\n\n\nAlthough the score of \"Flower Drum Song\" did not produce many hit tunes, the song \"I Enjoy Being a Girl\" has been recorded by such performers as Doris Day, Peggy Lee, Pat Suzuki, and Phranc, and it has been used in other movies and shows. Parodies of the song including a U.S. Gap company commercial with Sarah Jessica Parker. There are over a dozen versions of the song on YouTube, including parodies based on Harry Potter and \"Battlestar Galactica\".\n\nCompared to the musical on which it is based, the film rearranged the order of the songs. According to David Henry Hwang, the song \"Like a God\" was dropped from the film because studio executives were worried it could \"offend audiences in the American South\". Alfred Newman, the conductor and music supervisor, wrote a letter to producer Ross Hunter protesting the excision of music arrangers from the credits during post-production; Hunter agreed to reinsert a credit for Ken Darby, the associate music supervisor.\n\nThe 1961 soundtrack album from the film was critically praised; \"Variety\" lauded Newman's \"rousing orchestration\". Shortly after its release by Decca Records, both the monaural and stereo versions of the soundtrack charted on the list of bestselling records, according to Billboard Top LP's list. For the film soundtrack album, the performers were credited by role, not name, since \"several of the performers in the movie don't do their own singing.\" The singing voice of the character Linda Low (portrayed by Nancy Kwan) was dubbed by B. J. Baker, a Caucasian studio singer who had worked with Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, The Righteous Brothers, and Sam Cooke.\n\nThe torch song \"Love, Look Away\" sung by Helen Chao (portrayed by Reiko Sato) was also dubbed in by the American opera singer Marilyn Horne, who was offered the job by Alfred Newman, the film's conductor and musical supervisor, after Horne's triumphant début with the San Francisco Opera in \"Wozzeck\". Horne and Newman were friends through her extensive background singing on film soundtracks. In addition, Dr. Han Li (portrayed by Kam Tong) is dubbed by John Dodson.\n\nThe film soundtrack was reissued on CD by Decca Broadway on September 24, 2002, which added a bonus track of \"Love, Look Away\" (2:27), recorded by Rosemary Clooney around 1958.\n\nAfter the novel was released and became a bestseller, options were offered to author C.Y. Lee to produce a movie or stage adaptation. Lee was torn between the movie offer, which was more lucrative at $50,000, but would force him to give up all rights, or the stage offer from Joseph Fields, which only gave him $3,000 but only relinquished stage rights. After getting drunk the night of the decision, Lee could not remember the offer he chose, but his agent congratulated him on making the right choice the next morning. It turns out Lee had chosen the offer from Fields, who initially wanted to produce a play and eventually a movie, but after Fields mentioned the novel to Rodgers and Hammerstein, they signed on to write the musical.\n\nThe 1961 film production of \"Flower Drum Song\" was produced by Universal Studios, a break for Rodgers and Hammerstein, who had previously had their films produced by Twentieth Century Fox. The screenplay was written by Joseph Fields, who had previously collaborated with Hammerstein on the libretto for the musical, but had not previously written a major musical film; likewise, the director Henry Koster and producer Ross Hunter were working on their first musical film.\n\nSan Francisco watercolorist Dong Kingman painted the opening title sequence, which traces the journey of Mei Li from Hong Kong. Hermes Pan provided the choreography.\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 20, 1961; the film was largely shot at Stage 12 of the Universal Studios Lot, on a set built to reproduce Chinatown, including the opening scenes at Saint Mary's Square (complete with a replica of the stainless steel statute of Sun Yat-Sen sculpted by Beniamino Bufano), at a cost of $310,000.\n\nThe film was notable as the first that featured nearly all Asian American cast members (one of the few speaking Caucasian parts being that of a mugger), including dancers, though three of the singing voices were not Asian ones. The contemporaneous paucity of Asian actors notably forced producers to dress Arnold Stang in yellowface as a Chinese cook for an episode of \"Wagon Train\", since \"all of Hollywood's Oriental actors were busy making 'Flower Drum Song'\". Starring in the movie were Nancy Kwan, James Shigeta, Benson Fong, James Hong, Reiko Sato and the original Broadway cast members Jack Soo, Miyoshi Umeki, and Juanita Hall (an African American actress who previously played the Pacific Islander Bloody Mary in the Broadway and film productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"South Pacific\").\n\nAnna May Wong had been scheduled to play the part of Madam Liang, but she died in February 1961, before production began. Kwan won the role of Linda Low when she met Ross Hunter, the producer of \"Flower Drum Song\", at a party after he saw her film debut in the 1960 film adaptation of \"The World of Suzie Wong\". Kwan's casting was announced in February 1961.\n\nAmong various changes for the film, the song \"Like a God\" was changed from a song into a beat poetry presentation. The film (and earlier stage version) is lighter-hearted than the novel upon which it is based. Most notably, while Helen is simply left alone and broken-hearted in the musical and film versions, Ta's rejection of her prompts her to commit suicide in the novel. In the novel, Mei Li does not arrive in Chinatown illegally, nor does she have an arranged marriage with Sammy Fong (whose character was created for the musical and film).\n\nAlthough set in San Francisco, only a few scenes were actually filmed on location, notably a scene with Kwan and Shigeta on Twin Peaks. But neither Kwan nor Shigeta actually filmed at this location. Doubles stood in for them for the long shots of the car arriving and leaving Twin Peaks. The close-ups of Kwan and Shigeta in the car were process shots filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood with the view from Twin Peaks projected on a screen behind them.\n\nThe film includes scenes from the 1961 San Francisco Chinese New Year Festival and Parade.\n\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards:\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"Flower Drum Song\" premiered in New York City at Radio City Music Hall on November 9, 1961. The initial plan was to have the premiere on November 17 in San Francisco, at the Golden Gate Theatre, to benefit local hospitals, including the San Francisco Chinese Hospital. The Golden Gate Theatre premiere would be followed by a three-day Flower Drum Festival in Chinatown. A private screening was held for President John F. Kennedy and his family at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port on November 24. The film was widely released near Christmastime.\n\nAlthough it has been asserted the film was the only Hollywood adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to lose money, the production rights were reported as costing $1 million and the budget was $4 million, while gross revenues have been reported as $10.7 million.\n\nThe film was first issued on VHS in 1986, then reissued in 1991 followed by a LaserDisc version in 1992 by MCA Home Video. The LaserDisc and VHS versions of the film were cropped to a 1.33:1 ratio using pan and scan with the exception of the \"I Enjoy Being a Girl\" sequence. After the VHS and LaserDisc versions went out of print, the film was unavailable on home media for many years, while most of the other video versions of Rodgers and Hammerstein movies were released on DVD by other studios.\n\nAt present, MGM (via its acquisition of The Samuel Goldwyn Company) owns the theatrical and television rights to this movie, as well as other certain Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, while the original distributor Universal owns only the home video rights. (Universal also holds the copyright to this movie.)\n\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment (in association with the estates of Rodgers and Hammerstein) finally released a DVD version on November 7, 2006, with extra features on the making and casting of the movie. It includes interviews with David Henry Hwang, Pat Suzuki, and Nancy Kwan, and pictures from the 1958 and 2002 Broadway rehearsals and practice sessions, as well as pictures of Rodgers, Hammerstein, and Fields.\n\nReviewing for \"The New York Times\" after the premiere, Bosley Crowther called the film neither \"subtle or fragile ... It is gaudy and gaggy and quite melodic.\" \"Life\" called it \"gay, tuneful and well worth the admission\". However, \"Variety\" thought that \"much of the fundamental charm, grace and novelty of Rodgers & Hammerstein's \"Flower Drum Song\" has been overwhelmed by the sheer opulence and glamour [of the film]\".\nLewis calls it \"a bizarre pastiche of limping mediocracy\". He comments that since the 1958 version of the musical was only rarely revived for decades after its initial run, the film \"would in future years come to stand for the stage musical it so crassly misrepresented\" and would serve as the version that academics and latter-day theatre critics would judge when they analyzed the musical. James Deaville countered that Koster and Hunter \"wanted to make the musical more relevant and accessible ... [by] intensify[ing] the generational conflict ... [and] required spelling out much that the musical left to the audience's imagination.\"\n\nAsian-Americans often found the film offensive in later years due to common tropes and what was seen as miscasting Japanese American actors Shigeta and Umeki in Chinese American roles. David Henry Hwang, who revised the musical for a 2001 revival, \"had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It was kind of a guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'\" Writer Joanna Lee praised the film's portrayal of Asian Americans as \"prominent and legitimate American citizens\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "247107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247107", "title": "Illustration", "text": "Illustration\n\nAn illustration is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process, designed for integration in published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films.\n\nThe origin of the word “illustration” is late Middle English (in the sense ‘illumination; spiritual or intellectual enlightenment’): via Old French from Latin \"illustratio(n- )\", from the verb \"illustrate\".\n\nContemporary illustration uses a wide range of styles and techniques, including drawing, painting, printmaking, collage, montage, digital design, multimedia, 3D modelling. Most illustrators work on a freelance basis. \n\nDepending on the purpose, illustration may be expressive, stylised, realistic or highly technical. \n\nSpecialist areas include:\n\nTechnical and scientific illustration communicates information of a technical or scientific nature. This may include exploded views, cutaways, fly-throughs, reconstructions, instructional images, component designs, diagrams. The aim is \"to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer\"\n\nTechnical and scientific illustration is generally designed to describe or explain subjects to a nontechnical audience, so must provide \"an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer's interest and understanding\".\n\nIn contemporary illustration practice, 2D and 3D software is often used to create accurate representations that can be updated easily, and reused in a variety of contexts.\n\nIn the art world, illustration has at times been considered of less importance than graphic design and fine art.\n\nToday, however, due in part to the growth of graphic novel and video game industries, as well as increased use of illustration in magazines and other publications, illustration is now becoming a valued art form, capable of engaging a global market.\n\nOriginal illustration art has been known to attract high prices at auction. The US artist Norman Rockwell's painting \"Breaking Home Ties\" sold in a 2006 Sotheby's auction for USD15.4 million. Many other illustration genres are equally valued, with pinup artists such as Gil Elvgren and Alberto Vargas, for example, also attracting high prices.\n\nHistorically, the art of illustration is closely linked to the industrial processes of printing and publishing.\n\nThe illustrations of medieval codices were known as illuminations, and were individually hand drawn and painted. With the invention of the printing press during the 15th century, books became more widely distributed, often illustrated with woodcuts.\n\n1600s Japan saw the origination of Ukiyo-e, an influential illustration style characterised by expressive line, vivid colour and subtle tones, resulting from the ink-brushed wood block printing technique. Subjects included traditional folk tales, popular figures and every day life. Hokusai’s \"The Great Wave of Kanazawa\" is a famous image of the time.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, the main reproduction processes for illustration were engraving and etching. In 18th Century England, a notable illustrator was William Blake (1757–827), who used relief etching. By the early 19th century, the introduction of lithography substantially improved reproduction quality.\n\nIn Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were John Leech, George Cruikshank, Dickens illustrator Hablot Knight Browne, and, in France, Honoré Daumier. All contributed to both satirical and “serious” publications. At this time, there was a great demand for caricature drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes.\n\nThe British humorous magazine Punch (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's Comic Almanac (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir John Tenniel, the Dalziel Brothers, and Georges du Maurier. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators.\n\nHistorically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term \"cartoon\" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to John Leech being known as the world's first \"cartoonist\". In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian Le Voleur, Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.\n\nFrom the early 1800s newspapers, mass market magazines, and illustrated books had become the dominant consumer media in Europe and the New World. By the 19th century, improvements in printing technology freed illustrators to experiment with color and rendering techniques. These developments in printing effected all areas of literature from cookbooks, photography and traveling guides, as well as children's books. Also, due to advances in printing, it became more affordable to produce color photographs within books and other materials. By 1900, almost 100 percent of paper was machine-made, and while a person working by hand could produce 60-100lbs of paper per day, mechanization yielded around 1,000lbs per day. Additionally, in the 50 year period between 1846 and 1916, book production increased 400% and the price of books was cut in half.\n\nIn America, this led to a \"golden age of illustration\" from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time. Among the best known illustrators of that period were N.C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle of the Brandywine School, J. C. Leyendecker, Maxfield Parrish, and James Montgomery Flagg.\n\n"}

{"id": "54416907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54416907", "title": "Joy of Life (Suzanne Valadon)", "text": "Joy of Life (Suzanne Valadon)\n\nJoy of Life (La Joie de vivre) is an oil painting by Suzanne Valadon, completed in 1911. It was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1967.\n\nSuzanne Valadon's \"Joy of Life\" depicts a landscape with four nude and seminude women who are watched by a nude man. The nude male was modeled by Valadon's lover, André Utter. They met through her son, Maurice Utrillo, and Utter modeled nude for several of Valadon's paintings, including \"Adam and Eve\" (1909) and \"Casting the Net\" (1914).\n\"Joy of Life\" is based on the theme of \"women as nature,\" a typical subject at the time. Gill Perry has argued that the painting reworks the theme of bathers in nature. She notes that the women \"seem strangely separate from each other, the male viewer and from the nature that surrounds them,\" which suggests a \"more ambiguous, dislocated relationship with both nature and the male spectator.\" Perry's reading is echoed by Patricia Mathews, who has described the figures as being \"in\" nature, but not \"equivalent\" to nature. She suggests that the male viewer \"has no other role in the painting except as this near-caricature of the dominating male gaze,\" as the women are unaware of being watched. Rosemary Betterton has argued that the figures disrupt the male gaze and are, in fact, being caught in a moment without being sexualized. According to Mathews, the painting does not offer the \"coherent narrative that so clearly dominated masculinist images.\" Valadon's \"Joy of Life\", Mathews has noted, is consistent with the ways in which \"various narratives intersect in her work in often uncomfortable ways to dislodge and destabilize conventional gendered interpretations.\" In \"Casting the Net\", completed three years later, Valadon actually reversed the traditional active male/passive female concept by casting the nude male in the role of object.\n"}

{"id": "41368389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41368389", "title": "Killing Jesus", "text": "Killing Jesus\n\nKilling Jesus: A History is a 2013 book by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard about the life and crucifixion of Jesus, referred to in the book as Jesus of Nazareth. It is the follow-up to \"Killing Kennedy\" and \"Killing Lincoln\". \"Killing Jesus\" was released September 24, 2013 through Henry Holt and Company. The book was a commercial success, debuting at #1 on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list and remaining on the list for 52 weeks. Popular reviews of the book were mixed, with both Christian and non-Christian reviewers faulting the book for its tedious writing and its claims of historical objectivity. Scholars and historians have extensively criticized the book for its inaccurate, politically-motivated portrayal of Jesus as a \"Tea Party Son of God\", its uncritical approach to primary sources, its omission of some of Jesus' teachings, and its oversimplified, sensationalist portrayal of history. Like both its predecessors, the book was adapted into a television miniseries with the same name for National Geographic Channel.\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Times\", while writing \"Killing Jesus\", O'Reilly and Dugard found that sources were far less plentiful than for the previous books in their \"Killing...\" series. They stated that the Internet was \"a treasure\", but complained that the information on various websites was \"contradictory\", that \"hearsay was often quoted as truth\", and that information from one website was frequently shown to be unreliable when checked against information from more reliable sources. Bill O'Reilly stated that he believes the book was inspired by the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe book begins with \"A Note to Readers\" by Bill O'Reilly, which promises, \"...this is not a religious book. We do not address Jesus the Messiah, only as a man who galvanized a remote area of the Roman Empire and made very powerful enemies while preaching a philosophy of peace and love.\" After a lengthy quotation from the conservative journalist Vermont C. Royster, the introduction concludes: \"But the incredible story behind the lethal struggle between good and evil has not been fully told. Until now.\" The first chapter begins with a novelistic description of the Massacre of the Innocents from . The remaining portion of the chapter focusses on Herod the Great, the king of Judaea, the politics of his reign, the visit of the Magi, and the birth of Jesus. A lengthy footnote at the end of the chapter defends the historical accuracy of the canonical gospels and their traditional attributions to Matthew the Apostle, John Mark, Luke the Evangelist, and John the Apostle.\n\nThe second chapter describes the life of the Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar, his conquests, his seduction by the Egyptian Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra, and his eventual assassination. Chapter Three summarizes the aftermath of Caesar's murder, the Battle of Philippi, the Second Triumvirate, the Octavian's defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium, and Octavian's ascension to the title of \"emperor\". The fourth chapter returns to the life of Jesus, describing his worried parents looking for him after he has gone missing during a trip to Jerusalem for the Passover. It describes some of the politics of Roman Judaea, heavily emphasizing the idea that the Jews were victims of Roman totalitarian oppression. Chapter Five describes the finding in the Temple from , the architecture of the Temple in Jerusalem, Nazareth, and the government and political background of Galilee.\n\nChapter Six describes the preaching of John the Baptist, the arrival of Pontius Pilate in Judaea, the baptism of Jesus, and John the Baptist's arrest. Chapter Seven describes the alleged debaucheries of the Roman emperor Tiberius at Capri, described by the Roman historian Seutonius, accepting all of them as historical. Chapter Eight narrates the Cleansing of the Temple from , Jesus's meeting with Nicodemus from , and the beginning of his ministry. Chapter Nine details the calling of the apostles, the Sermon on the Mount, and the anointing of Jesus from . Following Catholic tradition rather than the gospels, the authors identify the unnamed \"sinful woman\" in this passage as Mary Magdalene. The chapter concludes with the beheading of John the Baptist. Chapter Ten entails Jesus's conflicts with the Pharisees and Sadducees and concludes with a characterization of Judas Iscariot.\n\nChapter Eleven describes Pontius Pilate's governance of Judaea and Chapter Twelve Jesus's entry to Jerusalem. In Chapter Thirteen, Jesus cleanses the Temple again and curses the fig tree. In Chapter Fourteen, he goes to the house of Mary and Martha, proclaims the Golden Rule, tells the Pharisees to \"Render unto Caesar\", weeps over Jerusalem, and predicts his own death. Chapter Fifteen has the betrayal of Judas and Chapter Sixteen has the Last Supper, the Agony in the Garden, and the arrest of Jesus. Chapters Seventeen through Nineteen describe Jesus's trial, crucifixion, and burial. Chapter Twenty-One has the account of the women at the tomb. The \"Afterward\" describes non-Christian mentions of Jesus, the fates of the Apostles according to Catholic tradition, as well as what happened to Tiberius, Caligula, Caiaphas, Herod Antipas, Jerusalem, and the early Christian movement.\n\nUpon its publication, \"Killing Jesus\" debuted at #1 on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list, and was on the list for 52 weeks. \"Killing Jesus\" surpassed the sales of the book \"\" by Reza Aslan, a professor of creative writing, which had been published only a few months before. Of its sales success, \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"The most popular titles in the Washington area have a distinctly biblical glow: for the second week in a row, \"Killing Jesus\" by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard is No. 1. This is the third in their spectacularly successful assassination series, following \"Killing Kennedy\" and \"Killing Lincoln\".\" Noting the concurrent popularity of other religion-related books, the article concludes, \"Publishers have long known that religion sells. Even in Washington.\"\n\nIn its fall books preview, \"USA Today\" called it \"a suspenseful thriller.\" A review of the book by Erik Wemble in \"The Washington Post\" remarked that \"Killing Jesus\" and its predecessors \"may not advance the scholarship on their respective topics, but who'll take issue with millions of Americans getting a quick-read tutorial on history via O’Reilly?\" Nonetheless, Wemble complained that the book's writing was full of annoying verbal tics. In particular, Wemble criticizes O'Reilly's constant countdown of how much time the person he is writing about has left to live and his use of the phrase \"so it is...\" at the beginnings of sentences. Wemble calls the phrase a \"a four-word clump of throat-clearing mumbo-jumbo\" and states that another reviewer counted roughly sixteen or so occurrences of it in \"Killing Jesus\". Wemble speculates that O'Reilly may have intended this phrase as \"a retroactive cliché, a little riff that would sound impressive in a book about antiquity.\"\n\nIn the book, O'Reilly and Dugard state that they are only including events that can be proven as historical fact, a claim which has drawn criticism from both critics of Christianity and evangelical Christians. A 2013 review by Dan Delzell for \"The Christian Post\" criticizes this statement for implying that not everything in the gospels can be proven as historical fact. Instead, the reviewer insists that everything in the gospel accounts is demonstrably factual and that O'Reilly's selective omission of stories found in the gospels from his book is tantamount to \"cut[ting] Christ in half.\" A review by Tim Chaffey from Answers in Genesis criticizes the book for deliberately omitting several of Jesus's miracles and glossing over others. The same review criticized the book for its \"graphic description of sexual activity\" and for portraying Mary Magdalene as a repentant prostitute, an idea that is not based on the Bible.\n\nIn an article for \"Salon\", Robert M. Price, an atheist theologian and self-identified fan of Bill O'Reilly, labels \"Killing Jesus\" a work of complete fiction comparable to \"The Da Vinci Code\", and states, \"There is no sign whatsoever that the authors of \"Killing Jesus\" have even begun to do their homework here. In the end notes, true, we find a number of book recommendations, but it is revealing that virtually every one of the New Testament and Jesus books mentioned are the work of evangelical/fundametalist spin doctors dedicated to defending the proposition that the gospels are entirely accurate, miracles and all.\" A 2015 review of both the book and the television miniseries based on it by Brook Wilensky-Lanford in \"The Guardian\" criticizes O'Reilly for accepting Jesus's alleged miracles as potentially historical and remarks that, although O'Reilly claims to treat his subject objectively, he \"can't be trusted not to confuse religious interpretation with historical fact.\"\n\nCandida Moss, a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame, criticizes the book for its many historical inaccuracies in two articles written in September and October 2013 for \"The Daily Beast\" and CNN respectively. Moss states that, although O'Reilly and Dugard do attempt to separate between fact and fiction, they do so inconsistently and accordingly to their previously held beliefs. In her \"Daily Beast\" article, she states: \"...without a method, \"Killing Jesus\" has all the critical rigor of your local church's Nativity play.\" She notes that O'Reilly and Dugard accept late, unsubstantiated legends about the fates of the apostles after the period covered by the New Testament as historical fact. They also uncritically accept the legend formalized in the fifth century by Pope Gregory I about Mary Magdalene having previously been a prostitute, which is not supported by the New Testament or any early Christian writings, but ignore the statement actually recorded in the gospels that Mary Magdalene was one of the people funding Jesus's ministry. They include statements from John the Baptist accusing tax collectors of overcharging people, but omit all reference to Jesus's repeated injunctions to \"support the poor, orphans, and widows\" as well as to the saying, \"whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise\" ().\n\nIn her CNN article, Moss cites the example of how they omit the line \"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do\", which attributes to Jesus as he was being crucified, because, as O'Reilly later said in a CBS interview, it is impossible to speak audibly while a person is being crucified. She then points out that they chose \"not\" to omit the line \"It is finished\", also attributed to Jesus while he was on the cross, in . Moss suggests that perhaps \"there [is just] something about the word 'forgiveness' that sticks in [their throats]\". She also criticizes them for taking everything written by Roman historians like Suetonius and Josephus completely at face value, as though these writers were totally unbiased. She also particularly criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard's portrayal of the Pharisees as \"self-righteous bloviators\", stating that modern Biblical scholars no longer view them this way, and that this portrayal is, ironically, based more on the stereotype of Roman Catholics promoted by Protestants during the Reformation and Early Modern Period than on actual ancient texts.\n\nMoss states that \"Killing Jesus\"'s description of the apostle Paul converting to \"Christianity\" is anachronistic because, at the time, Christianity was still a Jewish sect and the word \"Christian\" was not even coined until near the end of the first century. Instead, she says \"the first generation of Jesus' followers lived and died as Jews.\" Moss also notes O'Reilly and Dugard's unusual interpretations of various passages, such as , which O'Reilly and Dugard apparently interpret to mean that John the Baptist told the Pharisees that they will either \"burn \"or\" be condemned to Hell.\" She concludes: \"Apart from the methodological problems, the entire book is written in the style of a novel, not a history book. We hear the thoughts of Herod as he orders the execution of the male children of Bethlehem, for instance. It's entertaining, but it's historical fan fiction, not history.\"\n\nIn an article from November 2013, Joel L. Watts, author of \"Mimetic Criticism and the Gospel of Mark\", calls \"Killing Jesus\" nothing more than \"an attempt at agenda-driven drivel produced for the lowest common denominator.\" He adds, \"I wish I had my day back.\" In addition to raising many of the same accuracy concerns as Moss, Watts also criticizes the book for imputing post-Enlightenment ideas of individualism to ancient Galileean Jews and for referring to the Sadducees (who believed that the Torah was the only authoritative scripture and opposed the more progressive theology promoted by the Pharisees) as \"liberals\". He also criticizes a statement that the canon of the Hebrew Bible had been established \"500 years\" before Jesus, when, in reality, many of the books in the Hebrew Bible were not written until after that point and the canon of the Hebrew Bible was still debated long after Jesus's death. Watts accuses the authors of being arrogant and dismissive of the opinions of actual experts. He determines that \"they destroy context and literary construction to, and I can only assume this based on the evidence of reading the book, hide the actual message of the Gospels.\"\n\nA December 2013 review in \"The Guardian\" by Selina O'Grady, author of \"And Man Created God: Kings, Cults, and Conquests at the Time of Jesus\", remarks that, \"Everyone creates God in their own image, so it's not surprising that Fox television's aggressively conservative down-home-let's-hear-it-for-the-ordinary-guy talk show host should have created a Tea Party son of God. Jesus, the little guy, is an enemy of the big corrupt tax-oppressing Roman empire, which is itself just a version of Washington, only even more venal and sexually depraved. This Jesus is a tax-liberating rebel who incurs the wrath of the Jewish and Roman powers by threatening their joint fleecing of the people. As a member of the populist right, he is not, of course, in favour of redistribution: Bill O'Reilly's Jesus does not tell the rich to give away their money to the poor.\" The same review criticizes \"Killing Jesus\" for its \"bodice-ripping treatment of history\", stating that the book oversimplifies, sensationalizes, and misrepresents the historical events it purports to describe. According to O'Grady, \"Killing Jesus\" presents the Romans, Jewish elites, and Pharisees as categorically \"bad\" and \"ordinary Jews\" as \"good\", without any background or nuance. O'Grady also criticizes O'Reilly and Dugard for relying almost entirely on the gospels and ignoring the centuries' worth of books written by Biblical scholars about the historical Jesus.\n\nDuring a Q&A session following a 2014 lecture at Dickinson College on \"Jesus and the Historian\", Bart D. Ehrman, James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, laughed at his own mention of \"Killing Jesus\", commenting \"Bill O'Reilly! \"There's\" a source you trust about the historical Jesus. Hah! Aye yai yai.\" In his 2016 book \"Jesus Before the Gospels\", Ehrman was less overtly hostile, merely commenting that O'Reilly is \"obviously... not a New Testament scholar.\" In both the lecture and the book, Ehrman implicitly criticizes O'Reilly's portrayal of the historical Jesus as an advocate of \"smaller government and lower taxes.\" In the book, though, he adds, \"It is easy to see how this view of Jesus might resonate with a wide swath of our population today.\"\n\nNational Geographic picked up the television adaptation of \"Killing Jesus\", just as it had for \"Killing Lincoln\" and \"Killing Kennedy\". In March 2014, it was announced \"Killing Jesus\" was being adapted into a four-hour miniseries, and Walon Green has been tapped to write and executive produce the project. Also returning as executive producers are Ridley Scott, David W. Zucker, and Mary Lisio, who previously produced \"Killing Kennedy\". In August 2014, Christopher Menaul was attached to direct the miniseries.\n\nOn its premiere airing, the film was watched by 3.7 million viewers, averaging a 1.0 rating among adults in the 25-54 demographic. The viewership surpassed the record previously held by \"Killing Kennedy\". A review on \"Yahoo TV\" by Ken Tucker said of the film, \"Rendered without much embellishment and acted with firmly controlled vigor, \"Killing Jesus\", a TV adaptation of the bestselling book by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard, is a fine retelling of the story of Jesus Christ as a historical figure. That last phrase is key. O'Reilly and his co-author sought to write only what they considered provable historical facts about Christ. Whether this has been accomplished I'll leave to historians and theologians...\" A glowing review by Hannah Goodwin for the Christian Broadcasting Network praised the film for its authentic-looking set and costumes and called it \"a conversation starter\". The review suggested, \"Presenting Jesus' life and death from a largely historical perspective could open this religious history to wider audiences.\"\n\nA review by Neil Genzlinger in \"The New York Times\", however, panned the film, declaring, \"It's a costume pageant devoid both of the reverence that has made some previous film versions work and of the intrigue that might provide a secular \"Game of Thrones\"-like appeal. More effort went into the jewelry and headwear than into the storytelling.\" The same review compared the miniseries unfavorably with the book, stating, \"The book tried to put Jesus' story in the broader context of the politics and practices of the day, but here the account is largely pared down to the biblical rendition, with Jesus casting out a demon, preventing the stoning of a woman accused of adultery and delivering the touchstone teachings that all Christians know by heart.\"\n"}
{"id": "75286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75286", "title": "Landscape architecture", "text": "Landscape architecture\n\nLandscape architecture is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes. It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome. The scope of the profession includes landscape design; site planning; stormwater management; erosion control; environmental restoration; parks and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a landscape architect.\n\nLandscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of botany, horticulture, the fine arts, architecture, industrial design, soil sciences, environmental psychology, geography, ecology, and civil engineering. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil infrastructure and the management of large wilderness areas or reclamation of degraded landscapes such as mines or landfills. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, urban, suburban and rural, and with \"hard\" (built) and \"soft\" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological sustainability. The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.\n\nThe variety of the professional tasks that landscape architects collaborate on is very broad, but some examples of project types include:\n\nLandscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in forestry, nature conservation and agriculture.\n\nLandscape scientists have specialist skills such as soil science, hydrology, geomorphology or botany that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular species in a given area.\n\nLandscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.\nTheir work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning.\n\nGreen roof (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive roof gardens for storm water management, evapo-transpirative cooling, sustainable architecture, aesthetics, and habitat creation.\n\nFor the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses, palaces and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by André Le Nôtre at Vaux-le-Vicomte for King Louis XIV of France at the Palace of Versailles. The first person to write of \"making\" a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in 1828, and John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the \"Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton\".\n\nThe practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term \"landscape architect\" was used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States in 1863 and \nAndrew Jackson Downing (1815–1852), another early American landscape designer, was editor of \"The Horticulturist\" magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, \"A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America\", was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States. During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Beatrix Jones (later Farrand) with others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at Cambridge, England, in 1948 with Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe as its first president, representing 15 countries from Europe and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in Versailles.\n\nThrough the 19th century, urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs. In the second half of the century, Frederick Law Olmsted completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were Central Park in New York City, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York and Boston's Emerald Necklace park system. Jens Jensen designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for Chicago, Illinois, and private estates for the Ford family including Fair Lane and Gaukler Point. One of the original ten founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), and the only woman, was Beatrix Farrand. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Arnold Arboretum for Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts. Her numerous private estate projects include the landmark Dumbarton Oaks in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.. Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.\n\nSince this period Urban Planning has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as Civil Engineering, Architecture and Public Administration. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.\n\nLandscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Thomas Church was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.\n\nIan McHarg was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture. He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc. GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.\n\nIn many countries, a professional institute, comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In Europe, North America, parts of South America, Australia, India and New Zealand, landscape architecture is a regulated profession.\n\nSince 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper Carlos Thays, recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the UBA University of Buenos Aires\"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo\" (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.\n\nAILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.\n\nLandscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.\n\nIn Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute. For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the \"Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act\". Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.\n\nProvincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.\n\nAIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.\nIn Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:\n\nThe New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ www.nzila.co.nz.\n\nIn April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand. The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.\n\nWithin NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.\n\nNZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.\n\nThe Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.\n\nAt international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.\n\nILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.\n\nThe profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.\n\nA key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.\n\nLandscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.\n\nLandscape architects are employed in design of: green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.\nThey are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.\n\nIn May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA). ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).\n\nIn South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP), established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.\n\nAfter completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the University of Cape Town or the University of Pretoria, or landscape technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.\n\nThe UK's professional body is the Landscape Institute (LI). It is a chartered body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.\n\nThe Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.\n\nIn 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled \"I want to be a Landscape Architect\" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building sustainable communities and fighting climate change.\n\nIn the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.). Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB). Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in \"U.S. News & World Report\"'s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the American Society of Landscape Architects.\n"}

An oil painting on canvas executed in 1592–94, it is housed in the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, northern Italy.\n\nTintoretto depicted the Last Supper several times during his artistic career. His earlier paintings for the Chiesa di San Marcuola (1547) and for the Chiesa di San Felice (1559) depict the scene from a frontal perspective, with the figures seated at a table placed parallel to the picture plane. This follows a convention observed in most paintings of the Last Supper, of which Leonardo da Vinci's late 1490s mural painting in Milan, Italy, is perhaps the best-known example. \n\nTintoretto's painting of 1592–94, a work of his final years, departs drastically from this compositional formula. The centre of the scene is occupied not by the apostles but instead by secondary characters, such as a woman carrying a dish and the servants taking the dishes from the table. The table at which the apostles sit recedes into space on a steep diagonal. Also personal is Tintoretto's use of light, which appears to come into obscurity from both the light on the ceiling and from Jesus' aureola. A host of angels hover above the scene.\n\nTintoretto's \"Last Supper\" makes use of Mannerist devices, notably its complex and radically asymmetrical composition. In its dynamism and emphasis on the quotidian—the setting is similar to a Venetian inn—the painting points the way to the Baroque. \"The ability of this dramatic scene to engage viewers was well in keeping with Counter-Reformation ideals and the Catholic Church's belief in the didactic nature of religious art.\" \n"}

The opera company includes the Latvian National Ballet (LNB), LNO Chorus, and LNO Orchestra.\n\nRiga already had a German-speaking theatre, which also offered opera and ballet, from 1782, and this was housed in the Riga City Theatre from 1863. \n\nThe first attempt to create a Latvian national opera was 1893, when Jēkabs Ozols' \"Spoku stunda\" (\"The Ghostly Hour\") was performed. The Latvian opera (Latviešu Opera) was founded in 1912 by Pāvuls Jurjāns, though almost immediately, during the First World War, the opera troupe was evacuated to Russia. In 1918, the opera restarted (Latvju Opera) led by Jāzeps Vītols, the founder of the Latvian Academy of Music. The debut performance, on January 23, 1919, was of Wagner’s \"Der fliegende Holländer\". From 1944, following the occupation of Latvia by Soviet Union, and incorporation into the Soviet Union, the Latvian National Opera became the Latvian S.S.R. State Opera and Ballet Theater. In 1990, the theater was renamed the Latvian National Opera, but almost immediately the building was closed till 1995 for renovation and the company moved to temporary premises. For the reopening in 1995, the first opera was Jānis Mediņš’ \"Uguns un nakts\" (Fire and Night).\n\nThe National Opera House was constructed in 1863 by the St. Petersburg architect Ludwig Bohnstedt (interiors made by the firm of August Volz), for the then German-speaking City Theatre, and has been refurbished several times; 1882–1887 (following a fire in 1882), 1957–1958, 1991–1995 (following independence).

Hart for the Clarendon Law Series.\n\nFinnis argues that social theory cannot be value free and that Humean ethics, unlike genuine (as opposed to neo-scholastic) Thomist ethics, commits a naturalistic fallacy. He bases his radically rearticulated Aristotelian political and legal theory on dialectically defended first principles of practical reason and methodological principles of practical reasonableness (morality). He defends the following basic human goods: life, knowledge, play, aesthetic experience, sociability (friendship), practical reasonableness, and religion, defined as \"all those beliefs that can be called matters of ultimate concern; questions about the point of human existence.\"\n\nThe philosophy lecturer Stephen Buckle sees Finnis's list of proposed basic goods as plausible, but notes that Finnis's account of the basic requirements of practical reasonableness is more controversial. Buckle sees Finnis's requirement of \"respect for every basic value in every act\" as intended both to rule out consequentialism in ethics and also to support the moral viewpoint of the Catholic Church on a range of contentious issues, including contraception and masturbation, which in his view undermines its plausibility.\n\n\n"}

He is represented by James Cohan Gallery and lives in Berlin.\n\nOmer Fast is a video artist based in Berlin, he was born and raised in Israel, Fast spent much of his teenage years in Jericho, New York while his father pursued a medical degree in both countries. He received his BFA from a dual-degree program at Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1995, majoring in English and painting, and an MFA from Hunter College in 2000. He subsequently got a job doing magazine layout.\n\nFast's politically charged subject matter covers issues of race, pornography, and war—both historical battles and contemporary conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nHis work has been exhibited extensively in the United States and internationally. In October 2015, a monographic exhibition of Fast’s work titled Present Continuous opened at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, and subsequently travelled to the Baltic Center of Contemporary Art, Gateshead, UK, and the KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art, Aalborg. Denmark. He has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Moderna Museet, Stockholm, Sweden; Le Caixa, Madrid, Spain; Musée d’Art Contemporain, Montréal, Canada; Museum of Contemporary Art, Krakow, Poland; STUK Leuven, Belgium; Dallas Museum of Art, TX; Cleveland Museum of Art, OH; the Art Institute of Chicago, IL; the Minneapolis Institute of Art, MN; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, NY. His work was featured in dOCUMENTA (13), the 54th Venice Biennale, and the 2002 and 2008 Whitney Biennials. He received a BFA from Tufts University and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and an MFA from Hunter College in New York City. Fast lives and works in Berlin, Germany.\n\nFast's work is included in the permanent collections of numerous institutions, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, NY; LACMA, CA; Tate Modern, London, UK; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, France; and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands among others. Fast Lives and works in Berlin, Germany.\n\nFast is one of several contemporary artists who restages existing films, including Pierre Huyghe, Robert Melee and Yasumasa Morimura.\n\nIn 2017, Fast was met with protests and allegations of racism by the Chinatown Art Brigade and others, including the Korean American artist and 47 Canal gallery owner Margaret Lee, for his August exhibition in the James Cohan gallery on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The show was titled “August” after its centerpiece, a fine 3D video from 2016 that was inspired by the life of August Sander, a German portrait and documentary photographer. But that video, along with an earlier one, has been upstaged by a surrounding installation that transforms Cohan’s white-box space into a New York Chinatown shop or bus-company waiting room with metal chairs, broken A.T.M.s and a shabby facade. Fast seems to have intended the Cohan gallery “waiting room” not as a replication of any real Chinatown but as the kind of fantasy version of immigrant neighborhoods evoked to justify “slum clearance.” While the work was intended to provoke a strong reaction, a group of Chinatown-based activists have called out the piece as racist “poverty porn,” pure and simple, and demanded its removal.\nIn 2015 Fast released his first feature film, based on the Tom McCarthy novel \"Remainder\"\n\n\"Continuity\" features an older couple who hires male escorts to play out their dead son’s return from Afghanistan. The 40-minute work explores loss and grief as much as the narrative constructions of fiction and the cinematic conventions used in documentary films.\n\nFast is the director of this short film shown on the Biennale di Venezia in 2011.\n\nIn October 2009, Fast’s exhibition \"Nostalgia\" opened at South London Gallery. The exhibition included \"Nostalgia\", a three-part film installation that intermingles a man’s account of his struggle for asylum in Britain with a reenactment of his story as a 1970s science fiction movie in which he attempts to flee a dystopian Europe and relocate to a colony in Africa.\nFast's 2009-2010 Nostalgia at the Whitney Museum of American Art was part of the 2008 Bucksbaum Award, given to the most prominent artist in that year's Whitney Biennial.\n\nIn the four-channel video piece \"Casting\", the viewer walks into the screening room initially encountering two hanging projection screens. Each screen contains a different depiction of a narrative showing the characters acting while silent and remaining completely still. The projection screens are double sided and contain two additional images on the rear side where the viewer sees two men engaged in an interview. The two men are a young American Army sergeant and the artist in a dialog about the narrative. The artist states during the interview that he is interested only in memory and how memory gets mediated; he says the work he is trying to achieve has or should have no political slant. Although the work is politically ambiguous it shows the powerlessness of an American Army sergeant in the current Iraqi conflict and possibly the powerlessness of perceived American hegemonic power.\n\nIn 2002, Fast released \"CNN Concatenated\", an 18-minute-long single-channel video which uses CNN news anchor clips. The video is cut so that each word is spoken by a different newsperson. The pieces literally asks the viewers questions about media authenticity and gives CNN a distinct voice.\n\nThe 59-minute two-channel work centers on interviews with residents of Krakow, Poland, who worked as extras in the concentration camp scenes in Steven Spielberg's film \"Schindler's List\". The video suggests that, whatever their experience, many of them conflated the Hollywood version of the Holocaust with historical reality.\n\nFast has had solo exhibitions at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus (2012), Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2010), Berkeley Art Museum (2009), Museum of Modern Art, Vienna (2007), Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh (2005), Midway Contemporary Art, Minneapolis (2005), Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich (2004), and the Frankfurter Kunstverein, Frankfurt (2003). His work has also been featured in dOCUMENTA (13) (2012) and numerous biennials and group exhibitions. In 2016 the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin is showing the exhibition \"Omer Fast. Talking is not always the solution\".\n\nHis work is represented by gb agency, Paris and ARRATIA, BEER (Berlin) and James Cohan Gallery (NY).\n\nFast's work is in such international collections as the Whitney Museum of American Art, Solomon R.

It was one of the earliest opera houses in New York before it was converted into one of the earliest Broadway theatres. The theatre was conceived by Ferdinand Palmo, an Italian immigrant and successful restaurateur in New York City. It was located inside the former Stoppani's Arcade Baths building. Modest alteration to the building was done in 1843 to convert the building into a theater.\n\nIn 1848 opera performances at Palmo's Opera House ceased and the theater was leased to William Evans Burton. It was rechristened the Burton's Theater and became a performance venue for plays and other theatrical entertainments. It operated under that name until 1856 when the theater was leased to Edward Eddy and it was rebranded again as the Chambers Street Theatre. The theatre operated under that name until it closed in 1864. The building was then leased to the United States Government, and was used as a Federal Court building until it was demolished in 1876.\n\nPalmo's Opera House, designed by John M. Trimble, opened on February 3, 1844 with a production of Bellini's \"I puritani\" with Euphrasia Borghese as Elvira, Emma Albertazzi as Henrietta, and Michael Rapetti conducting. This was soon followed by performances of Bellini's \"Beatrice di Tenda\" and the New York premiere of Donizetti's \"Belisario\". In April 1844 the theater staged Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\" with basso buffo Antonio Sanquirico making his professional stage debut as Dr Bartolo. The following month the opera house presented the operas \"La sonnambula\" and \"L'elisir d'amore\" for their first presentations in the original Italian language in New York City.\n\nThe Fall 1844 season at Palmo's opened with a production of Rossini's \"L'italiana in Algeri\" with Laure Cinti-Damoreau as Isabella. The singer was later heard to rave reviews that season as Rosina in a revival of the company's production of \"The Barber of Seville\". Also performed that season was Rossi's \"Chiara Rosenberg\" with Rosina Pico in the title role.\n\nIn 1847 the Sanquirico-Patti Opera Company became the resident opera company at Palmo's Opera House. The company's first presentation there was the United States premiere of Donizetti's \"Linda di Chamounix\" on January 4, 1847 with Clotilda Barili in the title role and Sesto Benedetti as the Vicomte de Serval. The company went on to present the first opera by Giuseppe Verdi ever staged in the United States, \"I Lombardi alla prima crociata\" on March 3, 1847. Other operas staged that year at Palmo's included the New York premiere of \"Lucrezia Borgia\" and another staging of \"The Barber of Seville\".\n\nDespite making some notable achievements, the Sanquirico-Patti Opera company did not fare well financially against a new opera rival in the city, the touring Havana Opera Company, partly due to the much nicer accommodations and better production value at the Park Theatre where the Havana company was playing. In the Fall of 1847 the Sanquirico-Patti Opera Company left Palmo's for the newly built Astor Opera House. Faced with strong competition and mounting losses, Palmo ceased presenting opera at the house and the theater was leased in 1848 to William Evans Burton.\n\nBurton's Theatre opened on July 10, 1848 with a performance of the play \"Maiden's Beware!\". Later that month Burton presented the world premiere of John Brougham's stage adaptation of Dicken's \"Dombey and Son\" with Burton as Captain Cuttle to great success. In July 1849 the theater presented Dion Boucicault's \"London Assurance\" with Fanny Wallack as Lady Gay Spanker. On December 3, 1849 the theater presented the world premiere of Morris Barnett's \"The Serious Family\". In 1852 the theatre staged John Poole's \"Paul Pry\" with Henry Placide as Colonel Harding. The theatre also staged several plays by Burton, including the comedy \"Romance and Reality\", the burlesque \"Pocahontas\", and an adaptation of \"The Duke's Motto\".\n\nBurton assembled several notable performers of the era in his troupe at the theatre, including Rosa Bennett, William R. Blake, W. Humphrey Bland, Julis Daly, Edward Loomis Davenport, Jane Hill (later Mrs W. E. Burton), Josephine Shaw Russell Hoey, Mrs. Hughes, Mrs. George Jordan, John Sefton, Emma Skerret, Mary Cecilia Taylor, John Lester Wallack, and Lizzie Weston among others.\n\nIn 1856 Burton left for another theatre in uptown Manhattan and Edward Eddy took over the lease of the theatre which he renamed the Chamber Street Theatre.\n\n\n"}

The majority of the artifacts are currently in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.\n\nSchliemann claimed the site to be that of Homeric Troy, and assigned the artifacts to the Homeric king Priam. This assignment is now thought to be a result of Schliemann's zeal to find sites and objects mentioned in the Homeric epics which take place in northwestern Turkey. At the time the stratigraphy at Troy had not been solidified, which was done subsequently by the archaeologist Carl Blegen. The layer in which Priam's Treasure was alleged to have been found was assigned to Troy II, whereas Priam would have been king of Troy VI or VII, occupied hundreds of years later.\n\nWith the rise of modern critical history, Troy and the Trojan War were consigned to the realms of legend. In 1871-73 and 1878–79, Schliemann excavated a hill called Hissarlik in the Ottoman Empire, near the town of Chanak (Çanakkale) in north-western Anatolia, Turkey. Here he discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities, dating from the Bronze Age to the Roman period. Schliemann declared one of these cities—at first Troy I, later Troy II—to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time.\n\nConcerning events on or about May 27, 1873 Schliemann reported:\n\nSchliemann's oft-repeated story of the treasure being carried by his wife, Sophie, in her shawl was untrue. Schliemann later admitted making it up, saying that at the time of the discovery Sophie was in fact with her family in Athens, following the death of her father.\n\nA partial catalogue of the treasure is approximately as follows:\n\nApparently, Schliemann smuggled Priam's Treasure out of Anatolia. The officials were informed when his wife, Sophia, wore the jewels for the public. The Ottoman official assigned to watch the excavation, Amin Effendi, received a prison sentence. The Ottoman government revoked Schliemann's permission to dig and sued him for its share of the gold. Schliemann went on to Mycenae. There, however, the Greek Archaeological Society sent an agent to monitor him.\n\nLater Schliemann traded some treasure to the government of the Ottoman Empire in exchange for permission to dig at Troy again. It is located in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. The rest was acquired in 1881 by the Royal Museums of Berlin \"(Königliche Museen zu Berlin)\", in whose hands it remained until 1945, when it disappeared from a protective bunker beneath the Berlin Zoo.\n\nIn fact, after the capture of the bunker by the Red Army Professor Wilhelm Unverzagt turned the treasure over to the Soviet commendant and thus saved it from plunder and division. The commander promised to guarantee the safety of the art treasures. The artefacts were taken away to Moscow. During the Cold War, the Soviet government denied any knowledge of the fate of Priam's Treasure. However, in September 1993 the treasure turned up at the Pushkin Museum.\n\nRussia keeps what the West terms the looted art as compensation for the destruction of Russian cities and looting of Russian museums by Nazi Germany in World War II. A 1998 Russian law, the Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation, legalizes the looting in Germany as compensation and prevents Russian authorities from proceeding to restitutions.\n\nThere have always been doubts about the authenticity of the treasure. Within the last few decades these doubts have found fuller expression in articles and books.\nThe treasures are actually a thousand years older than Homer's King Priam of Troy, who died about 1200 B.C.\n\n\n"}

The purse increased in 1926 until Blumenthal's death in 1930 to ten thousand francs for two years. \n\nJurors included philosopher Henri Bergson; novelist Roland Dorgelès; novelist, essayist, diplomat and playwright Jean Giraudoux; writer Anna de Noailles; poet and essayist Paul Valéry; painter Paul Signac, painter and printmaker Édouard Vuillard, sculptor Paul Landowski, painter and sculptor Aristide Maillol, architect Auguste Perret, composer Paul Dukas, composer Maurice Ravel and composer/conductor Guy Ropartz.\n\nComposer Georges Migot served as vice-president and subsequently as president (1931–1935) of the foundation, as well as the archivist of the winners. \n\nBeginning in 1919 the foundation awarded nearly two hundred grants, and on April 11, 1937, the Prix Blumenthal was declared \"d'utilité publique (\"of public service\")\", giving it a special tax classification.

She was also related to Levi Strauss through her sisters.\n\nIn 1925, Blumenthal moved to Paris with her husband, later donating large sums to the Children’s Hospital in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Sorbonne in Paris. Blumenthal died in Paris in 1930, at age fifty-five, having won, along with her husband, the French Legion of Honor the previous year.\n\nAs an example of the impact of the Prix Blumenthal, textile artist Paule Marrot received the stipend in 1928, which allowed Marrot to open her workshop in Batignolles on rue Truffaut — where she became widely known for furniture textiles. Marrot went on to experience strong popularity and commercial success in the U.S. after World War II, made a strong impact at Renault by pioneering the company's textile and color division, and redefined furnishing fabrics in France. In 1952 Marrot was awarded the French Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor), (\"Chevalier\") — and her textiles continue under license to diverse companies including Nike, Anthropologie and the handbag maker, Hayden-Harnett.\n\nPartial list, by year of award:\n"}

He filled nets with empty discarded plastic bottles to support a structure of plywood and bamboo, on which he poured sand and planted numerous plants, including mangroves. The island sported a two-story house, a solar oven, a self-composting toilet, and three beaches. He used some 250,000 bottles for the structure. \n\nSowa was ordered to take the island out of the man-made canal in 2004 because many private homes and condos were being built and he lived for one year tied to the end of a loose rock pier. Richart was offered a new location in the bay of Soliman about 200 km south, Finally, he was permitted by Port authorities to tow Spiral Island but the island was destroyed by Hurricane Emily in 2005. \n\nIn late 2007 and 2008, Sowa built a replacement for Spiral Island in the waters of Isla Mujeres, the \"Island of Women\", also near Cancun.

It has since expanded to 25 metres (82 ft) due to various plants and mangroves growing from the island. The new island has three beaches, a house, two ponds, a wave-powered washing machine, solar panels, a solar-powered waterfall and river. The island is a constant work in progress with volunteers and Sowa himself continually making improvements.\n\nIn May 2011, Reishee embarked on a project to berth his island out in Isla Mujeres Bay, as it was now too big for its current site off a pier in Laguna Majax. The Mexican Government also recognized Joyxee Island as an \"Eco Boat\" and therefore needed to comply with all current boating regulations, which involved the purchase of fire extinguishers, life ring buoys and emergency kits. The project was launched on kickstarter.com with a goal of $18,000 that it failed to reach. Reishee later successfully relaunched the project with a more conservative $9,000 goal.\n\nNotes\n"}

He defines the latter as \"a choral song without anapaests or trochaics\". This comment about the absence of anapest and trochee has been interpreted to mean that the music was not based on the usual “walking” meters, since the chorus sings the stasimon while remaining in the orchestra. After making its entrance singing the parodos, it does not usually leave the orchestra until the end of the play.\n\nThe \"Suda\", an 11th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, attributes the establishment of the choral singing of a stasimon to the celebrated kitharode Arion of Hermione.\n"}
{"id": "428496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428496", "title": "Teaching stories", "text": "Teaching stories\n\nTeaching stories is a term used to describe narratives that have been deliberately created as vehicles for the transmission of wisdom. Whilst it is a term that has been used in a number of religious and other traditions, Shah's use of it was in the context of Sufi teaching and learning, within which this body of material has been described as the \"most valuable of the treasures in the human heritage\". The range of teaching stories is enormous, including anecdotes, accounts of meetings between teachers and pupils, biographies, myths, fairy tales, fables and jokes. Such stories frequently have a long life beyond the initial teaching situation and (sometimes in deteriorated form) have contributed vastly to the world's store of folklore and literature.\n\nIt is the teaching function of teaching stories that characterises them rather than any other categorisation, however much they may have other uses. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach:\n\nThus these narratives also often have a wide circulation outside of any instructional function, where they frequently have cultural significance and entertainment value, or contain a moral answer or solution of some kind, or are put to use to reinforce belief. What makes them distincively teaching stories however is something different: they are likely to be open-ended, depending on the individual members of their audience for a variety of interpretations. Their purpose is ultimately to change the thinking process itself. They put at the disposal of those who know them an instrument for measuring themselves, the world and situations that they encounter. It is for this reason that the reading, rereading, discussion and interpretation of narratives in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah's study circles engaged.\n\nAccording to Doris Lessing:\n\nShah described many of the folktales widely dispersed across the world as teaching stories, writing in the introduction to one such tale, The Lost Camel, collected in his \"World Tales\":\n\nWithout denying the entertainment or moral value in the stories, Shah emphasised that there is in such tales an often hidden dimension of instruction. Stories, such as those from the Thousand and One Nights and other collections of traditional myths and folktales, are considered to fall into this category. Modern examples (although maybe not generally recognized as such) are some of the stories that have been retold and adapted by Disney. These tales have been adapted and laid out in the simplest form of their wisdom, making them easily accessible for children in particular. As Robert Ornstein has written:\n\nThough a \"moral\" is appended to many fables, for instance the fables of Aesop, Shah insisted that there were levels of meaning hidden in them that lay beyond the merely didactic:\n\nShah published four books of tales of the Mulla Nasrudin. These stories are known throughout the Muslim world. Superficially, most of the stories may be told as jokes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and caravanserais of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasrudin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, but there is also the structure of the tale that functions as an analogy or metaphor for some aspect of human nature or learning.\n\nIt is impossible to say how far back in time teaching stories go. Shah's collection \"World Tales\" includes the Tale of Two Brothers, an ancient Egyptian story from around the 12th century BC. Jataka tales from India as far back as the 3rd century BC have travelled westwards via the Panchatantra and have long been recognised as having a teaching function. An example is The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal which made its first appearance In Europe some 900 years ago in Petrus Alphonsi's collection of tales, the \"Disciplina Clericalis\" (which, according to E.L. Ranelagh, could be translated as \"a course of study for the reader\").\n\nThe blind men and an elephant is a well-known tale that has been used among Jainists, Buddhists and Hindus in India, as well as by Persian Sufi writers Sanai of Ghazni, Attar of Nishapur and Rumi. Shah's \"Tales of the Dervishes\", a collection of narratives gathered from classical Sufi texts and oral sources spanning a period from the 7th to the 20th centuries, gives Sanai's version.\n\nParallels with other religious traditions are obvious, wherever narratives are used instructionally rather than to generate or perpetuate belief or conformity. Examples might be Zen koans, Hasidic tales, and the parables of Jesus. Sometimes, as in The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal or The Blind men and an elephant, versions of the same story are put to use.\n\n\n"}

In Baron-Cohen's theory, children with autism are strong 'systemizers' and faces are hard to systemize. In contrast, children with autism have a preference for predictable systems. The Transporters therefore focuses on mechanical vehicles that only travel along tracks, because they are highly predictable systems. Grafted onto these animated vehicles are human faces. In this way, social skills teaching takes place in an autism friendly format.\n\nA study published in the \"Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders\" found that after watching the DVD for 15 minutes a day for four weeks most children with ASC (autistic spectrum condition) caught up with typically developing children in their ability to recognise emotions on four different tasks.\n\n\"The Transporters\" DVD consists of 15 five-minute episodes, each featuring a key emotion. There are also 30 interactive quizzes and an accompanying booklet to reinforce learning. In 2007, the series was nominated for a BAFTA award. \n\nThe series features eight animated toy vehicles. Each has an actual human face so that viewers learn to recognise real rather than cartoon expressions. All the expressions were verified by an independent panel before they were included in the series. \n\nThere are two versions of the DVD, with different accents and vocabulary. The North American version is voiced by Kerry Shale and the British English version is voiced by Stephen Fry. \n\n\"The Transporters\" was originally commissioned by Culture Online, which was part of the UK government’s Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15858242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15858242", "title": "Things the Grandchildren Should Know", "text": "Things the Grandchildren Should Know\n\nThings the Grandchildren Should Know is an autobiography by Mark Oliver Everett, the front man of the independent rock band Eels. Everett spent a year writing the book between the release of the retrospectives \"\" and \"\" and the composition of 2009's \"Hombre Lobo.\"\n\nThe book shares its title with the closing track from the Eels' 2005 album \"Blinking Lights and Other Revelations.\" In that song Everett takes on the persona of an elderly grandfather sharing the wisdom he has learned about life shortly before his death. The parallels between the song and the book are loose, as Everett is much younger than his song persona. He remarks in the final chapter the irony of the title given that he has no children, let alone grandchildren. The German edition's title “Glückstage in der Hölle” translates to \"Lucky days in hell\", resembling the name of the Eels' song \"Your Lucky Day in Hell.\"\n\nUnusually for a modern autobiography, neither inside the book nor the cover (first edition) includes photos of the author. Likewise, the cover refers to Everett's full name, rather the better-known moniker E. The front and back cover avoid referring to his status as the front man of the Eels. Readings of portions of the text occurred during live sets during the 2008 Eels tour. Eels guitarist The Chet would later read the audiobook edition.\n\n\"Things the Grandchildren Should Know\" received generally positive reviews from critics from the United States—such as Joel Stein of \"Time\"—as well as British press—including \"The Guardian\" and \"The Independent.\" Antonia Quirke, writing for \"The Times\" claims that Everett \"[P]icks the right stories to tell. A rare skill in the writers of memoirs,\" and sums up the book as \"a subtle, touching thing.\" Pete Townshend's cover blurb calls it \"[O]ne of the best books ever written by a contemporary artist.\" Everett's hometown press considered it \"intellectual, wry and unflinching as it conveys complex emotions with simple, graceful language.\" and \"a heartbreaking story of staggering genius.\" The book also received reviews from music publications, such as \"Spin,\" who considered the author \"a clear-eyed and emotionally affecting writer\" and \"Q,\" who gave it four out of five stars.\n\nAfter the initial British pressing, the book was released in the United States by Thomas Dunne Books and St. Martin's Press on October 14, 2008 (). An audio edition of this book was released on cassette tape, CD-ROM, and Compact Disc by Blackstone Audio on November 30, 2008. It was also made available on the iTunes Store. Editions would go on to be published in Belgium, Denmark, Cyprus, France, Germany, Iceland, India, The Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Italy.\n\n"}

Tibetans out of necessity, had long ago adopted the practice of \"celestial burial\" (also Sky burial) because of Tibet's harsh terrain in most of the year and deficit of wood for cremation. This form of Sky burial, still practiced, begins with a ritual dissection of the deceased, and then followed by the feeding of the parts to Vultures on the hill tops. Both the location of the ritual dissection and the place of feeding is understood as the charnel ground. Over time, anatomical knowledge found its way into Ayurveda and to an Iesser extent into China. As result, Tibet has become a home of the Buddhist medical centers Chogppori and Menchikhang (or Menhang), between the twelfth to sixteenth century A.D., where monks came to study even from foreign countries.\n\nEmily Fisher, a trustee at The American Museum of Natural History, donated modern copies of a series of seventy-nine Tibetan Buddhist tangkas (religious paintings) that were originally commissioned in 1687 by the fifth Dalai Lama's regent, Sangye Gyamtso (1653-1705). He had the paintings done to elucidate his commentary on the \"Four Tantras\" (Tib. \"Gyushi\") - eighth-century Tantric Buddhist texts that form the foundation of Tibetan medicine and cover physiology, pathology, diagnosis, and cure. With such depictions, the Tantric Buddhist system of healing could, according to Sangye Gyamtso, be \"perceived by everybody, from the scholar to the child, as dearly as one would see a myrobalan (the foremost healing plant in the Tibetan tradition) held in the palm of one's hand.\"\n\nThe original set of these thangkas, which were kept in Lhasa, were destroyed by the Chinese military in 1959, but these recent copies, based on three surviving sets, were painted over the course of seven years by Nepalese atelier Romio Shrestha, who followed religious and artistic conventions in copying the seventeenth-century originals. Shrestha's paintings on cloth, which are filled with astonishing renditions of a variety of physical conditions and illnesses, have been digitally photographed and incorporated into the Museum of Natural History, Division of Anthropology's image database.\n\n"}
