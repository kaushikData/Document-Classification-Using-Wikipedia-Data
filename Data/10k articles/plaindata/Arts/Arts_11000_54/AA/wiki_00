Its programs give volunteers from all walks of life the opportunity to be involved in preservation in a variety of hands-on ways.\n\nAdventures in Preservation (AiP) is a non-profit organization revolving around “Heritage Travel with Purpose”. AiP connects people and preservation through hands-on programs that safeguard cultural heritage and foster community sustainability. AiP travelers have the opportunity to travel, experience their destination, and learn hands-on skills from experts while assisting communities in a meaningful way.\n\nAiP organizes a series of hands-on building conservation workshops and volunteer vacations. Working in locations around the world, participants support community-based preservation projects, such as restoring houses to create affordable housing. The workshops are meaningful opportunities to give back while learning about preservation in general, as well as specific building conservation techniques.\n\nEach workshop is led by a technical expert, who teaches and guides volunteers as they work. Participation is open to all, from teens to active retirees. Since its founding in 2001, Adventures in Preservation has worked in a half-dozen countries, including Albania, Slovenia, Mexico, Italy, Ghana, and the United States. Many other projects are in development. Requests for assistance come directly from people involved at the grass-roots level, and projects are put onto a wait list.\n\nNumerous examples have shown that AiP’s volunteer efforts are a major catalyst for conservation. AiP volunteers have played a key role in restoration projects at the Francis Mill in Waynesville, North Carolina; the Weisel Bridge, Quakertown, Pennsylvania; Manor House in Oplotnica, Slovenia; the gardens of the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum, The Bronx, New York; and adobe residences in Mesilla, New Mexico.\n\nThey have also been involved in restoration efforts at the Jean (Jacob) Hasbrouck House, New Paltz, New York; the Monastery of , , Vittorio Veneto, Italy; a shotgun house in Cairo, Illinois; the Chief’s House in Ablekuma, Ghana; and missions in Chihuahua, Mexico. AiP also organized crews of volunteers in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, to help clean up in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nAiP volunteers restore more than buildings. They restore people's lives, their communities, and their pride in their heritage. The workshops also contribute variously to heritage tourism, economic development, and job training initiatives.\n\nThe organization and its volunteers have received awards for their efforts at Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum and their emergency stabilization work at the James Brown House and Farm Ooltehwah, Tennessee.\n\nview current projects at http://adventuresinpreservation.org/upcoming-adventures/\n\nAiP adventures have always provided you a great educational experience, with hands-on training and excursions designed to highlight the essence of each country’s culture. AiP offers six to eight workshops each year. As with most volunteer travel programs, there is a fee for participating. This fee covers lodging, most meals, insurance, instructions, and a contribution towards the cost of conservation work and building materials. Current workshop offerings are listed on their website.\n\n\"Jammers\" is a special term for the people who travel with AiP to explore and help restore the world's cultural heritage, because they are so much more than volunteers or participants. To make a long story short, \"jammers\" comes from an early misunderstanding that Adventures in Preservation worked with jam and jelly, as in strawberry and other fruit preserves. An interesting possibility, but not so. It represents the way a group of musicians, or other groups, come together to jam and create something new and wonderful.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "734590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=734590", "title": "Alfred Jewel", "text": "Alfred Jewel\n\nThe Alfred Jewel is a piece of Anglo-Saxon goldsmithing work made of enamel and quartz enclosed in gold. It was discovered in 1693, in North Petherton, Somerset, England and is now one of the most popular exhibits at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It has been dated to the late 9th century, in the reign of Alfred the Great and is inscribed \"AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN\", meaning 'Alfred ordered me made'. The jewel was once attached to a rod, probably of wood, at its base. After decades of scholarly discussion, it is now \"generally accepted\" that the jewel's function was to be the handle for a pointer stick for following words when reading a book. It is an exceptional and unusual example of Anglo-Saxon jewellery.\n\nIt seems to have been one of the precious 'æstels' or staffs that Alfred is recorded as having sent to each bishopric along with a copy of his translation of Pope Gregory the Great's book \"Pastoral Care\", saying in his preface to the book:\n\nAnd I will send a copy to every bishop's see in my kingdom, and in each book there is an aestel of 50 mancusses and I command, in God's name, that no man take the staff from the book, nor the book from the church.\n\nThe mancus was a term used in early medieval Europe to denote either a gold coin, with a weight of gold of 4.25 grams (2.73 dwt; equivalent to the Islamic dinar, and thus lighter than the Byzantine solidus), or a unit of account of thirty silver pence. This made it worth about a month's wages for a skilled worker, such as a craftsman or a soldier.\n\nNo other context is given in the preface, but in the context of books, the Old English word 'æstel' can mean a \"guide\", \"index\", and also a \"handle\"; so, it is concluded that it meant a small pointer. Other jewelled objects with a similar form have survived, all with empty sockets, such as a 9th-century example in gold and glass in the British Museum, found in Bowleaze Cove in Dorset (see below), and the \"yad\" or \"Torah pointer\" remains in use in Jewish practice. David M. Wilson sounded a note of caution as to the connection with Alfred, noting that \"in a period when royal titles meant something, there is no royal title in the inscription\". However the commissioning by Alfred and the function as a pointer handle are taken as firmly established by Leslie Webster in her survey \"Anglo-Saxon Art\" of 2012, as well as by the Ashmolean. Other functions suggested have been as an ornament for a crown, or as a pendant, though this would display the figure upside down.\n\nThe Alfred Jewel is about long and is made of filigreed gold, enclosing a highly polished tear-shaped piece of clear quartz 'rock crystal', beneath which is set a cloisonné enamel plaque, with an image of a man, perhaps Christ, with ecclesiastical symbols. The figure \"closely resembles the figure of Sight in the Fuller Brooch, but it is most commonly thought to represent Christ as Wisdom or Christ in Majesty\", according to Wilson, although Webster considers a personification of \"Sight\" a likely identification, also comparing it to the Fuller Brooch. Around the sides of the crystal there is a rim at the top that holds the rock crystal in place, above an openwork inscription: \"AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN\", meaning 'Alfred ordered me made'.\n\nAn animal head at the base has as its snout a hollow socket, like those found in the other examples, showing that it was intended to hold a thin rod or stick. The back is a flat gold plate engraved with an acanthus-like plant motif, or Tree of Life according to Webster. Like the back of other examples, it is \"suitable for sliding smoothly across the surface of a page\". The use of relatively large cells of enamel to create a figurative image is an innovation in Anglo-Saxon art, following Byzantine or Carolingian examples, as is the use of rock crystal as a \"see-through\" cover. The rock crystal piece may be recycled from a Roman object.\n\nThe jewel was discovered in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton in the English county of Somerset, on land owned by Sir Thomas Wroth (\"circa\" 1675–1721). North Petherton is about away from Athelney, where King Alfred founded a monastery. A description of the Alfred Jewel was first published in 1698, in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. It was bequeathed to Oxford University by Colonel Nathaniel Palmer (c. 1661-1718) and today is in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. There is a replica of the jewel in the Church of St Mary, North Petherton. Another replica is on display in the Blake Museum, Bridgwater. In February 2015 the jewel returned to Somerset for the first time in 297 years when it was displayed for a month in the Museum of Somerset, Taunton Castle.\n\nSince the discovery of the Alfred Jewel, six similar objects have been found. All are smaller and less elaborate, but are traceable to the same period and have a socket like that on the Alfred Jewel, suggesting that they were made for the same purpose.\n\n\"The Minster Lovell Jewel\" – the most similar to the Alfred Jewel, consisting of a round gold disk that contains an enamel plaque of a floral design. It was found in Minster Lovell in Oxfordshire and is kept at the Ashmolean Museum.\n\n\"The Warminster Jewel\" – consists of filigreed gold strips containing a white glass stone. A small blue glass stone is held in the middle of the jewel where the gold strips meet. This jewel was discovered in Warminster in Wiltshire and is held in the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum.\n\n\"The Bowleaze Jewel\" – made of patterned gold with a blue glass stone in the middle. It was found at Bowleaze Cove near Weymouth, Dorset and is now in the British Museum.\n\n\"The Yorkshire Aestel\" - resembles a golden animal's head with blue glass eyes, one of which is missing. It was found in Aughton, Yorkshire, by Tim Pearson and was sold as \"lot 312\" in Bonhams Antiquities auction, Wednesday 15 October 2008 for ₤10,800. This is the only privately owned aestel.\n\n\"The Borg Aestel\" – decorated with a pattern of spirals of gold wire. It was found in the ruins of a Viking Era Chieftain Hall at Borg in the Lofoten Islands in Norway, and is now in the Lofotr Viking Museum. Alfred is known to have been visited by a powerful trader called Ottar, who was native to the Lofoten Islands, so it is possible that Alfred gave him the jewel as a gift. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, it was Viking loot, like most Anglo-Saxon finds in Scandinavia.\n\n\"The Bidford Bobble\" – the smallest of the jewels. Its round head is made of patterned gold with blue and red enamel pieces. It was found in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire and now belongs to the Warwickshire Museum Service.\n\nThe seven jewels were exhibited together for the first time in Winchester Discovery Centre between February and May 2008, as the centrepiece of an exhibition of relics of Alfred the Great.\n\nThe Early English Text Society, a text publication society founded in 1864 to publish Anglo-Saxon and medieval English texts, uses a modified representation of the Jewel as its emblem.\n\nA replica of the Jewel is given as a birthday present in chapter six of Nancy Mitford's comic novel, \"The Pursuit of Love\" (1945).\n\nIn Susan Cooper's \"The Dark is Rising\" (1973), one of the six Signs of the Light, the Sign of Fire, is based on the Jewel. It also is made with gold and bears the inscription \"LIHT MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN\", or \"The Light ordered that I be made\".\n\nThe Jewel is referred to in Roy Harper's 19 minute song, \"One Of Those Days In England (Parts 2–10)\" from the album \"Bullinamingvase\" (1977).\n\nThe Inspector Morse episode \"The Wolvercote Tongue\" (1987) centres on the theft of a fictional Saxon artefact based on the Jewel.\n\nA near identical aestel (with the Christ-like figure wearing a red tunic instead of a green one) appeared in BBC Four's \"Detectorists\" in 2015, first appearing in series two, and playing a more pivotal role in the following Christmas Special.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2271599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2271599", "title": "Alice Terry", "text": "Alice Terry\n\nAlice Frances Taeffe (July 24, 1900 – December 22, 1987), known professionally as Alice Terry, was an American film actress and director. She began her career during the silent film era, appearing in thirty-nine films between 1916 and 1933. While Terry's trademark look was her blonde hair, she was actually a brunette, and put on her first blonde wig in \"Hearts Are Trumps\" (1920) to look different from Francelia Billington, the other actress in the film. Terry played several different characters in the 1916 anti-war film \"Civilization\", co-directed by Thomas H. Ince and Reginald Barker. Alice wore the blonde wig again in her most acclaimed role as \"Marguerite\" in film \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" (1921), and kept the wig for any future roles. In 1925 her husband Rex Ingram co-directed \"\", filming parts of it in Italy. The two decided to move to the French Riviera, where they set up a small studio in Nice and made several films on location in North Africa, Spain, and Italy for MGM and others. In 1933, Terry made her last film appearance in \"Baroud\", which she also co-directed with husband.\n\nBorn Alice Frances Taaffe in Vincennes, Indiana, she made her film debut in 1916 in \"Not My Sister\", opposite Bessie Barriscale and William Desmond Taylor.\n\nTerry started in films as an extra during her mid-teens. For two years she worked in cutting rooms at Famous-Players-Lasky. This work would help her later on when she worked with her husband.\n\nAlice Terry was married to Rex Ingram, a prominent director. One of her biggest problems in her career was being the leading lady in movies directed by her husband. Her roles in films directed by her husband left her passive and unmemorable. Rex Ingram also hired male stars that further outshone her in movies such as \"The Conquering Power\" (1921), \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1922) and others. One fan magazine writer described Alice as \"pliant clay\" or easily manipulated on screen.\n\nIn 1924 and 1925 the marriage between Terry and Ingram was in jeopardy, and in that time period she worked under other directors. During this time period Alice worked on five movies, but her roles particularly in \"Any Woman\" (1925) and \"Sackcloth and Scarlet\" (1925), both by Paramount Pictures, proved that Alice was a legitimate star away from her husband. When they got back together, Terry took on a more behind-the-scenes role.\n\nAlice's work at Famous-Players-Lasky helped her in ways that were not commonly known to the public. Ingram would often get too moody to work while directing movies so Terry would take over. She was a competent film editor and learned how to direct from a master. When Ingram went to produce his last film, and only talkie, \"Baroud\" (1933), Alice helped so much that she was named co-director and she directed all the scenes Ingram appeared in. Baroud highlighted Alice's ability as an all around filmmaker but she never took that further.\n\nTerry worked with Ramón Novarro, a popular a film star from Mexico who drew in audiences as a \"Latin lover\", and became known as a sex symbol after the death of Rudolph Valentino. Many have said that Novarro outdid Terry in many films such as \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1922), \"The Arab\" (1924) and others; but this didn't hinder their friendship.\n\nIn 1921, she married director Rex Ingram during production of \"The Prisoner of Zenda\" (1922), which he directed and in which she appeared as Princess Flavia. The couple sneaked away over one weekend, were married in Pasadena, and returned to work promptly the following Monday.\n\nIn 1923 Terry and Ingram decided to move to the French Riviera. They formed a small studio in Nice and made several films on location in North Africa, Spain, and Italy for MGM and others.\n\nDuring the making of \"The Arab\" (1924) in Tunisia, they met a street child named Kada-Abd-el-Kader, whom they adopted upon learning that he was an orphan. Allegedly, el-Kader misrepresented his age to make himself seem younger to his adoptive parents.\n\nAlice Terry was known for being open minded and acted as a cover for Ramón Novarro's sexuality. In the 1930s she went with Novarro, Barry Norton, and other homosexual actors to Hollywood nightspots to act as a cover, which received backlash in the magazine \"The Hollywood Reporter\".\n\nWhen Ingram decided to return to Los Angeles he asked Terry to find a home by a river. One night when Terry was drinking with friends she instructed the cab to pull over so she could throw up. When Terry was done, she looked up and saw a property in Studio City on the Los Angeles River and decided that this was the place where her new home with Rex would be.\n\nOnce Terry and Ingram moved back to the United States they started having problems with their adopted son, Kada-Abd-el-Kader. He \"began associating with fast women and fast cars throughout the San Fernando Valley.\" Terry and Ingram sent him back to Morocco \"to finish school.\" Kada-Abd-el-Kader never went back to school, but he later became a tourist guide in Morocco and Algiers. El-Kader would always tell tourists that he was the adopted son of Rex Ingram and Alice Terry.\n\nTerry and Ingram retired in the 1930s and took up painting. When Ingram died in 1950, Terry invited four of his mistresses to his funeral. When Alice was asked how she could invite four of his mistresses to the post-funeral party said: \"Who cares, I'm the only one that can call herself Mrs. Rex Ingram.\"\n\nAfter Ingram's death Terry's sister Edna moved into the property on Kelsey Street and controlled Alice's life. Alice had a lover named Gerald Fielding who wanted to move in with Alice but Edna forbade it. It is speculated that Edna was jealous of Alice, Edna started as an extra as movies just like her sister, but then married a financial advisor and she stopped acting altogether.\n\nTerry was still active in the 1970s. She loved hosting Sunday afternoon parties and going out to dinner in extravagant, floor length mink coats. She was proud of her appearance and wanted to make sure all other women were envious.\n\nAlzheimer's put a stop to Terry's parties and fun and she eventually died in a Burbank, California hospital on December 22, 1987. Her grave is located in the Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Alice Terry has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6628 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n"}
{"id": "38519954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38519954", "title": "Art in Sierra Leone", "text": "Art in Sierra Leone\n\nArt in Sierra Leone has a long and significant tradition of carving and ceremonial works like masks and cloth for initiation and protection. Although art styles are oftentimes ascribed to a single ethnic group (often the Mende), the styles and processes are spread throughout the country and many artists move between the different ethnic groups in the country.\n\nArt is often practiced by organized societies, whether the traditional Sande and Poro societies or the more recent \"odelay\" societies of Freetown, and express a range of spiritual and political meanings. Carving using wood, ivory, and stone has been prominent for many centuries and retains importance today. In addition, since the 1930s, Freetown has had a number of \"lanterns\" competitions where different groups construct large, decorative floats.\n\nThe Sande (female) and Poro (male) ceremonial societies have a long history of artistic construction in many different ethnic groups of Sierra Leone. Although most often affiliated with the Mende, these societies exist widely in the ethnic groups of Sierra Leone including in the Temne, the Kono, the Vai, and Bullom languages communities.\n\nThe Sande and Poro societies, which are primarily tasked with the initiation ceremonies for women and men to become a part of the community, produce an important range of artwork associated with the ceremony. One of the most prominent artistic forms associated with these societies are the helmet masks (called \"sowei\" in Mende and \"anawu\" in Temne) involved in the initiation rituals.\n\nSierra Leone did not develop a significant artistic tradition of patriotic imagery during the struggle for independence and after. However, after the 1992 Sierra Leonean coup d'état, youth groups (\"odelay societies\") formed and began engaging in high-profile art with patriotic themes. Prominent figures depicted were Bai Bureh or Sengbe Pieh in the lanterns and masks by the odelay societies in Freetown. In addition to historical heroes, the art often depicts National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) leaders and symbols (such as Valentine Strasser and Solomon Musa).\n\nIn general, there are clear regional differences in the wood carving techniques of the forest communities (the Mende, Vai, and Bullom) with smooth edges and intricate details. The savannah style (the Temne Limba, and Loko communities), in contrast, is defined by abstract styles with straight lines and bold contrasts.\n\nTwin figures are prominent in Temne cultural practice and the wood carvings play a key role in the ceremonial life of the community. These figures of no more than a foot tall are created with a twin child passes away, and are used initially as a play partner for the living twin and as a ceremonial site for the mother.\n\nThe twin figures are carved into a number of other ceremonial related wood, including staffs for religious initiation and healing. Associated with these figures is the construction of small-scale houses for the twin (called \"ka-bangka\" in Temne) which are spread throughout the area. This use of twin figures is associated with wider spiritual powers that twins are claimed to possess in Temne beliefs.\n\nIvory carvings have been produced by many of the ethnic groups in the current area of Sierra Leone and were a primary export to Portuguese traders when they first began the trade networks with the coastal communities. It was not until the 1950s that the stylistic connections between the ivory pieces and the large stone carvings which were discussed significantly by European sources earlier in that century.\n\nThe \"nomoli\" or \"pomdo\" stone carvings of unclear origin have been discovered buried around southern Sierra Leone. The figures were first described by Europeans in 1852 by missionary George Thompson who discovered a group of five of them on the site of a destroyed village. The human figures, carved out of soapstone, are found throughout a large area that was controlled primarily by the Temne until the Mende entered in the 1600s. When asked about the statues by early explorers, the people in the region expressed the belief that they were the work of spiritual beings and that no one in the communities knew how to make such a figure.\n\nThe Mende believe the stones are the representations of the people who lived in the region before they came to the area and the Temne people have a ceremony around the stones where they treat them as former chiefs and kings of the region. African art curator Frederick Lamp believes that the stone carvings are a Temne tradition which was lost when the Mende invaded and displaced the communities which had existed there before that.\n\nCloth arts are often used in many of the different groups in Sierra Leone to provide special types of protection. The cloth is provided with specific designs for spiritual protection for the wearer.\n\nA prominent modern artistic expression involves the design and floating of \"lanterns\" down the river in Freetown, the capital of the country. From 1961 until 1991, the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) held competitions where various different civil groups would design large floats, often with lights inside or outside, in celebration of Ramadan. The lanterns are constructed out of wood, bamboo, wire, paper, rice and other materials and represent landmarks, animals, or supernatural beings.\n\nThe lantern festival began small in the 1930s when the businessman Daddy Maggay witnessed a Catholic lantern festival in the Gambia. The small processions slowly grew, largely as a result of the reputation for good cooking by Maggay's wife (whose specialty was corn and couscous), and eventually became run by the YMMA.\n\nAs the competition grew, violence occasionally broke out and the event grew larger and larger. The events and lanterns often have political themes related to the issues in Sierra Leone at the time and are affiliated with various movements. The regular holding of the lantern competition was ended in 1991 by the civil war, but irregular competitions still are held.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18932581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18932581", "title": "Auteur", "text": "Auteur\n\nAn auteur (; , 'author') is an artist, such as a film director, who applies a highly centralized and subjective control to many aspects of a collaborative creative work; in other words, a person equivalent to an author of a novel or a play. The term is commonly referenced to filmmakers or directors with a recognizable style or thematic preoccupation.\n\nAuteurism originated in the French film criticism of the late 1940s as a value system that derives from the film criticism approach of André Bazin and Alexandre Astruc—dubbed auteur theory by the American critic Andrew Sarris. The concept was invented to distinguish French New Wave filmmakers from studio-system directors that were part of the Hollywood establishment, and has since been applied to producers of popular music as well as to video-game creators.\n\nEven before the auteur theory was clearly defined, the director was considered to be the most important among the people working on a film. Early German film theorist Walter Julius Bloem credited this to film being an art for the masses, and the masses being accustomed to regard someone who gives the final product (in this case, the director) as an artist, and those who contribute before (i.e. screenwriters) as apprentices. Likewise, James Agee, one of the most famous film critics of the 1940s, said that \"The best films are personal ones, made by forceful directors.\"\n\nAround the same time, the French film critics André Bazin and Roger Leenhardt became advocates for the theory that it is the director that brings the film to life and uses the film to express their thoughts and feelings about the subject matter as well as a worldview as an auteur. They emphasised that an auteur can use lighting, camerawork, staging and editing to add to their vision.\n\nThe French magazine \"Cahiers du cinéma\" was founded in 1951 and quickly became a focal point for discussion on the role of directors in cinema. In François Truffaut's 1954 essay \"Une certaine tendance du cinéma français\" (\"A certain tendency in French cinema\"), he criticized the prevailing \"Cinema of Quality\" trend in French cinema, saying that filmmakers were being unadventurous by adapting literary classics into unimaginative films. Truffaut said that these films treated the director as only a \"metteur en scene\", a \"stager\" who simply adds the performers and pictures to an already completed script. Truffaut coined the phrase \"La politique des auteurs\" (\"The policy of the authors\") to describe his view, in which he expressed a clear preference for directors who operated with autonomy, vision and a signature style. These discussions were part of the beginning of the French New Wave in cinema.\n\nFrom 1960, with his first self-directed film \"The Bellboy\", Jerry Lewis was one of the earliest Hollywood studio-system actor-turned-directors to be critiqued as an auteur. His attention to both the business and creative sides of production: writing, directing, lighting, editing and art direction coincided with the rise of the auteur theory. He earned consistent praise by French critics in both \"Cahiers du Cinéma\" and \"Positif\". His singular \"mis-en-scene\", and skill behind the camera, was aligned with Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Satyajit Ray. Jean-Luc Godard said, “Jerry Lewis...is the only one in Hollywood doing something different, the only one who isn’t falling in with the established categories, the norms, the principles. ...Lewis is the only one today who’s making courageous films. He’s been able to do it because of his personal genius”.\n\nAndrew Sarris coined the phrase \"auteur theory\" to translate \"la politique des auteurs\" and is credited for popularizing it in the United States and English-speaking media. He first used the phrase in his 1962 essay \"Notes on the Auteur Theory\" in the journal \"Film Culture\". He began applying its methods to Hollywood films, and expanded his thoughts in his book \"The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968\" (1968). The impact of Sarris' work was that critical and public attention on each film focused less on its stars and more on the overall product.\n\nIn the 1960s and the 1970s, the filmmaking industry was revitalized by a new generation of directors. Known as the New Hollywood era, these directors were given increased control over their projects. Studios showed an increase willingness to let directors take risks. The phase came to end in the 1980s, when high-profile financial failures like \"Heaven's Gate\" prompted studios to reassert control.\n\nThe auteur theory had detractors from the beginning. Pauline Kael was an early opponent and she debated it with Andrew Sarris in the pages of \"The New Yorker\" and various film magazines. Kael opposed privileging the director and instead argued that a film should be seen a collaborative process. In her 1971 essay \"Raising Kane\" (1971), on Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\", she points out how the film made extensive use of the distinctive talents of co-writer Herman J. Mankiewicz and cinematographer Gregg Toland.\n\nRichard Corliss and David Kipen have argued that writing is more important to a film's success than the directing. In his 2006 book, Kipen coined the term Schreiber theory to refer to the theory that the screenwriter is the principal author of a film.\n\nFilm historian Georges Sadoul pointed out that the main author of a film is not necessarily the director, but can be the main actor, screenwriter, producer, or even the author of the original story (in case of literary adaptations). Also, he argued that the film can only be seen as a work of collective and not as a work of a single person. Film historian Aljean Harmetz, referring to the creative input of producers and studio executives in classical Hollywood, argues that the auteur theory \"collapses against the reality of the studio system\".\n\nSome criticize the auteur theory, and the practice of praising auteurs, for being male-dominated. Writing for \"IndieWire\" in 2013, Maria Giese noted that pantheons of auteur directors rarely included a single woman. Some point to the broader lack of women directors; the under-representation of women in film has been called the celluloid ceiling. In 2016, just 7% of all directors for the top 250 grossing movies were women. Others point to the lack of women in film schools, which has since changed. Now, Professor Martha Lauzen of San Diego State University says that women are represented in film schools.\n\nThere are references in law, where a directed film is treated as a work of art and the auteur, as the creator of the film, is the original copyright holder. Under European Union law, the film director is considered the author or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.\n\nThe references of auteur theory are occasionally applied to musicians, musical performers and music producers. From the 1960s, Phil Spector is considered the first auteur among producers of popular music. Author Matthew Bannister named him the first \"star\" producer. Journalist Richard Williams wrote: \"Spector created a new concept: the producer as overall director of the creative process, from beginning to end. He took control of everything, he picked the artists, wrote or chose the material, supervised the arrangements, told the singers how to phrase, masterminded all phases of the recording process with the most painful attention to detail, and released the result on his own label.\".\n\nAnother early pop music auteur was the Beach Boys' multi-tasking leader Brian Wilson, who himself was mentored by Spector. Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. Wilson became the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument, thus making the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control. Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on his influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds. \"The Atlantic\"s Jason Guriel wrote that Wilson \"paved the way for auteurs like Kanye West ... anticipat[ing] the rise of the producer ...

Some of his major works were featured on the Canadian $20 banknote of the Canadian Journey series (2004–2012).\n\nWilliam Ronald Reid Jr., called Bill, was born in Victoria, British Columbia; his father was American William Ronald Reid Sr., of Scottish-German descent and his mother, Sophie Gladstone Reid, was from the Kaadaas gaah Kiiguwaay, Raven/Wolf Clan of T'anuu, more commonly known as the Haida, one of the First Nations of the Pacific coast.\n\nReid developed a keen interest in Haida art while working as a radio announcer in Toronto for CBC Radio, where he also studied jewelry making at the Ryerson Institute of Technology. His maternal grandfather first taught Reid about Haida art, and through him, Bill inherited his tools from his great-great-uncle Charles Edenshaw, a renowned artist who died the year Reid was born.\n\nIn 1951, Reid returned to Vancouver, where he eventually established a studio on Granville Island. He became greatly interested in the works of Edenshaw, working to understand the symbolism of his work, much of which had been lost along with many Haida traditions. During this time Reid also worked on salvaging artifacts, including many intricately carved totem poles, which were then moldering in abandoned village sites. He assisted in the partial reconstruction of a Haida village in the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology.\n\nAt the age of 29, Reid married a woman named Mabel. They had one child together and later adopted a second.\n\nWorking in the traditional forms and modern media (usually gold, silver and argillite), Reid began by making jewelry. He gradually explored larger sculptures in bronze, red cedar and Nootka Cypress (yellow cedar), usually portraying figures, animals, and scenes from folklore. He intended to express his ancestors' visual traditions into a contemporary form.\n\nReid's most popular works are three large bronze sculptures. Two depict a canoe filled with human and animal figures: one black, \"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii\", is at the Canadian Embassy, Washington, D.C., in the United States; and one green, \"The Jade Canoe\", is at Vancouver International Airport, in British Columbia. The third sculpture, \"Chief of the Undersea World\", depicts a breaching orca and is installed at the Vancouver Aquarium. Plaster casts of these sculptures are held by the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Canada.\nReid received many honours in his life, including honorary degrees from the University of British Columbia, the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria, the University of Western Ontario, York University, and Trent University. He received the National Aboriginal Achievement Award, the Indspire Awards, for Lifetime Achievement in 1994, and was made a member of the Order of British Columbia and an Officer of France's Order of Arts and Letters. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.\n\nOn 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued 'The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986-1991, Bill Reid' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on the sculpture \"The Spirit of Haida Gwaii\" (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.\n\nTwo of his sculptures, \"Raven and the First Men\" and \"Spirit of Haida Gwaii\", are prominently featured on the $20 note in the Bank of Canada's new \"Canadian Journey\" (2004) issue, paired with a quotation from author Gabrielle Roy.\n\nReid participated in the blockades of logging roads which helped save the rain forests of Gwaii Haanas (South Moresby). He stopped work on the sculpture in Washington during this period to protest the destruction of the forests of Haida Gwaii, by the time Bill Reid was alive the archipelago was called the Queen Charlotte Islands. In 1981, he married Martine de Widerspach-Thor (Mormanne), a French anthropologist.\n\nHaving dedicated the later part of his life to the creation of new works and these tasks of curation, Reid died on 13 March 1998, of Parkinson's disease, in Vancouver. In July 1998 friends and relatives paddled Lootaas, a large cedar canoe carved by Reid for Expo 86, on a two-day journey along the Pacific coast to bring his ashes to Tanu Island in Haida Gwaii, the site of his mother's village of New Clew.\n\n\n"}

Archaeologist Shmuel Yeivin was the first to publish about it, and described it as a church due to the apse located in the east of the building. Since no pillars were found, he proposed that the church was without a roof. But in 1985 archaeologist Ronny Reich concluded that the site was the central part of a villa, rather than a church.\n\nIn 2004, the Israel Antiquities Authority removed the 70 cm thick dirt layer covering the mosaic, restored and strengthened it, and prepared it for visitors. The site was opened to the public in October 2005. Entrance to the site is free, and it is possible to walk on the mosaic.\n\nThe mosaic floor belongs to a Byzantine palace that was built in the end of the 6th century or beginning of the 7th century, and which lay outside the walls of ancient Caesarea. The floor covered the central courtyard of the palace, which was led to by a portico on the west side. Surrounding it was a colonnade, rooms, and additional courtyards with mosaic floors. The built area of the palace was about 1500 square meters, and the entire settlement covered about 3 dunams. It belonged to a wealthy Christian family, but no indications of its identity have been found. The building had an additional story which also had mosaic floors, parts of which collapsed when the palace was destroyed by fire, apparently during the Arab conquest in 640. The wooden beams of the second floor were burned, and parts of its mosaic were found on the floor of the first story.\nThe mosaic takes up an area of 16 by 14.5 meters. It includes a frame decorated with fruit trees bearing large and beautiful fruit. Between the trees are large mammals in states of movement. The mammals include lions, leopards, bears, ibex, dogs, elephants, gazelle, oxen, wild boar, horse, and goat.\n\nThe center of the mosaic (surrounded by the frame) consists of 120 round medallions populated by large colorful birds, which give the mosaic its name. The medallions form 12 rows, with different kinds of birds in each row - peacocks, storks, pelicans, herons, pheasants, grey-headed swamphen, duck, flamingo, guineafowl, ostrich, rock partridge - all of them facing to the left. The sequence of birds is such that the same species is repeated along a diagonal in the medallion array.\n\nUnder the mosaic is a plastered cistern, to which drained rainwater from the entire complex. In the northwest corner of the site was a reservoir which received its water from a well. The complex was too high to receive water from Caesarea's aqueduct, so it needed an independent water supply.\n\nAnother, unique, finding at the site was a table cover in the shape of the letter D, tiled with squares and triangles. The table was made with the \"glass-gold\" method - two layers of glass with a gold layer between it, and figures of crosses and flowers in the gold layer. When the palace was burned, the table overturned and was burned, while the cover was preserved on the floor. This cover was removed from the site for preservation.\n\n\n"}

It was rebuilt in 1802 according to the designs of the architect Thomas de Thomon and renamed the Bolshoi, but burned down in 1811. The building was restored in 1818, and modified between 1826 and 1836 by Alberto Cavos to accommodate more modern machinery.\n\nUntil 1886, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was principal theatre for both the Imperial Ballet and the Imperial Russian Opera. It was there that the first Russian operas — Glinka's \"A Life for the Tsar\" and \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" — were premiered. Although the theatre would include many of the great Russian operas in its repertory, many of the works of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov received their world premieres on the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Many of the great 19th century ballets of Marius Petipa and Arthur Saint-Léon were given for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre.\n\nIn 1886 the building was declared unsafe and, at the behest of the theatre director Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the ballet and opera performances moved to the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, where they have remained ever since. The Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was then torn down to make place for the Saint Petersburg Conservatory.

It was first launched in 2011 and indexes over 60,000 editorially selected books, starting from 2005. Books in the index are electronic and print scholarly texts that contain articles based on original research and/or reviews of such literature.\n\nThe index covers series and non-series books as long as they include full footnotes and the index has two separate editions, a Science edition and a Social Sciences & Humanities edition. The Science edition covers physics and chemistry, engineering, computing and technology, clinical medicine, life sciences, and agriculture and biology. Currently both series only contain books that date back to 2005.\n\nIn their 2014 book \"Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact\", Blaise Cronin and Cassidy R. Sugimoto noted that \"for impact assessment of book-based fields, bibliometricians need a database with large numbers of books\" and that while the Book Citation Index did meet this need, Google Books also fulfilled this purpose and was not only free, but was (at the time) more comprehensive for bibliometric analyses. A 2013 article in the \"Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology\" remarked on the index's opportunities and limitations. It stated that the \"most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index.\" They also stated that the Book Citation Index was \"a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "627070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=627070", "title": "Book signing", "text": "Book signing\n\nBook signing is the affixing of a signature to the title page or flyleaf of a book by its author. Book signings are events, usually at a bookstore or library, where an author sits and signs books for a period.\n\nBook signing is popular because an author's signature increases the value of books for collectors. The author may add a short message to the reader, called a dedication, to each book, which may be personalized with the recipient's name upon request. A simple author's signature without a dedication is typically more valuable to collectors (exceptions include inscriptions to persons of note, e.g., from Hemingway to Fitzgerald, or to persons of significance in the author's life).\n\nSometimes an author will sign additional copies for future sale. An additional advantage to authors for doing this is that once a book has been signed, it cannot be returned to the publisher for a refund.\n\nMany authors today spend a great deal of time signing their books, and sign many thousands of copies. For example, John Green signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of his 2012 novel \"The Fault in Our Stars\".\n\nThe growing popularity of ebooks and ereading devices has inspired the development of software - such as Authorgraph (formerly known as Kindlegraph and renamed to reflect its expansion to include all ereading platforms) and Autography (for iOS devices) - that allows authors to digitally personalize ebooks, by including autographs, dedications, and photographs, and to provide such personalization remotely as well as at in-person book signings. Such software benefits authors, \"who are not obliged to go on long distance promotional tours in order to autograph e-books for their fans\", as well as those readers who are unwilling or unable to brave crowds and longs lines at onsite book signings. Before such applications were introduced, efforts to bridge the digital divide for those who read ebooks included having authors sign the backs of their fan's ereading devices or sign ebooks via direct stylus input (e.g., on a Sony Reader Touch or Palm eReader).\n\nBook signings provide more than a just a chance to obtain signatures. Authors and bookstores are benefited by the fact that many copies of the book being promoted are sold at these events. Signings also increase public goodwill and allow authors to connect with their fans. For fans, signings provide a chance to see and meet a favorite author and ask them questions.\n\nThe development of social media platforms allows modern day authors to conduct virtual book signings. For example, The GoodEReader and Autography jointly hosted an ebook signing with author HP Mallory, during which Mallory greeted fans via Spreecast, a social connectivity platform that allows users to have up to four guests on video chat at one time, to conduct Q&A sessions with even more participants, and to maintain a channel on the site, thereby recording and storing the Spreecast and assigning the recordings a URL for sharing at other outlets. \n\nMany authors use the book signing platform LiveSigning to host large-scale, streaming video book signings with their fans. Donald Trump hosted a book signing on this platform during his presidential campaign in December 2015. Book signings on LiveSigning typically consist of the author signing books, answering questions from fans, and making phone calls to some fans. After the event, the signed books are mailed to everyone who purchased a signed copy.\n\n\n"}

The screenplay was written by John Briley based on a pair of books by journalist Donald Woods. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist Steve Biko and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. Denzel Washington stars as Biko, while actor Kevin Kline portrays Woods. \"Cry Freedom\" delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.\n\nThe film was primarily shot on location in Zimbabwe and in Kenya due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.\n\nA joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by Universal Pictures and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures cinematically, and by MCA Home Video for home media. \"Cry Freedom\" premiered in cinemas nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 cinemas nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.\n\nSouth African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.\n\nFollowing a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in East London, South Africa, liberal journalist Donald Woods (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially \"banned\" by the South African government and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at King William's Town. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.\n\nAfter speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by South African security forces. Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalize the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with Jimmy Kruger (John Thaw), the South African Minister of Justice in his house in Pretoria in an attempt to prevent further abuse by the security force. Kruger first expresses discontent over the actions of security force, however Woods is later harassed by security forces at his home. The security men that harass Woods insinuate that their orders to visit Woods came directly from Kruger.\n\nLater, Biko decides to travel to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1 020 km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.\n\nWoods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of Lesotho, disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy (Penelope Wilton) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist Bruce Haigh (John Hargreaves), the British High Commission in Maseru, and the Government of Lesotho, they are flown under United Nations passports and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via Botswana to London, where they were granted political asylum.\n\nThe film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.\n\nThe premise of \"Cry Freedom\" is based on the true story of Steve Biko, the charismatic South African Black Consciousness Movement leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of Apartheid; and Donald Woods, the liberal white editor of the \"Daily Dispatch\" newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the Black People's Convention working on social upliftment projects around Durban. The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime. Biko's political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973. The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko's death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance. As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organizations, especially those closely associated with Biko. The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa. After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life, Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government. Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: \"Biko\", exposing police complicity in his death. That book, along with Woods's autobiography \"Asking For Trouble\", both being published in the UK, became the basis for the film.\n\nPrincipal filming took place primarily in the Republic of Zimbabwe because of the tense political situation in South Africa at the time of shooting. Other filming locations included Kenya, as well as film studios in Shepperton and Middlesex, England. The film includes a dramatized depiction of the Soweto uprising which occurred on 16 June 1976. Indiscriminate firing by police killed and injured hundreds of African schoolchildren during a protest march.\n\nThe original motion picture soundtrack for \"Cry Freedom\" was released by MCA Records on 25 October 1990. It features songs composed by veteran musicians George Fenton, Jonas Gwangwa and Thuli Dumakude. At Biko's funeral they sing the hymn Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Jonathan Bates edited the film's music.\n\nA live version of Peter Gabriel's 1980 song \"Biko\" was released to promote the film; although the song was not on the film soundtrack, footage was used in its video.\n\nAmong mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mostly positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 82% of 22 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.5 out of 10.\nRita Kempley, writing in \"The Washington Post\", said actor Washington gave a \"zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25.\" Also writing for \"The Washington Post\", Desson Howe thought the film \"could have reached further\" and felt the story centring on Woods's character was \"its major flaw\". He saw director Attenborough's aims as \"more academic and political than dramatic\". Overall, he expressed his disappointment by exclaiming, \"In a country busier than Chile with oppression, violence and subjugation, the story of Woods' slow awakening is certainly not the most exciting, or revealing.\" Roger Ebert in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" offered a mixed review calling it a \"sincere and valuable movie\" while also exclaiming, \"Interesting things were happening, the performances were good and it is always absorbing to see how other people live.\" But on a negative front, he noted how the film \"promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border. It's sort of a liberal yuppie version of that Disney movie where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom.\"\n\nJanet Maslin writing in \"The New York Times\" saw the film as \"bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others\" but pointed out that \"it isn't dull. Its frankly grandiose style is transporting in its way, as is the story itself, even in this watered-down form.\" She also complimented the African scenery, noting that \"\"Cry Freedom\" can also be admired for Ronnie Taylor's picturesque cinematography\". The \"Variety Staff\", felt Washington did \"a remarkable job of transforming himself into the articulate and mesmerizing black nationalist leader, whose refusal to keep silent led to his death in police custody and a subsequent coverup.\" On Kline's performance, they noticed how his \"low-key screen presence served him well in his portrayal of the strong-willed but even-tempered journalist.\" Film critic Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film a \"thumbs up\" review calling it \"fresh\" and a \"solid adventure\" while commenting \"its images do remain in the mind ... I admire this film very much.\" He thought both Washington's and Kline's portrayals were \"effective\" and \"quite good\". Similarly, Michael Price writing in the \"Fort Worth Press\" viewed \"Cry Freedom\" as often \"harrowing and naturalistic but ultimately self-important in its indictment of police-state politics.\"\nMark Salisbury of \"TimeOut\" boasted on the film's merits by declaring the lead acting to be \"excellent\" and the crowd scenes \"astonishing\", while equally observing how the climax was \"truly nerve-wracking\". He called it \"an implacable work of authority and compassion, \"Cry Freedom\" is political cinema at its best.\" James Sanford however, writing for the \"Kalamazoo Gazette\", did not appreciate the film's enduring qualities, calling it \"a Hollywood whitewashing of a potentially explosive story.\" Rating the film with \"3 Stars\", critic Leonard Maltin wrote that the film was a \"Sweeping and compassionate film\". He did however note that the film \"loses momentum as it spends too much time on Kline and his family's escape from South Africa\". But in positive followup, he pointed out that it \"cannily injects flashbacks of Biko to steer it back on course.\"\n\nIn 2013, the movie was one of several discussed by David Sirota in \"Salon.com\" in an article concerning white savior narratives in film.\n\nThe film was nominated and won several awards in 1987–88. Among awards won were from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the Berlin International Film Festival and the Political Film Society.\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film premiered in cinemas on 6 November 1987 in limited release throughout the U.S. During its opening weekend, the film opened in a distant 19th place and grossed $318,723 in business showing at 27 cinemas. The film \"Fatal Attraction\" opened in first place with $7,089,680 screening at 1,351 theaters. The film's revenue dropped by 10.6% in its second week of release, earning $284,853.

The painting does not bear a date but was first exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 1884. The Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, purchased it at a Christie's auction in London in 1976.\n\nAccording to a story published in 1897, Leighton spent six months searching throughout Europe for a model to match his imagined ideal of Iphigenia for his intended portrayal of Cymon and Iphigenia. He saw a young actress, Dorothy Dene, in a theatre in London and his search was over. Possessing a classical Greek style beauty, Dene had golden wavy hair with excellent skin texture and colouration on her face; she was taller than average with graceful arms and legs together with an “exquisitely moulded bust”. She appeared in several other of Leighton's works, including \"Greek Girls Playing Ball\" and \"Summer Moon\". Lena, one of Dene's younger sisters, appears in the painting as the child slave. Other paintings by Leighton featuring Dene are: \"The Bath of Psyche\", \"Clytie\", \"Perseus and Andromeda\", \"Solitude\", \"The Return of Persephone\" and \"The Vestal.\"\n\nThe painting took eight months to complete; a succession of line drawings were done first as Leighton tried to capture the position he wanted for the central figure, around 56 – including several of foliage and other elements of the piece – of these are known to exist. The English art critic Peter Nahum describes the painting as \"central among Leighton's later works\", an opinion Mrs Russell Barrington considered was shared by Leighton. Leighton's painting \"Idyll\" dating from a few years earlier has some similar elements but lacks the complexities of \"Cymon and Iphigenia\". The two compositions each highlight the difference between the fair complexion of a female with a dark skinned male; both feature a full-length woman reclining beneath a tree and similar lighting techniques are used.\n\nThe overall dimensions of the undated oil on canvas painting are . Based on Giovanni Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\", the painting depicts a scene from the first tale of day five; Iphigenia is sleeping in the woods and Cymon, a young nobleman, stands gazing at her beauty which fills him with inspiration. After seeing her, Cymon changes from a badly mannered lout to an ideal polymath. Nahum felt it \"emphasised the transforming power of beauty.\" Boccaccio set the story in the springtime; Leighton preferred the ambience of a more autumnal feel. The artist was very precise about the mood he wanted to reflect by describing the specific setting of the time of day as \"the most mysteriously beautiful in the whole twenty-four hours\". He wished to capture the overall impression of drowsiness just before drifting to sleep especially on long hot days as night begins to fall. The painting is set when there is the \"merest lip of the moon\" showing on the horizon above the sea and the atmosphere is \"haunted still with the flush of the after-glow from the sun already hidden in the west.\"\n\nIphigenia lies with her face and torso pivoted slightly to her right, her arms are raised above her head. Her body is loosely covered by material and the depiction of her figure is described as \"masterly\" by a writer using the name of \"Mentezuma\" in his report included in the Art Amateur about the Royal Academy exhibition of 1884. Other sleeping figures are Iphigenia's servants and a dog. According to Greenhough White, Leighton had the ability to show \"the perfection of repose\" and the \"self-abandonment and unconsciousness of sleep\" and it was utilised to full effect in this painting and his earlier work entitled \"Summer Moon\".\n\nThe first time the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts was at the summer exhibition in 1884. After viewing it at the exhibition an unnamed French critic reported that he could not recall \"a more original effect of light and colour, used in the broad, true, and ideal treatment of lovely forms.\" The following year, in 1885, it was exhibited in Berlin. It was again displayed at the Royal Academy in the winter of 1897, a memorial exhibition of his works as Leighton had died on 25 January 1896. It was included in the Guildhall Art Gallery's annual loan exhibition in 1897. Sir W.E. Cuthbert Quilter owned the painting until it was sold among his art collection in July 1909. It changed ownership a number of times in the UK, with owners including Leopold Albu, and Pamela Cavendish (mother of Hugh Cavendish, Baron Cavendish of Furness), before being purchased at auction by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Australia, in February 1976. It returned to at the Royal Academy from mid-February to April 1996, in an exhibition devoted to the work of Leighton. The Art Gallery of New South Wales also purchased a colour study of the painting, measuring , in 1986.\n\n"}

The title is taken from films which bookend the era: \"Easy Rider\" (1969) and \"Raging Bull\" (1980). The book follows Hollywood on the brink of the Vietnam War, when a group of young Hollywood film directors known as the \"movie brats\" are making their names. It begins in the 1960s and ends in the 1980s.\n\nThe book was the basis of a 2003 documentary film of the same name directed by Kenneth Bowser and narrated by actor William H. Macy. It was screened out of competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 100% based on reviews from 8 critics.\n\n\nSeveral of the film-makers profiled in the book have criticized Biskind. Robert Altman denounced both the book and Biskind's methods, saying \"It was hate mail. We were all lured into talking to this guy because people thought he was a straight guy but he was filling a commission from the publisher for a hatchet job. He's the worst kind of human being I know.\" Francis Ford Coppola was similarly critical, alleging that Biskind interviewed only people with negative opinions of him.\n\nCritic Roger Ebert noted that Steven Spielberg said of \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\" that: \"Every single word in that book about me is either erroneous or a lie.\" Ebert himself notes that: \"Biskind has a way of massaging his stories to suit his agenda.\" When asked about Biskind's portrayal of him as \"a womanizer, a tyrant and a bully,\" William Friedkin said: \"I've actually never read the book, but I've talked to some of my friends who are portrayed in it, and we all share the opinion that it is partial truth, partial myth and partial out-and-out lies by mostly rejected girlfriends and wives.\" Peter Bogdanovich was equally furious, saying: \"I spent seven hours with that guy over a period of days, and he got it all wrong\".\n\n\"A Decade Under the Influence\"-a 2003 documentary also about New Hollywood\n\n"}

{"id": "41812810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41812810", "title": "Feminist aesthetics", "text": "Feminist aesthetics\n\nFeminist aesthetics first emerged in the 1970's and refers not to a particular aesthetic or style but to perspectives that question assumptions in art and aesthetics concerning sex-role stereotypes, or gender. In particular, feminists argue that despite seeming neutral or inclusive, the way people think about art and aesthetics is influenced by sex roles. Feminist aesthetics is a tool for analyzing how art is understood using gendered issues. A person's gender identity affects the ways in which they perceive art and aesthetics because of their subject position and the fact that perception is influenced by power. The ways in which people see art is also influenced by social values such as class and race. One's subject position in life changes the way art is perceived because of people's different knowledge's about life and experiences. In the way that feminist history unsettles traditional history, feminist aesthetics challenge philosophies of beauty, the arts and sensory experience. \n\nStarting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define \"taste\". Kant and Hume both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because fine art was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division. Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: beauty and sublimity; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine). Feminist aesthetics analyzes why \"feminine\" traits are subservient compared to \"masculine\" traits in art and aesthetics.\n\nAnother explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for \"whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of jouissance\". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein). Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. \n\nThe idea of the \"creative genius\" is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses. This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius. Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist. However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses. In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism – which Christine Battersby calls \"a kind of masculine heroism\" – and overlooks the work of joint collaborations.\n\nAesthetic theories that make a distinction between \"arts\" and \"crafts\" can be viewed as anti-feminist. Here, art usually refers to \"fine art\" and crafts refers to everything else which has \"everyday aesthetics\". Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses. Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as \"art\". Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of \"art\", because their domain is marginalized.\n\n"}

In the papal states, it was known as Gonfalonier of the Church or Papal Gonfalonier. Other central and northern Italian communes, from Spoleto to the County of Savoy, elected or appointed \"gonfalonieri.\" The Bentivoglio family of Bologna aspired to this office during the sixteenth century.

A Native American from the Maliseet tribe, she was later adopted at the age of four by Les Berry, an engineer, and his wife Judith, an adoption lawyer. As a result of the adoption, Julie Berry gained an older brother, Chris, but she also was separated from her biological sister, whom she would not see again for another two decades.\n\nBerry grew up in Gorham, Maine, where she attended Gorham High School.

In December 2003, she was accepted into the Peace Corps, although she ultimately did not join.\n\nIn 2004, Berry was one of 18 people selected for the cast of \"\", the series' ninth season overall. Upon meeting the series' host, Jeff Probst, for the first time during a casting interview, Probst knew at first sight that he definitely wanted her on the show. At the start of the game, she was initially placed in the Yasur tribe, an all-female group. On Day 11, she was one of only two women switched to the previously all-male Lopevi tribe (the other being Twila Tanner). After the merge, Berry and Tanner pondered between sticking with their Lopevi alliance or returning to their old all-female Yasur alliance. Ultimately, they chose to re-align with the women. At the Final Five reward challenge, Berry won the reward: a picnic lunch. She chose Chris Daugherty to enjoy the reward with her, hoping that he would join her in eliminating Tanner. In the end, Daugherty ended up siding with Tanner, and Berry was voted out, giving her a fifth-place finish overall and making her the fifth member of the jury.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Berry wept openly before proceeding to ask Daugherty if their friendship had been real or not. She followed that up with a make-or-break question to determine which finalist would get her vote. Ultimately, she voted for Daugherty over Tanner for the title of Sole Survivor.\n\nFollowing production of \"Survivor: Vanuatu\", the show's host, Jeff Probst, sent Berry an e-mail just to say hello. Shortly thereafter, the two were dating. Their relationship was not made public until the live airing of the \"Vanuatu\" reunion show when, as the closing credits rolled, Probst began holding Berry’s hand in front of the studio and viewing audience. In an interview with \"People\" magazine, Probst expressed his gratitude for Berry, saying, \"I finally met someone who could teach me about love...Julie's given me a sense of balance I've never had. It's like fingers interlacing.\"\n\nThe two were together for three years.

{"id": "177309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177309", "title": "Lighting designer", "text": "Lighting designer\n\nA theatre lighting designer (or LD) works with the director, choreographer, set designer, costume designer, and sound designer to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text, while keeping in mind issues of visibility, safety, and cost. The LD also works closely with the stage manager or show control programming, if show control systems are used in that production. Outside stage lighting, the job of a Lighting Designer can be much more diverse and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installation and on massive celebration spectaculars, for example the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nThe role of the lighting designer varies greatly within professional and amateur theater. For a Broadway show, a touring production and most regional and small productions the LD is usually an outside freelance specialist hired early in the production process. Smaller theatre companies may have a resident lighting designer responsible for most of the company's productions or rely on a variety of freelance or even volunteer help to light their productions. At the Off-Broadway or Off-Off-Broadway level, the LD will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work (hanging instruments, programming the light board, etc.) that would be the work of the lighting crew in a larger theater.\n\nThe LD will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between scenes - such changes are often done just with lighting to avoid too many blackouts in one scene - and will have meetings (called design or production meetings) with the director, designers, stage manager, and production manager to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details. The LD will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the actors are being directed to use the stage area ('blocking') during different scenes, and will receive updates from the stage manager on any changes that occur. The LD will also make sure that he or she has an accurate plan of the theatre's lighting positions and a list of their equipment, as well as an accurate copy of the set design, especially the ground plan and section. The LD must take into account the show's mood and the director's vision in creating a lighting design.\n\nBecause lighting design is much more abstract than costume or scenic design, it is sometimes difficult for the lighting designer to accurately convey his or her ideas to the rest of the production team. To help the LD communicate the ethereal aspects of lighting, he or she may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of actual lighting effects to help communicate ideas about how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various members of the production team. Examples of typical paperwork include cue sheets, lightplots, instrument schedules, shop orders and focus charts. Cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called, so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue. Cue sheets are of the most value to stage management.\n\nThe light plot is a scale drawing that communicates the location of lighting fixtures and lighting positions so a team of electricians can independently install the lighting system. Next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any color gel, gobo, or other accessory that needs to go with it, and its channel number. Often, paperwork listing all of this information is also generated by using a program such as Lightwright. The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but simple lists to assist the Master Electrician during load-in, focus and technical rehearsals. Professional LDs generally use special computer-aided design packages to create accurate and easily readable drafted plots that can be swiftly updated as necessary. The LD will discuss the plot with the show's production manager and the theatre's master electrician or technical director to make sure there are no unforeseen problems during load-in.\n\nThe lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production's independently hired \"Production Electrician\" who will interface with the theatre's Master Electrician, for directing the theatre's electrics crew in the realization of his or her designs during the technical rehearsals. After the Electricians have hung, circuited and patched the lighting units, the LD will direct the focusing (pointing, shaping and sizing of the light beams) and gelling (coloring) of each unit.\n\nAfter focus has occurred the LD usually sits at a temporary desk (tech table) in the theater (typically on the Center Line in the middle of the house) where he or she has a good view of the stage and work with the lighting board operator/programmer, who will either be seated alongside him or her at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room. At the tech table, the LD will generally use a Magic Sheet, which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage, so he or she can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments. The LD may also have a copy of the light plot and channel hookup, a remote lighting console, a computer monitor connected to the light board (so they can see what the board op is doing), and a headset, though in smaller theatres this is less common. There may be a period of time allowed for pre-lighting or \"pre-cueing\", a practice that is often done with people known as Light Walkers who stand in for performers so the LD can see what the light looks like on bodies. At an arranged time, the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order, with occasional stops to correct sound, lighting, entrances etc.; known as a \"cue-to-cue\" or tech rehearsal. The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a \"tech\" rehearsal is the production's technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause (\"hold\") frequently. Nevertheless, any errors of focusing or changes to the lighting plan are corrected only when the performers are not onstage. These changes take place during 'work' or 'note' calls. The LD only attends these notes calls if units are hung or rehung and require additional focusing. The LD or Assistant Lighting Director (also known as the ALD, see below for description) will be in charge if in attendance. If the only work to be done is maintenance (i.e. changing a lamp or burnt out gel) then the Production or Master Electrician will be in charge and will direct the Electrics crew.\n\nAfter the tech process, the performance may (or may not, depending on time constraints) go into Dress rehearsal without a ticketed audience and/or Previews with a ticketed audience. During this time, if the cueing is finished, the LD will sit in the audience and take notes on what works and what needs changing. At this point, the Stage Manager will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow. Generally, the LD will stay on headset, and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems, or will be in the control booth with the board operator when a monitor is not available. Often, changes will take place during notes call, but if serious problems occur the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved then.\n\nOnce the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call. If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally the lighting designer will not make further changes.\n\nChanges should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LD's approval. There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened. Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period (if there was a preview period) was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed (this is particularly common in dance productions). If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD. If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color (some gel, especially saturated gel, loses its richness and can fade or 'burn out' over time). The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time. The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to each's satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue. The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the Master Electrician.\n\nIt is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do. Many times, the lighting crew of a small theatre will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer. Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights. The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the light board during rehearsals and performances. In some cases, the light board and sound board are operated by the same person, depending on the complexity of the show. The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.\n\nAs previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written. With the advancement in computer processing and visualization software, lighting designers are now able to create computer generated images (CGI) that represent their ideas. The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible (which helps in creating complete renderings). This creates a 3D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated. Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 3D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc. The designer can then take renderings or \"snapshots\" of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team.\n\nIn addition to computer visualization, either full scale or small scale mock ups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer's ideas. Fiber optic systems such as LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set. For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4\" scale, the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures. These 'mini lights' can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions. Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos. The most sophisticated fiber optic systems are controllable through computer software or a DMX controlled Light board. This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real time lighting effects as they will look during the show.\n\nIf the production is large or especially complex, the Lighting Designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design.\n\nThe Associate Lighting Designer will help assist the Lighting Designer in creating and executing the lighting design. While the duties that an LD may expect the Associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Ass't LD will do the following:\n\nThe Assistant Lighting Designer assists the Lighting Designer and the Associate Lighting Designer. Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associate's assistant. There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production. The ALD will usually:\n\nDuring focus, the LD is up on stage directing members of the Electrics crew on where and how to focus each individual lighting unit. This can be a time consuming and frustrating process. Focus can run much smoother if the Associate LD and the Assistant LD are keeping good track of which lights have been focused, what's coming up next and directing the electrics crew so that there is minimal down time between focusing each light. They should also direct the LD to which units are next and even what their purpose is and a rough focus.\n\n\n\n"}

Made from a nitrocellulose compound developed at the Edison laboratory—though occasionally employing Bakelite in its stead and always employing an inner layer of plaster—these cylinder records were introduced for public sale in October 1912. The first release in the main, Popular series was number 1501, and the last, 5719, issued in October 1929 just as the Edison Records concern closed up shop. The Edison company also maintained separate issue number ranges for foreign, classical and special series that are not included here. The issue numbers are not necessarily continuous as some titles were not released, or otherwise skipped. Nevertheless, the Blue Amberol format was the longest-lived cylinder record series employed by the Edison Company. These were designed to be played on an Amberola, a type of Edison machine specially designed for celluloid records that did not play older wax cylinders. Blue Amberols are more commonly seen today than earlier Edison 2-minute brown or black wax and 4-minute black wax Amberol records.\n\nThe following very incomplete list of Blue Amberol Records is ranked by issue number, title, writer(s), performer(s) and date. Dates are certainly not chronological for either recording or issue; the issue of certain titles could be delayed or never deployed, and some Blue Amberol releases are merely reissues of earlier records that had appeared in other formats before the Blue Amberol existed. From about July 1914, Edison's Diamond Discs were used to master Blue Amberols and releases of the same titles appear in both series, though with totally different release numbers. Some of the very last Blue Amberols were dubbed from electrical recordings, though the Amberola was never manufactured with an electrical pickup; in later years, some enthusiasts have refitted Amberola players with electrical pickups and there is evidence that even at the end of the 1920s there were kits one could order to make the conversion.\n\nBlue Amberol Records\n\n"}

{"id": "3725072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3725072", "title": "Newberry Opera House", "text": "Newberry Opera House\n\nThe Newberry Opera House, located in Newberry, South Carolina, is a fully restored historic building that is a live-performance space for popular artists, touring theatre companies, and local organizations. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.\n\nDesigned in the French Gothic style, the first floor of the building was used by the town government for offices, a jail, and the fire company, which had one engine there. The upper floor was designed as a theater and supporting spaces. For years it attracted national touring companies, individual performers and a variety of theatre acts. It later was adapted also for use as a movie theater, but showed its last movie in 1952. It was restored beginning in 1998, in a project that included an addition to enable its use for full theatrical productions.\n\nThe building was designed in the French Gothic style as both a place of entertainment and as a seat of government for the city. The building, completed in 1881 and dedicated in 1882, had a clock tower topped with a garfish weather vane.\n\nThe original design called for the first floor to house the fire engine room, town council chambers, a clerk's office, a police officer, and three jail cells. The second floor contained a hall with 426 seats, 53 by in size. Also on this floor were a ticket office, a \"green room\", a cloakroom, and three dressing rooms. Drop curtains and seven scenes or sets for the stage were available. One scene, a landscape, survived to the late 20th century.\n\nThe Opera House quickly became known as \"the entertainment center of the Midlands\". Touring companies of New York City plays, minstrel and variety shows, famed vocalists and lecturers, magicians and mind readers, novelty acts and boxing exhibitions all were featured there. It was used not only by professional performers, but also by the community for meetings, dances, college commencement exercises, and musicals. Notable artists, such as Edwin Booth, John Barrymore and his family, and Tallulah Bankhead are known to have performed there.\n\nThe first film shown there was \"Birth of a Nation\" (1915), a silent movie, and others followed. The early Edison \"Talkies,\" using a phonograph record for sound, were introduced in the 1920s. Slowly, movies replaced the stage shows. In the 1920s, the Opera House was remodeled as a movie theater.\n\nIn 1952, after the showing of \"The Outlaw\", the Opera House was closed as a movie theater. During the movie era, the original horseshoe-shaped balcony was reduced in size, this restricted seating across the back of the auditorium to blacks only; the state had racial segregation in facilities. The city added an outdoor open stairway which they required blacks to use for entry. Since the mid-1960s, such public facilities have been integrated.\n\nBy 1959, there was talk about tearing the building down, but the hall was still used for community purposes, and the city used the first floor. In 1969, the Newberry Historical Society promoted the preservation of the Opera House, as did several other community groups. In 1970, the building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAfter the City of Newberry vacated the building in the mid 1990s, the Newberry Opera House Foundation was established to assess restoration. Recognizing the lack of performance spaces in the Midlands, it consulted with experts about a proposed project. Since proceeding with a restoration plan, it has managed fundraising and operations of the facility, which it leases from the city.\n\nThe exterior restoration and window replacement was completed in 1994, and the interior renovation began in 1996. It included restoration of the horseshoe-shaped balcony. An additional was added to the original building in order to create a full theatrical production facility: a new loading dock, an elevator, a second stage for rehearsal, and dressing rooms. The total cost of the renovation was approximately $5.5 million. Architects for the renovation and addition were Craig Gaulden Davis of Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nA variety of theatrical touring companies and live-performance artists from Willie Nelson to Michael Bolton, the Newberry Ballet Guild, South Carolina Opera Company and Asheville Lyric Opera have all performed there, keeping the hall busy. It has a maximum capacity of 426. It is also used for performances by Newberry College and other community institutions.\n\nSouth Carolinians Josh Turner, Edwin McCain, Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs, and Chubby Checker have all performed at the Newberry Opera House in recent years. The Charlie Daniels Band, The Tams, Art Garfunkel, Arlo Guthrie, Puddle of Mudd and Saliva (in 2018) have also performed at the Opera House in recent years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2555312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2555312", "title": "Palace of the Shirvanshahs", "text": "Palace of the Shirvanshahs\n\nThe Palace of the Shirvanshahs (, ) is a 15th-century palace built by the Shirvanshahs and described by UNESCO as \"one of the pearls of Azerbaijan's architecture\". It is located in the Inner City of Baku, Azerbaijan and, together with the Maiden Tower, forms an ensemble of historic monuments inscribed under the UNESCO World Heritage List of Historical Monuments. The complex contains the main building of the palace, Divanhane, the burial-vaults, the shah's mosque with a minaret, Seyid Yahya Bakuvi's mausoleum (the so-called \"mausoleum of the dervish\"), south of the palace, a portal in the east, Murad's gate, a reservoir and the remnants of a bath house. Earlier, there was an ancient mosque, next to the mausoleum. There are still ruins of the bath and the lamb, belong to the west of the tomb.\n\nIn the past, the palace was surrounded by a wall with towers and, thus, served as the inner stronghold of the Baku fortress. Despite the fact that at the present time no traces of this wall have survived on the surface, as early as the 1920s, the remains of apparently the foundations of the tower and the part of the wall connected with it could be distinguished in the north-eastern side of the palace.\n\nThere are no inscriptions survived on the palace itself. Therefore, the time of its construction is determined by the dates in the inscriptions on the architectural monuments, which refer to the complex of the palace. Such two inscriptions were completely preserved only on the tomb and minaret of the Shah's mosque. There is a name of the ruler who ordered to establish these buildings in both inscriptions is the – Shirvan Khalil I (years of rule 1417–1462). As time of construction – 839 (1435/36) was marked on the tomb, 845 (1441/42) on the minaret of the Shah's mosque.\n\nThe burial vault, the palace and the mosque are built of the same material, the grating and masonry of the stone are the same.\n\nThe complex used to occupy more place. There were rooms for court servants and services.\n\nThe main buildings of the ensemble were built at different times. Despite this fact, these buildings are linked by unity of scale, by rhythm and proportionality of the basic architectural forms – cubic volumes of buildings, domes, portraits. The builders of the ensemble relied on the traditions of the Shirvan-Absheron architectural school.\n\nIn 1964, the palace complex was declared a museum-preserve and taken under the protection of the state. In 2000, this ensemble, along with the fortified walls of the historic part of the city and the Maiden Tower, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the obverse of the Azerbaijani 10,000 manat banknote of 1994–2006 and of the 10 new manat banknote issued since 2006.\n\nIn the 15th century the Shirvanshah dynasty, under Ibrahim I of Shirvan, transferred his capital from Shemakha to Baku following a devastating earthquake. He committed himself to the construction of the \"palace\". The building is believed to be a memorial complex built around the sacred place of worship (pir) and tomb of Seyyid Yaxya Bakuvi who was a Helwati Sufi saint. The Shirvanshahs were patrons of the Helwati Sufiye order, and Shirvanshah Khalilullah I was buried with his family in the grounds of the palace. Other historians argue that the building was used as the ruler's palace. Both theories suffer from the absence of evidence. It is known that wells inside the grounds of the \"palace\" were considered to have healing qualities until recent times, as was the hill where the palace was built.\n\nAfter the Safavid conquest of Baku in 1501, the Sufi order was expelled. Over centuries the \"palace\" fell into ruin and was known in Baku as Baku Khans palace; this toponym moved into Russian historiography, first cited by Bartold.\n\nUntil 1501, there wasn't any information found about the building of the palace. According to one of the Persian chronicles, in 1501 the troops of shirvanshakh Farrukh-yessar, the son Khalil-ully I, were defeated in Shemakha by the troops of Shah Ismail I from the Safavid dynasty. Farrukh-yessar was killed in the battle of shirvanshah; the troops of Ismail I, having defeated near Shemakha, moved to Baku, besieged it and after several assaults took the city. Then, a tall building of Shirvanshahs was destroyed due to the order of Shah Ismail I. After a while, the city of Baku and its entire district, as well as Shirvan, were governed by the governors who were placed by the Safavids. There is not any detailed information about the people who lived in the palace and in what state it was in the first half of the XVI century.\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century there was a war between the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire. In 1578, the Turks conquered Baku. From the time of the rule of the Ottoman Empire in the palace area, the gate in the palace wall surrounding the palace from the east has been preserved. From the inscription placed on the portal of this gate, it follows that they were built during the reign of the Turkish sultan Murad III (1574–1595 years of rule).\n\nDue to the literary works, there were Turkish pashas living in the palace at that time. The East Gate is a witness of this.\n\nSince the XVII century, the palace was empty, and there were not any government officials. The abbot of the monastery and the representative of the Isfahan mission Capuchin Pater Raphael du Mans in his essay in 1660 described Shirvanshah Palace in Baku fortress and gave information about its desolation and destruction. In 1723, Baku was besieged by the troops of Peter I, and the city was bombed. In this regard, the south-eastern facades of the palace suffered much. The palace was transferred to the Russian military department in the middle of the 19th century.\n\nThe Russian military department made a partial renovation of the palace. At the same time, the significant restructuring was carried out, which adapted the palace facilities to warehouses for military equipment. Repairs carried out by the military department, along with the restoration of the destroyed parts, and led to the destruction of a number of parts required for the restoration of the palace. By adapting the building of the palace to the warehouse, the military department demolished a number of walls separating the rooms in the second and first floors, and there were semi-circular arches supporting the roof instead of them on the second floor.\n\nThe remains of domed, lancet and cross-slabs were destroyed in all the rooms on the second floor; they were replaced by flat beams. And window openings (double-glazed windows) of the second floor were laid out so that only small windows remained. New wide doorways were pierced.\n\nDuring this period, the Orthodox Church in Baku sought the demolition of the palace to build a Baku cathedral in its place. However, this petition was rejected by the tsarist authorities only because the premises of the palace were used for large warehouses.\n\nThere was an entrance made to the second floor of the northern facade of the palace and a huge opening was punched in the wall. This was done for the cart drawn by the horses from the street would enter the second floor of the palace. After making the above-mentioned reorganization, the military department attached a ladder to the eastern facade of the palace, and the entire southern (or lower) courtyard was surrounded by a stone wall with loopholes. This wall was erected from a foundation left from the old walls surrounding the palace. The palace ensemble is now protected by fortress walls erected in the first half of the 19th century.\n\nDuring existence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918–1920), a number of measures were taken to study and fix architectural monuments. Thus, at the end of 1918, the dimensional drawings of the Shirvanshahs Palace were made by the Ishmael Bek Nabi oglu, the architectural engineer. At the beginning of 1920, several cycles of lectures on the fate of the palace were read in the \"Society for the Study of the Muslim East\" by Ismail bek Nabi oglu. The periodical press indicated that the report was illustrated by various photographs and drawings of the palace. After the reports and debates, the presidium of the society was elected, which included chairman Professor Zimin, Comrade chairman I Belyaev, secretary-teacher Seidov and Kazioni Subkhanverdikhanov. The meeting instructed the presidium to organize an excursion to the palace in the near future.\n\nIn 1920, the government of the Azerbaijani SSR began to take measures to protect the monument. Since 1920, the cleaning of the palace from the age-old layers of garbage and partial repairs began, accompanied by archaeological reconnaissance.\n\nIn 1924 the works were continued. After the large repair and restoration works of 1932–1934, conducted by AzCUOP together with the Moscow State Restoration Workshops for projects designed by architect Boris Zasypkin, the building of the former Shirvanshah palace was given to the Azerbaijan History Museum AzFAN. Since the clay floors were fragile, and the building of the palace was intended for the organization of a museum in it, during the repair and restoration work the floors were covered with parquet. Also during the works from the window openings were laid the stones laid in the XIX century, and they were returned to their original appearance. The original layout of the second floor was not restored, due to the fact that the premises were supposed to be a museum: where there are only two rooms, there were originally eight rooms. The plan of the first floor was completely restored.\n\nIn 1937-1938 under the guidance of archaeologist V.N. Leviatov, archaeological excavations were carried out in the palace and a large number of artifacts dating from the 12th-15th centuries were found. And the archaeological excavations conducted by Leviatov in 1945 on the territory of the palace ensemble, deep beneath the foundations of the surviving buildings, revealed the remains of a once densely populated residential quarter. Numerous fragments of ceramic products and coins date it to the VIII-IX centuries.\n\nFor some time, the Azerbaijan People's Museum and the Museum of the History of Religion were located in the palace building. In 1960, the palace was turned into an architectural reserve, which in 1964 was transformed into the State Historical and Architectural Museum-Reserve \"Complex of the Shirvanshahs Palace\".\n\nIn 1992, new restoration works began. The author of the restoration project of the palace complex was Niyazi Rzayev. Restoration began from the throne room. In 2000, at the 24th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, the historical part of the city of Baku, Icheri Sheher, along with the palace, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site from Azerbaijan. These were the first objects included in the list of UNESCO, located on the territory of Azerbaijan. In 2006, the next restoration of the palace was completed.\n\nIn 2017, the Maiden Tower and the Palace of the Shirvanshahs were awarded with the Certificate of Excellence.\n\n\nThe building of the palace did not arise at once. The building of the complex was started in 1411 by Shirvanshah Sheykh Ibrahim I. The two-storey building of the palace numbers about 50 dimensions and outlines of the constructions connected with three narrow winding staircases. The big lancet portal directly leads from the courtyard to the second floor, into a high octahedral lodging covered with a cupola. A small, octagonal vestibule behind it connects it with the rest of the lodgings in the palace.\n\nThe earliest building (approximately the end of the fourteenth century) is the central part (octagonal hall of the second floor). The part adjoining the western facade was added a little later. The western, northern and a small part of the eastern facades form an incomplete rectangle. The rest of the eastern facade and the entire southern facade are formed by two triangular lanterns and a broken line between them, enclosing four right angles.\n\nThere were originally 52 rooms connected by three narrow spiral staircases in the palace building: 27 on the first and 25 on the second floor (currently 16 rooms on the second floor), and the layout of the second floor basically reproduced the plan of the first floor. The central part of the palace (octagonal hall of the second floor, the entrance to which is decorated with a portal) has thicker walls. Arranged in the western facade, the main entrance to the palace is decorated with a high portal. The ladder of the portal leads to a tall octagonal front hall, covered with a dome. It is assumed that this room served for receptions.\n\nThe small octagonal lobby behind it connected the hall to the rest of the rooms. Slit-shaped holes in the faces served as a voice connection with the lower floor, where the office premises were located. The rooms and rooms of the second floor are more ceremonial. Among them, there are the southern and eastern facades with bay windows that reveal the bay view. There are also rooms for the Shah and his family on the second floor.\n\nThe smooth surface of the large stone planes of the palace is shaded by alternating rows of masonry, differing in color, width and texture, as well as the \"shebeke\" aura – stone gratings in small light apertures.\n\nThere were daily-life objects, coins of the XII-XV centuries, copper utensils, weapons and decorations of the XIX century, musical instruments of the XV century found during the archaeological excavations both on the territory of the palace complex and in the territory of the historical center of Icheri-Sheher and Shirvan. There were also female costumes and embroidery of the XIX century, Shemakha carpets of the XIX century and carpet woven in the XVII century in Baku. There is a mock-up of the historic part of the city in the center of the hall. \n\nA small aperture, located on the north side of the palace garden, leads to the closed courtyard Divan-khana, which is framed on three sides by a pointed arcade. In the composition center Divan-khana there is an octagonal rotunda-pavilion. The hall of this rotunda is surrounded by an open arcade of the same warrant. The elliptical cover with a slightly pointed top is protected from the outside by a faceted stone dome. The western facade of the rotunda is decorated with arabesques which are stylized with a portal, the channeled half-cupola of the lancet conch is supported by a system of finely modeled stalactites (mucarnases). Overhead planes are covered with ornament. The portal leads to the canopy connecting the hall with the and service rooms located one above the other.\n\nThere are several versions of the appointment of Divan-khana. It was supposed to serve as a building for legal proceedings, receptions or state council, or perhaps, it was a mausoleum. The most common hypothesis is based on the common name of the monument, according to which it was assumed that it is a court, or a reception room of the palace, or the building of an \"order\". The features of the style and the incompleteness of the part of the decoration work allow one to date Divan-khana to the end of the 15th century, the time of the capture of Baku by the Safavid troops. The features of the plan, the dungeon-crypt and the content of the lapidary inscription above the entrance to the hall (Koran, Sura 10, verses 26 and 27) indicate his memorial appointment.\n\nThe origin of the original architectural structure is also associated with the pre-Islamic funerary tradition. Historian Sara Ashurbeyli believes that even in pre-Islamic times, the occupied Divan-khan territory was a sacred place (it is assumed that the cup-shaped grooves served to collect the sacrificial blood of animals)\n\nIn the old days, a mosque was added to the mausoleum of Seyyid Yahya Bakuvi, which was called the \"old\" mosque. It is known as the \"Kei-Kubad Mosque\". This mosque was built at the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century after the destruction of the older building on which it was built. The mosque was covered with a dome, which was supported by four stone columns that stood inside the mosque. The clutches of the mosque were tied up with the laying of the mausoleum. In 1918, the \"old\" mosque burned down during a fire. The image of this mosque and its brief description was given in the article of Andrei Pavlinov, who visited Baku and saw the mosque in 1888, published in the third issue of the journal \"Materials on the Archeology of the Caucasus\" (Moscow, 1893) Historian Abbasgulu Bakikhanov wrote that Bakuvi taught and prayed in the mosque: \"The cell where he prayed, the school where he worked and his grave are there, in the mosque\". Keygubad Shirvanshah ruled from 1317 to 1343 and was Sheikh Ibrahim's grandfather.\n\nIn the 1920s, when E. A Pakhomov surveyed the mausoleum and ruins of the old mosque, it was discovered that the pedestal on which the base of one of the mosque columns stood, covers a narrow trench made in the ground and plastered into the crypt of the mausoleum. In this trench, there were several stone tombstones. When examining the crypt, it was found that there were scattered bones to twenty human skeletons. The bones were folded without observing any rules. This is due to the fact that at the place where the mausoleum stood and around it, there was once a cemetery. And during the construction of the mosque and digging foundation pits under the foundations, a number of burials were broken. Bones from the broken graves were collected and stacked in the mausoleum, and gravestones – in the trench. These tombstones are not preserved. Currently, on the site where the mosque once stood, there are two columns that once stood inside the mosque, as well as part of the wall with the roof.\n\nIn the southern courtyard, next to the palace, stands a mausoleum, built in the second half of the 15th century, called the mausoleum of the \"dervish\" and known as the burial of the court scholar Khalil Ili Seyid Yahya Bakuvi, who was engaged in medicine, mathematics, and astrology. The mausoleum has an octagonal body, which completes the pyramidal tent. The interior of the mausoleum consists of an underground crypt where the tombstone of Bakuvi is located, and a camera above it. Small octagonal volume of the mausoleum turns into a drum covered with a dome. On the sides of the mausoleum there are three small windows carved into solid slabs of limestone, and, like in the old days, they are through-through stone gratings, consisting of multi-beam stars. The archway in the northern part is connected the mausoleum with an older mosque. According to Abbaskuli aga Bakikhanov, \"the cell where he prayed [Bakuvi], the school and the grave that are under the mosque named after him, still exist today\".\n\nIn the front of the lower courtyard, there is a mosque building with a minaret. In terms of the mosque is rectangular, has a large hall, a small women's chapel and service rooms. The northern portal is facing the Shirvanshahs burial vault. This portal is more solemn than the east, which was intended for the inhabitants of the palace, descending the semi-underground passage. The double-lighted hall is covered with a dome on spherical sails.\n\nMihrab mosque is located at the southern end of the hall. Above the one-woman women's chapel there is also a domed room. It is inferior in size to the dome of the hall and repeats its outlines. Against the backdrop of the prismatic volume, completed by two domes with slightly pointed tunnels, a deeply shaded aperture of the mosque portal is clearly drawn.\n\nAbove the northeast corner of the mosque stands a minaret, ending with a stalactite cornice supporting a balcony that had a stone barrier before. The inscription encircles the minaret below the stalactite cornice. It is executed in the font \"nash\" and contains inscription.\n\nThe inscription says about the construction of the minaret, but not the mosque that was built at an earlier time. This is confirmed by the lack of a decorated rich portal and artistic inscriptions on it.\n\nOn the territory of the southern courtyard of the complex was the so-called Eastern Portal, also known as the \"Gate of Murad\". The construction of this portal completed the formation of the ensemble. Judging by the inscription on the portal niche, the portal was built during the years of occupation of Baku by Ottoman troops at the behest of a noble Bakrada of the Rajab Baba in 994 AH (1585/86) by architect Amir Shah of Vaillankoukh (suburb of Tabriz). Compared with the Divan-khana portals and the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the structure and forms of the portal are somewhat simplified. It has a less rich and elegant decor. The upper part of the portal is decorated with a building inscription in Arabic.\n\nThe inscription has sockets with floral ornaments on both sides. In the lower part of the portal, there is a deep niche formed by a stalactite semi-double. Unlike other portals of the palace, the Eastern portal has a wide lancet entrance opening, similar to the gate. Sarah Ashurbeyli assumes that this structure was the entrance to a building that did not survive, or was not erected.\n\nNear the shah's mosque in the lower courtyard, in the wall separating the lower platform from the upper one, is located the building of the Shirvanshahs burial vault, the so-called \"Turbe\". This building is located directly opposite the entrance, overlapped by a pointed vault. Smooth wall of the facade is lined with Baku limestone with a careful fit of the seams. Above the building, there is a richly decorated portal to the tomb. This portal repeats the compositional reception of the Divan-khan portal, but in comparison with the latter it is somewhat easier to interpret (the stalactite arch consists of only four rows of stalactites, the side walls are smoothly solved, no niches, and only tympanum of the arches, a number of inscriptions in the font \"nash\" – Koranic (Surah XII, verse 92nd) and hadith.\n\nOn the right and left of the portal's lancet aperture in two onion-shaped medallions are inscriptions with the name of the builder-architect of the tomb. In each medallion, the same inscription is repeated twice (in direct and mirror image) and contains the following words: Allah Muhammad Ali (an architect). Judging by the name, the architect was a Shiite. Above the ornamentation of the tympanum of the stalactite arch there is a strip with an inscription of a religious nature. In the tympanas, medallions are also arranged on each side, also with an inscription. The inscription above the entrance to the portal dates the construction of the burial vault 839 (1435/36) and reports that the tomb was built by Shirvanshah Halilullah for his mother and son.\n\nThe portal leads to the canopy, on the right and left side of which are located associated with the opening of small rooms, probably intended for ministers of worship. The canopies lead to the main hall, which is cross-shaped in plan, and its central part is covered with a dome resting on the vaults of the branches of the cross and stone walls through a system of spherical sails. It is interesting that outside the stone dome was once covered with turquoise glaze.\n\nDuring the archaeological excavations in the tomb were found fragments of architectural details of tombstones in the hall, as well as a number of burials of members of the family of Halilullah. So, archaeological works in 1946 under the wooden floor of the tomb, a crypt was found with five burials, covered with stone slabs (one of them contained the remains of a child of 6–7 years old, apparently the son of Halilullah, the other – older women, probably the mother of Halilullah, the skeleton of a man is 18–19 years old). The continuation of the work in the tomb found a number of untouched tombs, the total number of which reached 14. The names of the members of the family of Halilullah can be found on the basis of odes, elegies and chronograms from the sofa of Badr Shirvani: the mother of Halilullah Bike khanum (died 839 AH / 1435/6), his sons Farrukh Yamin (born 839 AH / 1435/6, died in 846 AH / 1442/3 at the age of seven), Sheikh Saleh (born in 847 AH / 1443, died in 849 AH / 1445/6 at the age of 2 years), Mir Bahram (killed ( Shaheed) in the Kaytag steppe at a young age of 20 Muharram in 850 AH / 17 April 1446), Prince Muhammad Ibrahim (born 20 Muharram 836 / 16 September 1432), Farrukh Yasar (born 12 Muharram 845 AH / 2 June 1441).\n\nIn the lower courtyard of the complex, there is a bathhouse, the location of which does not allow us to contour the territory that belonged to the palace. It is assumed, however, that the bathhouse, built in the 15th century, was indeed a palace. The bath was cleared of blockages, and the internal layout of the bath was restored thanks to the conservation of the lower rows of wall masonry.\n\nThe palace bath, like the vast majority of the baths of the East, was buried in the ground, but only the entrance portal and the domes of large halls were visible from the outside, the crowns of which ended with perforated lanterns that served as ventilation. Such a strong depth of the bath was typical for the baths of the entire Absheron peninsula.\n\nThe visitor of the bath from the vestibule-dressing room got into the soap-house, where there was a swimming pool for general ablution. To the soap adjoining large and small rooms, intended for all procedures that required a different temperature. The necessary temperature of the various rooms, depending on their destination, was tried to preserve the internal layout of the bath. In one of the last chambers of the bathhouse, there was a tank with hot water. Under it, there was a firebox, which served to heat all the premises of the bath. The underground, the stables and the walls of the baths were heated by a branched system of heat-conducting channels.\n\nNot far from the bathhouse is located the ovdan – a reservoir, which was one of the largest in the Fortress of the Ovdans. This ovdan supplied drinking water not only to the palace, but also to the entire surrounding area. This assumption is confirmed by the nearby small, built in the XIV century Chin Mosque, which is believed to have served the residents of the nearby area. Ovdan supplied water to the palace bathhouse.\n\nOvdan is a spacious reservoir located deep underground, which was ventilated by means of a special vertical shaft. Such a structure is typical for most of the ovdans surviving till the present day. To descend into the reservoir it was possible by a gentle staircase, which was blocked by a lancet arch. =\n\nWater came into the ovdan from a well-kept underground water pipe-kyhryza. The water intake structures of this water pipe were quite far from the city.\n\nImages of the Shirvanshahs palace can be found on the works of such artists as Grigory Gagarin, Georgy Hohenfelden, in the photographs of Richard Thiele. In 1990, the postage stamp of the USSR, dedicated to the palace, was issued. Later, the image of the palace appeared on the postage stamps of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Also, Shirvanshah's palace was depicted on an Azerbaijani banknote in face value of 10,000 manats. Description of the palace is found in the novel of Kurban Said \"Ali and Nino.\"\n\nThe architecture of the palace several times fell into the footage of Leonid Gaidai's film \"Brilliantovaya ruka\", which was also filmed in the \"old city\" of Baku.\n\n\nJonathan M.

{"id": "13187140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13187140", "title": "Psychic distance", "text": "Psychic distance\n\nPsychic distance is a perceived difference or distance between objects. The concept is used in aesthetics, international business and marketing, and computer science.\n\nPsychic distance is made up of the Greek word \"psychikos – ψυχικός\", an adjective referring to an individual's mind and soul, and \"distance\" which implies differences between two subjects or objects. Some therefore argue that the concept exists in the mind's eye of the individual and it is their subjective perception that uniquely determines \"psychic distance\". As a result it is often viewed as a humanistic reflection of individual acuity and not a collective, organisational or societal perspective. However, in the international business context, psychic distance is frequently measured in terms of national averages or in terms of the national-level differences that influence those perceptions.\n\nIn his book, King refers to his preference to use the term \"aesthetic distance\" rather than psychic distance, as he feels the latter term has misleading connotations in current usage.\n\nIn 1912 Cambridge's Edward Bullough wrote of it in a long paper entitled, \"Psychical Distance as a factor in Art and an Aesthetic Principle\" which appeared in the British Journal of Psychology. In this he set down in a reasonably complete manner the concept as it applied to the arts.\n\nEvidently, he successfully influenced thinkers 50 years later. Donald Sherburne, for example, says, \"Edward Bullough's psychical distance has become \"a classic doctrine of aesthetic thinking.\" And James L. Jarrett writes of Bullough's ideas, \"Perhaps no more influential idea has been introduced into modern aesthetics than that of psychical distance.\"\n\nThe psychical distance construct has been used as an intercultural theme by the arts in the study of creative detachment between East and West. Despite such cameo appearances in other fields, the concept has been essentially \"operationalised\" by business with the marketing function acting as the chief curator.\n\nIn international business (IB) and marketing settings, psychic distance is based on \"perceived\" differences between a home country and a \"foreign\" country regardless of physical time and space factors which differ across diverse cultures. It is a subjective type of distance (\"perceived differences\") unlike the distances forming the CAGE framework, for instance . This makes psychic distance very difficult to measure, and often times fallacious proxies are used to estimate it (e.g., Kogut & Singh (1988) index using Hofstede's (1980) cultural dimensions). More accurate approaches rely on asking decision-makers their perceptions towards different host countries (e.g., Hakanson & Ambos, 2010), or using its antecedents to estimate it (psychic distance stimuli: Dow & Karunaratna, 2006). \n\nThe business origins of the \"psychic distance\" idiom can be traced back to research conducted by Beckerman (1956) and Linnemann (1966). As a fully formed concept Vahlne and Wiedersheim-Paul (1973) as cited by Nordstrom and Vahlne (1992) described psychic distance as \"factors preventing or disturbing the flow of information between potential or actual suppliers and customers.\" These factors are associated with country-based diversities and dissimilarities and can be grouped into four clear areas:\n\n\nAlthough the concept was fully formed by the early 1970s, it was the study of Nordic multinationals by Johanson and Vahlne (1977) which followed on from two earlier studies in 1975 and 1976, that is generally accepted as the concept's real genesis. The studies concluded that a firm's international activities relate directly to psychic distance and that further international expansion progresses into markets with successively greater psychic distance.\n\nIn summary, companies tend to initially export to countries that they understand; then build on their acquired experience to explore opportunities further afield. In other words, firms enter new markets where they are able to identify opportunities with low market uncertainty then enter markets at successively greater psychic distance. As a consequence, contemporary literature on the internationalisation process cites psychic distance as a key variable and determinant for expansion into foreign markets.\n\nThe psychic distance has also on occasion been measured through formative indicators such as strong commercial relations, close political relations, historic ties, geographic ties, social ties, country information stock, level of development. These indicators are deeply analyzed for the international market selection. The measurement of these indicators is best accomplished through an index construction. However, the formative indicators are very context dependent. If they were applied to different industries, countries and entry modes, the indicators would have shifted dramatically.\n\nMore recently, Gairola and Chong incorporated psychic distance to simulate more realistic noise models in spatial games, leading to interesting results, including a manifestation of the psychic distance paradox.\n\n\n"}

It is now displayed along with the French regalia in the Galerie d'Apollon at the Louvre.\n\nThe vase likely dates to the second century . According to Suger, abbot of Saint-Denis, in his \"De administratione\", he found, \"lying idly in a chest for many years, an Egyptian porphyry vase admirably shaped and polished.\" In his own words, he determined to adapt and transfer (\"adaptavimus ... transferre\") it into a liturgical vessel \"in the form of an eagle\" (\"in aquilae formam\"), a symbol of Christ. Suger's Eagle is a typical case of the \"careful preservation of the ancient relic in a setting which leaves it completely intact.\" On the bottom of the eagle is a nielloed \"titulus\": \"This stone deserves to have mounts of gold and gems. / It was marble. Its settings are more precious than marble.\" Inscribed around the base of the neck, above the lip of the vessel, is a dedication to the church of Saint-Denis. The goldwork of the neck demonstrates superb chiselwork.\n\nTwo large engravings from 1706 depict the treasure of Saint-Denis (including the eagle vase) as it was then displayed, in a cabinet. Its popularity as a tourist attraction prevented the treasure's total destruction during the French Revolution.

{"id": "705401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705401", "title": "Tank Man", "text": "Tank Man\n\nTank Man (also known as the Unknown Protester or Unknown Rebel) is the nickname of an unidentified man who stood in front of a column of tanks on June 5, 1989, the morning after the Chinese military had suppressed the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by force. As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and smuggled out to a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time. Inside China, the image and the events leading up were subject to heavy state censorship, and as a result they are being forgotten.\n\nThere is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown. At least one witness has stated that \"Tank Man\" was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest. Shao Jiang, who was a student leader, said: \"I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks.\" Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and recorded on video.\n\nThe incident took place at the north edge of Tiananmen Square, along Chang'an Avenue, on June 5, 1989, two days after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests. The man stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for \"TIME\" magazine, told the \"New York Times,\" \"At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester.\" He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags. As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action. After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse.\n\nHaving successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on. At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man–tank standoff.\n\nVideo footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way. Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for \"Newsweek\", said it was the Chinese government PSB (the police), while Jan Wong, who was there for \"The Globe and Mail\", thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, \"Time\" included the \"Unknown Rebel\" in a feature titled \"\". In November 2016, \"Time\" included Jeff Widener's photograph in \"Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time\".\n\nLittle is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid \"Sunday Express\" named him as Wang Weilin (), a 19-year-old student who was later charged with \"political hooliganism\" and \"attempting to subvert members of the People's Liberation Army.\" However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights. One party member was quoted as saying, \"We can’t find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can’t find him among the dead or among those in prison.\" Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man's identity and current whereabouts.\n\nThere are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, reported that he was executed 14 days later; other sources say he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests. In \"\", Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have \"no idea who he was either\" and that he's still alive somewhere on the mainland. Another theory is that he escaped to Taiwan and remains employed there as an archaeologist in the National Palace Museum. This was first reported by the Yonhap news agency in South Korea.\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), \"I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,\" and then replied in English, \"I think never killed\". The government also argued that the incident evidenced the \"humanity\" of the country's military.\n\nIn a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Jiang Zemin said, \"He was never arrested.\" He then stated, \"I don't know where he is now.\" He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man down.\n\nInternationally, the image of the lone man in front of the tank has come to symbolize the events at Tiananmen Square in 1989 and is widely considered one of the most iconic images of all time.\n\nA PBS interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship. Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China. When undergraduate students at Peking University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were \"genuinely mystified.\" One of the students said that the image was \"artwork.\" It is noted in the documentary \"Frontline: The Tank Man\" that he whispered to the student next to him \"89,\" which led the interviewer to surmise that the student may have concealed his knowledge of the event.\n\nIt has been suggested that the \"Unknown Rebel,\" if still alive, never made himself known as he is unaware of his international recognition due to Chinese media suppression of events relating to government protest.\n\nAt and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment.\nFive photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was not later confiscated by the PSB. On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level.\n\nThe widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both \"Time\" and \"Life\" magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea.\n\nThe most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about half a mile (800 meters) away from the scene. Widener was injured and suffering from the flu. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter. With Widener running out of film, a friend (by the name of Kirk) hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot. Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers. He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but did not win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of all time.\nCharlie Cole, working for \"Newsweek\" and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to \"Newsweek\". He was awarded the 1990 World Press Photo of the Year and the picture was featured in \"Life\" \"100 Photographs That Changed the World\" in 2003.\n\nOn June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter, Terril Jones, revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos.\n\nArthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel, but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen. It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Tsang's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Wah told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A \"foreign\" photographer accompanying him suddenly said, \"I am not gonna die for your country,\" and left. Wah returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event.\n\nIn addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua, CNN cameraman Jonathan Schaer and NBC cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene. ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony.\n\nAfter seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the \"tank man\" incident occurred.\n\nIn Tom Clancy's 2000 novel \"The Bear and the Dragon\", the Chinese authorities apprehend and execute Tank Man, then bill the surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head.\n\nA similar scene is depicted in the music video for \"Club Foot\" (2004) by the English rock band Kasabian.\n\nTank Man is briefly referenced in the 2007 film \"Superbad\".\n\nThe music video for \"Refuse/Resist\" by the thrash/death metal band Sepultura features brief footage of the Tank Man.\n\nA fictionalized version of the fates of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in Lucy Kirkwood's 2013 play \"Chimerica\", which premiered at the Almeida Theatre from May 20, 2013 to July 6, 2013.\n\nOn June 4, 2013, Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are \"today\", \"tonight\", \"June 4\", and \"big yellow duck\". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a photoshopped version of Tank Man, in which rubber ducks replaced the tanks, had been circulating around Twitter—a reference to Florentijn Hofman's \"Rubber Duck\" sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour.\n\nFootage of Tank Man is included in the 2014 film adaptation of Lowis Lowry's \"The Giver\", during a montage intended to give the protagonist strength.\n\nA 2017 novel published by Random House Mondadori, La quimera del Hombre Tanque fictionalizes a second, hypothetical encounter between the two protagonists of the iconic photo of 1989. Aiming at social reconciliation, a group of Chinese leaders tries to broadcast on TV, a quarter of a century after the incident, a peaceful encounter between Tank Man and the tank commander.\n\n\n\n"}

Cárcano proposed the establishment of one to Governor Ambrosio Olmos in 1887. Securing the project's approval and funding from the Córdoba Legislature, Cárcano commissioned a fellow Italian Argentine, architect Francesco Tamburini, for the project's design. Creating an eclectic Italianate theatre, Tamburini's design was juxtaposed with Arturo Nembrini Gonzaga's interior verdigris accents, façade reliefs and quadriga, all nods to the Beaux Arts architecture so in demand in Argentina at the time. The entirety of the theatre's materials, fabrics and machinery was imported for the purpose from Europe.\n\nThe landmark institution was inaugurated on April 26, 1891, as the Rivera Indarte Theatre. Popularly known as the \"Teatro de la Calle Ancha\" (\"Broad Street Theatre\") during the early 20th century (Broad Street was later renamed Vélez Sársfield Avenue), the grand concert hall was designed for a capacity of 1,000 spectators. Its concert hall featured a rising floor to stage level, made available during the many social balls held there since then. Among the first prominent drama theatre directors to stage productions there was María Guerrero, who popularized the theatre of Spain in Argentina after 1897. Subsequent years saw numerous internationally renowned classical performers, as well, notably Enrico Caruso, Titta Ruffo, Tito Schipa and Arthur Rubinstein.\n\nThe theatre additionally houses the Luis de Tejeda and Rafael Grisolía halls, each with capacities of around 100 and mainly reserved for seminars, as well as for the theatre's Youth Orchestra. A museum of the institution's extensive stagecraft collection was organized into the Cristóbal de Aguilar Musical and Theatre Museum in 1970.\n\nThe institution was renamed in honor of General José de San Martín in 1950 by order of President Juan Perón on the occasion of the centennial of the Liberator's death. It was renamed \"Rivera Indarte\" in 1956 (following Perón's overthrow), and regained the San Martín denomination in 1973.\n\n"}

TAS was initially housed at Combat Stress, a charitable organisation for ex-servicemen and women, before being moved with the help of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers to the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire to launch The Abandoned Soldier Project. The sculpture has subsequently been moved to Cardiff Castle, then to Exeter Castle for the War Art Exhibition in June 2011, and was filmed as part of a Channel 5 documentary. From there it was moved to the Rhondda Heritage Park at Trehafod. \n\nIn April 2012, the sculpture was moved back to Cardiff Castle as a permanent 'base'. In the Summer of 2013, the head piece was removed from the base and taken on a tour of Wales. The high points included; The summit of Mount Snowdon and Portmeirion. In May 2014 the sculpture was part of an installation by Themis Jones, installed at the Hay Festival of Literature and Art. In July 2014 he returned to his main 'base' at Cardiff Castle and will stand as a lasting reminder of the trauma of War, until 2018.\n\nThe statue was created in remembrance of soldiers who have suffered the after effects of armed conflict and are not being treated like the heroes they truly are. The sculpture was modelled after Lance Corporal Daniel Twiddy, who had been wounded in 2003 by friendly fire and shrapnel while in Basra. Twiddy had received several wounds from shrapnel, which included wounds to the face from a 'Blue on Blue' incident.\n\nIn 2010 concerns were made over the stability of the sculpture and that the resin material might disintegrate. Concerns were also raised about the sculpture's lack of a permanent display location. There have been attempts at petitioning for a more permanent location as well as fundraising efforts for a bronze version of the statue.\n\nThe sculpture now has a piece of music, commissioned by the TAS Project, written and sung by Bethan Myfanwy Hughes, a civilian trauma nurse and also a member of the Territorial Army.\n\nhttp://www.theabandonedsoldier.com/\n\nwww.facebook.com/pages/The-Abandoned-Soldier-Statue/243347702432383\n"}

M. W. Turner, depicting the fire that broke out at the Houses of Parliament on the evening of 16 October 1834.\n\nAlong with thousands of other spectators, Turner himself witnessed the Burning of Parliament from the south bank of the River Thames, opposite Westminster. He made sketches using both pencil and watercolour in two sketchbooks from different vantage points, including from a rented boat, although it is unclear that the sketches were made instantly, \"en plein air\". The sketchbooks were left by Turner to the National Gallery as part of the Turner Bequest and are now held by the Tate Gallery. Some other sketches in Turner's sketchbooks, previously thought to also show the Burning of Parliament, have been reassessed and may be sketches of the fire that destroyed the Grand Storehouse at the Tower of London on 30 October 1841.\n\nThe paintings were made in late 1834 or early 1835 and both measure by . Turner spent many hours reworking both paintings on the varnishing day immediately before the exhibition opened to the public.\n\nThe first painting, exhibited at the British Institution in February 1835, shows the Houses of Parliament from the upstream side of Westminster Bridge. The buildings on the other side of the river are wreathed in golden flames. The fire is consuming the chamber of the House of Commons in St Stephen's Hall, and illuminating the towers of Westminster Abbey. The fire reflects dull red in the water, with a crowd of spectators in the foreground. To the right of the painting, Westminster Bridge looms like an iceberg, larger than life, but the perspective of the part of the bridge closest to the far bank is strongly distorted where it is lit up by the flames. The painting was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1928 as part of the John Howard McFadden Collection.\n\nThe second painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy's summer exhibition later in 1835. It shows a similar scene from further downstream, closer to Waterloo Bridge, with the flames and smoke blown dramatically over the Thames as spectators on the river bank and in boats look on. This painting was acquired by the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1942 as a bequest from John L. Severance (son of oil magnate Louis Severance).\n\nThe colours and composition of these paintings may have influenced Turner's conception of his 1839 painting \"The Fighting Temeraire\", which also depicts the passing of an old order.\n\n"}

Despite its title, it depicts Moses cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, known as the seventh plague.\n\nIn the foreground, two dead horses and a dead man are piled together, casualties of the earlier plague of pestilence in livestock. To the right, Moses stands with his arms outstretched, cursing the Egyptians with a plague of hail and fire, far away from the engulfed city. In the background, tumultuous clouds swirl above the Egyptian city, which is denoted by the gleaming, white pyramid in the centre of the canvas. Thin, horizontal lines fall from the clouds, showing streaks of hail falling from the sky. The painting is dominated with dark, neutral tones, creating the feeling of gloom.\n\nAlthough the painting would be categorised as a history painting for its display of a biblical scene, the painting comes across as a landscape painting, clearly demonstrating Turner's training in landscapes. The sky and the scenery take precedence over the figure of Moses and his actions, instead turning him into part of the landscape. The painting shows the force of nature as a more important factor than the force of man, which is minuscule.\n\nTurner describes the seventh plague of Egypt that God cursed upon the Egyptians for punishment of not releasing the Israelites from slavery, as described in the Old Testament Book of Exodus, 9:13–35. Turner possibly mislabelled this painting as the wrong plague when he submitted it, but the title has not changed.\n\nTurner submitted this large-scale painting to the annual Royal Academy exhibition in London in 1800. The twenty-four-year-old Turner was eager to impress the London art critics, with the largest canvas submitted by a young artist. He attempted to show his virtuosity as a history painter, even when his landscape painting background is entirely evident. Turner had only been accepted into the Royal Academy as an Associate Member in 1799, and was eager to show his place.\n\nThe painting was purchased from Turner by William Beckford in April 1800. Henry Jeffrey purchased the painting in 1807, before selling it to Thomas Tutor. George Young acquired the painting by 1853, and it was at sale at Christies in London in 1866. The painting was purchased by Earl Grosvenor in 1866 and stayed in his possession until at least 1871. In 1876, the painting was bought by Sir Francis Cook, where the painting stayed until 1951. It was sold to Sir Alexander Corda by the Cook family. John Mitchell bought the painting in 1955; the IMA purchased the painting in the same year from Mitchell with funds from the Lilly family.\n\n"}

Completed in 1955, after nine months of work, it remains one of his most popular compositions. Since its arrival at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1955, it replaced Renoir's \"A Girl with a Watering Can\" as the most popular piece in the museum.\n\n\"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\" was completed during Dalí's post-World War II era, which is characterized by his increased interest in science, optical illusion and religion. During this time he became a devout Catholic and simultaneously was astonished by the \"atomic age\". Dalí himself labelled this era in his work \"Nuclear Mysticism\". He sought out to combine traditional Christian iconography with images of disintegration. This is especially apparent in his piece \"The Madonna of Port Lligat\", which was completed six years earlier.\n\nThe painting wasn't commissioned. After purchasing the \"Crucifixion\" and then giving it to the Metropolitan, collector and banker Chester Dale told Dalí he \"had to do one more religious picture\". In a paragraph in the National Gallery's curatorial file but missing from all published accounts, Dalí wrote of this picture:\n\n\"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\" depicts thirteen figures gathered around a table. Assuming this painting is in line with traditional symbolism the figures are Christ and his 12 Apostles. Christ is the centre figure in the painting placed directly on the horizon line. Directly behind him on the intersection point of perspective rests the source of sunlight making the Christ figure the focus of the painting. He points upward directing the viewer’s attention to a dominating transparent torso with arms stretched outward spanning the width of the picture plane. The scene’s setting is within a transparent dodecahedron or twelve-sided space as perceived in the pentagon-shaped windowpanes behind the table. In the background is a familiar landscape of Catalonia, which Dalí has included in his paintings numerous times, one example being his famous painting \"The Persistence of Memory\".\n\nThe combination of a classic Christian theme with the jarring techniques of surrealism captures the eye, as Dalí was able to do repeatedly with such works as \"The Temptation of St. Anthony\", \"Christ of Saint John of the Cross\", \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\", \"Nuclear Cross\", and \"The Ecumenical Council\", among others. The dimensions of the painting are in the golden ratio, as is the dodecahedron in the background. Dalí is quoted as saying that \"the Communion must be symmetrical\".\n\nThere have been many interpretations of this painting, but some critics have dismissed the piece, with the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich even calling it “junk”. Michael Anthony Novak, a Catholic theologian, presented a paper on the subject of this piece in 2005. He proposes that Dalí’s intention was not simply to paint the event of the last supper. He later stated:\n\nOther critics, like Novak, say, by looking at the title, the focus is not placed on one evening two thousand years ago. The lack of individualization of the apostles, their lack of focus on Christ and the almost dematerialized Christ reaches beyond the fact of the event. Some say because Christ points to himself and the floating torso above him it could possibly be that he is referring to himself as his spirit has already ascended to heaven.\n\n\n\n"}

Tuttle Company, is a book publishing company that includes Tuttle, Periplus Editions, and Journey Editions. A company profile describes it as an \"International publisher of innovative books on design, cooking, martial arts, language, travel and spirituality with a focus on China, Japan and South East Asia.\" Many of its books on Asian martial arts, particularly those on Japanese martial arts, were the first widely read publications on these subjects in the English language.\n\nPublisher and book dealer Charles E. Tuttle (1915–1993) founded the company in 1948 in Tokyo, Japan, with the aim of publishing \"books to span the East and West.\" It was the 31st corporation approved by the occupying Allied administration. In its first year of operation, the company imported and distributed U.S. paperback publications to the occupying forces, and the next year, it released its first publication. From 1951, it published many books on the Japanese language, arts, and culture, as well as translations of Japanese works into the English language.\n\nIn 1953, part of the company was separated to form a new, partially owned company, Yohan, which took on responsibility for distributing U.S. paperback books and magazines. The Charles E. Tuttle Company retained responsibility for distributing UK publications. In 1991, under chief executive Peter Ackroyd, a planned acquisition of the Atlantic Monthly Press failed to eventuate. According to executives, \"Tuttle, which specializes in Japanese and other Asian books, came to feel that it was putting its existing business at risk by acquiring Atlantic.\" In 1996, the company changed its name to Tuttle Publishing.\n\nSince its founding, Tuttle has published more than 6,000 books and today maintains an active backlist of around 2,000 titles. The company now produces 150 new titles each year, most of which still focus on the areas of Asian interest that Tuttle has long been known for—everything from Asian literature and language learning to cooking, art, crafts, and design.\n\nThe company’s founder, Charles Egbert Tuttle, Jr., was a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University. He enlisted in the U.S. military and was stationed in Japan immediately after World War II, working on General Douglas MacArthur’s staff. His job, among other things, was to help revive the Japanese publishing industry after the war. After his military service was completed, he decided to stay on in Japan and set up his own business importing English-language books and magazines and exporting rare Japanese antiquarian books to U.S. libraries.\n\nTuttle came from a distinguished New England publishing family. His father ran Tuttle Antiquarian Books—one of several Tuttle companies in Rutland, Vermont, that had been involved with printing and publishing since the 1830s. At university, he studied American history and literature. After graduating in 1937, he worked in the library of Columbia University for a year, then joined the family business. His interest in publishing 'quality' books about Japan and Asia, and his keen eye for design and editorial matters as a publisher, grew out of an appreciation for the valuable antiquarian books that he dealt with as a youth.\n\nTuttle's current publisher and CEO is Singapore resident Eric Oey. Oey is a nephew of Charles E. Tuttle.\n\nAccording to UNESCO (2002, 2007), Tuttle Publishing is the most active publisher of books teaching Japanese to the English-speaking world, and English to the Japanese-speaking world. The company has also published books on Tagalog. The company publishes more than 40 products that teach Chinese, 20 that teach Korean, 20 for Indonesian, and numerous products on other Asian languages such as Burmese, Cambodian, Lao, Malay, Thai, and Vietnamese. Tuttle published its first Arabic phrasebook in 2004 and, in 2009, its first introduction to Modern Standard Hindi.\n\nIn 2010, out of the company's top 20 best-selling books, 11 were martial arts titles. Tuttle Publishing had estimated annual sales of $2.5–$5 million U.S., and a staff of around 40 people. It had offices in North Clarendon (in Vermont, USA), Singapore, Tokyo, and Jakarta. Leading officers are in the U.S. are Michael Sargent (General Manager), David Loseby (Finance Executive), and Christopher Johns (Sales & Marketing Director).\n\nIn September, 2012, Tuttle announced that it would move its fulfillment operation to Simon & Schuster, resulting in the layoff of 16 employees in its Vermont operation. By late 2013, subsequent departures left a staff of 18.\n\n\na. This is not the same person as the British author by the same name.\n\n"}

Ye means \"Kathmandu\" and Ya means \"celebration\", together it means \"celebration inside Kathmandu\" in Nepal Bhasa. The celebrations consist of two events, Indra Jātrā and Kumāri Jātrā. Indra Jātrā is marked by masked dances of deities and demons, displays of sacred images and tableaus in honor of the deity Indra, the king of heaven. Kumāri Jātrā is the chariot procession of the living goddess Kumari.\n\nFamily members deceased in the past year are also remembered during the festival. The main venue of the festivities is Kathmandu Durbar Square. The celebrations last for eight days from the 12th day of the bright fortnight to the 4th day of the dark fortnight of Yanlā (ञला), the eleventh month in the lunar Nepal Era calendar.\n\nIndra Jatra was started by King Gunakamadeva(गुणकामदेव) to commemorate the founding of the Kathmandu city in the 10th century. Kumari Jatra began in the mid-18th century. The celebrations are held according to the lunar calendar, so the dates are changeable. This year (2018), the festival takes place from 21st to 28th of September, and the main day of attraction falling on 24th.\n\nThe festival starts with Yosin Thanegu (योसिं थनेगु), the erection of Yosin or Linga, a pole from which the banner of Indra is unfurled, at Kathmandu Durbar Square. The pole, a tree shorn of its branches and stripped of its bark, is obtained from a forest near Nālā, a small town 29 km to the east of Kathmandu. It is dragged in stages to Durbar Square by men pulling on ropes.\n\nAnother event on the first day is Upāku Wanegu (उपाकु वनेगु) when participants visit shrines holding lighted incense to honor deceased family members. They also place small butter lamps on the way. Some sing hymns as they make the tour. The circuitous route winds along the periphery of the historic part of the city. The procession starts at around 4 pm.\n\nKumari Jatra, which means the chariot festival of Kumari, coincides with Indra Jatra. It was started in 1756 AD during the reign of Jaya Prakash Malla.\n\nDuring this festival, three chariots carrying human representations of the deities Ganesh, Bhairava and Kumari accompanied by musical bands are pulled along the festival route through Kathmandu on three days. The procession starts at around 3 pm.\n\nOn the first day of Kumari Jatra known as Kwaneyā (क्वनेया:), the chariots are pulled through the southern part of town. The second day is the full moon day known as Yenya Punhi (येँयाः पुन्हि). During the procession known as Thaneyā (थनेया:), the chariots are drawn through the northern part till Asan. And on the third day Nānichāyā (नानिचाया:), the procession passes through the central section at Kilāgal. Since 2012, the chariot of Kumari has been pulled by an all women's team on the third day of the chariot festival.\n\n\nMata Biye (मत बिये) means to offer butter lamps. On the day of Kwaneyā, the first day of the chariot festival, Newars honor family members deceased during the past year by offering small butter lamps along the processional route. They also present butter lamps to relatives and friends on the way as a mark of respect. The procession starts at around 6 pm.\n\n\nThe procession of the goddess Dāgin (दागिं) (alternative name: Dāgim) re-enacts Indra mother's going around town in search of her son. The procession consists of a man wearing a mask accompanied by a musical band. It starts at around 8 pm when the chariot of Kumari returns to Maru after journeying around the southern part of town.\n\nThe procession begins from an alley at the south-western corner of Maru square and passes by the western side of Kasthamandap. The participants follow the festival route north to Asan and then back to Durbar Square. The procession continues to the southern end of town before returning to Maru.\n\n\nBau Mata (बौँ मत) consists of a long representation of a holy snake made of reeds on which a row of oil lamps are placed. The effigy is suspended from poles carried on the shoulders and taken along the festival route. The procession starts from the southern side of Kasthamandap at Maru. When the Dagin procession returns from the upper part of town and reaches Maru, that is the cue for the Bau Mata procession to set off. It starts at around 9 pm and is organized by the Manandhar caste group.\n\n\nMasks of Bhairava are displayed at various places in Kathmandu throughout the eight days of the festival. Bhairava is the terrifying aspect of Shiva. The largest ones are of Sweta Bhairava at Durbar Square, and of Akash Bhairava at Indra Chok. A pipe sticking out of the mouth of Sweta Bhairava dispenses alcohol and rice beer on different days. An image of Bākā Bhairava is exhibited at Wotu, next to Indra Chok.\n\nThe mask of Aakash Bhairava is related to the Mahabharata. Some believe it to be the head of the first Kirat King Yalamber. Every night, different groups gather and sing hymns at Indra Chowk.\n\nImages of Indraraj Dyah with his outstretched hands bound with rope are exhibited on a tall platform at Maru near Durbar Square and at Indra Chok, Kathmandu.\n\nA tableau is known as Dasavatar or the 10 incarnations of Vishnu is shown on the temple steps in front of Kumari House every night.\n\nThis is performed by the residents of Kilagal tole. Pulu Kisi is believed to be the carrier of Indra himself. Pulu Kisi goes through the streets of the ancient city Kathmandu in search for his imprisoned master. People view the masked creature with the roar of excitement and laughter. From time to time It does naughty and mischievous things by running through the street knocking anyone that comes in its path and swinging its tail in an amazing manner.Like other dancers, he also has a team of a musical band and a torch carrier in front.\n\nThe demon dance of Majipā Lākhey is performed on the streets and market squares. The Majipa Lakhey dancer and his retinue of musicians move with much agility. The Lakhey chases Jhyalincha( a smaller being who teases Lakhey) with his dance and music. It's one of the most spectacularly chaotic dance to watch. He alongside Pulukisi helps in crowd control before chariot procession through the streets and crowds spreading the festive mood.\n\nThe Sawa Bhakku dance group from Halchok, at the western edge of the Kathmandu Valley, makes its rounds along the festival route, stopping at major street squares to perform and receive offerings from devotees. The dancers consist of Bhairava (in blue) holding a sword and his two attendants (in red). The ensemble is also known informally as Dhin Nāli Sintān after the sound of their music.\n\nthumb\nDevi Pykhan from Kilagal, Kathmandu is performed at Kilagal, Hanuman Dhoka, Jaisidewal, Bangemuda, Indrachowk, Kilagal . Dancers wearing masks of various gods & goddesses and the name of them Bhairav, Kumari, Chandi, Daitya, Kawan, Beta, & Khya. As per historical themes The Devi Pyakhan (Devi nach was born the time of Gunakar raj.\n\nMāhākāli Pykhan from Bhaktapur performs at Durbar Square and major street squares around Kathmandu. Khyāh Pyākhan (ख्याः प्याखं) features dancers dressed in a costume representing the Khyah, a fat, hairy ape-like creature. Their dance is marked by antics and a lot of tumbling.\n\nIndra Jatra is celebrated in Bhaktapur by erecting poles representing Indra at various localities around the city. The poles are known as Yambodyah. Masked dances and Pulu Kisi dance are also performed.\n\nIndra Jatra has been celebrated officially in Gangtok, the capital of the Indian state of Sikkim, since 2010. The day of the festival has also been declared a state holiday. The celebrations consist of Lakhe dance, Pulu Kisi dance, chariot procession of Kumari and a procession of girls dressed like various deities.\n\nOn 5 September 2017 the Newar people of the state gathered at Namchi, South Sikkim district for the celebration, first time in the district.\n\nIndra Jatra is also observed in some districts of Terai (Nepal and Indian Northern Bihar) as Indra Puja according to the local traditions. Rituals are different than in the Kathmandu Valley but the festival is observed around the same time indicating a common origin of the festival, probably during the Lichhavi period.\n\nAccording to legend, Indra (Hindu god-king of heaven), disguised as a farmer, descended to earth in search of \"parijat\" (Night jasmine), a white flower his mother Basundhara needed to perform a ritual. As he was plucking the flowers at Maruhiti, a sunken water spout at Maru, the people caught and bound him like a common thief. He was then put on display in the town square of Maru in Kathmandu. (In a reenactment of this event, an image of Indra with his hands bound is put on display at Maru and other places during the festival.)\n\nHis mother, worried about his extended absence, came to Kathmandu and wandered around looking for him. (This event is commemorated by the procession of Dagin (दागिं) through the city. Pulu Kisi (alternate name Tānā Kisi), a wicker representation of an elephant, also runs around town reenacting Indra's elephant searching frantically for its master.)\n\nWhen the city folk realized they had captured Indra himself, they were appalled and immediately released him. Out of appreciation for his release, his mother promised to provide enough dew throughout the winter to ensure a rich crop. It is said that Kathmandu starts to experience foggy mornings from this festival onwards because of this boon.\n\nOn the last day, the yosin pole erected at Durbar Square is taken down in a ceremony known as Yosin Kwathalegu (योसिं क्वथलेगु). It marks the end of the festivities.\n\nYenya is also the season of open air theatre productions. Performances depicting social themes, satire and comedy are held on dance platforms or makeshift stages at market squares all over the Kathmandu Valley on the sidelines of the sacred festival. The plays, known as Dabu Pyākhan (दबू प्याखं), have a history going back centuries.\n\n"}
