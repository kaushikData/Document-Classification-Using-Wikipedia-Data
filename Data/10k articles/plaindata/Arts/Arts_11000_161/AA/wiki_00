{"id": "634561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634561", "title": "Alexander Mackenzie (composer)", "text": "Alexander Mackenzie (composer)\n\nSir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie KCVO (22 August 184728 April 1935) was a Scottish composer, conductor and teacher best known for his oratorios, violin and piano pieces, Scottish folk music and works for the stage.\n\nMackenzie was a member of a musical family and was sent for his musical education to Germany. He had many successes as a composer, producing over 90 compositions, but from 1888 to 1924, he devoted a great part of his energies to running the Royal Academy of Music. Together with Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford, he was regarded as one of the fathers of the British musical renaissance in the late nineteenth century.\n\nMackenzie was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of Alexander Mackenzie and his wife, Jessie Watson \"née\" Campbell. He was the fourth musician of his family. His great-grandfather was an army bandsman; his grandfather, John Mackenzie, was a violinist in Edinburgh and Aberdeen; his father was also a violinist, the conductor of the orchestra in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, and editor of \"The National Dance Music of Scotland\". Mackenzie's musical talent emerged early: at the age of eight he was playing nightly in his father's orchestra. He was sent for his musical education to Germany, living with his teacher, the Stadtmusiker August Bartel, in Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in Thuringia, where he entered the conservatorium under K. W. Ulrich and Eduard Stein, remaining there from 1857 to 1861, when he entered the ducal orchestra as a violinist.\nMackenzie wished to continue his violin studies with the teacher Prosper Sainton, who had taught his father, and in 1862 he successfully applied for admission to the Royal Academy of Music in London, where Sainton taught. His other tutors were the principal, Charles Lucas (harmony), and Frederick Bowen Jewson (piano). Shortly after starting at the Academy, he was awarded a King's Scholarship, the income from which Mackenzie augmented by playing in theatre and music hall pit-bands, as well as in classical concerts under the leading conductor Michael Costa. This sometimes caused him to neglect his academic work, and on one occasion, having failed to prepare a piece by a classical composer for a piano examination, he improvised, \"starting off in A minor and taking care to end in the same key\", and convinced the examiners that it was a little-known work by Schubert. Recalling this prank in his old age, he added, \"I have never ceased to wonder at my escape, and would certainly not advise any student to run a similar risk today.\" Some of Mackenzie's early compositions were performed at the Academy.\n\nIn 1865 Mackenzie returned to Edinburgh. He undertook a heavy workload of teaching, both privately and in local colleges, and from 1870 he was in charge of music at St George's, Charlotte Square. In 1873 he took on the conductorship of the Scottish Vocal Association. He also played the violin in orchestral concerts both locally and at the Birmingham Festivals from 1864 to 1873, meeting visiting musicians including the conductor Hans von Bülow, who became a firm friend. In 1874 Mackenzie married a local woman, Mary Malina Burnside (d. 1925). They had a daughter, Mary. Mackenzie successfully began composing orchestral music. Bülow conducted his overture \"Cervantes\" in 1879, and two of his Scottish rhapsodies were premiered by August Manns in 1880 and 1881.\nBy this time, Mackenzie's heavy workload as a teacher and player began to undermine his health. Two of Bülow's pupils in Florence, Italy, Giuseppe Buonamici and George F. Hatton, introduced Mackenzie to the musical philanthropists Carl and Jessie Hillebrand. After a few months' rest in their care, Mackenzie began composing full-time. Apart from a year in England (1885), he made Florence his home until 1888. During this period he spent much time in the company of Franz Liszt. He began composing large-scale works, including instrumental, orchestral and choral music and two operas. His cantatas \"The Bride\" and \"Jason\" were successfully given, and the Carl Rosa Company commissioned his first opera, \"Colomba\", written to a libretto prepared by Francis Hueffer, music critic of \"The Times\". The opera premiered successfully in 1883. A second opera, \"The Troubadour\", produced by the same company in 1886, was less successful, though Liszt thought well enough of the piece to begin work on a piano fantasia based on themes from it. Pablo de Sarasate premiered a violin concerto by Mackenzie at the Birmingham Festival of 1885. For the 1885–86 season, Mackenzie was appointed conductor of Novello's oratorio concerts in London. Liszt paid his final visit to England chiefly to hear his \"Saint Elisabeth\" performed under Mackenzie's direction in 1886.\n\nIn October 1887, the principal of the Royal Academy of Music, Sir George Macfarren, died, and in early 1888 Mackenzie was appointed to succeed him. He held the post for 36 years until his retirement in 1924. At the time, the Academy was overshadowed by its younger rival, the Royal College of Music, and Mackenzie set about reviving its reputation. He was fortunate in enjoying the friendly support of his opposite numbers at the College, George Grove, and, from 1895, Hubert Parry, and the two institutions established a close working relationship of mutual benefit. In addition to overhauling the curriculum and reorganising the faculty, Mackenzie engaged personally with his students by teaching composition and conducting the student orchestra. In 1912 the Academy moved from its old buildings in Mayfair to purpose-built premises in Marylebone. In his later years as principal, Mackenzie became markedly conservative, forbidding his students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he stigmatised as \"a pernicious influence\".\n\nMackenzie was conductor of the Royal Choral Society and the Philharmonic Society Orchestra between 1892 and 1899, giving the British premières of many works, including symphonies by Tchaikovsky and Borodin. \nLike his father, Mackenzie took a great interest in folk music and produced several collections of arrangements of traditional Scottish songs. In 1903, interested in investigating Canadian folk-song, he undertook a tour of Canada organised by the Anglo-Canadian musician Charles A.E. Harriss. His visit stimulated the cultural scene and choral festival competitions were held throughout Canada with eleven new choral societies being founded. Mackenzie conducted concerts during the tour, exclusively of British music.\n\nMackenzie was regarded as a cosmopolitan musician. He spoke fluent German and Italian and was elected to the post of President of the International Musical Society which he held from 1908 to 1912. From his early days playing in orchestras in Edinburgh and Birmingham he had met and become friendly with many leading international musicians, including Clara Schumann, Joseph Joachim, Charles Gounod and Antonín Dvořák. His friendship with Liszt began in Mackenzie's student days in Sondershausen and lasted for the rest of Liszt's life.\n\nAlthough Mackenzie composed a large number of works, which met with great public success, he found, as had Arthur Sullivan earlier and as did Parry contemporaneously, that running a large musical conservatoire left less time for composition. Both at the Academy and elsewhere, he was a popular lecturer. Among his topics were Verdi's opera \"Falstaff\", the text of his lecture on which was later published in translation in Italy. Outliving his contemporaries Sullivan and Parry, he gave memorial lectures on their lives and works. At a time when Sullivan's reputation in academic musical circles was not high, Mackenzie's tribute was generous and enthusiastic.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Mackenzie's professional prominence brought him many honours from universities and learned societies in Britain and abroad. He was knighted in 1895, and created a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1922, the year of the centenary celebrations of the Royal Academy, in which he was the central figure. On his eighty-sixth birthday, over forty distinguished musicians presented him with a silver tray inscribed with facsimiles of their signatures, including Elgar, Delius, Ethel Smyth, Edward German, Henry Wood, and Landon Ronald. He retired from the Academy and from public life in 1924.\n\nMackenzie died in London in 1935 at the age of 87.\n\n\"The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" says of Mackenzie's music that it is \"cosmopolitan in style and somewhat old-fashioned for its period, displaying influences of French and German composers, including Bizet, Gounod, Schumann, and Wagner.\" \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" says that although Mackenzie's music was eclipsed by the works of later composers, \"he and his contemporaries may be regarded as having laid the foundations of the musical renaissance in 19th- and early 20th-century Britain\".\n\nDuring his time teaching in Edinburgh, Mackenzie wrote several works, including a piano trio, a string quartet and a piano quartet, and he maintained a considerable output despite his crowded schedule both then and later. \"The Times\" reported that his list of compositions numbered 90, of which 20 were distinctly Scottish.\nHis orchestral works include the overture \"Cervantes\", performed at Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in 1877, three \"Scottish Rhapsodies\", a violin concerto premiered by Pablo de Sarasate at the Birmingham Festival of 1885, a \"Scottish\" concerto for piano (1897), a suite, \"London Day by Day\" (1902), and a \"Canadian Rhapsody\" (1905). He composed incidental music to six dramas, including \"Ravenswood\", and J. M. Barrie's \"The Little Minister\". The funeral march from his music for Henry Irving's production of \"Coriolanus\" was played at Irving's funeral in 1905 and at Mackenzie's memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral in 1935. He worked on a symphony but did not complete it.\n\nIt was as a composer of vocal music that Mackenzie first achieved national fame. His cantata \"The Bride\" was a success at the Three Choirs Festival of 1881. Edward Elgar played in the violins at the première and later remarked that meeting Mackenzie was \"the event of my musical life\". A second cantata, \"Jason\", for the Bristol festival of 1882, was also well received. His most famous choral work was the oratorio \"The Rose of Sharon\", written for the Norwich festival of 1884. The words were adapted from the \"Song of Solomon\" by Joseph Bennett, music critic of \"The Daily Telegraph\", who later provided Sullivan with the text for \"The Golden Legend\". \"The Dream of Jubal\" (1889), is an unusual combination of recitation and choral sections, composed for the jubilee of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society in 1889.\n\nMackenzie's operas began in 1883 with \"Colomba\", first produced by the Carl Rosa Company. It was a success, but his second opera \"The Troubadour\" (1886) was not. Francis Hueffer's libretti for both operas were written in an antiquated style that attracted much criticism. Mackenzie's other operas were a one-act opera, \"The Cricket on the Hearth\", first performed in 1914, \"The Eve of St John\" (1924), and two almost-complete operas, \"The Cornish Opera\" and \"Le luthier\".\n\nCritics observed that Mackenzie's operatic and choral music was generally ill-served by his librettists: \"Much of his best work ... is neglected, partly because unlike his contemporaries, Parry and Stanford, Mackenzie went for the texts of his larger vocal works to such librettists as Joseph Bennett and Hueffer, instead of to the vital things of English poetry and literature.\" \"[He] was content with librettos written by hacks according to the current operatic conventions.\" This even applied to his one excursion into comic opera, \"His Majesty\", a piece in the Gilbert and Sullivan vein, with a libretto by F. C. Burnand and R. C. Lehmann and additional lyrics by Adrian Ross, presented at the Savoy Theatre in 1897. \"The Times\" commented, \"Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case.\" Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was \"marked by distinction as well as humour.\"\n\nMackenzie also wrote books on Giuseppe Verdi (1913) and Franz Liszt (1920). In his memoirs \"A Musician's Narrative\" (1927), he described \"a lifetime spent, boy and man, in the service of British music\".\n\n"}
{"id": "22911386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22911386", "title": "Aval Oru Thodar Kathai", "text": "Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\n\nAval Oru Thodharkadai () is a 1974 Tamil film directed by K. Balachander. The story revolves around a working middle class woman, who sacrifices her life and desires to support her large family. The lead role was played by Sujatha in her first Tamil film, which was also her first starring role. Kamal Haasan, Vijayakumar, Jaiganesh, M. G. Soman and Sripriya played key roles. The film was shot in black-and white.\n\nThe film is considered to be one of Balachander's as well as Sujatha's best films. Several directors like Mani Ratnam, K. Bhagyaraj and K. S. Ravikumar named \"Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\" as one of their favourite films. It ran for 25 weeks and was remade or dubbed in five other Indian languages.\n\nKavitha (Sujatha) is a working woman in a middle-class family. She works hard to support her widowed sister, unmarried sister, her blind younger brother, her mother, her drunkard brother Murthy (Jaiganesh) and his family. Her father abandons the family and becomes a saint. Her brother not only does not take responsibilities, but also creates additional problems for her. She has a longtime boyfriend of five years, Tilak (Vijayakumar) who wants to marry her, but she doesn't because of her commitment to her family. His eyes now wander to Kavitha's widowed younger sister Bharathi (Sripriya) who reciprocates his feelings. Kavitha, after reading her boyfriend's love letter to her sister, arranges for them to get married, thus giving up her chance of having a life with him. Meanwhile, Prasad (Kamalahasan) loves Bharathi, Kavitha's sister; but when he comes to know that she loves Tilak, he sacrifices his love for her and marries Kavitha's distressed friend, Chandra (Fatafat Jayalaxmi). Kavitha eventually accepts a marriage proposal of her boss (Gokulnath), when she realises that her brother has become responsible enough to take care of her family. She decides to resign from the hard work, but could not as the result of a turning point in a typical Balachandar-style climax. Kavitha swaps her unmarried sister as the bride in her stead, as she is informed of Murthy's death minutes before. In the end she resumes her job and continues to support the family.\n\n\nDirector K. Balachander saw the Malayalam film, \"Ernakulam Junction\", where Sujatha had played the heroine and decided that she would play the role of the protagonist in his \"Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\". When auditioning her, Balachander felt that her Malayalam accented Tamil may not be convincing for the role of Kavitha and sent her advising to learn and speak Tamil better. A month later, Balachander called Sujatha and gave the role, that marked her Tamil cinema debut. Balachander introduced Fatafat Jayalaxmi in \"Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\" and the sobriquet \"Fatafat\" she got after she used the word in this film. Actors Jaiganesh, Sripriya (her first release, though she had worked for another film before) and Thideer Kanniah also made their debuts with this film. Kamal Haasan learnt mimicry for his role. Rajesh said that he was approached to act in the film but he couldn't take up the film.\n\nThe song \"Kadavul Amaitha Medhai\" was shot at a community hall situated at Nandanam, Chennai.\n\nThe film is considered a classic and cult film. Times of India named it one \"of the landmark movies in the history of Tamil cinema\". 30 years after the film's release, directors Mani Ratnam, K. Bhagyaraj and K. S. Ravikumar named \"Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\" as one of their favourite films. Mani Ratnam said, \"K.Balachandar has done some of the best films before and after \"Aval Oru Thodar Kathai\". But I choose it mainly for its storyline. It is not the plot or the story, but the character that carries the film through. Although it was released about 25 years ago, the character remains fresh in one’s memory. That is the greatness of the film\". Ravikumar stated, \"Through his script and direction, Balachandar brings out the tender core of his middle-class heroine, assailed by problems, in \"Aval Oru Thodarkathai\".\" Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi said, \"Since Aval Oru Thodarkathai days, I am an avid fan of Balachander\". In 2011, after Balachander had been given the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Rediff named it one of Balachander's best and wrote, \"\"Aval Oru Thodarkadhai\" was one of his path-breaking works. Sujatha took on the mantle of Kavitha, the hard-working woman who struggles to support her largely ungrateful family. The tough exterior conceals a heart of gold, which, tragically, is never seen or recognised by her family. The film made waves not just for its principal characters who challenged Tamil cinema's set notions; it was also the dialogues that drew gasps from the audience. In creating Kavitha, K Balachander gave life to one of Tamil's most enduring, powerful female characters\". Hindu wrote, \"Aval Oru Thodarkadhai is a film that will stay with you forever — the invincible heroine was a big draw. And with AOT, Sujatha arrived! As the eldest daughter, who bears the onus of supporting a large family, she came up with a memorable performance. Her matter-of-fact approach to life was very fresh for Tamil audiences, who sang paeans to KB’s creative stroke\".\n\n\"Aval Oru Thodarkathai\" is the second film in a series of woman-centric films by Balachander in which \"the daughter has to make sacrifices and take care of her family\" and a reviewer from Times of India wrote that it was a tough task to beat those films.\n\n\nThe song \"Kadavul Amaitha\" inspired a 1979 film of same name. \n\nThe song \"Deivam Thantha\" inspired a television series of same name in Vijay TV. The song was parodied by Vivek in \"Parthiban Kanavu\" (2003). Although the song sequence in the film featured Jai Ganesh as the character singing, it is often associated with Rajinikanth, who played Murthy in the Telugu remake also by Balachander, \"Athuleni Katha\", and acted in the sequence of the same song in Telugu. Thus, Vivek is seen mimicking Rajinikanth's iconic cigarette-flicking mannerism during his parody.\n\nClips from \"Aval Oru Thodarkathai\" were screened along with clips from other films such as \"Server Sundaram\" (1964), \"Iru Kodugal\" (1969), \"Arangetram\" (1973), \"Avargal\" (1977) and \"Azhagan\" (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death.\n\n\"Aval Oruuu Thodhar Kathai\" was remade in Telugu as \"Anthuleni Katha\", also directed by K. Balachander. It was also shot in black and white. Jayaprada played the role of Sujatha, Rajnikanth did the role of Jaiganesh, making his debut in Telugu cinema, and Kamal Haasan did the role of Jayaprada's boss. Same tunes were used in both the languages. Sripriya, Phataphat Jayalaxmi and rest of the cast are same in both the versions. The Tamil film was later dubbed into Malayalam as \"Aval Oru Thudar Katha\" in 1975. In 1977, Mala Sinha starred in the Bengali remake titled \"Kabita\" playing the lead role. Kamal Haasan made his Bengali film debut with this film by acting in the same role that he played in the Tamil original. Bharat Shamsher directed the black-and-white film. The film was again remade in Hindi as \"Jeevan Dhaara\" in 1982 by director T. Rama Rao. Rekha did the role of Jayaprada, Rakesh Roshan did the role of Kamal Haasan, Amol Palekar did the role of Narayana Rao. Kanwaljit did the conductor role, Simple Kapadia (sister of Dimple Kapadia) did Phataphat Jayalaxmi's role. The film was shot in colour. The film was a decent hit.\n\nIn 1983, Balachander produced the Kannada remake titled \"Benkiyalli Aralida Hoovu\" starring Suhasini, whose real-life uncle Kamal Haasan played the guest role of a bus conductor in this remake. Balachander directed the film which was produced by Chandulal Jain. It was shot in colour.\n\n"}

{"id": "915627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=915627", "title": "Color wheel", "text": "Color wheel\n\nA color wheel or colour circle is an abstract illustrative organization of color hues around a circle, which shows the relationships between primary colors, secondary colors, tertiary colors etc.\n\nSome sources use the terms \"color wheel\" and \"color circle\" interchangeably; however, one term or the other may be more prevalent in certain fields or certain versions as mentioned above. For instance, some reserve the term \"color wheel\" for mechanical rotating devices, such as color tops or filter wheels. Others classify various color wheels as \"color disc\", \"color chart\", and \"color scale\" varieties.\n\nAs an illustrative model, artists typically use red, yellow, and blue primaries (RYB color model) arranged at three equally spaced points around their color wheel. Printers and others who use modern subtractive color methods and terminology use magenta, yellow, and cyan as subtractive primaries. Intermediate and interior points of color wheels and circles represent color mixtures. In a paint or subtractive color wheel, the \"center of gravity\" is usually (but not always) black, representing all colors of light being absorbed; in a color circle, on the other hand, the center is white or gray, indicating a mixture of different wavelengths of light (all wavelengths, or two complementary colors, for example).\n\nThe original color circle of Isaac Newton showed only the spectral hues and was provided to illustrate a rule for the color of mixtures of lights, that these could be approximately predicted from the center of gravity of the numbers of \"rays\" of each spectral color present (represented in his diagram by small circles). The divisions of Newton's circle are of unequal size, being based on the intervals of a Dorian musical scale. Most later color circles include the purples, however, between red and violet, and have equal-sized hue divisions. Color scientists and psychologists often use the additive primaries, red, green and blue; and often refer to their arrangement around a circle as a color circle as opposed to a color wheel.\n\nThe typical artists' paint or pigment color wheel includes the blue, red, and yellow primary colors. The corresponding secondary colors are green, orange, and violet or purple. The tertiary colors are green-yellow, yellow–orange, orange-red, red–violet/purple, purple/violet-blue and blue–green.\n\nA color wheel based on RGB (red, green, blue) or RGV (red, green, violet) additive primaries has cyan, magenta, and yellow secondaries (cyan was previously known as cyan blue). Alternatively, the same arrangement of colors around a circle can be described as based on cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractive primaries, with red, green, and blue (or violet) being secondaries.\n\nMost color wheels are based on three primary colors, three secondary colors, and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary, known as tertiary colors, for a total of 12 main divisions; some add more intermediates, for 24 named colors. Other color wheels, however, are based on the four opponent colors, and may have four or eight main colors.\n\nGoethe's Theory of Colours provided the first systematic study of the physiological effects of color (1810). His observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel anticipating Ewald Hering's opponent color theory (1872).\n\nA color circle based on spectral wavelengths appears with red at one end of the spectrum and is 100% mixable violet at the other. A wedge-shaped gap represents colors that have no unique spectral frequency. These extra-spectral colors, the purples, form from additive mixture of colors from the ends of the spectrum.\n\nIn normal human vision, wavelengths of between about 400 nm and 700 nm are represented by this incomplete circle, with the longer wavelengths equating to the red end of the spectrum. Complement colors are located directly opposite each other on this wheel. These complement colors are not identical to colors in pigment mixing (such as are used in paint), but when lights are additively mixed in the correct proportions appear as a neutral grey or white.\n\nFor example: the reason that the Wimbledon tennis tournament uses purple on the Wimbledon official logo is that purple is located almost opposite of green on the color wheel. Purple against green provides good contrast.\n\nThe color circle is used for, among other purposes, illustrating additive color mixture. Combining two colored lights from different parts of the spectrum may produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum, even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved. This type of color matching is known as metameric matching. Thus a combination of green and red light might produce a color close to yellow in apparent hue. The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle, but they are usually represented as being joined by a straight line on the circle, the location of the new color closer to the (white) centre of the circle indicating that the resulting hue is less saturated (i.e., paler) than either of the two source colors. The combination of any two colors in this way are always less saturated than the two pure spectral colors individually.\n\nObjects may be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions. The human visual system is able to adapt to these differences by chromatic adaptation. This aspect of the visual system is relatively easy to mislead, and optical illusions relating to color are therefore a common phenomenon. The color circle is a useful tool for examining these illusions.\n\nArranging spectral colors in a circle to predict admixture of light stems from work by Sir Isaac Newton. Newton's calculation of the resulting color involves three steps: First, mark on the color circle the constituent colors according to their relative weight. Second, find the barycenter of these differently weighted colors. Third, interpret the radial distance (from the center of the circle to the barycenter) as the saturation of the color, and the azimuthal position on the circle as the hue of the color. Thus, Newton's color circle is a predecessor of the modern, horseshoe-shaped CIE color diagram.\n\nThe psychophysical theory behind the color circle dates to the early color triangle of Thomas Young, whose work was later extended by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. Young postulated that the eye contains receptors that respond to three different primary sensations, or spectra of light. As Maxwell showed, all hues, but not all colors, can be created from three primary colors such as red, green, and blue, if they are mixed in the right proportions.\n\nThere is no straight-line relationship between colors mixed in pigment, which vary from medium to medium. With a psychophysical color circle, however, the resulting hue of any mixture of two colored light sources can be determined simply by the relative brightness and wavelength of the two lights. A similar calculation cannot be performed with two paints. As such, a painter's color wheel is indicative rather than predictive, being used to compare existing colors rather than calculate exact colors of mixtures. Because of differences relating to the medium, different color wheels can be created according to the type of paint or other medium used, and many artists make their own individual color wheels. These often contain only blocks of color rather than the gradation between tones that is characteristic of the color circle.\n\nA number of interactive color wheel applications are available both on the Internet and as desktop applications. These programs are used by artists and designers for picking colors for a design.\n\nThe HSL and HSV color spaces are simple geometric transformations of the RGB cube into cylindrical form. The outer top circle of the HSV cylinder – or the outer middle circle of the HSL cylinder – can be thought of as a color wheel. There is no authoritative way of labeling the colors in such a color wheel, but the six colors which fall at corners of the RGB cube are given names in the X11 color list, and are named keywords in HTML.\n\nColor schemes are logical combinations of colors on the color wheel.\n\nIn color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media. For example, the use of a white background with black text is an example of a common default color scheme in web design.\n\nColor schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling together commonly appear together in color schemes. A basic color scheme uses two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination, usually based around a single color—for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, orange and light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article.\n\nColor schemes can also contain different shades of a single color; for example, a color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light (almost white) to very dark.\n\nAnalogous colors are colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, yellow and green.\nMonochromic colors are different shades of the same color. For example, light blue, indigo, and cyan blue.\nComplementary colors are colors across from each other on a color wheel. For example, blue and orange.\nTriadic colors are colors that are evenly across from each other, in a triangle over the color wheel. For example, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue are triadic colors.\n\nFor a list of ways to construct color schemes, regarding properties such as warmness/achromiticness/complementariness, see color theory.\n\nAnalogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.\n\n\n"}

The Content Scramble System (CSS) was devised for this purpose to make copyright infringement difficult, but also presents obstacles to some legitimate uses of the media. The association is also responsible for the controversial Regional Playback Control (RPC), the region encoding scheme which gives movie studios geographic control over DVD distribution.\n\nAs of 2001, members included film distributors such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros.\n\nThey filed the much publicized case versus Jon Johansen who they alleged wrote DeCSS. The case was dropped in January 2004. CSS decrypting software (such as DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD, and DVD Shrink) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. It also removes Macrovision, CSS, region codes, and user operation prohibitions. They also filed the suit \"DVD CCA v. Bunner\" against people who distributed DeCSS, seeking injunctions to stop further distribution based on trade secret claims. The injunction was eventually denied because CSS was no longer a secret by the time litigation occurred.\n\nAll hardware manufacturers (especially DVD player/burner manufacturers) implement DVD CCA-mandated enforcement features on their products as RPC (which is one of three restrictions in the Content Scramble System); some even go beyond that and implement additional features to restrict ripping, for example:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22499668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22499668", "title": "En Garde Arts", "text": "En Garde Arts\n\nEn Garde Arts is a New York City-based theatre company, and a pioneer in the field of immersive theater. \n\nFounded in 1985 by Anne Hamburger, the company was New York’s first exclusively site-specific theatre, leading audiences to unexpected locations across the city for innovative, contemporary, highly visual new work. En Garde’s productions earned 6 OBIEs, 2 Drama Desk Awards and the Special Outer Critics Circle Award. The company ceased operations in 1999 when Hamburger relocated to the West Coast, first as Artistic Director of the La Jolla Playhouse, and later to run a global division for the Walt Disney Company. She returned to the east coast, reformed the company, and re-launched En Garde in the fall of 2014.\n\nFrom 1985-1999, Hamburger commissioned playwrights, directors and composers to create theatrical pieces for architectural sites and neighborhoods. The roster of En Garde’s alumni artists includes playwrights Charles L. Mee, Mac Wellman, Maria Irene Fornes; composers David Van Tieghem, Jonathan Larson; directors Michael Engler, Tina Landau, Anne Bogart, Reza Abdoh, Jim Simpson and Bill Rauch; and actors Carl Hancock Rux, Fiona Shaw, Fisher Stevens, Tyne Daly and Jefferson Mays. Intrepid audiences followed their work to a variety of locations, including Central Park, the Meatpacking District, Penn Yards, East River Park, Pier 25, the Chelsea Hotel, the Victory Theater (New Victory Theatre, and the intersection of Wall and Broad Streets in Lower Manhattan.\n\nIn 1989, En Garde produced a series of three plays at the Dairy, Belvedere Castle and Bow Bridge(Central Park) in Central Park to great critical acclaim. OBIE Awards for Best New American Play and Best Director were given to BAD PENNY playwright Mac Wellman and director Jim Simpson . \"The New York Times\" wrote, “Moving environmentally through the streets and buildings of Manhattan, En Garde Arts is an invigorating urban presence.” The following year, Wellman’s play CROWBAR became the first legitimate theatrical production to be held in 42nd Street’s Victory Theatre for 60 years. Designed and built for Oscar Hammerstein in 1900, the theatre’s elaborately decorated interior remained intact despite decades of neglect, including 20 years as porn theatre. CROWBAR was produced before 42nd Street’s redevelopment, and En Garde Arts could not find a cleaning company willing to take on the job, so a group of volunteers cleaned the interior to make way for Mac Wellman’s new play. Directed by Richard Caliban with music by David Van Tieghem, CROWBAR won OBIEs for En Garde Arts and actor Elzbieta Czyzewska, and was granted a Special Award by the Outer Critics Circle.\n\nNow firmly in league with New York’s most influential and innovative theatre companies, En Garde continued to produce iconoclastic, critically acclaimed, award-winning work throughout the 1990s. Reza Abdoh & Mira-Lani Oglesby’s spectacular, AIDS era cri de coeur, FATHER WAS A PECULIAR MAN took place over 9 distinct locations through the Meatpacking District, long before its gentrification. In an abandoned Victorian hospital on West 106th Street, Charles L. Mee’s ANOTHER PERSON IS A FOREIGN COUNTRY confronted the social marginalization of unconventional people; in fact, it was a celebration of difference, played like a beautiful human symphony under a blanket of stars. Director Anne Bogart’s cast included a blind choir with seeing-eye dogs, a group of emotionally disturbed rock musicians, and a man and woman, both 3’ tall, all staged against the gothic, empty Towers Nursing Home(New York Cancer Hospital). The evening ended with a stunning waterfall cascading down the building’s stone facade.\n\nEn Garde would win further OBIE Awards for Tina Landau & Charles L. Mee’s ORESTES in the Penn Yards, and Trojan Women in East River Park Amphitheatre. Deborah Warner’s adaptation of The Wasteland with Fiona Shaw earned two Drama Desk Awards. Hamburger used the New York Stock Exchange as a backdrop for JP MORGAN SAVES THE NATION by composer Jonathan Larson. On opening night, he slipped her a cassette tape of the work he was just developing; it would become the musical phenomenon RENT. Hamburger was recognized with the Edwin Booth and Lee Reynolds Awards for the impressive body of her work. In 1999, she was offered and accepted the post of Artistic Director with the La Jolla Playhouse. Within six months of moving to California, she received an offer to establish a new creative division for the Walt Disney Company, where she remained until returning to New York.\n\nHamburger re-launched En Garde Arts in 2014 with BASETRACK Live, a gripping, multimedia fusion of music, film, photojournalism and performance, that explores the impact of war on veterans and their families. The show was developed in collaboration with the corpsmen and families of the 1st Battalion 8th Marines. BASETRACK Live, created by Edward Bilous, music direction by Michelle DiBucci, directed by Seth Bockley, co-adapted by Jason Grote with Seth Bockley and Anne Hamburger. Music Co-Composed by Edward Bilous, Michelle DiBucci and Greg Kalember. Anne Hamburger, Executive Producer, Portia Kamons, Producer (Inspired by the website One-Eight Basetrack, a citizen journalism project featuring the work of Teru Kuwayama, Balazs Gardi and Tivadar Domaniczky). The production premiered in Austin, TX in September 2014, and is touring to over 40 cities nationally with a New York premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Veterans Day 2014. BASETRACK Live was invited to Fort Hood at the invitation of the Commanding General to encourage active duty soldiers to avail themselves of mental health services. Six months of research by the Intrepid Behavioral Health Center determined that 36% of the soldiers that came to the show sought out help for the first time.\n\nEn Garde Arts continued to grow, creating the highly anticipated Emerging Arts Festival BOSSS (Big Outdoor Site Specific Stuff) in the fall of 2015. Beginning in early 2015, Hamburger gathered multiple artists together once a week to brainstorm ideas. Hamburger mentored the artists as pieces began to take shape, working with the Hudson River Park as a performance space. Completely free to the public, the festival featured 9 site-specific shows, including a feminist march through the park, to a first date with Bina48, the most advanced artificial intelligence-enabled robot in the world. After complications due to tropical storm Joaquin, the festival was moved from its original dates in early October to the weekend of October 23rd.\nEn Garde Arts plans to make BOSSS an annual event.\n\n1985: \"The Ritual Project\" (Central Park) En Engarde Arts supported project, funded by a Lower Manhattan production grant.

{"id": "175717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175717", "title": "Fantasy world", "text": "Fantasy world\n\nA fantasy world is a human conceived world created in fictional media, such as literature, film or games. Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology and sometimes, either a historical or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world connected to Earth via magical portals or items (like Narnia); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like Middle-earth); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the Star Wars Galaxy).\n\nMany fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.\n\nThe setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about. Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.\n\nEven when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.\n\nEarly fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy \"lands\", part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers. For example, Oz, though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.\n\nAlthough medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an ogre could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the Renaissance onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.\n\nEven within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900, was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nAn early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (\"Arabian Nights\"), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set \"long ago\" or \"far away\". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's Islandia. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an arcadian society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.\n\nDream frames were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place. H.P. Lovecraft made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized, and are far less frequent today.\n\nThis change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds. This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.\n\nThe most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since William Morris used it in his early fantasy works, such as \"The Well at the World's End\". and particularly since the 1954 publication of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Such a world is often called \"pseudo-medieval\"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on romanticized views of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism. The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or oligarchies, usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages. Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately pastoral.\n\nCareful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.\nHeavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in Barry Hughart's \"Bridge of Birds\", clearly derived from China, or Lloyd Alexander's use of real world cultures such as Welsh for \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" or Indian for \"The Iron Ring\", make the line between fantasy worlds and alternate histories fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.\n\nConversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as Ruritania or Graustark—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such Ruritanian romances may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.\n\nAccording to Lin Carter in \"Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy\", fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of magic (paranormal). This element may be the creatures in it (dragons, unicorns, genies and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from mythology and folklore, frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.\n\nFantasy worlds created through a process called world building are known as a constructed world. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.\n\nDespite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.\n\nFurthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking-Glass\".\n\n\nFairytale fantasy may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully. Comic fantasy may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in Diana Wynne Jones's \"Dark Lord of Derkholm\", or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in L. Sprague de Camp's \"Solomon's Stone\", where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other subgenres of fantasy suffer if the world-building is neglected.\n\nRather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce \"a retreat of magic\" (sometimes called \"thinning\") that explains why the magic and other fantastic elements no longer appear: For example, in \"The Lord of the Rings\", the destruction of the One Ring defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the Three Rings of the elves, resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A contemporary fantasy necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. J. K. Rowling's \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.\n\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\", the first major role-playing game, has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called \"campaign settings\"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The Forgotten Realms is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.\n\nMany established fantasy writers have also derided \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the \"Dungeons & Dragons Monster Manual\" instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.\n\nDue to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and science fiction, it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between \"fantasy worlds\" and planets in science fiction. For example, the worlds of Barsoom, Darkover, Gor, and the Witch World combine elements of both genres.\n\n\n"}

It is believed to be the oldest fountain in Rome, dating back, according to some sources, to the 8th century. The present fountain is the work of Donato Bramante, with later additions by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Carlo Fontana. \nA fountain is believed to have stood in this square since the 8th century, but the exact date it was built is unknown. The fountain is first mentioned in documents dating to the second half of the 15th century. A drawing of the fountain appears on the map of Rome made by Pietro del Massaio in 1471, along with a description of the legend of the fountain's origin. According to the legend, which appears in the \"Chronicle\" of Eusebius, translated and finished by Saint Jerome in the fifth century, on the night of the birth of Christ a fountain of oil appeared miraculously in front of the church, which as a result was given the name \"Santa Maria in fontibus.\" The original fountain was supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct, the Aqua Traiana. When the aqueduct was ruined during the invasions of Rome, water came from underground sources below the Janiculum hill. The old fountain illustrated in the drawing of del Massaio had two vasques, one above the other, pouring water into the basin below. \n\nThe fountain was reconstructed between 1499 and 1500 on the command of Giovanni Lopez, the bishop of Perouse and Bishop of the parish of Santa Maria in Trastevere, who gave the commission to Donato Bramante, the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Bramante removed the upper vasque and added four carved stone wolf heads, the emblem of the Lopez family. \n\nThe fountain was reconstructed again in 1604 by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi, the father of Carlo Rainaldi,the architect of the two churches of Piazza del Popolo. At that time the fountain was connected to the newly restored Acqua Felice aqueduct. In 1659 the fountain was connected to the Acqua Paola aqueduct and remodeled again by Bernini. Bernini replaced the octagonal basin, moved the fountain from its original place in front of the church to a new location in the center of the square, and added sculpted seashells around the basin. At the end of the 17th century, the architect Carlo Fontana replaced Bernini's seashells with his own sculpted seashells. \n\nThe fountain was completely rebuilt in 1873, following the design of Bernini and Fontana, but using less expensive materials. In that occasion, the main pool was rebuilt with bardiglio marble and an imposing S.P.Q.R. sign has been placed on the external side of the shells.\nIt was rebuilt once again in 1930. The last maintenance has been made in 1984.\n\n"}
{"id": "43758363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43758363", "title": "Gamergate controversy", "text": "Gamergate controversy\n\nThe Gamergate controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the hashtag #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture. \"Gamergate\" is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.\n\nIn August 2014, the harassment campaign targeted several women in the video game industry; notably game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included doxing, threats of rape, and death threats. \n\nGamergate proponents (\"Gamergaters\") said that they were a movement, but had no official leaders, spokespeople, or manifesto. Gamergate supporters organized anonymously or pseudonymously on online platforms such as 4chan, Internet Relay Chat, Twitter, and Reddit. Statements claiming to represent Gamergate have been inconsistent and contradictory, making it difficult for commentators to identify goals and motives. Gamergate supporters said there was unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics. As a result, Gamergate has often been defined by the harassment its supporters engaged in. Gamergate supporters have frequently responded to this by denying that the harassment took place or by falsely claiming that it was manufactured by the victims.\n\nThe controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism. \n\nIndustry responses to the harassment campaign have focused on ways to minimise harm and prevent similar events. Gamergate has led figures both inside and outside the industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment.\n\nIn 2013, Zoë Quinn, an independent game developer, released \"Depression Quest\", a text-focused game designed to convey the experience of depression though a series of fictional scenarios, based in part on Quinn's own experience with the illness. The game received positive reviews in the gaming media, but faced backlash online from gamers who disliked its departure from typical game formats emphasizing violence and skill and who opposed \"political\" intrusions into gamer culture. Quinn was subjected to several months of harassment after its release, including rape and death threats. Quinn documented the harassment she received and spoke openly to the media about it, which led to an even greater intensity of abuse against her, including the posting of her home address online. She ultimately fled her house out of fear for her safety.\n\nThe event that would come to be known as Gamergate began in 2014 as a personal attack on Quinn, incited by a blog post by Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni. Called the \"Zoe Post\", it was a lengthy, detailed account of their relationship and breakup that included copies of personal chat logs, emails, and text messages. The blog falsely implied that Quinn had gotten a favorable review of \"Depression Quest\" because of her sexual relationship with Nathan Grayson, a video-game reviewer for the website \"Kotaku\". Grayson never actually reviewed Quinn's games, and Grayson's only article mentioning her was published before their relationship began. Gjoni later updated his blog post to acknowledge this, saying that a typographical error was to blame. Nonetheless, a link to the blog posted on 4chan, where many participants had previously been highly critical of \"Depression Quest\", led to renewed attacks on Quinn.\n\nAfter Gjoni's blog post, Quinn and her family were subjected to a virulent and often misogynistic harassment campaign. Online attackers of Quinn at first used the label \"Quinnspiracy\", later adopting the hashtag \"#Gamergate\" after it was coined by the actor Adam Baldwin, whose nearly 190,000 Twitter followers helped the spread of the hashtag. Harassment of Gamergate targets was coordinated via Internet Relay Chat (IRC), spreading rapidly over imageboards and forums like 4chan and Reddit.\n\nWithin four months of the start of Gamergate, Quinn's record of threats she had received had grown 1,000-fold. At a conference Quinn said, \"I used to go to game events and feel like I was going home [...] Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?\". One anonymous 4chan user threatened to \"give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal\". Commentators both inside and outside the video game industry condemned the attacks against Quinn. The attacks included doxing (researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual) and hacking of her Tumblr, Dropbox, and Skype accounts; she was again subjected to rape and death threats. Quinn again fled her home to stay with friends. She wrote that \"the Internet spent the last month spreading my personal information around, sending me threats, hacking anyone suspected of being friends with me, calling my dad and telling him I’m a whore, sending nude photos of me to colleagues, and basically giving me the 'burn the witch' treatment\".\n\nGamergate supporters subjected others to similar harassment, doxing, and death threats. Those who came to the victims' defense were ridiculed as \"white knights\", or \"social justice warriors\" (SJWs); this characterization was intended, according to Heron, Belford and Goker, to neutralize any opposition by questioning their motives. Shortly after the Gamergate hashtag was coined, video game developer Phil Fish had his personal information, including various accounts and passwords, hacked and publicly posted in retaliation for defending Quinn and attacking her detractors. The hacks and doxing also exposed documents relating to Fish's company, Polytron. As a result, Fish left the gaming industry and put Polytron up for sale, calling the situation \"unacceptable\" and saying, \"it's not worth it\".\n\nThe campaign expanded to include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment due in part to her YouTube video series \"Tropes vs. Women in Video Games\", which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games. Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper. After a new episode of \"Tropes vs. Women\" was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that \"one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences\". \"The perpetrators\", Sarkeesian went on to say, \"do not see themselves as perpetrators at all [...] They see themselves as noble warriors\".\n\nSarkeesian canceled an October 2014 speaking appearance at Utah State University (USU) after the school received three anonymous threats, the second of which claimed affiliation with Gamergate. The initial threat proposed that \"a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees, as well as the students and staff at the nearby Women's Center\", alluding to the École Polytechnique massacre, a 1989 mass shooting motivated by antifeminism. USU's President and Provost released a joint statement saying that USU, in consultation with state and federal law enforcement agencies, had assessed that there was no credible threat to students, staff or the speaker. Requests for additional security measures were declined because of Utah's open carry laws, leading to the cancellation. The threats drew the attention of mainstream media to the Gamergate situation. Wingfield of \"The New York Times\" referred to the threat as \"the most noxious example of a weeks long campaign to discredit or intimidate outspoken critics of the male-dominated gaming industry and its culture\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the threat to attack Sarkeesian and other Gamergate-related threats. The investigations, which were plagued with jurisdictional issues, ultimately closed with the FBI failing to identify the perpetrators of some threats and declining to prosecute others.\nIn mid-October Brianna Wu, another independent game developer and co-founder of video game studio Giant Spacekat, saw her home address and other identifying information posted on 8chan as retaliation for mocking Gamergate. Wu then became the target of rape and death threats on Twitter and elsewhere. After contacting police, Wu fled her home with her husband, saying she would not allow the threats to intimidate her into silence. Wu announced an reward for information leading to a conviction for those involved in her harassment, and set up a legal fund to help other game developers who have been harassed online. As of April 2016, Wu was still receiving threats in such volume that she employed full-time staff to document them.\n\nHarassment related to Gamergate continued for several months after the onset of the controversy. Two critics of Gamergate were targets of attempted \"swatting\"—hoaxed reports to emergency services intended to provoke a SWAT team response at the target's home. \"The Guardian\" reported that both swatting attempts were coordinated through the \"baphomet\" subforum of 8chan. After the initial rush of threats that caused her to flee her home, Wu documented receiving roughly 45 death threats by April 2015; Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen offered up to a $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those who made the threats. Wu's studio, Giant Spacekat, withdrew from the Expo Hall of PAX East 2015. Wu cited security concerns, lack of confidence in the management and their failure to return calls.\n\nActress and gamer Felicia Day wrote a blog post about her concerns over Gamergate and her fear of retaliation if she spoke against it. Almost immediately her home address and phone number were posted online, leading to harassing letters and phone calls. Actor Wil Wheaton and former NFL player Chris Kluwe also posted criticisms of Gamergate. Stephen Colbert questioned why men like Kluwe had not been threatened by Gamergate, noting that the targets were almost entirely women.\n\nSome who have identified as Gamergate supporters said that they have been harassed. YouTube personality Steven \"Boogie2988\" Williams remarked that a comment on one of his videos included his address and a threat to his wife's life. In an interview with BBC Three, Gamergate supporter John Bain, known by his YouTube moniker \"TotalBiscuit\", said he had been the target of death threats and harassment from anonymous people who opposed his view on Gamergate. Mike Diver wrote in \"Vice\" that threats against Gamergate supporters had been neglected in press coverage. According to the BBC, the technology writer Allum Bokhari said that a \"well-known trolling group\" was \"working to provoke both sides against each other\".\n\nBomb threats have also been made towards events attended by Gamergate supporters. A May 2015 meeting in Washington D.C. arranged by writer Christina Hoff Sommers and journalist Milo Yiannopoulos was the target of a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to local police responding to information supplied by the FBI. During \"Airplay\", an event run by the Society of Professional Journalists in August 2015, multiple bomb threats were made. This led to the evacuation of the building and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nGamergate harassment was orchestrated largely through anonymous message boards such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit, particularly the \"KotakuInAction\" subreddit. \"Ars Technica\" reported that a series of 4chan discussion logs suggests that Twitter sockpuppet accounts were used to popularize the Gamergate hashtag. Heron, Belford, and Goker, analyzing the logs, said that early Gamergate IRC discussions focused on coordinating the harassment of Quinn by using astroturf campaigns to push attacks against her into mainstream view. They also describe how initial organizers attempted to cultivate a palpable narrative for public consumption while internally focusing on personal grudges against Quinn and aggressive sexual imagery. Mortensen wrote in \"Games and Culture\" that Gamergate's structure as an anonymous swarm allowed it to create an environment where anyone who criticized it or became its target was at risk, while allowing them to avoid individual responsibility for harassment.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion of self-policing and the responsibility supporters of Gamergate share when the hashtag is used for harassment. A number of websites have blocked users, removed posts, and created policies to prevent their users from threatening Quinn and others with doxing, assault, rape and murder, and planning and coordinating such threats. 4chan founder Christopher Poole banned all discussion of Gamergate on the site as more attacks occurred, leading to Gamergate supporters using 8chan as their central hub.\n\nMany Gamergate supporters have denied that the harassment took place, or falsely accused victims of fabricating the evidence. Gamergate supporters have used the term \"Literally Who\" to refer to victims of harassment such as Quinn, saying they are not relevant to Gamergate's goals and purposes. Commentators have decried the use of such terminology as dehumanizing, and said that discussions on Gamergate forums often center around those referred to as \"Literally Who\". Some Gamergate supporters have denounced the harassment, arguing that the perpetrators are in the minority and do not represent them.\n\nBy September 24, 2014, over one million Twitter messages incorporating the Gamergate hashtag had been sent. A \"Newsweek\" and Brandwatch analysis found more than two million Twitter messages between September and October 2014. Software developer Andy Baio also produced an analysis of #Gamergate tweets showing a discussion that was polarized between pro- and anti-Gamergate factions. One quarter of the tweets sampled were produced by users new to Twitter, most of whom were pro-Gamergate. While the number of Gamergate supporters is unclear, in October 2014 \"Deadspin\" estimated 10,000 supporters based on the number of users discussing Gamergate on Reddit.\n\nThe series of events that came to be known as Gamergate has been described as \"torturously complex\". As a movement, it had no official leaders or clearly defined agenda. Because of its anonymous membership, lack of organization and leaderless nature, sources differ as to the goals or mission of Gamergate and defining it has been difficult. Frank Lantz of NYU's Game Center wrote that he could not find \"a single explanation of a coherent Gamergate position\". Christopher Grant, editor-in-chief of \"Polygon\", told the \"Columbia Journalism Review\": \"The closest thing we've been able to divine is that it's noise. It's chaos [...] all you can do is find patterns. And ultimately Gamergate will be defined—I think has been defined—by some of its basest elements.\"\n\nAs the threats expanded, international media focused on Gamergate's violent, misogynistic element and its inability to present a coherent message. Bob Stuart, in \"The Daily Telegraph,\" reported that \"Gamergate has since swelled into an unwieldy movement with no apparent leaders, mission statement, or aims beyond calling out 'social justice warriors'. [...] When members of the games industry are being driven from their houses and jobs, threatened, or abused, it makes Gamergate's claim that it is engaged in an ethical campaign appear laughable.\" The campaign's focus broadened to take on other targets in the news media, as with Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media.\n\nJesse Singal, in \"New York\", stated that he had spoken to several Gamergate supporters to try to understand their concerns, but found conflicting ideals and incoherent messages. Singal observed Gamergate supporters making a constant series of attacks on Quinn, Sarkeesian, and other women, while frequently stating that Gamergate \"is not about\" them. Chris Ip of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" said that any legitimate message from Gamergate supporters regarding ethics in journalism was lost in the noise created by harassment, sexism, and misogyny. With anyone able to tweet under the hashtag and no single person willing or able to represent the hashtag and take responsibility for its actions, Ip said it is not possible for journalists to neatly separate abusers from those seeking reasonable debate. \n\nJon Stone wrote in \"The Guardian\" that readjusts and reinvents itself in response to attempts to disarm and disperse its noxiousness, subsuming disaffected voices in an act of continual regeneration, cycling through targets, pretexts, manifestoes, and moralisms\". \"Polygon\"s Grant said that Gamergate has remained amorphous and leaderless so that the harassment can be conducted without any culpability.\n\nWhile organized through anonymous message boards such as 4chan and Reddit, Gamergate harassment was most prominent on Twitter. Michael Salter, a University of Western Sydney criminologist, writes that Twitter's design and architecture was \"highly conducive\" to such abuse campaigns, allowing Gamergaters to overwhelm users' ability to individually block the large numbers of fake or \"sockpuppet\" accounts used to send abusive and harassing messages. \n\nTwitter was criticized for its inability to respond quickly and prevent harassment over the service. Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats. Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by the ease with which anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints. Robinson Meyer of \"The Atlantic\" said Gamergate is an \"identity crisis\" for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims.\n\nEarly on during Gamergate, software developer Randi Harper started the \"Good Game Auto Blocker\" or \"ggautoblocker\", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically blocked, therefore reducing the degree of harassment received. In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group \"Women, Action & the Media\" (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while arising in the wake of the Gamergate harassment, was due to general issues of the harassment of women on the Internet. In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.\n\nEarly in the controversy, posters on 4chan focused on donating to a self-described radical feminist group called The Fine Young Capitalists (TFYC), who had been embroiled in a dispute with Quinn over a female-only game development contest they had organized. Advocating donations to help TFYC create the game, posters on 4chan's politics board argued that such donations would make them \"look really good\" and would make them \"PR-untouchable\".\n\nTo respond to widespread criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended to show that Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed as a way to \"demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism\". Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be sockpuppets that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods. Quinn said that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, \"#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign once people started calling it misogynistic\". Arthur Chu wrote that the hashtag was an attempt to leverage white guilt and to prevent allies from supporting the people being attacked by Gamergate.\n\nGamergate supporters were critical of the wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose from a list of target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser. Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.\n\nGamergate became associated with the \"Sad Puppies\" and \"Rabid Puppies\" during 2015 Hugo Awards for science fiction writing. These groups organized voting blocs that dominated the 2015 Hugo Awards. The campaign was described as a backlash against the increasing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in science fiction. Members of the bloc said that they sought to counteract what they saw as a focus on giving awards based on the race, ethnicity, or gender of the author or characters rather than quality, and bemoaning the increasing prominence of what they described as 'message' fiction with fewer traditional \"zap gun\" sciencefictional trappings. By 2018, the Sad Puppies had diminished visibility, and Quinn's 2017 memoir, \"\", was nominated for the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Related Work (for non-fiction works related to science fiction or fantasy).\n\nThe most active Gamergate supporters or \"Gamergaters\" said that Gamergate was a movement for ethics in games journalism and that any harassment of women was done by others not affiliated with Gamergate. They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues, leading to conflicts of interest. Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as \"Depression Quest\" and \"Gone Home\", which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional AAA games as downplayed. Journalists who did not cover the examination into Quinn's private life were accused of conspiracy, and a blacklist circulated by Gamergate supporters.\n\nObservers in the media have largely rejected these claims as baseless. Chris Ip of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" wrote that \"many criticisms of press coverage by people who identify with Gamergate [...] have been debunked\" and concluded that \"at core, the movement is a classic culture war\". Writing in \"Vox\", Todd VanDerWerff said that \"[e]very single question of journalistic ethics Gamergate has brought up has either been debunked or dealt with\". According to Leigh Alexander, then editor-at-large of \"Gamasutra\", the ethics concerns were a conspiracy theory, albeit a sincere one; Alexander writes that there is nothing unethical about journalists being acquainted with those they cover and that meaningful reporting requires journalists to develop professional relationships with sources. \"Ars Technica\", \"Vox\", and \"Wired\", among others, stated that discussions of gender equality, sexism and other social issues in game reviews present no ethical conflict.\n\nSeveral writers who attempted to understand Gamergate's motivations concluded that, rather than relating to purported issues with gaming journalism ethics, Gamergate represented an effort to suppress opposing views. Salter writes that \"mass media had a decisive role in evaluating the competing claims of Gamergate and its critics, and ultimately dismissing Gamergate as a misogynist abuse campaign\". Screenshots of 4chan boards, collected and published by Quinn, suggested that complaints about ethics in games journalism were invented \"post hoc\" by Gamergaters to distract critics from their ongoing abuse of her. Jay Hathaway wrote at \"Gawker\" that this strategy emerged once Gamergaters found that harassing Quinn about her sexual history was unlikely to win them support; according to Hathaway, IRC chat logs showed that \"the [Gamergate] movement was focused on destroying Zoë Quinn first, reforming games reporting second\".\n\nOther commentators argued that Gamergate had the potential to raise significant issues in gaming journalism, but that the wave of misogynistic harassment and abuse associated with the hashtag had poisoned the well, making it impossible to separate honest criticism from sexist trolling. Visible support for Gamergate in the form of tweets, online videos, and blogs seldom involved discussion of ethics, but often featured misogynistic and/or racist commentary. The targets were mainly female game developers, academics, and writers.\n\nResearchers at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University described Gamergate as a \"vitriolic campaign against Quinn that quickly morph[ed] into a broader crusade against alleged corruption in games journalism\" which involved considerable abuse and harassment of female developers and game critics. Concerns have also been raised when juxtaposing the behavior of Gamergate supporters with their claimed message: Dr. Kathleen Bartzen Culver, a professor and media ethics expert at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, wrote that while Gamergate supporters claimed to be interested in journalism ethics, their \"misogynistic and threatening\" behavior belied this claim. \"Much of the conversation—if I can even call it that—has been a toxic sludge of rumor, invective, and gender bias. The irony comes from people who claim to be challenging the ethics of game journalists through patently unethical behavior.\"\n\nAfter analyzing a sample of tweets related to Gamergate, \"Newsweek\" concluded that it was primarily about harassment rather than ethics, stating that the sample \"suggests that [...] contrary to its stated goal, Gamergate spends more time tweeting negatively at game developers than at game journalists\". Casey Johnston wrote for \"Ars Technica\" that, based on logs from the 4chan users who initially pushed Gamergate into the spotlight, the goal behind the hashtag campaign was to \"perpetuate misogynistic attacks by wrapping them in a debate about ethics\". An academic analysis of a week's worth of public posts tagged with #Gamergate found that the issue publics involved were not \"only or even primarily\" concerned with ethics in gaming journalism.\n\nIn an interview with Anita Sarkeesian in \"The Guardian\", Jessica Valenti said that \"the movement's much-mocked mantra, 'It's about ethics in journalism was seen by others as \"a natural extension of sexist harassment and the fear of female encroachment on a traditionally male space\". Sarkeesian asked, \"if this 'movement' was about journalism, why wasn't it journalists who had to deal with a barrage of rape and death threats?\". Wu told \"The Boston Globe\" that the ethics claims were \"a pretext\" and described Gamergate as \"an actual hate group [...] they're upset and threatened by women who are being very outspoken about feminism\".\n\nGamergate has been criticized for focusing on women, especially female developers, while ignoring many large-scale journalistic ethics issues. Alex Goldman of NPR's \"On the Media\" criticized Gamergate for targeting female indie developers rather than AAA games publishers, and said claims of unethical behavior by Quinn and Sarkeesian were unfounded. In \"Wired\", Laura Hudson found it telling that Gamergate supporters concentrated on impoverished independent creators and critics, and nearly exclusively women, rather than the large game companies whose work they enjoyed. \"Vox\" writer Todd VanDerWerff highlighted an essay written by game developer David Hill, who said that corruption, nepotism, and excessive commercialism existed in the gaming industry, but that Gamergate was not addressing those issues. Adi Robertson, of \"The Verge\", commented on the long-standing ethical issues gaming journalism has dealt with, but that most Gamergate supporters did not seem interested in \"addressing problems that don't directly relate to feminist criticism or the tiny indie games scene\".\n\nIn mid-September 2014, Milo Yiannopoulos, vocal critic of feminism and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from a mailing list for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the Breitbart News website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the mailing list as evidence of collusion among journalists. The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn in response to the harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate. Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest. Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.\n\nObservers have generally described Gamergate as part of a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games. \"The Washington Post\"s digital culture writer Caitlin Dewey said that \"Whatever Gamergate may have started as, it is now an Internet culture war\" between predominantly female game developers and critics advocating for greater inclusion, and \"a motley alliance of vitriolic naysayers\" opposed to such changes. \"Vox\" said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women. \"Ars Technica\" quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn.\n\nGamergate has been described as being driven by antifeminist ideologies. Some supporters have denied this, but acknowledge that there are misogynistic voices within Gamergate. Antonsen, Ask, and Karlstrom wrote in \"Nordic Journal of Science and Technology Studies\" \"in the case of #gamergate, it is the explicit goal of many of the participants to exclude groups of people, particularly women, from the debate and from the game industry and limit women's rights as citizens.\" Jon Stone, in \"The Guardian\", called it a \"swelling of vicious right-wing sentiment\" and compared it to the men's rights movement. Commentators such as Stone, Liana Kerzner, and Ryan Cooper have said that the controversy is being exploited by right-wing voices and by conservative pundits who had little interest in gaming. Chrisella Herzog states that in addition to violent sexism, Gamergate has virulent strains and violent sentiments of homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and neo-Nazism. Some figures associated with Gamergate went on to become components of the so-called alt-right, which thus featured in the 2016 American presidential election.\n\nQuinn said the campaign had \"roped well-meaning people who cared about ethics and transparency into a pre-existing hate mob\", and urged industry publishers and developers to condemn the hashtag. She further asked those Gamergate supporters who had any earnest discussion about ethics to move away from the \"Gamergate\" tag.\n\nGamergate is often considered to be a reaction to the changing cultural identity of the \"gamer\". As video games grew in mainstream popularity during the 1990s, a \"gamer\" identity emerged around games marketed to an audience that was predominantly young, male and heterosexual. Over the years, the growing popularity of games expanded that audience to include many who did not fit the traditional gamer demographic, particularly women. Games with artistic and cultural themes grew in popularity, and independent video game development made these games more common, while mobile and casual games expanded the scope of the industry beyond the traditional gamer identity. The games most popular with typical \"gamers\", often featuring explicit violence along with exaggerated gender stereotypes, were joined by a more diverse set of games that included gay, lesbian, and transgender themes. \"Indie\" gaming blogs and websites were created to comment on these developments, in contrast to the more established gaming press, which was traditionally dependent on the games industry itself.\n\nThe media-studies scholar Adrienne Massanari writes that Gamergate is a direct response to such changes in video-game content as well as changes in the demographics of players. Surveys by the Entertainment Software Association in 2014 and 2015 showed that video-game players were between 44% and 48% female, with an average age of thirty-five. This broader audience began to question some assumptions and tropes that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw write that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men might eventually be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences. Gamergaters often dismiss such games and their more diverse, casual group of players as being not \"real\" games or gamers. Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" said that some of Gamergaters' concerns were rooted in a view of video games as \"appliances\" rather than art, that should be reviewed based on feature checklists rather than traditional artistic criteria. Chris Suellentrop of \"The New York Times\" criticized resistance to innovative uses of the gaming medium, and the belief that increased coverage and praise of artistic games like \"Gone Home\" would negatively affect blockbuster games such as \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\nGamergate is particularly associated with opposition to the influence of so-called \"social justice warriors\" in the gaming industry and media, who are perceived as a threat to traditional gaming culture. As the video-game market grew more diverse, cultural critics became interested in issues of gender representation and identity in games. One prominent feminist critic of the representation of women in gaming is Anita Sarkeesian, whose \"Tropes vs. Women in Video Games\" project is devoted to female stereotypes in games. Her fund-raising campaign and videos were met with hostility and harassment by some gamers. Further incidents raised concerns about sexism in video gaming. Prior to August 2014, escalating harassment prompted the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) to provide support groups for harassed developers and to begin discussions with the FBI to help investigate online harassment of game developers. In an interview on Comedy Central's program \"The Colbert Report\", Sarkeesian said she believes women are targeted because they are \"challenging the status quo of gaming as a male-dominated space\".\n\nIn late August 2014, shortly after the initial accusations against Grayson and harassment of Quinn, several gaming sites published opinion essays on the controversy that focused on the growing diversity of gaming and the mainstreaming of the medium, some of which included criticism of sexism within gamer culture. These so-called \"gamers are dead\" articles were seen as part of a conspiracy to undercut traditional gamer identity and were used by participants to rally support for Gamergate. \"Slate's\" David Auerbach and \"The Sentinel's\" David Elks criticized these articles for alienating their publications' audience by attacking the gamer identity. Writing for \"Paste\", L. Rhodes said the antagonism in the Gamergate controversy was a result of the industry seeking to widen its customer demographic instead of focusing on core gamers, which Rhodes says \"is precisely what videogames needed\". Brendan Keogh of \"Overland\" stated that Gamergate \"does not represent a marginalised, discriminated identity under attack so much as a hegemonic and normative mainstream being forced to redistribute some of its power\".\n\nGamergate has been described as an expression of sexism and misogyny within gaming culture; its main themes are criticism of feminism and so-called \"social justice warriors\", who are perceived as a threat to traditional video games. Women's greater visibility in the gaming industry has seen a corresponding rise in gendered harassment and intimidation directed at them. Among mainstream journalists, the harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate is considered emblematic of this surge of online misogyny. According to Sarah Kaplan of \"The Washington Post\", \"sexism in gaming is a long-documented, much-debated but seemingly intractable problem\", and became the crux of the Gamergate controversy. Jaime Weinman writing in \"Maclean's\" said, \"[w]hether it was supposed to be or not, GamerGate is largely about women\". Discussing Gamergate on her ESPN blog, Jane McManus compared the misogyny that women in the gaming industry experience to that faced by the first women entering sporting communities. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described Gamergate as \"something that we need to stand clearly against\".\n\nSexism and misogyny had been identified as problems in the video game industry and online community prior to the events of Gamergate. Sarkeesian considered that the Internet has a \"boys'-locker-room feel\" to it, with male users trying to show off to each other which causes escalating cases of harassment in situations like Gamergate. In March 2014, game designer Cliff Bleszinski wrote a blog post commenting on the \"latent racism, homophobia and misogyny\" that existed within the online gaming community. In a November 2014 interview with \"Develop\", Wu said the game industry \"has been a boys' club for 30 years\", and that the common portrayal of women as \"sex symbols and damsels in distress\" in video games has led to the players taking the same attitudes. Brendan Sinclair, writing for \"GamesIndustry.biz\", stated that the events of the Gamergate controversy were \"reprehensible and saddening\" and \"this industry has some profound issues in the way it treats women\".\n\nMany commentators have said that the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Lisa Nakamura, a professor of digital studies at the University of Michigan, wrote that Gamergate \"showed the world the extent of gaming's misogyny\". Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for \"The Daily Beast\" accused the video game world of being \"thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm\" with hate on any \"random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext\". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a \"Teen Titans\" cover and to a community manager of the \"Mighty No. 9\" game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"DayZ\". In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that \"[b]efore [Gamergate] had a name, it was nothing but trying to get me to kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. [...] There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone.\" Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to \"fundamentally distort who she is\".\n\nTargets of Gamergate supporters have overwhelmingly been women, even when men were responsible for the supposed wrongdoings. Writing in \"The New Yorker\", Simon Parkin observed that Quinn was attacked while the male journalist who was falsely accused of reviewing her work favorably largely escaped, revealing the campaign as \"a pretense to make further harassment of women in the industry permissible\". In \"The New York Times\", Chris Suellentrop said that a petition sought to have a female colleague fired for criticizing the portrayal of women in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", while he and many other male critics raised similar concerns but did not face similar reprisals. Most commentators have described Gamergate as consisting largely of white males, though some supporters have said that it includes a notable percentage of women, minorities and LGBT members.\n\nCritics of the movement have described it as a kind of misogynistic terrorism. Writing in \"The Week\", Ryan Cooper called the harassment campaign \"an online form of terrorism\" intended to reverse a trend in gaming culture toward increasing acceptance of women, and stated that social media platforms need to tighten their policies and protections against threats and abuse. Speaking on Iowa Public Radio, academic Cindy Tekobbe said the harassment campaign was intended to drive women from public spaces and intimidate them into silence. Prof. Joanne St. Lewis of the University of Ottawa stated that Gamergate's harassment and threats should be considered acts of terrorism as the perpetrators seek to harm women and to prevent them from speaking back or defending others.\n\nThough \"Newsweek\" reported that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed, and parts of the FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 due to a lack of leads. Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce. In June 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled in \"Elonis v. United States\" that harassing messages sent online are not necessarily true threats that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to \"Pacific Standard\", this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment. However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be treated the same as threats made in other forms of communication.\n\nWu has expressed her frustration over how law enforcement agencies have responded to the threats that she and other women in the game industry have received. On public release of the FBI's case files on Gamergate, Wu said she was \"livid\", and that \"Only a fraction of information we gave the FBI was looked into. They failed on all levels.\"The lack of legal enforcement contributes towards the harassers' ability to maintain these activities without any risk of punishment, according to Chrisella Herzog of \"The Diplomatic Courier\"; at worst, harassers would see their social media accounts suspended but are able to turn around to register new accounts to continue to engage.\n\nU.S. Representative Katherine Clark, one of whose constituents was Brianna Wu, called for a stronger response from law enforcement to online abuse, partly as a result of advocacy by the women targeted by Gamergate. On March 10, 2015, Clark wrote a letter to the House Appropriations Committee asking it to call on the Justice Department to crack down on the harassment of women on the internet, saying the campaign of intimidation associated with Gamergate had highlighted the problem. She asked the U.S. Department of Justice to \"prioritize\" online threats against women, saying, \"We do not think this a harmless hoax. We think this has real-life implications for women\". Clark also hosted a Congressional briefing on March 15, along with the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus to review issues of cyberstalking and online threats; during the briefing, Quinn spoke of her experiences with Gamergate, which an executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence described during the hearing as \"an online hate group [...] which was started by an ex-boyfriend to ruin [Quinn's] life\". On May 27, the United States House of Representatives formally supported Clark's request for increased measures to combat online abuse against women, explicitly pressing for more investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice. On June 2, Rep. Clark introduced the \"Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act of 2015\" to Congress. The bill would have allocated more funding for the FBI to employ additional agents to enforce laws against cyberstalking, online criminal harassment, and threats. Two years later, in June 2017, Rep. Clark introduced the \"Online Safety Modernization Act of 2017\" with co-sponsors Reps. Susan Brooks (Indiana) and Pat Meehan (Pennsylvania), which combined several of Clark's previous bills. The bill focused on penalizing \"cybercrimes against individuals\", including doxing, swatting, and sextortion, as well as granting $20 million for law enforcement training to help tackle such crimes, and $4 million to establish the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals in order to study and collect statistics and information related to these crimes.\n\nThe harassment of Quinn, Sarkeesian, Wu, and others led prominent industry professionals to condemn the Gamergate attacks for damaging the video gaming community and the public perception of the industry. \"Vanity Fair\"s Laura Parker stated that the Gamergate situation led those outside of the video game industry to be \"flooded with evidence of the video-game community as a poisonous and unwelcoming place\", furthering any negative views they may have had of video games. Independent game developer Andreas Zecher wrote an open letter calling upon the community to take a stand against the attacks, attracting the signatures of more than two thousand professionals within the gaming industry. Many in the industry saw the signatures \"as proof that the people sending vicious attacks at Quinn and Sarkeesian weren't representative of the video game industry overall\". Writing for \"The Guardian\", Jenn Frank described the tactics used in the harassment campaign and the climate of fear it generated through its attacks on women and their allies, concluding that this alienating and abusive environment would harm not only women but also the industry as a whole. Frank herself received significant harassment for writing this article, and announced an intention to quit games journalism as a result. Games designer Damion Schubert wrote that Gamergate was \"an unprecedented \", and that silencing critiques of games harms games developers by depriving them of feedback. Several video game developers, journalists, and gamers from across various gender, racial, and social backgrounds adopted new Twitter hashtags, such as #INeedDiverseGames, #StopGamergate2014 and #GamersAgainstGamergate, to show solidarity with the people targeted by the harassment and their opposition to the reactionary messages from Gamergate supporters.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation characterized Gamergate as a \"magnet for harassment\", and notes the possible financial risk for companies dealing with it on social media platforms. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that \"[t]here is no place in the video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats\". ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future. At BlizzCon 2014, Blizzard Entertainment president and co-founder Mike Morhaime denounced recent harassment; blaming a \"small group of people [who] have been doing really awful things\" and \"tarnishing our reputation\" as gamers. He called on attendees to treat each other with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate. CEOs of both the American and European branches of Sony Computer Entertainment, Shawn Layden and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony. The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.\n\nResponses to Gamergate have encouraged the video game industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them. Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a \"Diversity in Technology\" program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at increasing the number of women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in announcing the program that \"it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent\". Electronic Arts (EA) COO Peter Moore said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling \"Fortune\" \"[i]f there's been any benefit to Gamergate, [...] I think it just makes us think twice at times\". Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the \"Seattle Times\", IGDA executive director Kate Edwards said, \"Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, \"We need to stop this. This has got to change.\"\n\nThe Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 included markedly more female protagonists in these new games, as well as more visible presence by women at the event. Some commentators characterized this as a response to Gamergate and a rejection of the misogynistic Gamergate harassment.\n\nThe game \"\" references Gamergate with hashtag, #CrusaderGate, which the Riddler uses to unsuccessfully try to rally the Internet against Batman; bemoaning its failure, the Riddler describes those who use the hashtag as \"idiotic and easily roused rabble\".\n\n\"\", an episode of the crime television series \"\", portrays a fictionalized version of the Gamergate controversy, including a character whom some observers said resembled Sarkeesian and whose story seemed based on those of women subject to the harassment campaign. The 2015 documentary film \"GTFO\" analyzed issues of sexism and harassment in video gaming. The film's director, Shannon Sun-Higginson, stated Gamergate was \"a terrible, terrible thing, but it's actually symptomatic of a wider, cultural, systemic problem\". The Gamergate situation was covered as part of a larger topic of online harassment of women in the June 21, 2015, episode of \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\". The impact of the Gamergate controversy on Brianna Wu was the subject of the March 16, 2016, episode of \"The Internet Ruined My Life\".\n\nIn January 2015, Quinn and Alex Lifschitz created the Crash Override Network, a private group of experts who provide free support and counsel to those that have been harassed online, including as a result of Gamergate, and to work with law authorities and social media sites in response to such threats. Software developer Randi Harper founded a similar group, the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative, a non-profit organization that also seeks to provide aid to those harassed online.\n\nAnita Sarkeesian was named as one of \"Time\" magazine's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet in March 2015, and later in the magazine's Top 100 Most Influential People of 2015, in recognition of her role in highlighting sexism in the video game community in the wake of the Gamergate controversy. She was also highlighted as one of \"Cosmopolitan\"s fifty \"Internet's Most Fascinating\" in a 2015 list due to her efforts to curb online harassment.\n\nAn on-line abuse panel (itself the subject of controversy) at the 2016 SXSW festival said that there was no technological solution to the problem of harassment given human nature; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific. Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for Women's History Month, President of the United States Barack Obama said that \"We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes.\" Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. \"And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it\".\n\n"}
{"id": "6558004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6558004", "title": "Gay Science", "text": "Gay Science\n\nGay Science: The Ethics of Sexual Orientation Research is a 1997 book about scientific research on sexual orientation by the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy. The book received positive reviews, crediting Murphy with providing a useful discussion of the ethical implications of sexual orientation research, including the work of scientists such as the neuroscientist Simon LeVay and the geneticist Dean Hamer, and with convincingly criticizing the philosopher John Finnis. However, some reviewers criticized his style of writing.\n\nMurphy, a philosopher, discusses scientific research on sexual orientation, including homosexuality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality. He aims to provide \"an ethical overview of sexual orientation research and, more specifically, the meaning of that research for gay people.\" He argues in favor of the use of the terms \"homoeroticism\" and \"heteroeroticism\" in place of \"homosexuality\" and \"heterosexuality\" respectively, maintaining that the latter set of terms are misleading. He discusses the work of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, including Freud's views on homosexuality, and the views of the philosopher Michel Foucault. He evaluates the work and views of scientists such as the neuroscientist Simon LeVay, the geneticist Dean Hamer, and J. A. Y. Hall, as well as the work of the psychoanalysts Irving Bieber and Charles Socarides, the psychologists Alan P. Bell, J. Michael Bailey, Doreen Kimura, and Joseph Nicolosi, and the sociologist Martin S. Weinberg. He also discusses the views on homosexuality of the philosopher John Finnis.\n\n\"Gay Science\" was first published by Columbia University Press in 1997.\n\n\"Gay Science\" received positive reviews from James Edward Van Buskirk in \"Library Journal\" and R. W. Smith in \"Choice\" and a mixed review from the biologist Ruth Hubbard in \"The Times Literary Supplement\". The book was also reviewed by the gay writer Gabriel Rotello in \"New Scientist\".\n\nVan Buskirk described the book as an \"important addition to the field\" and a useful complement to LeVay's \"Queer Science\" (1996). He credited Murphy with providing an objective account of sexual orientation research and its ethical implications. Smith credited Murphy with providing a \"carefully detailed\" and \"meticulously logical\" analysis of the moral implications of research into the causes of homosexuality. However, he also described the book as \"somewhat repetitious\".\n\nHubbard credited Murphy with addressing \"a range of interesting questions about the purpose and uses of scientific research\" into homosexuality, but criticized his writing, calling it \"convoluted and ponderous\". She also criticized him for writing \"as though ethics and moral philosophy exist outside politics\", arguing that \"the power relationships that determine what science gets done also circumscribe the extent to which it is done ethically\" and that if \"scientific inquiring takes place in a context in which its results are certain to be misused, then the ethical innocence it may have in other contexts becomes irrelevant\".\n\n\"Gay Science\" received a positive review from the psychiatrist Vernon Rosario in \"The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review\". Rosario described the book as a \"welcome addition to the debate\" on biological research on homosexuality, and credited Murphy with providing \"a scientifically well-informed and balanced review of the recent research and its possible ethical implications\" and with being \"well-versed in the basic science and cognizant of the enormous theoretical and methodological impediments to doing sound research in this area.\" He agreed with him that it is reasonable to hypothesize that homosexuality might have a biological basis, but considered him overly optimistic in believing that research into that possibility would benefit gay people. He commented that, \"it seems unlikely that biological research on homosexuality will easily shake off its 150-year-old association with the pathologization of same-sex love\", and noted that all of the sexual orientation research Murphy discussed was actually concerned specifically with homosexuality. He wrote that while Murphy discussed hypothetical scenarios in which it became possible for scientists to manipulate \"sexual orientation in utero or in adults\", his \"countless scenarios seem contrived and belabored\". He described Murphy's view that adults should be free to have their sexual orientation changed through biological manipulation and that \"mothers would have the right to abort fetuses that tested positive for homosexuality\", if either of these things ever became possible, as \"disturbing\", but also difficult to argue against.\n\n\"Gay Science\" received positive reviews from Mark Chekola in \"Bioethics\", the philosopher Michael Ruse in the \"British Journal for the Philosophy of Science\", and Daniel Wolfe in \"Culture, Health & Sexuality\", and a mixed review from the sex researcher James D. Weinrich in \"Human Biology\". The book was also reviewed by the psychiatrist Susan Bradley in \"The New England Journal of Medicine\", the philosopher Udo Schüklenk in \"JAMA\", the philosopher David Hull in \"The Quarterly Review of Biology\", the philosopher Sandra Harding in the \"Journal of Homosexuality\", and the feminist scholar Martha McCaughey in \"Science, Technology, & Human Values\".\n\nChekola described the book as \"an admirable exploration of issues related to research on sexual orientation and possible applications of such research\". He credited Murphy with being the first person to write a comprehensive work examining these issues, calling him \"extremely thorough and exhaustive\". He also credited Murphy with carefully discussing the limitations of research by LeVay, Bailey, Hamer, Hall, Kimura, and Nicolosi. He wrote that while Murphy's speculation that science might develop means of preventing or altering homosexuality, and that the number of gay people would be diminished as a result, might seem \"odd and chilling\", it was \"an interesting exercise in looking at the implications scientific knowledge might have for people's choices that could result in a minority's becoming smaller, a concern not limited to gay and lesbian people.\" However, he also wrote that Murphy's thoroughness would probably limit his audience to academics, and that \"Many undergraduates would likely get lost at various points in the book.\"\n\nRuse credited Murphy with having \"a deep and sensitive knowledge of the appropriate areas of science\", being \"able to write clearly and distinctly about difficult issues, so that one can follow without any trouble the sorts of points that he wants to make\", and providing good discussions of the work of researchers such as LeVay. He wrote that Murphy's book made his own work \"\" (1988) in \"many respects ... dated and redundant.\" He agreed with Murphy's defense of inquiry into the origins of sexual orientation. He found Murphy's discussion of attempts by parents to control the sexual orientation of their children interesting, but disputed Murphy's conclusion that parents would have the right to engage in such attempts, arguing that rather than granting them that right it would be better \"to change societal attitudes about homosexuality so that people do not show prejudice against homosexuals.\" He found Murphy's discussion of laws about homosexuality interesting, but questioned whether Murphy provided \"anything which is deeply grounded in a well thought-out philosophy of law\". He also questioned whether Murphy was right to devote attention to the issue of whether it is possible or desirable to change a person's sexual orientation and noted that, \"Murphy seems to have virtually no time or interest in Freud's work, even though a mere twenty years ago the Freudian etiological analysis of homosexuality was considered really significant.\" He also observed that Murphy had little or no interest in discussing social constructionist views influenced by Foucault.\n\nWolfe described the book as \"invaluable for students of gay history, medicine and their intersections\", and praised its, \"Careful summary and careful citations\". He complimented Ruse for his discussions of the research of Bieber, Socarides, Hamer, and LeVay, his account of conversion therapy, and his philosophical discussion of the ethical questions involved in scientific research on sexual orientation, including the possible development of methods to prevent or alter homosexuality. He also credited Murphy with exposing the oversimplification of research such as that of LeVay by the media. Though noting that not all readers would find Murphy's ethical discussions interesting, he agreed with Murphy's criticisms of Finnis's views, while finding them obvious. He criticized Murphy for devoting too much space to discussing anti-gay views and arguments.\n\nWeinrich credited Murphy with providing a \"reasonably up-to-date review\" of scientific accounts of sexual orientation, and endorsed Murphy's criticisms of Finnis, calling them \"complete and devastating\". He also praised Murphy for helpfully addressing \"questions about the supposed naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexual desire and behavior\" and for his discussion of \"the consequences for society of his lines of thought.\" However, he described much of Murphy's discussion of the question of whether research into sexual orientation should be undertaken at all as boring, and wrote that most of Murphy's conclusions ranged \"from self-evident to uninteresting.\" He also accused Murphy of being naive in his discussion of how institutions such as the Catholic Church and the American military might respond to the development of scientific methods of preventing or detecting homosexuality, and argued that he was overly critical of sociobiological explanations of homosexuality, and sometimes showed a \"less than perfect\" understanding of biology.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "64656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64656", "title": "Hue", "text": "Hue\n\nHue is one of the main properties (called color appearance parameters) of a color, defined technically (in the CIECAM02 model), as \"the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red, green, blue, and yellow\", (which in certain theories of color vision are called unique hues). Hue can typically be represented quantitatively by a single number, often corresponding to an angular position around a central or neutral point or axis on a colorspace coordinate diagram (such as a chromaticity diagram) or color wheel, or by its dominant wavelength or that of its complementary color. The other color appearance parameters are colorfulness, saturation (also known as intensity or chroma), lightness, and brightness.\n\nUsually, colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness or colorfulness, such as with \"light blue\", \"pastel blue\", \"vivid blue\". Exceptions include brown, which is a dark orange.\n\nIn painting color theory, a hue is a \"pure\" pigment—one without tint or shade (added white or black pigment, respectively). Hues are first processed in the brain in areas in the extended V4 called globs.\n\nIn opponent color spaces in which two of the axes are perceptually orthogonal to lightness, such as the CIE 1976 (\"L\"*, \"a\"*, \"b\"*) (CIELAB) and 1976 (\"L\"*, \"u\"*, \"v\"*) (CIELUV) color spaces, hue may be computed together with chroma by converting these coordinates from rectangular form to polar form. Hue is the angular component of the polar representation, while chroma is the radial component.\n\nSpecifically, in CIELAB\n\nwhile, analogously, in CIELUV\n\nwhere, atan2 is a two-argument inverse tangent.\n\nPreucil describes a color hexagon, similar to a trilinear plot described by Evans, Hanson, and Brewer, which may be used to compute hue from RGB. To place red at 0°, green at 120°, and blue at 240°,\n\nEquivalently, one may solve\n\nPreucil used a polar plot, which he termed a color circle. Using R, G, and B, one may compute hue angle using the following scheme: determine which of the six possible orderings of R, G, and B prevail, then apply the formula given in the table below.\n\nNote that in each case the formula contains the fraction formula_5, where \"H\" is the highest of R, G, and B; \"L\" is the lowest, and \"M\" is the mid one between the other two. This is referred to as the \"Preucil hue error\" and was used in the computation of mask strength in photomechanical color reproduction.\n\nHue angles computed for the Preucil circle agree with the hue angle computed for the Preucil hexagon at integer multiples of 30° (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta, and the colors midway between contiguous pairs) and differ by approximately 1.2° at odd integer multiples of 15° (based on the circle formula), the maximal divergence between the two.\n\nThe process of converting an RGB color into an HSL color space or HSV color space is usually based on a 6-piece piecewise mapping, treating the HSV cone as a hexacone, or the HSL double cone as a double hexacone. The formulae used are those in the table above.\n\nThe hues exhibited by caramel colorings and beers are fairly limited in range. The Linner hue index is used to quantify the hue of such products.\n\nManufacturers of pigments use the word hue, for example, \"cadmium yellow (hue)\" to indicate that the original pigmentation ingredient, often toxic, has been replaced by safer (or cheaper) alternatives whilst retaining the hue of the original. Replacements are often used for chromium, cadmium and alizarin.\n\nDominant wavelength (or sometimes equivalent wavelength) is a physical analog to the perceptual attribute hue. On a chromaticity diagram, a line is drawn from a white point through the coordinates of the color in question, until it intersects the spectral locus. The wavelength at which the line intersects the spectrum locus is identified as the color's dominant wavelength if the point is on the same side of the white point as the spectral locus, and as the color's complementary wavelength if the point is on the opposite side.\n\nThere are two main ways in which hue difference is quantified. The first is the simple difference between the two hue angles. The symbol for this expression of hue difference is formula_8 in CIELAB and formula_9 in CIELUV. The other is computed as the residual total color difference after Lightness and Chroma differences have been accounted for; its symbol is formula_10 in CIELAB and formula_11 in CIELUV.\n\nThere exists some correspondence, more or less precise, between hue values and color terms (names). One approach in color science is to use traditional color terms but try to give them more precise definitions. See spectral color#Table of spectral or near-spectral colors for names of highly saturated colors with the hue from ≈ 0° (red) up to ≈ 275° (violet), and line of purples#Table of highly-saturated purple colors for color terms of the remaining part of the color wheel.\n\nAlternative approach is to use a systematic notation. It can be a standard angle notation for certain color model such as HSL/HSV mentioned above, CIELUV, or CIECAM02. Alphanumeric notations such as of Munsell color system, NCS, and Pantone Matching System are also used.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11113141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11113141", "title": "Iara (mythology)", "text": "Iara (mythology)\n\nIara, also spelled Uiara or Yara (, , , , ) or Mãe das Águas (, \"mother of waters\"), is a figure from Brazilian mythology based on ancient Tupi and Guaraní mythology. The word derives from Old Tupi \"yîara\" = \"y\" + \"îara\" (water + lord/lady) = lady of the lake (water queen). She is seen as either a water nymph, siren, or mermaid depending upon the context of the story told about her. The Brazilian town of Nova Olinda claims the Cama da Mãe D’água as the home of Iara.\n\nIara is a beautiful young woman, sometimes described as having green hair, light brown or copper-colored skin (as that of an Indigenous Amerindian from Brazil, or of a ) and brown eyes, connected to a freshwater dolphin, manatee or fish body (the Tupi word \"y\" did not have a distinct meaning, being used in general for any riverine or freshwater lacustrine place) who would sit on a rock by the river combing her hair or dozing under the sun. When she felt a man around she would start to sing gently to lure him. Once under the spell of the Iara a man would leave anything to live with her underwater forever, which was not necessarily a bad thing, as she was pretty and would cater for all needs of her lover for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is often claimed that, until the 18th century, the Iara legend was originally about an aggressive monstrous river merman known as Ipupiara (\"freshwater monster\", in Portuguese phonological rules; by that [Pre-Pombaline] time, most Brazilians still spoke ), that would readily devour fishers, rather than that of a seducing, docile river mermaid.\n\nIaras are immortal (like the nymphs of Greek mythology), but her lovers do age and die, which means that they live most of eternity alone.\n\nThe legend of the Iara was one of the usual explanations for the disappearance of those who ventured alone in the jungle.\n\nIara (or Yara) is also a very popular female name in Brazil.\n\nThe Iara is similar in nature to several other female figures of folklore from other regions such as La Llorona from Mexico and the Southwestern United States, the Colombian creatures La Patasola and the \"Tunda\" and the Deer Woman of North America. All are females who at times function as sirens leading men to their death.\n\nIn the 1969 film version of the novel \"Macunaíma\", the protagonist of the same name meets his death at the hands of an Iara. He embraces her eagerly and sees too late the blow hole in the back of her neck that gives her away as the creature she is and not the beautiful woman he mistook her for.\n\nThis physical deformity marking an otherwise perfect woman is a common theme among siren figures in the Americas but it is usually one of the feet. Deer Woman has hooves for feet, La Patasola and the \"Tunda\" have deformed feet and \"La Llorona\" is often said to have no feet by those who see her.\n\n"}

K. Jha, Prof. M. G. K. Menon, Dr Kapila Vatsyayan, Rajeev Sethi, B. K. Thapar, Martand Singh, Bilkees I. Latif, Madhavrao Scindia, and J. B. Dadachanji.\n\nIn 2007, INTACH signed a memorandum of understanding with AusHeritage, Australia's noted heritage network, to collaborate on South Asian and South East Asian regional initiatives.\n\nAmong the tasks undertaken by INTACH are restoration of monuments and their management; advocacy for heritage property conservation; public awareness through heritage walks and buses; establishment of heritage clubs in schools; and holding of awareness workshop for teachers of schools and colleges and heritage walks to various unprotected sites.\n\nOver the years, INTACH has taken up restoration and protection of hundreds of monuments that fall outside the coverage of Archaeological Survey of India and other government agencies, and at times local authorities hand over the upkeep and restoration of heritage structures to INTACH directly.\n\nINTACH has established chapters not only within India but also outside it. It now uses funds raised by its international chapters in Belgium and the United Kingdom, to take up restoration, conservation and protection projects of historical structures and heritage buildings across India.\n\nAfter developing Raghurajpur, Orissa, a place famous for its master ‘Pattachitra’ artists and ‘Gotipua’ dance troupes as a heritage village, which has now become a major rural tourist destination, it later used the same pattern to develop Padmanabhpur village, Ganjam district, Orissa, famous for its weavers and folk dancers, into another heritage destination.\n\nIn 2007, the government of Goa signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with INTACH for restoration, conservation and maintenance of 51 officially listed heritage and cultural monuments in the state. This includes the restoration and conservation of the 16th century Reis Magos Fort in Goa, then in 2008, INTACH signed anouth a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Delhi for the conservation of 92 monuments in Delhi, in the preparation of the Commonwealth Games 2010.\n\nThe INTACH Logo, based on the anthropomorphic copper figure from Shahabad, Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the enigmatic Copper Hoards of the Ganga Valley (circa 1800—1700 BC) is the perceived brand image of INTACH. The classic simplicity and vitality of its lines make it a striking example of primitive man’s creative genius.\n\nINTACH’s mission to conserve heritage is based on the belief that living in harmony with heritage enhances the quality of life, and it is the duty of every citizen of India as laid down in the Constitution of India. The objectives spelt out in the Memorandum of Association constitute INTACH’s Mandate and Vision. Its stated mission to date continues to be:\nTo achieve the above-stated mission, at subsequent Visioning Exercises further measures were spelt out:\n\nINTACH bestows the following awards:\n\nThe INTACH UK Trust, established in 1987, is a registered charity in the United Kingdom funded by the Charles Wallace bequest. The aim of this trust is to support the cause of heritage conservation in India.\n\nIts two main activities are:\n\nIn recent years INTACH has been fortunate to receive support from the central government and several state governments, corporate houses and international agencies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1523930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1523930", "title": "Intangible property", "text": "Intangible property\n\nIntangible property, also known as incorporeal property, describes something which a person or corporation can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/intellectual property. It generally refers to statutory creations such as copyright, trademarks, or patents. It excludes tangible property like real property (land, buildings, and fixtures) and personal property (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.). In some jurisdictions intangible property are referred to as \"choses in action\". Intangible property is used in distinction to tangible property. It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred). Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary extinguishment and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.\n\nGenerally, ownership of intangible property gives the owner a set of legally enforceable rights over reproduction of personal property containing certain content. For example, a copyright owner can control the reproduction of the work forming the copyright. However, the intangible property forms a set of rights separate from the tangible property that carries the rights. For example, the owner of a copyright can control the printing of books containing the content, but the book itself is personal property which can be bought and sold without concern over the rights of the copyright holder.\n\nIn English law and other Commonwealth legal systems, intangible property is traditionally divided in \"pure intangibles\" (such as debts, intellectual property rights and goodwill) and \"documentary intangibles\", which obtain their character through the medium of a document (such as a bill of lading, promissory note or bill of exchange). The recent rise of electronic documents has blurred the distinction between pure intangibles and documentary intangibles.\n\n"}

{"id": "8483187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8483187", "title": "Lida Abdul", "text": "Lida Abdul\n\nLida Abdul is a video artist and performance artist from Afghanistan. She was born as Lida Abdullah in Kabul in 1979, fled the country as a child during the Soviet Invasion and went on to live in India and Germany then the United States.\n\nHer most recent work has been featured at the 2005 Venice Biennale, Kunsthalle Vienna, Museum of Modern Art Arnhem Netherlands and Miami Cantral, CAC Centre d'art contemporain de Brétigny and Frac Lorraine Metz, France. She has also exhibited in festivals in Mexico, Spain, Germany, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Afghanistan.\n\nAbdul completed a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1997 and a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1998, both from California State University. She also completed a Master of Fine Arts in the University of California in 2000. She currently lives and works in Los Angeles and Kabul.\n\nAbdul fled Afghanistan in December 1979 with the threat of the Soviet Invasion, making her a refugee to India, Germany and the United States, and thus is an \"artistic nomad\". The Russian-Afghan conflict's history goes back to 1838. Autocratic Russia (and later the USSR) had expansionist goals, continually competing with Great Britain for Central Asian territory. Historically, Afghanistan's goals have been independence, maintenance of territory and the security of the throne. This contrasted with two great powers, Russia and Great Britain, competing for power in the Middle East. The Soviet Union and Afghanistan were \"natural allies\" during the Second World War. The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan is considered the leading event of the Cold War. Soviet presence in Afghanistan was felt strongly in infrastructure. Afghan cities, notoriously difficult to travel between, were connected with a major road system with Soviet aid.\n\nAbdul's video and performance art is described as abstract and dream-like, and she uses film techniques such as blurring to evoke the mind, as well as an \"epic scale\". Her films are politically charged and use themes of hope and renewal to suggest her war-torn home country's future of progress. While Abdul was made a refugee in 1979 after the Soviet Invasion, she was able to return to Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban to revisit her home country, film, and meet with Afghan people to talk about their hopes for the future. She considers herself a Nomadic artist, because of her life growing up involved a lot of moving country-to-country and keeping her away form her homeland Abdul uses those feelings and emotions as inspiration or motivation in her art. Abdul creates political commentary, films that speak to themes of devastation, displacement culture, identity and bodies.\n\"White House\" is a short film rich with political content. It is one of Abdul's better-known works, which was shown at the Venice Biennale. The film depicts the rubble of a classical building in a landscape set outside of Kabul. The artist films herself dressed in black, painting the rubble white. A man enters the scene, and Abdul paints his back in a similar fashion. Finally, the short, five-minute film ends with a herd of goats exploring the ruins. The film is rhythmic, and a symbol of hope and progress, as well as an act of political resistance to various injustices, such as the United States' profitable occupation of Afghanistan, the whitewashing of history, and Afghan people's psychological injury from living in a war-torn region.\n›\nTrees is a video documentary where young men discuss their reason for cutting down a tree, one that is still alive and bearing fruits. They explain their reasoning for cutting it down is because it was the site of many hangings and had to be destroyed. In the end the men cut the tree down and carried it off.\nClapping with stones is a video documentary, which contains a group of men in black \"Shalwar Kameez\" performing a prayer like ritual in front of the rock of Bamiyan. The Bamiyan contains traces of ancient Buddha's, which was destroyed in 2001 by the Taliban.\n\nBrick Sellers of Kabul is a photograph of young children in Kabul, each of them breaking a brick that they hand to a man with a shock of unruly hair and a painted expression. They are very serious and there is a sense of adulthood in the lives of each of these children. Abdul said, \"Kabul is full of kids who run in the streets, but if you knew their lives you would wonder how it is possible for them to keep going... when their laughter disappears.\"\n\nLida Abdul's work has appeared in numerous solo and group exhibitions in the Middle East, Europe and North America.\nNational Museum of Afghanistan (Kabul, Afghanistan 2007)\n\nIndianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art (Indianapolis, USA 2008)\n\nOK Center for Contemporary Art (Linz, Austria 2008)\n\nKrannert Art Museum (Champaign, Illinois, US 2010)\n\nCentro de Arte Contemporáneo (Málaga, Spain 2013)\n\nCalouste Gulbenkian Foundation (Lisbon, Portugal, 2013)\n\nForeman Art Gallery, Bishops University (Quebec, Canada, 2013)\n\nGiogrio Persano Gallery (Turin, Italy, 2013)\n\nCalouste Gulbenkian Foundation (Paris, France, 2014)\n\nCAP Center (Lyon, France, 2015)\n\"Global Feminisms\" (Brooklyn Museum, NYC, USA 2007)\n\n\"History of Violence\" (Haifa Museum of Art, Israel 2009)\n\n\"Beyond Memory\" (Museum on the Seam, Jerusalem, Israel 2011)\n\n\"Transition Project\" (Yapi Kredi Kültür Merkezi, Istanbul, Turkey 2013)\nVenice Biennale (2005 and 2015)\n\nMoscow Biennial (2007)\n\nDocumenta (Kassel, Germany 2012)\n\nLida Abdul's work has received several awards, including the Taiwan Award at the Venice Biennale in 2005, the Prince Claus Award in Amsterdam and the Netherlands in 2006, the UNESCO Prize for the Promotion of the Arts from the United Arab Emirates in 2007, and the EMAF Award in Osnabrueck, Germany in 2009, and won the Finalist Mario Prize 1, Fondazione Merz, Turin in 2015.\n\nAbdul's art also addresses the common issue of the depiction of Afghan people in the mass western media. It is common in western media to only report on Afghanistan in contexts of terror and war, and public western knowledge does not expand much beyond that image. Through her art, Abdul hopes Western people will learn more about Afghan people and cultures.\nHer works are permeated with; cultural identity, migration, psychological damage, process of destruction & displacement, and include notions of exile and homeland. Though a centrally governed country, is not unified in culture, national identity or language, though the \"lingua franca\" is Dari. Few people living in Afghanistan would describe themselves as \"Afghan\", but rather of a specific tribe living in the region and surrounding areas. Major groups include Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Baluch, each distinct and without strong feelings of national borders or identity, who spill into neighboring countries without regard for borders.\nSome attributes unite most \"Afghans\", however, with a 90% majority Sunni Muslim population. One of Abdul's goals in her films is to educate a western audience about the nature of these cultures, and how they may diverge from the assumptions that people make about Afghanistan and Afghan people due to stereotypes they may encounter in the popular media. She recognizes the tendency of western media to paint a stereotypical image of Afghanistan, and through her art, she hopes to humanize people who are often demonized. One such stereotype is an image of a nation overtaken by war and stripped entirely of culture, however, even in light of devastation, Afghan people still had the desire to create art. With the works of Lida Abdul and other artists in the forefront, a western audience is given an alternative way to see Afghanistan removed from the depictions of terror and devastated cities.\nAfghanistan is more regional than central in orientation and culture, in part because of the lack of transportation throughout the country to connect major points of interest. However, a road system connecting the three major cities was built with Soviet aid.\n\n"}

A living lab is a user-centered, open-innovation ecosystem, often operating in a territorial context (e.g. city, agglomeration, region), integrating concurrent research and innovation processes within a public-private-people partnership.\n\nThe concept is based on a systematic user co-creation approach integrating research and innovation processes. These are integrated through the co-creation, exploration, experimentation and evaluation of innovative ideas, scenarios, concepts and related technological artefacts in real life use cases. Such use cases involve user communities, not only as observed subjects but also as a source of creation. This approach allows all involved stakeholders to concurrently consider both the global performance of a product or service and its potential adoption by users. This consideration may be made at the earlier stage of research and development and through all elements of the product life-cycle, from design up to recycling. See also: Concurrent engineering\n\nUser centred research methods, such as action research, community informatics, contextual design, user-centered design, participatory design, empathic design, emotional design, and other usability methods, already exist but fail to sufficiently empower users for co-creating into open development environments. More recently, the Web 2.0 has demonstrated the positive impact of involving user communities in new product development (NPD) such as mass collaboration projects (e.g. crowdsourcing, Wisdom of Crowds) in collectively creating new contents and applications.\n\nA living lab is not similar to a testbed as its philosophy is to turn users, from being traditionally considered as observed subjects for testing modules against requirements, into value creation in contributing to the co-creation and exploration of emerging ideas, breakthrough scenarios, innovative concepts and related artefacts. Hence, a living lab rather constitutes an experiential environment, which could be compared to the concept of experiential learning, where users are immersed in a creative social space for designing and experiencing their own future. Living labs could also be used by policy makers and users/citizens for designing, exploring, experiencing and refining new policies and regulations in real-life scenarios for evaluating their potential impacts before their implementations.\n\nThe term \"living lab\" has emerged in parallel from the ambient intelligence research communities context and from the discussion on experience and application research (EAR). The emergence of the term is based on the concept of user experience and ambient intelligence (AmI).\n\nWilliam J. Mitchell, Kent Larson, and Alex (Sandy) Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are credited with first exploring the concept of a Living Laboratory. They argued that a living lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. Nowadays, several living lab descriptions and definitions are available from different sources.\n\nIn 2010, Mitchell, Larson and Pentland, formed the first US-based living labs research consortium. According to the consortium website:\n\n\"The convergence of globalization, changing demographics, and urbanization is transforming almost every aspect of our lives. We face new choices about where and how we work, live, travel, communicate, and maintain health. Ultimately, our societies are being transformed. MIT Living Labs brings together interdisciplinary experts to develop, deploy, and test - in actual living environments - new technologies and strategies for design that respond to this changing world. Our work spans in scale from the personal to the urban, and addresses challenges related to health, energy, and creativity.\"\n\nThe consortium has since been reorganized as the City Science Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe term \"living lab\" or \"living laboratory\" is also used for representing a residential home research facility where the behaviour of people living in this house is observed and usage patterns are collected by researchers that are investigating methods for merging new technologies with user-centered design. In this type of living lab, users are more observed subjects than engaged in the co-creation of ideas and breakthrough scenarios. There are examples of such research facilities like PlaceLab at MIT developed by Kent Larson and Stephen Intille and ExperienceLab at Philips Research. In the Netherlands, Utrecht University has created the Governance Lab Utrecht\n\nThe living lab process, which integrates both user-centred research and open innovation, is based on a maturity spiral concurrently involving a multidisciplinary team in the following four main activities:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1807103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1807103", "title": "Montmajour Abbey", "text": "Montmajour Abbey\n\nMontmajour Abbey, formally the Abbey of St. Peter in Montmajour (), was a fortified Benedictine monastery built between the 10th and 18th centuries on what was originally an island five kilometers north of Arles, in what is now the Bouches-du-Rhône Department, in the region of Provence in the south of France.\n\nThe abbey complex consists of six sections:\n\nThe abbey is noted for its 11th–14th-century graves, carved in the rock, its subterranean crypt, and its massive unfinished church. It was an important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, and in the 18th century it was the site of a large Maurist monastery, now in ruin. The abbey and the landscape around it were frequently painted and drawn by Vincent van Gogh.\n\nIt has been listed since 1840 as a \"monument historique\" by the French Ministry of Culture. Today the ruins of the abbey are cared for as a historic monument by the \"Centre des monuments nationaux\".\n\nUntil the late Middle Ages, Montmajour was an island, 43 meters above the surrounding terrain, protected by marshes and accessible only by boat. As early as the 3rd millennium BC the island was used as a cemetery, with individual graves carved into the rock. In the 9th and 10th centuries the island also served as a sanctuary for the local residents during invasions of the Saracens and the Normans. During the Middle Ages, several legends arose about Montmajour and its founding. One legend said that the island had been the sanctuary of St. Trophimus, who had been sent from Rome by St. Peter to convert the Gauls. After coming to Arles in 46 AD, he took shelter in one of the caves on the island and received disciples there. A rock cell under the church is called \"The Confessional of St. Trophimus.\" Until 943 the island belonged to the Church of St. Trophime in Arles.\n\nAnother legend said that the graves were those of soldiers of Charlemagne, who had fought against the Saracens. A third legend said that the first church was founded by King Childebert I, the son of Clovis, when he saw the fervor of a group of hermits on the island.\n\n\nSt. Peter's Chapel is the oldest existing part of the abbey, probably built between 1030 and 1050. It consists of a narthex and two parallel naves, the older one cut into the rock on the south side of the hill, and an arcade of rounded Romanesque arches resting on columns, creating openings to the rock cemetery. The columns are older than the church, and probably come from Roman buildings in Arles; but the capitals of the columns are carved with Romanesque floral designs. The southern nave is complete with a choir and a semi-circular apse.\n\nInside the church a passage leads to what appears to be a natural cave, with a small window, which according to tradition was the home of St. Trophimus and the first monks to live on the island.\n\nThe chapel was severely vandalized in 1976, with restoration due by 2012.\n\nThe rocky slope near St. Peter's Chapel has more than a dozen tombs cut into the rock in the shape of human bodies, with places for the head, shoulders and feet. The more recent tombs (14th century) were rectangular, and were probably covered with stone slabs. Most of the tombs are oriented with the feet toward the east, the direction of the sunrise and the Resurrection.\n\nThe Chapel of the Holy Cross (French: \"Chapelle de Sainte-Croix\") was built to contain the most valuable relic of the abbey, a piece of the True Cross. It is located a few hundred meters from the abbey church, outside the monastery walls, to provide the monks with greater separation from the crowds of pilrims.\n\nIt was dedicated on 20 April and is in the shape of a cross, with a vestibule on the north side, and four semicircular apses with semicircular domes around a square bay with a cloister vault. The vault is crowned by a perfect stone square, topped by triangular pediments and a small tower. The cornices and pediments are decorated with dentils. The building, with its dignity, simplicity, symmetry and perfect craftsmanship, is considered a masterpiece of Romanesque architecture.\n\nThe crypt of St Benedict is partly dug into the rock of the hill and partly built of massive stone walls, perfectly cut. It features a transept with two absidioles, or small chapels, and a passage which leads to a small rotunda which is crowned with a cupola. The rotunda is surrounded by an ambulatory a tall, narrow hemicircular corridor with a stone barrel vault. On its outer side, the ambulatory opens into five radiating chapels, each with its own window catching the eastern light, and its own small barrel-vaulted choir bay and semi-domed apse. The large number of small chapels allowed the large number of monks in the monastery to quickly celebrate the morning mass. \nA striking feature of the crypt is the smooth quality of the stone work- the stones are perfectly cut and fitted, and their only texture is the slight rippling caused by dressing the stone with the help of a toothed hammer.\n\nThe massive church on top of the crypt has a single nave fourteen meters wide. It was designed to have five bays, but apparently because of a shortage of funds only two bays were constructed, and the west end was left unfinished.\n\nThe nave is covered with slightly pointed barrel vaults supported by projecting traverse arches resting upon cruciform piers.\n\nThe apse, at the east end of the church, is semicircular, and has the same diameter as the width of the nave. It has an imposing semi-spherical dome with five flat ribs, and three small windows, slightly offset to one side. Perhaps because of the strong mistral and tramontane winds from the north, the nave has no windows on the north side.\n\nThe church has a relatively short transept, each wing ending in a small apsidiole.\n\nThere are three doorways on the south side of the church; one leading to the rock cemetery, one to abbot's lodging (now ruined); and one to the chapter house and the spiral stairway to the bell tower.\n\nTwo new chapels were added to the north side of the nave in the 15th century. One, which served as the sacristy, contains the 18th century lavabo, or washing basin, and the other protected the charters of the Abbey.\n\nThe cloister was built to the south of the church. It was meant to reinforce the walls of the first four bays of the church, but these bays were never built. It is rectangular, 27 meters long and 24 meters wide. In the center is a cistern which collected rainwater through pipes and channels from the roofs of the monastery buildings.\n\nThe north gallery is the oldest part of the cloister. The traverse arches are supported by brackets decorated with carvings of real and mythological beasts, including a tarasque. Some of the foliage-decorated columns show human heads looking through the foliage. The original sculpted capitals were repaired in the 19th century.\n\nAt the beginning of the east gallery is the tomb of the Counts of Provence, built to hold the remains of Count Raymond Berenger IV (died 1181). The only original Romaneque capitals are in this arcade, representing the Temptation of Christ by a small devil with flaming hair; on the other side is an acrobat performing splits, and an apple, the symbol of temptation.\n\nThe west gallery was extensively altered by the Maurist monks in the 18th century, but the brackets have some of the most vivid carvings, showing the Mistral wind, the moon, the sun and fire, and a mythical amphibious beast devouring a man. It also has 13th century graffiti depicting sailing ships and horses.\n\nThe south gallery is the most recent, and the carvings are the most realistic; a donkey, a monkey, a camel and an eagle are depicted on the brackets, and the columns show the Annunciation the crowning of the Virgin, and knights fighting.\n\nThe Chapter House was connected with the east gallery- here the monks gathered each morning to hear a chapter of the Rule of St. Benedict followed by a brief teaching on it by the abbot, and also discussed the management of the abbey. It is lit by a single oculus, or round window, and connected with the nave and by a stairway to the dormitory.\n\nThe Refectory, or dining room, connected with the south gallery through a Romanesque door decorated with a grotesque head of Tantalus,\n\nThe dormitory of the monks occupied the entire floor over the refectory, and was connected to it by two staircases.\n\nThe west gallery formerly connected to the cellar, bakery, bread oven, and guest rooms, which no longer exist.\n\nThe tower was built by the abbot and cardinal, Pons de l'Orme, beginning in 1369 to protect the abbey from the rampaging Free Company (see chronology.) The tower is 26 meters high, and contained a well and a storeroom for provisions, having three stories in the upper level. The top is equipped with battlements, arrow slits and machicolation, designed to drop unpleasant things on the heads of attackers. The coat of arms of the abbot, an elm tree with two angel-monks, is carved on the outside of the tower.\n\nThe ruined Maurist Monastery was built in the classical Piranesian style on a huge scale; the building was originally five stories high, covering eight thousand square meters, with sixty windows and two grand staircases. The monks, lay brothers and novices lived on the top two floors, with their library, classrooms and archives. The building was largely demolished after the French Revolution for its building materials (see Chronology.)\n\nThe painter Vincent van Gogh, who lived in nearby Arles, frequently painted and drew the Abbey and the landscape around it. In a letter to his brother in July 1888, he said he had been at Montmajour at least fifty times \"to see the view over the plain.\" He wrote on July 5, 1888: \"Yesterday, at sunset, I was on a stony heath, where very small, twisted oaks grow, in the background a ruin on the hill, and wheat fields in the valley. it was romantic, and couldn't be more so.\"\n\nA painting that van Gogh had done on July 4, 1888, \"Sunset at Montmajour\", long considered a fake, was authenticated and placed on display in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in September 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "12917687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12917687", "title": "Mysore literature in Kannada", "text": "Mysore literature in Kannada\n\nMysore literature in Kannada is a body of literature composed in the Kannada language in the historical Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India and written in the Kannada script. The writings date from the Kingdom of Mysore, which existed from around 1600 CE until the establishment of modern India in 1947. Many of the works of this literature written on religious themes are labeled Veerashaiva or Vaishnava in acknowledgment of the two faiths that gave form to the literature and fostered it until the advent of the modern era. Despite a gradual decline in the popularity of Jainism, authors devoted to the faith produced some works of merit. Secular themes dealing with a wide range of subjects were also written on. Kannada literature flourished for a short while in the court of the neighbouring kingdom of the Nayakas of Keladi whose territory was annexed by Mysore in 1763.\n\nDuring an age of revival and innovation, some Mysore court poets brought back the classical \"champu\" (a composition in prose-verse), a form of writing that had prevailed in Kannada prior to the 13th century, and initiated writings on contemporary history. Yakshagana, a native form of dramatic literature meant for a rustic audience, consolidated in the coastal and malnad (hill) regions in the 16th century and gained popularity thereafter, and spread to Mysore and Yelandur. The literature of the itinerant Haridasas, popular in the 15th and 16th century, was revived in the 18th and 19th century, and had a strong influence on devotionalism in the Kannada speaking regions. The \"vachana\" poetic tradition was repopularised by some poets while others wrote anthologies and doctrines based on the 12th century Veerashaiva canon. Social developments in the 19th century brought the influence of English literature and classical Sanskrit literature, resulting in the birth of modern prose, prose narrative and theatrical literature.\n\nThe men of letters in the Mysore royal court included not only the court poets, who were often quite prolific, but also on occasion the rulers themselves. In the post Vijayanagara period, a new kind of lyrical poetry, one unaffiliated with the royal court, and written by maverick-poets was gaining popularity. A wide range of metres, indigenous and Sanskritic, were popular including \"tripadi\" (3-line verse), \"shatpadi\" (6-line verse) and \"saptapadi\" (7-line verse) metres, and \"gadya\" (prose).\n\nBy the mid-16th century, Kannada literature had been influenced by three important socio-religious developments: Jainism (9th–12th centuries), Veerashaivism (devotion to the god Shiva, from the 12th century), and Vaishnavism (devotion to the god Vishnu, from the 15th century). In addition, writings on secular subjects remained popular throughout this period.\n\nJain works were written in the classical \"champu\" metre and were centred on the lives of Tirthankars (saints), princes and personages associated with the Jainism. The early Veerashaiva literature (1150–1200 CE), comprising pithy poems called \"Vachanas\" (\"lit.\" \"utterance\" or \"saying\") which propagated devotion to the god Shiva were written mostly as prose-poems, and to a lesser extent in the \"tripadi\" metre. From the 13th century, Veerashaiva writers made the saints of the 12th century the protagonists of their writings and established native metres such as the \"ragale\" (lyrical compositions in blank verse) and the \"shatpadi\".\n\nThe Vaishnava writers of the 15th and early 16th century Vijayanagara empire consisted of the Brahmin commentators who wrote under royal patronage, and the itinerant Haridasas, saint-poets who spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya using simple Kannada in the form of melodious songs. The Haridasa poets used genres such as the \"kirthane\" (compositions based on rhythm and melody), the \"suladi\" (rhythm-based) and the \"ugabhoga\" (melody-based). Overall, Kannada writings had changed from \"marga\" (formal) to \"desi\" (vernacular) and become more accessible to the commoner.\n\nAfter the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, the centres of Kannada literary production shifted to the courts of the emerging independent states, at Mysore and Keladi. The Kingdom of Keladi was centred at Keladi and nearby Ikkeri in the modern Shivamogga district. At their peak, their domains included the coastal, hill and some interior regions of modern Karnataka. Writers in the Keladi court authored important works on Veerashaiva doctrine. The Keladi territories and that of smaller chiefs (\"Palegars\") were eventually absorbed into the Kingdom of Mysore by 1763. The unique aspect of the Mysore court was the presence of numerous multi-lingual writers, some of whom were Veerashaivas. They were often adept in Telugu and Sanskrit, in addition to Kannada. The Veerashaiva monasteries that had sprung up in various regions including Mysore, Tumkur, Chitradurga and Bangalore sought to spread their influence beyond the Kannada speaking borders. Sadakshara Deva, a Veerashaiva writer, tried to rejuvenate the classical \"champu\" style of writing. The Srivaishnava (a sect of Vaishnavism) writers, who were dominant in the Mysore court, maintained a literary style that was conventional and conservative while proliferating lore and legend. A spurt in Vaishnava writings resulted in new renderings of the epics, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata and no fewer than three versions of the Ramayana. Prior to the 17th century, information about royal genealogy and achievements had been recorded mostly on versified inscriptions. Beginning with the 17th century, with the consolidation of the feudatory of Mysore into an independent kingdom, historical and biographical writings became popular. A number of such works were penned by the court poets in the 17th and early 18th century, most notably, Tirumalarya II and Chikkupdhyaya. Some of these writings would later serve as valuable research and source material for modern day historians.\n\nYakshagana (\"lit.\" \"Songs of the demi-gods\") is a composite folk-dance-drama or folk theatre of southern India which combines literature, music, dance and painting into. The best-known forms of this art are from the Dakshina Kannada, Udupi district, Uttara Kannada and to some extent from the Shimoga district of modern Karnataka. There are a variety of dance-dramas collectively termed as Yakshagana. The \"Yakshagana Tenkutittu\" (\"lit.\" \"Yakshagana of the southern style\") is popular primarily in the Mangalore region and the \"Yakshagana Badagatittu Bayalaata\" (\"lit.\" \"Yakshagana of northern style performed outdoors\") is popular in Udupi and surrounding regions. Other art forms also grouped under Yakshagana are the \"Nagamandalam\", a dance meant to appease the deity Naga, and a variety of \"bhuta\" (spirit) dances. The \"Yakshagana Tenkutittu\" is more akin to the classical Kathakali of Kerala.\n\nAccording to modern Kannada writer Shivarama Karanth, the region between Udupi and Ikkeri could be where the Yakshagana of the northern style originated. However, he noted that the earliest forms of dance-drama, called the \"Gandharagrama\", are mentioned in the writing \"Narada Siska\" dated to 600–200 BCE. This primitive form developed into \"Ekkalagana\", a term which appears in the 12th century Kannada writings \"Mallinathapurana\" (c. 1105, by Nagachandra) and the \"Chandraprabha Purana\" (c. 1189, by Aggala). According to the scholar M.M. Bhat, \"Chattana\", a native composition adaptable to singing and mentioned in \"Kavirajamarga\" (c. 850) could be considered the earliest known forerunner of the Kannada Yakshaganas. An epigraph of c. 1565 from Bellary describes a grant to a troupe of Tala-Maddale performers. The earliest available manuscript containing Yakshagana plays is \"Virata Parva\" (c. 1565) by Vishnu of Brahmavara in South Kanara, and \"Sugriva Vijaya\" (mid-16th century) by Kandukuru Rudrakavi. The earliest available edition of Yakshagana plays, \"Sabhaparva\", is dated to c. 1621.\n\nHaridasa \"Sahitya\", the devotional literature of the Vaishnava saints of Karnataka, flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries under the guidance of such saint-poets as Vyasatirtha, Purandara Dasa (\"father of carnatic music\") and Kanaka Dasa. This period, according to the scholars M.V. Kamath and V.B. Kher, may be called its \"classical period\". This literature was revived in the 18th and 19th centuries. According to musicologist Selina Tielemann, the Vaishnava \"bhakti\" (devotion) movement, which started with the 6th century Alvars of modern Tamil Nadu and spread northwards, reached its peak influence on South Indian devotionalism with the advent of the Haridasas of Karnataka. The Haridasa poetry, which bears some structural similarities to devotional songs of northern and eastern India, is preserved in written textual form but the musical compositions in which they are rendered have been passed down orally. These songs have remained popular with the members of the Madhva religious order even in the modern age. Vijaya Dasa, Gopala Dasa and Jagannatha Dasa are the most prominent among the saint-poets belonging of the \"didactic period\". The scholar Mutalik classifies Haridasa devotional songs into the following categories: \"biographical, socio-religious, ethical and ritualistic, didactic and philosophical, meditative, narrative and eulogistic and miscellaneous\". Their contribution to Hindu mysticism and the \"bhakti\" literature is similar to the contributions of the Alvars and Nayanmars of modern Tamil Nadu and that of the devotional saint-poets of Maharashtra and Gujarat. According to the scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash, about 300 saint-poets from this cadre enriched Kannada literature during the 18th–19th century\n\nAfter a break of more than three centuries, writing of \"vachana\" poems was revived. Though some poets such as Tontada Siddhalingayati (1540), Swatantra Siddhalingeswara (1565), Ganalingideva (1560), Shanmukha Swamy (1700), Kadasiddheswara (1725) and Kadakolu Madivallappa (1780) attempted to re-popularise the tradition with noteworthy pieces, they lacked the mastery of the 12th century social reformers. The most notable of the later day \"vachanakaras\" (\"lit.\" \"Vachana poets\") were undoubtedly Sarvajna and Sisunala Sherif (late 18th century). Sarvajna is known to have lived sometime between the mid-16th century and the late 17th century. Though the \"vachana\" poetic tradition had come to a temporary halt, the creation of anthologies and commentaries based on the earlier \"vachana\" canon, depicting the 12th century Veerashaiva saints as its protagonists, became popular from around c. 1400. Among well-known 16th century anthologists were Channaveeracharya (16th century) and Singalada Siddhabasava (c. 1600) who interpreted the \"vachanas\" from a purely philosophical and meta-physical context. In the Keladi court, notable works on doctrine, such as \"Virasaivadharma siromani\" (\"Crest jewel of the moral order of the Veerashaivas\") and \"Virasaivananda chandrike\" (\"Moonlight to delight the Veerashaivas\") were written. A new genre of mystic \"Kaivalya\" literature, a synthesis of the Veerashaiva and the Advaitha (monistic) philosophy, consolidated from the 16th century onwards. While the most famous writings are ascribed to Nijaguna Shivayogi (c. 1500), later day writers such as Mahalingaranga (\"Anubhavamrita\" in \"shatpadi\" metre, c. 1675) and Chidanandavadhuta (\"Jnana Sindhu\") are also notable.\n\nThe birth of modern expression in the Kannada language can be traced to the early 19th century, a transition that in later decades included the influence of English literature on local traditions. The earliest examples of modern literature came in the form of prose, either inspired by or renderings of Sanskrit classics, in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar III. The king himself was an accomplished Kannada writer to whom is ascribed the prose romance \"Saugandhika Parinaya\". Under the patronage of the king, Kempu Narayana wrote \"Mudramanjusha\" (\"The Seal Casket\", 1823), a historical novel and an innovative version of the Sanskrit original, \"Mudrarakshasa\" by Vishaka Datta. This work is considered the trailblazer in modern Kannada prose.\n\nEnglish-language education, the role of missionaries, their translation of the Bible into Kannada in 1820, the arrival of the printing press, publication of newspapers and periodicals and the earliest Kannada-English and English-Kannada dictionaries helped to modernise Kannada prose. Development of prose narrative came by way of translations of Christian classics, such as \"Yatrikana Sanchara\" (\"The Pilgrim's Progress\", 1847). Dramatic literature got its impetus from translations of Sanskrit and English classics (\"Shakuntala\" in 1869; \"Macbeth\", \"King Lear\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\"). The modern novel, with a reformist outlook, was born in 1892. This milestone was followed by the earliest social plays with similar themes, a trend that had already set roots in the modern literature of Marathi and Bengali languages. Muddanna (or Nandalike Lakshminarayana) stands out as a unique writer, whose language is Old-Kannada but whose sensibilities are modern. His two important works were \"Adbhuta Ramayana\" (1895) and \"Ramaswamedham\" (1898). The latter work is historically important to prose development – ancient epic is handled from a modern viewpoint. The narrator is the author and the listener his wife. Muddanna's declaration \"Padyam Vadhyam, Gadyam Hridyam\" (\"lit.\" \"Poetry deserves killing whereas prose reaches the heart\") summarises the trends in Kannada literature in the late 19th century.\n\nWith the waning of the Vijayanagara empire, Raja Wodeyar I (r. 1578–1617) became the first ruler of political importance at Mysore, having ousted the Vijayanagara governor at Srirangapatna. However, the fledgling kingdom still owed nominal allegiance to the diminished empire. The foundation of an independent state that would influence regional polity and culture was laid in this period. In the following decades, the Mysore court became the inheritor of the Vijayanagara literary legacy and a centre for textual production not only in Kannada, the native language, but to some extent, even in Telugu and Sanskrit. The earliest available Kannada language writings from the Mysore court are by Tirumalarya I (or Tirumala Iyengar), Raja Wodeyar I's court poet. He composed the \"Karna Vrittanta Kathe\" (c. 1600) in \"sangatya\" metre, a composition rendered to the accompaniment of an instrument. Raja Wodeyar I's grandson, Chamaraja VI (r. 1617–1637), is the earliest among the Mysore kings known for their personal contribution to the fine arts. The king wrote \"Chamarajokti Vilasa\", a translation of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in the Valmiki tradition. \n\nDuring the rule of King Kanthirava Narasaraja Wodeyar I (r. 1637–1659), the kingdom attained complete freedom, as evidenced from the issue of gold coins called \"phanams\", similar to ones issued by the Vijayanagara empire. This event was followed by a period of political expansion within modern southern Karnataka and a successful military encounter against the invading Mughal commander Ranadullah Khan. Govinda Vaidya, the most well-known poet in the royal court, wrote \"Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya\" (1648) in \"sangatya\" metre. In this eulogy, written in 26 chapters, Vaidya compares his patron king to \"God Narasimha\" (an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu). The writing also gives useful details about the kingdom, its social events, urban life, the king's court, the types of music composed by the court musicians and the instruments they used to render them. During this time, Bhattakalanka Deva, a Jain writer from Haduvalli in South Kanara excelled as a grammarian of extraordinary talent. He was the last of the three notables who wrote comprehensively on Old-Kannada grammar (Nagavarma II and Keshiraja being the other two). He was an expert in Sanskrit grammar as well. His extant Kannada grammar, \"Karnataka Sabdanusasanam\", containing 592 Sanskrit \"sutras\" (a literary form written for concision) with \"vritti\" (glossary) and \"vyakhya\" (commentary), is written in four \"padas\" (chapters) and makes useful references to contemporary and earlier writers. His work is modelled after that of earlier Sanskrit grammarians, Panini, Pujyapada and others, and is considered an exhaustive work. The author's emphasis on the importance of Kannada language and its rich literary and poetic history is evident and was meant to be a rebuttal to the attitude shown by contemporary Sanskrit scholars towards Kannada language.\n\nShadaksharadeva, who attempted to revive the classical (Sanskritised) \"champu\" metre, belonged to the Pampa tradition. A Veerashaiva by faith and the head of the Yelandur monastery, he was under the patronage of the Mysore court. A bilingual writer in Sanskrit and Kannada, his writings propagate his faith in the god Shiva. He wrote three well-known works in Kannada: \"Rakashekara Vilasa\" (1655), his best-known poetic work, written during his early days, has love as the main theme and rivals the poems in Lakshmisa's \"Jaimini Bharata\" (17th century). It is derived from a well-known devotional Tamil story of Satyendra Chola and is known to be based on an earlier work, \"Bhavachintaratna\" (c. 1513), by Kannada writer Gubbi Mallanarya of Vijayanagara. In a noteworthy piece of elegiac poetry, the poet describes the lamentation of a mother in his own inimitable style. Upon hearing the news of her son's death by trampling under the hooves of Prince Rajashekara's horse, the mother rushes to the scene, and mourns, holding the body of her son in her lap. \"Vrishabhendra Vijaya\" (1671), a poem of epic proportions, written in forty-two cantos and 4,000 stanzas, is an account of the 12th century reformer Basavanna. \"Sabarasankara Vilasa\" is a poem in five cantos narrating a popular tale of the battle between the god Shiva and the Pandava prince Arjuna. To test Arjuna's devotion to him, Shiva disguises himself as a hunter and fights a fierce battle with Arjuna. Toward the end, impressed with Arjuna's devotion, Shiva bestows on him a weapon called \"Pashuptastra\".\n\nOther notable Kannada writers in the court of Kanthirava Narasaraja I (r. 1637–1659) were Shantaveera Deshika (\"Shivaganga Charitra\" in \"sangatya\" metre, 1650), Bhaskara (\"Beharaganita\", on mathematics, early 17th century), Nanjakavi (\"Kanthirava Narasaraja Charitra\", a historical, early 17th century) and Timmarasa (\"Markandeya Ramayana\", the story of the god Rama which forms an episode in the forest section of the epic Mahabharata, c. 1650). Chamaiah, a court poet, wrote an account of his patron, King Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar (r. 1659–1673) in \"Devarajendra Sangatya\" (late 17th century), and Channarya wrote a metrical history of the same king in \"Devaraja Vijaya\" (late 17th century). Tirumalabhatta, a court poet of the Keladi ruler Hiriya Venkatappa Nayaka (r. 1586–1629) wrote the poem \"Shivagita\".\n\nThe reign of King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar (r. 1673–1704) is a high point in the early history of the Kingdom of Mysore. The king, an able warrior known to have defeated even the Marathas on occasion, held the upper hand against the Nizam of Golconda and brought the Keladi territories under his domain by 1682. An able administrator, the king was inclined towards the Srivaishnava faith. His reign produced numerous prolific writers, not the least the king himself – he was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and a composer of music. A well-known treatise on music called \"Geeta Gopala\", written in opera style and in the \"saptapadi\" metre, is credited to him. Though inspired by Jayadeva's \"Geeta Govinda\" (c. 1200), it had an originality of its own. The work differs from the original in that the god Krishna and his Gopikas are the protagonists of the play instead of Krishna and his consort Radha. The writing consists of fourteen sections, with seven songs in each section. It is considered an asset to students of music and literature. The king's other works are commentaries on the Bhagavata and the later chapters of the epic Mahabharata, a collection of devotional poems written in thirty verses (\"Chikkadevaraya binappa\", \"Kings Petition\") and composed in praise of the god Cheluva Narayanaswamy of Melkote.\n\nTirumalarya II, a native of Srirangapatna and a descendent of Tirumalarya I, was held in high esteem in the Mysore court. A childhood friend of the King Chikka Devaraja, he served as his minister. Tirumalarya II authored five notable writings: \"Chikka Devaraja Saptapadi\" (\"saptapadi\" metre, 1698), an important musical treatise rendered in seven sections comprising fifty-two songs which exalts the patron king to the level of \"God on Earth\"; \"Apratimavira Charite\" (\"History of the Peerless Hero\"), a rhetorical eulogy of the king and a treatise on poetics; \"Chikkadevaraja Vijaya\", an account of the king's conquests, his life and his ancestors, in the \"champu\" metre comprising six chapters; \"Chikkadevaraya Yaso-bhushana\"; and the prose piece \"Chikkadevaraja Vamshavali\", one of the earliest available contemporary historicals in Kannada language describing the king's ancestry. In addition, Tirumalarya II composed seventy songs, most of which are in Kannada and a few in Telugu.\n\nMinister Chikkupadhyaya (or Lakshmipathi), a native of Terakanambi town in Mysore district was a zealous Srivaishnava and one of the most prolific Kannada writers of his time. To his credit are over thirty works, mostly in the \"sangatya\" and \"champu\" metres, and \"gadya\" (prose). His best-known works are \"Vishnupurana\" (prose and \"champu\" versions, 1691); \"Divya Suri Charitre\", a history of the twelve Alvar saints; \"Artha Panchaka\" (\"Five truths\"), on saint Pillai Lokacharya; a commentary on \"Tiruvayimole\" of saint Nammalvar; \"Kamalachala Mahatmya\" (1680); \"Hastigiri Mahatmya\" (1679); \"Rukmangada Charite\" (1681); \"Satvikabrahma-Vidya-Vilasa\", treating on the Visishtadvaita philosophy; \"Yadugiri Mahatmya\", a eulogy of saint Kadambi Srirangacharya; \"Yadavagiri Mahatmya\", a eulogy of saint Kadambi Lakshmanacharya; and a collection of seventy songs called \"Shringarada Hadugalu\" in praise of his patron Chikka Devaraja (pen-name \"Chikkadevaraja\").\n\nLakshmisa, a superb story-teller, a dramatist and a Vaishnava by faith, is one of the most well-known writers of \"kavyas\" (narrative poems). Kannada scholar H.S. Shiva Prakash opines he lived in the mid-16th century, but R. Narasimhacharya and historian Nilakanta Sastri claim he was active in the late 17th century, probably during the rule of King Chikka Devaraja. His \"Jaimini Bharata\", written in \"shatpadi\" metre, is the poet's Kannada version of the Hindu epic Mahabharata and is one of the most popular poems of the late medieval age. A collection of stories, the epic poem contains the famous tale of the \"Sita Parityaga\" (\"Repudiation of Sita\"). The author has succeeded in converting a religious story into a very human tale, making it popular even in modern times. For his deft usage of the language, the poet earned the honorific \"Upamalola\" (\"lit.\" \"One of revels in similes and metaphors\").\n\nSingaraya, a brother of Tirumalarya II, wrote \"Mitravinda Govinda\" (1680), the earliest available classical drama in Kannada. It is a play inspired by the Sanskrit drama \"Ratnavali\" (\"Pearl necklace\") by King Harsha of Kannauj. Among notable women poets, Srirangamma (1685) wrote \"Padmini Kalyana\" (\"Marriage of Padmini\"), and Sanchi Honnamma, a Vokkaliga from Yelandur, wrote \"Hadibadeya Dharma\", on the duties of a faithful wife. This work, which won her many accolades, is in nine sections, containing 479 stanzas, and is written in \"sangatya\" metre. Despite being employed as a betel bag bearer and as a maid to Queen Devajammani, she claimed Alasingaraya, a court poet, her Guru. Her work narrates the struggles of women in society, and stresses their need to fulfill their daily roles in family life.\n\nOther writers under the patronage of King Chikka Devaraja were: Chidananda, a Jain poet wrote philosophical compositions called \"Tatwada Kirtanegalu\" (1675), \"Neeti Nrimaya\" and \"Munivamsha Bhyudaya\" in \"sangatya\" metre; Vaikunta Dasa (1680), a native of Belur composed \"kirtanes\" on the god Vishnu (pen-name \"Vaikunta\") and songs such as \"Kapatamata\"; Timmakavi (\"Hari Vilasa\" in \"sangatya\" metre and \"Yadavagiri Mahatmya\", 1677); Mallikarjuna (\"Sriranga Mahatmya\", 1678) and Mallarasa (\"Dasavatara Charite\")\n\nSome Brahmin writers worthy of mention from the 17th century are Ramachandra (\"Asrasastra\"), Tirumalevaidya (\"Uttara Ramayana\", 1650), Nagarasa of Pandharpur (\"Bhagavadgite\"), Timmarasa (\"Kshetraganita\" on geometry), and Venkayarya, a Haridasa of Penukonda (\"Krishnalilabhyudaya\"). Among Jains, Padmana Pandita (\"Hayasara Samuchchaya\") and Chandrashekara (\"Ramachandra charitra\", story of the Hindu god Rama) are notable. Among Veerashaiva writers, Harisvara (\"Prabhudeva Purana\"), Siddhananjesa, (\"Raghavanka Charitra\" and \"Gururaja Charitra\"), Prasabhushana (or Pemmisetti, \"Gurubhaktandara Charitre\"), Mummadi Tamma (\"Sankara Samhita\"), Parvatesvara (\"Chatuacharya Purana\") and Sejjeya Siddhalingaraya (\"Malayaraja Charite\") are well-known.\n\nA mendicant Veerashaiva poet, a moralist and a drifter whose early days are unclear, Sarvajna (\"lit.\" \"The all knowing\"), has left his indelible mark on Kannada literature and the Kannada-speaking people. He is known to have been a native of either Abbalur or Madagamasuru in the Dharwad district. Based on literary evidence scholars place him variously between the 16th and 18th centuries. Prabhu Prasad of the Sahitya Akademi feels he belonged to the 16th century while Kannada scholars R. Narasimhacharya and H.S. Shiva Prakash claim he lived in the 17th century. To Sarvajna goes the credit of re-vitalising the \"vachana\" poetic tradition. His witty and didactic poems, numbering over 2,000, were written using the simple \"tripadi\" metre. Some clues in his first fourteen of a series of poems (\"Reminiscences of Birth\") give an indication about his birth, parentage and his reasons for leaving home at an early age. His poems after the 14th focus on his spiritual quest.\n\nSarvajna, who is not known to have acquired a formal education, gained knowledge from the world, writing poems impromptu about the nature of people and places. According to the scholar Naikar, Sarvajna was born to \"sing the truth and truth alone\". His poems cover a vast range of topics, from caste and religion to economics and administration, from arts and crafts to family life and health. People from a broad spectrum of life were commented upon: \"Professionals such as priests, astrologers, sorcerers, tax collectors and accountants; artisans such as smiths, carpenters, tailors and potters; and businessmen such as oil men, money-lenders, fishermen and farmers\", all have caught the poet's discerning eye. Sarvajna reserved his compliments only for the farmers, weavers, real spiritual seekers and chaste housewives. A tomb in Hirekerur town in the Haveri district is said to be his final resting place. His poems, all of which end with his name \"Sarvajna\", constitute some of Kannada's most popular works. Sarvajna is to Kannada language what Bhartrhari is to Sanskrit language, Vemana is to Telugu and Thiruvalluvar is to Tamil. Neither was he patronized by royalty nor did he write for fame or money. His main aim was to instruct people about morality with poems such as these:\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century Mysore's independence was delicately balanced, with the incumbent kings accepting either a nominal subordination or a strategic alliance with the larger power, the Mughals of northern India, by paying tribute while keeping the Marathas (Baji Rao I) of the Deccan plateau at bay. From the 1830s, the kings also came under the sway of the powerful \"Dalavoy\" (or \"Dalwai\", Prime minister) Nanjaraja (or Nanjarajaiah) and \"Sarvadhikari\" (Chief minister) Devaraja (or Devarajaiah), the influential Kalale brothers of Nanjangud. During this period, literary contributions were made by some members of the royal family including King Narasaraja Wodeyar II, Nanjaraja and Queen Cheluvambe.\n\nYakshagana, a rustic form of theatre which draws upon themes from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata, has an established history in the Kannada speaking region of over 400 years. In its rudimentary form, the script of the play contains \"prasanga\" (poetic songs) sung by the \"bhagavata\" (musician), to which improvised \"matu\" (dialogue) is added. Witty comments are interjected by \"hasyagaras\" (clowns). Musical instruments include \"maddale\" and \"chende\" (types of drums), and a \"sruti\" (harmonium-like instrument). The \"rangasthala\" (acting arena) could be a temple compound, an open space near the patron's house or a clearing in a paddy field. The \"Sugriva Vijaya\" (mid-16th century) by Kandukuru Rudrakavi is one of the earliest available manuscripts of a Yakshagana play. It is based on the story of the ape-like humanoid king Sugriva who overthrew his powerful brother Vali to regain his kingdom in the Hindu epic Ramayana. While scholars such as M.M Bhat, Shivarama Karanth and R.R. Diwakar have proposed various theories about the origin and forerunners of the Yakshagana art, N. Venkata Rao, editor of \"The Southern school in Telugu literature\" (1960), gives the credit of writing the earliest available Yakshagana plays that include \"sangita\" (music), \"nataka\" (drama) and \"natya\" (dance) to the polyglot king of Mysore, Narasaraja II (r. 1704–1714). The king was proficient in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Prakrit. His fourteen Yakshagana compositions, written in various languages but in the Kannada script, were discovered at the government manuscripts library in Chennai. By the early 19th century, Yakshagana had become popular in Mysore and nearby Yelandur, where stage troupes were active.\n\nThe Haridasa literature propagates the \"dvaita\" (dualistic) philosophy of Madhvacharya. Their compositions have also been of immense value to the development of music and literature in general. While \"Hari\" (a form of god Vishnu) is central to their beliefs, their compositions show tolerance to other Vaishnava deities as well. By bringing the values cherished in the Upanishads (scripture) and Vedas (Hindu sacred texts) to the commoner in simple Kannada, these itinerant Haridasas made valuable contributions as \"minstrels of God\". With the passing of the Vijayanagara era, the creation of the Haridasa literature slowed down for about a century, despite attempts by two \"dasa\" (devotee) poets, Mahapati Dasa (1611–1681), who wrote 600 compositions, and his son Krishna Dasa. The tradition however recovered in the early 18th century under the able guidance of Vijaya Dasa (1687–1755), a native of Ceekalaparavi in the Raichur district. Vijaya Dasa was inspired by the establishment of the monastery of saint Raghavendra Swami (of the Madhvacharya order) at Mantralayam town. His lyrical compositions, said to be 25,000 in all, are written in the Purandara Dasa tradition with the pen-name (\"ankita\") \"Vijaya Vittala\". Most well-known among his many disciples is Gopala Dasa who wrote with the pen-name \"Gopala Vittala\" (1721–1769). Later, Gopala Dasa inspired another famous saint-poet, Jagannatha Dasa, to take to the Haridasa fold.\n\nJagannatha Dasa (1728–1809) is considered the most notable of the late-18th century Haridasas. Apart from a number of devotional songs, he is credited with two important writings. The \"Harikathamritasara\" treats on the philosophy of Madhvacharya. Written in the \"shatpadi\" metre with a poetic touch, it contains 32 chapters of 988 stanzas. The \"Tattva Suvvali\", containing 1,200 pithy and proverbial poems written in the \"tripadi\" metre, is known to have been a consolation to his widowed daughter. Among women, Helavanakatte Giriyamma (pen-name \"Helavanakatte Ranga\", early 18th century) and Harapanhally Bhimava (pen-name \"Bhimesa Krishna\", 1890) are notable despite their humble education and background. Giriyamma authored more than forty songs, and five narrative poems, the best known among which is the devotional piece \"Chandrahasana Kathe\". In a prayer poem about famine, Giriyamma wrote:\nCheluvambe, a queen of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar I (r. 1714–1732), was an accomplished Kannada writer. Her notable works include \"Varanandi Kalyana\", written in the \"sangatya\" metre. The story narrates the wedding of Varanandi, the daughter of the Badshah (Emperor) of Delhi, and the god Cheluvaraya Swamy of Melkote. In the writing, the author envisioned Varanandi to be a reincarnation of Satyabhama, the consort of the Hindu god Krishna. Her other compositions include \"Venkatachala Mahatmyam\" – a lullaby song written in \"choupadi\" (4-line verse) metre in devotion to the Hindu god Venkateshwara residing on the Vrishabha hill, songs centred on Alamelu Mangamma, the consort of the Hindu god Venkateshwara of Tirupati, and songs in praise of the god Cheluvanarayana. Shalyada Krishnaraja, a poet and a member from the royal family was proficient writer in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit. His contributions to Kannada literature include devotional songs, \"vachana\" poems, compositions in \"sangatya\" metre (\"Nija Dipika Ratna\"), \"gadya\" (\"Anubhava Rasayana\"), and \"kirthane\" compositions (\"Bhakti Marga Sarovara\", \"Gnana Sarovara\" and \"Shalyada Arasinavara Tikina Kirtane\").\n\nNanjaraja was the most noted of the Shaiva writers in the court of King Krishnaraja Wodeyar II (r. 1734–1766). For his literary taste, he earned the honorific \"Nutana Bhojaraja\", a comparison to the medieval King Bhoja. A native of Kalale town near Nanjangud, Nanjaraja came from an influential family of warriors, statesman and scholars. He was politically active and is known to have created a power centre, holding court in parallel to Krishnaraja II. He was proficient in multiple languages and authored more than twenty writings in Kannada, Sanskrit and Telugu. Among his Kannada writings, \"Kukudgiri Mahatmya\", and a musical composition called \"Aravattu muvara trivadhi\", an account of the life of 63 ancient devotees of the god Shiva, is well known.\n\nOther well-known Shaiva writers were Chenniah, who wrote in the \"sangatya\" metre (\"Padmini Parinaya\", 1720), Nuronda, who eulogised his patron Krishnaraja II in \"Soundarya Kavya\" (c. 1740) in \"sangatya\" metre, and Sankara Kavi (\"Chorabasava Charitre\", 18th century). Linganna Kavi wrote a \"champu\" historical piece called \"Keladinripavijayam\" in the 1763–1804 period accounting for the chronology and history of the Keladi dynasty. The work also gives useful information about contemporary kingdoms and states including the Nawabs of Savanur, the Marathas and the Mughals. Notable Jain writers of the period were Payanna (\"Ahimsacharitre\"), Padmaraja (\"Pujyapada Charitre\", 1792), Padmanabha (\"Ramachandra Charitre\"), Surala (\"Padmavati Charitre\"), and Jayendra (\"Karnataka Kuvalayananda\"). Vaishnava writers who distinguished themselves were Lakshmakavi (\"Bharata\" in 1728 and \"Rukmangada Charite\"), Venkatesha (\"Halasya Mahatmya\", in \"champu\" metre), Konayya (\"Krishnarjuna Sangara\"), Timmamatya (\"Ramabhyudaya Kathakusumamanjari\", a version of the epic Ramayana), Timmarya of Anekal (\"Ananda Ramayana\", 1708), Balavaidya Cheluva (\"Lilavati\", and an encyclopedia of precious stones called \"Ratnasastra\"), and Puttayia (\"Maisuru Arasugala Purvabhyudaya\", c. 1713, an account of the history of the Kingdom of Mysore).\n\nAfter the death of Tipu Sultan in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war (1799), the British took control of the kingdom. They however restored the Wodeyars in the smaller princely state of Mysore under the paramountcy of the British Raj. The British took direct control of the administration of the kingdom in 1831, after which Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar III devoted all his time to developing the fine arts, earning him the honorific \"Abhinava Bhoja\" (\"lit.\" \"Modern Bhoja\"). Krishnaraja III (1799–1868) is called the \"Morning Star of the Renaissance in Karnataka\". A patron of the fine arts, he was an accomplished writer, musician, musicologist and composer. He gave munificent grants to scholars and was a prolific writer himself. Of the over forty writings attributed to him, a prose romance called \"Saugandhika Parinaya\", in two versions (a \"sangatya\" composition and a play) is best known. In this writing, the author imaginatively narrates the story of the sage Durvasa who curses Devendra (the Hindu god Indra) to be born as Sucharitra, the son of King Sugandharaya of Ratnapuri. Devendra's wife Shachidevi takes birth as Sougandhika and marries Sucharitra. Apart from composing many devotional songs to his deity, the Hindu goddess Chamundeshwari (pen-name \"Chamundi\"), he authored three noteworthy treatises: \"Sri Tatwanidhi\" and \"Swara Chudamani\" (on music) in Sanskrit language and Kannada script, and \"Sara Sangraha Bharata\" (on dance and music), dealing with tala (rhythm) in the Kannada language.\n\nAliya Lingaraja Urs, a native of Heggadadevanakote and a son-in-law (\"Aliya\") of Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer with over fifty works spanning various genres: devotional songs, musical compositions, \"kavya\" (classical poems), over thirty Yakshagana plays, and other dramas. The author used multiple pen-names including, \"lingaraja\" and \"linganripa\". For his contributions to the fine arts, he earned the title \"Ubhaya Kavita Visharada\" (\"lit.\" \"Master of poetry in two languages\" – Kannada and Sanskrit). Among his best-known Kannada works are the poem \"Prabhavati Parinaya\" and the two versions of the classical epic \"Girija Kalyana\" (\"Marriage of the mountain born goddess\"), in Yakshagana style and in \"sangatya\" metre. The writing gives an account of the Girija, the daughter of Himavanta, her youthful days and her successful penance which resulted in her marriage to the Hindu god Shiva. Yadava, also a court-poet, penned two prose pieces, \"Kalavati Parinaya\" (1815) in the \"dandaka vritta\" (blank verse) metre and \"Vachana Kadambari\", a prose rendering of the classical Sanskrit original by poet Bana.\n\nThe Jain poet Devachandra (1770–1841), a native of Kankagiri, was in the court of Krishnaraja III and authored three noted works: \"Pujyapada Charite\", a poem on the life of the Jain saint Pujyapada in \"sangatya\" metre; \"Ramakathavatara\", the poet's Jain version of the Hindu epic Ramayana in \"champu\" metre; and \"Rajavalikathe\" (1838), a biographical account of the Mysore royal family, some earlier poets, and stories of religious importance. Another Jain writer of merit was Chandrasagaravarni, author of \"Kadambapurana\" and other works. Devalapurada Nanjunda of Nanjangud, a mere court attendant, rose to the level of a court poet for his scholarship in Kannada and Sanskrit. Among his many compositions, \"Sougandhika Parinaya\" in \"sangatya\" metre, \"Samudra Mathana Kathe\" (a Yakshagana play), \"Sri Krishna Sarvabhoumara Charitre\" in \"sangatya\" metre, and \"Krishnendra Gite\" in \"choupadi\" metre are well-known. He earned the honorific \"Ubhaya Bhasha Kavi\" (\"Poet of two languages\"). Modern Kannada prose saw its nascent beginning in 1823 with \"Mudra Manjusha\" (\"Seal Casket\"). It is an elaboration of a play summarised in the Sanskrit original, \"Mudra Rakshasa\" by Vishakadatta, and was written by Kempu Narayana, a court poet of Maharaja Krishnaraja III.\n\nEager to spread their gospel in Kannada, Christian missionaries took to the Kannada language. The establishment of the printing press and English language education had a positive effect on Kannada prose. Periodicals and newspapers were published for the first time. The first Kannada language book was printed in 1817 and the first Bible in 1820. Grammar books and dictionaries, meant to help the missionaries in their effort in spreading Christianity, became available. Rev. W. Reeve compiled the earliest English-Kannada dictionary in 1824 followed by a Kannada-English dictionary in 1832, though the best-known work is an 1894 publication by Rev. Ferdinand Kittel. Rev. William Carrey published the earliest Kannada grammar in 1817. The influence of English literature and poetry on Kannada was evident from the numerous songs of prayer composed by the missionaries. British officers Lewis Rice and John Faithfull Fleet deciphered numerous Kannada inscriptions. Rice published several ancient classics and a brief history of Kannada literature while Fleet published folk ballads such as \"Sangoli Rayana Dange\" (\"Sangoli Raya's Revolt\"). The first Kannada newspaper, \"Mangalura Samachara\" (\"Mangalore News\"), was published in Mangalore in 1843. In a few years, printing presses opened in many locations, including at the Mysore palace in 1840.\n\nA surge in the generation of prose narratives and dramatic literature, inspired by writings in English, Sanskrit, modern Marathi and modern Bengali languages culminated in original works in the succeeding decades. In the field of prose, translation of English classics such as \"Yatrikana Sanchara\" (\"The Pilgrim's Progress\" by Bunyan, 1847) and \"Robinson Crusoe\" (1857) set the trend. Translations from vernacular languages were popular too and included the Marathi classic \"Yamuna Prayatana\" (1869) and the Bengali work \"Durgesanandini\" (1885). In the genre of drama, inspiration came from translations of Sanskrit and English plays. \"Shakuntala\" and \"Raghavendrarao Nataka\" (\"Othello\") by Churamuri Sehagiri Rao (1869), \"Pramilarjuniya\" by Srikantesa Gowda and \"Vasanthayamini Swapnachamatkara Nataka\" by K. Vasudevachar (\"Midsummer Night's Dream\"), \"Macbeth\" by Srikantesa Gowda, \"King Lear\" by M.S. Puttanna, \"Ramavarma-Lilavati\" (\"Romeo and Juliet\") by C. Ananda Rao paved the way.\n\nBasavappa Shastry (1882), a native of Mysore and court poet of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja Wodeyar IX, earned the honorific \"Kannada Nataka Pitamaha\" (\"lit.\" \"Father of Kannada stage\") for his contributions to drama. His contribution to dramatic literature in the form of anthologies, translations and adaptations from English and Sanskrit, learned editions, and successful integration of musical compositions into drama is well accepted. His translations from English to Kannada include \"Shurasena Charite\" (\"Othello\"). His Sanskrit to Kannada translations include, \"Kalidasa\", \"Abhignyana Shakuntala\", \"Vikramorvasheeya\", \"Malavikagnimitra\", \"Uttara Rama Charite\", \"Chanda Koushika Nataka\", \"Malathi Madhava\" and \"Ratnavali\". Other well-known Kannada writers in Chamaraja IX's court were S.G. Narasimhacharya, Dhondo Narasimha Mulabaglu, Santa Kavi and B. Ventakacharya.\n\nThe earliest modern novels in the Kannada language are the \"Suryakantha\" by Lakshman Gadagkar (1892) and the \"Indrabayi\" (1899) by Gulvadi Venkata Rao. The later work is reformist and decried corruption and encouraged widow remarriages. Suri Venkataramana Shastri's modern social play \"Iggappa Heggadeya Vivaha Prahasana\" (\"Iggappa Heggade's farce of marriage\", 1887) and Dhareswar's \"Kanya Vikraya\" (1887) carried a similar reformist outlook while Santa Kavi's \"Vatsalaharana\" (1885) drew upon mythological and folk themes.\n\nIn 1881, the British handed back administrative powers to the Wodeyar family. Up to 1947, when the kingdom acceded to the Union of India, the incumbent Maharaja was assisted by a Diwan (Prime minister), the administrative chief of Mysore. These were times of positive social and economic change, the independence movement and modern nationalism, all of which influenced literature.\n\nKannada literature saw the blossoming of the Navodaya (\"lit\". \"New beginning\") style of writings in genres such as lyrical poems, drama, novels and short stories, with the strong influence of English literature. B. M. Srikantaiah's \"English Geetagalu\" (\"English songs\", 1921) was the path-breaker in the genre of modern lyrical poetry. The earliest stalwarts in the field of modern historical drama and comedy were T. P. Kailasam and A.N. Swami Venkatadri Iyer (also called \"Samsa\"). Kailasam sought to critique social developments by producing plays that questioned the utility of the modern education system in \"Tollu Gatti\" (1918, \"The Hollow and the Solid\") and the dowry system in \"Tali Kattoke Cooline\" (\"Wages for tying the Mangalsutra\"). Samsa's ideal king, Narasaraja Wodeyar, is the protagonist of the play \"Vigada Vikramarya\" (\"The Wicked Vikramarya\", 1925).\n\nInitial development in the genre of historical novels, in the form of translations and original works, sought to re-kindle the nationalistic feelings of Kannadigas. Venkatachar (\"Anandamatha\") and Galaganath were among the first to write such novels. Galaganath's \"Madhava Karuna Vilasa\" (1923) described the founding of the Vijayanagara empire, while his \"Kannadigara Karmakatha\" (\"Kannadigas Fateful Tale\") described the empire's decline. In 1917, Alur Venkata Rao wrote the famous \"Karnataka Ghata Vaibhava\", a summary of earlier works by Fleet, Rice, Bhandarkar and Robert Sewell, appealing to the Kannadigas to remember their glorious past, their ancient traditions and culture, their great rulers, saints and poets. Other well-known works were Kerur Vasudevachar's \"Yadu Maharaja\" describing the rise of the Wodeyar dynasty, and Vasudevaiah's \"Arya Kirti\" (1896). The tradition of novels started by Gulvadi Venkata Rao (1899) reached maturity in 1915 with M.S. Puttanna's \"Madidunno Maharaya\" (\"Sir, as you sow, so you reap\"), a historical novel written in flowing prose and whose theme is set in the times of Maharaja Krishnaraja III. To Puttanna also goes the credit for writing the earliest modern biography, \"Kunigal Ramashastriya Charitre\" (\"The story of Kunigal Ramashastri\"). The genre of short story made its initial beginnings with Panje Mangesh Rao, M.N. Kamath and Kerur Vasudevachar, but it was Masti Venkatesh Iyengar who stole the limelight with and set a trend for others to follow in his \"Kelavu Sanne Kathegalu\" (\"A few short stories\", 1920) and \"Sanna Kathegalu\" (\"Short stories\", 1924).\n\nThe efforts of these early pioneers were to become a forerunner for the golden age in the decades to follow. A long list of noted poets and writers followed: D. R. Bendre (\"Gari\", \"The Wing\", 1932) and Govinda Pai (\"Gilivindu\", \"Parrots\", 1930), perhaps the most acclaimed writers of lyrical poems that synthesised the work of the English romantics with native traditions; K. Shivaram Karanth, the noted novelist and author of \"Chomana Dudi\" (\"Choma's Toil\", 1933); Kuvempu, one of Kannada's doyen poets who showed his brilliance in using the blank verse in his masterpiece epic and magnum opus, \"Sri Ramayana Darshanam\" (1949); V. K. Gokak, a writer of drama, criticism, songs and epic (\"Bharata Sindhu Rashmi\", 1940); D. V. Gundappa, the philosopher-writer to whom is ascribed writings in just about every genre, though his most notable work is the \"Mankuthimmana Kagga\" (\"Dull Thimma's Rigmarole\", 1943), which closely compares with the wisdom poems of the late medieval poet Sarvajna.\n\n"}

Hower also had a role in \"Standing On Fishes\" (1999), and although her name appears in the end credits of this movie, her role was cut from the final version. She has had guest-starring roles in the television series \"Suddenly Susan\" and \"The Sentinel\".\n\nHower had a recurring role as Ensign Samantha Wildman on the popular sci-fi series \"\". She appeared in eight episodes spanning the series' seven-year run. Her character in the series was named after a real life 7-year-old girl who died in an accident. The little girl's parents decided to donate their daughter's organs. The ailing wife of one of \"Voyager\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writers received one of the girl's kidneys. The writer, Jimmy Diggs, decided to honor the child's memory by naming the \"Voyager\" persona after the little girl. Because the real Samantha Wildman had been fond of animals, Jimmy Diggs thus made Ensign Wildman head of \"Voyager\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s xenobiology department. During the events of the episode \"Deadlock\" (Season 2), she gives birth to a daughter: Naomi Wildman.

It is one of the few songs by Walther for which a melody has survived. \n\nThe \"Palästinalied\" was written at the time of the Fifth Crusade (1217-1221). \nIts oldest attestation is in the \"Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift\" (ms. A, ca. 1270), in seven stanzas. \nThe oldest source for the melody is the so-called Münster fragment (ms. Z, 14th century).\n\nThe subject of the song is the Christian gospel told from the perspective of a pilgrim setting foot in the Holy Land. \nThe song's conclusion refers to the crusades themselves, asserting that, in view of the claim of Christians, Jews and \"heathens\" (Muslims) to the Holy Land, the Christian claim is the just one (\"Al diu werlt diu strîtet her / Wir sîn an der rehten ger / Reht ist, daz er uns gewer\" \"All the world is warring here [in the Holy Land] / Our claim is the just one / It is right that He [God] grant it\").\n\nThe \"Kleine Heidelberger Liederhandschrift\" (ms. A) is the oldest source of the text (dated to the 1270s), giving seven stanzas. \"Codex Manesse\" (ms. C, fol 126rv, dated c. 1304) has nine stanzas.\nOther manuscripts contribute an additional four, for a total of thirteen distinct stanzas. \nOf these, one (recorded as 4th stanza in ms. Z) is clearly younger than the original composition. On the remaining five stanzas not in ms. A, there is no expert consensus as to whether they should be regarded as Walter's. \n\nThe nine stanzas in C are numbered C21–C29, the seven stanzas in A are A50–A56.\nThree stanzas are identical between A and C (C22=A51, C23=A52, C29=A56) and another have only minor differences, such as transposed word order (C21=A50, C25–27 = A53–55). The fourth and eighth stanzas in C (C24, C28) are not recorded in A.\n\nThe earliest source for the melody is the Münster fragment (ms. Z), written about a century after Walther's death.\nThe \"Carmina Burana\" ms. (c. 1230) contains the first stanza of \"Palästinalied\" (CB 211a) with neumes, which are however insufficient for reconstructing a melody. The stanza is given as an appendix to \"Alte clamat Epicurus\" (CB 211), which was to be sung in the same melody.\n\nWith the increased popularity of Medieval rock, Neofolk and related musical styles in the late 1980s and 1990s, the \"Palästinalied\" became a sort of staple song for such genres and is now well known to modern audiences due to performances by mainly German bands, including (among others):\n\n\"Palästinalied-Projekt\" is a compilation of 20 performances of the song (2002; ).\n\nThe Austrian Ensemble for Early Music recorded a reconstructionist performance of \"Palästinalied\".\n\nLou Harrison's String Quartet Set's 1st movement takes much of its melody from this song.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1972, by Alan Fletcher, Theo Crosby, Colin Forbes, Kenneth Grange, and Mervyn Kurlansky at Needham Road, Notting Hill, London. The company has offices located at London, New York City, San Francisco, Berlin and Austin, Texas.\n\nPentagram was founded on the premise of collaborative interdisciplinary designers working together in an independently owned firm of equals. Theo Crosby claimed the structure was suggested to him by his experience of working on the seminal late-1950s exhibition \"This Is Tomorrow\": \"it was my first experience at a loose, horizontal organisation of equals. We have brought it ... to a kind of practical and efficient reality at Pentagram\". The firm currently comprises 19 partner-designers in five cities, each managing a team of designers and sharing in common overhead and staff resources. The partners in each office share incomes equally and all the partners own an equal portion of the total firm. This equality, along with the tradition of periodically inviting new members to join, renews the firm while giving even the newest members an equal footing with the partners of long standing. This 'flat' organisation (there are no executive officers, CEO, CFO or board, other than the entire group) along with the self-capitalised finances of the business, allows equal participation and control of the group's destiny by the member. In 1978 Colin Forbes formed the New York office, eventually adding both graphic designers Peter Harrison and Woody Pirtle as partners. In 1990-91 Michael Bierut, Paula Scher, graphic designers, and James Biber, an architect, joined the New York office and eventually moved to a building at 204 Fifth Avenue, a building designed by C.

{"id": "37588136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37588136", "title": "Representation of slavery in European art", "text": "Representation of slavery in European art\n\nRepresentations of slavery in European art date back to ancient times. They show slaves of varied ethnicity, white as well as black.\n\nIn Europe, slavery became increasingly associated with blackness from the 17th century onwards. However, slaves before this period were predominantly white. The \"black\" in European art is not the same topic as the \"slave\" in European art: slaves were not always black and blacks not always slaves. The article also concentrates on European art rather than Western art in general.\n\nFrom the Renaissance onwards, a substantial number of bound figures, often naked and crouching, illustrate enslavement. This imagery had for one of its roots the ancient tradition of Roman Triumph, but its contemporaneous relevance was greatly magnified by the prevalence of slavery within European countries. In particular, galley slaves were often used by artists as models for muscular nude bodies.\n\nSometimes the name of an individual who was a slave is known. One instance is Juan de Pareja (1606–1670) who was a slave of Velázquez and was trained as a painter by the artist. Velázquez freed Juan de Pareja in 1650 and the document of manumission survives. Juan de Pareja became a successful artist himself.\n\nAlexandre Dumas of \"The Three Musketeers\" fame, was the son of a slave, also known as Alexandre, who rose to be a general in chief in the French army. His portrait hardly suggests his early life as a slave. He was pawned by his father who was a French nobleman but was lucky enough to be retrieved by the father and brought up in France.\n\nFrans Post (1612—1680) and Albert Eckhout (c.1610–1665) were two early Dutch painters to depict slavery. Post painted pictures of slaves working in idyllic rural landscapes which do little to reflect the harsh realities of their life. Eckhout's work is a visual record of the ethnic mix in Dutch Brazil.\n\nThe trade in black Africans was widespread in Europe long before the Triangular Trade involving Europe, Africa and the Americas. Numerous portraits of high-class Europeans show them in the company of black figures, often children, whose status may be advertised by the silver slave collar being worn. A silver collar is usually worn in conjunction with luxurious clothes and other finery, which allowed the artist to show off his repertoire and the owner of the slave to show off his or her wealth. In fact, in the 17th and 18th centuries, it was the fashion among some wealthy Europeans to have their black household slaves or servants wear silver collars; these were often inscribed with the name of the owner or employer. The slave collar is seen in contemporary paintings.\n\nChains, fetters, manacles, slave collars are the familiar iconographic markers of slavery with the broken chain being particularly useful for \"dis\"-enslavement. \n\nSlaves were chattel and so it is no surprise to see that they were on occasion branded like cattle in life and in art. Another sign of slavery, less obvious and much less gruesome, was the cropped pony tail or topknot which marked an enslaved Turk in the galleys. \n\nOften slaves were prisoners captured in war and there is an iconographical overlap between the two. Michelangelo's Dying Slave was not given this title by him. He instead talked of such figures as prisoners. The slave status of Caryatids is similarly open to interpretation. \n\nIt is not always clear from a picture that a slave or a servant or a free person has been represented. Thus, it is unknown if the portrait of Juan de Pareja were painted by Velázquez while the former was still a slave. In any case, the portrait is not an image of enslavement, even if Juan de Pareja were a slave at the time of painting.\n\nWith Abolitionism, the imagery of enslavement was turned to a social and political purpose. An instance of this is the medallion devised for the movement by Josiah Wedgwood which shows a pleading grateful black slave. People wore the medallion as a token of their commitment to abolitionism.\n\nAn example of an anti-Abolitionist image is that by George Cruikshank, \"New Union Club\". It satirises what supposedly took place at a celebrated dinner organised by Abolitionists.\n\n\n"}

Unsigned, it was commissioned by the St George Guild of Archers in Antwerp for their banqueting hall and is now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister within the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel.\n\nIt shows an ancient Roman general being crowned by Nike with laurels of victory and treading underfoot a bound barbarian and a personification of Discord (shown with snakes for hair). To his right is a genius of Harmony, who presents him with a bound bundle of arrows (symbolising peace). The figure on the right is also intended as the guardian of religion, due to the eternal fire shown on the altar beside the figure. Behind the altar is a red and white tricolour, referring to the ruling house of Habsburg and thus affirming the guild's loyalty to that house.\n\nWilliam VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel acquired the painting between 1730 and 1760 to add to his collection of Dutch paintings at the Schloss Bellevue in Kassel's Oberneustadt or upper new town. The Peace of Tilsit in 1807 made Kassel the capital of the Kingdom of Westphalia, under Jerome Bonaparte - later that year Jerome's brother Napoleon I acquired the painting and assigned it to the imperial coronation hall in Paris. In 1813 general Czerniczew forced Jerome Bonaparte to flee and negotiations began for the return of this and other paintings confiscated by Napoleon. Jacob Grimm (then a legation secretary) played an instrumental part in gaining the return of the Rubens, which occurred in December 1815.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1943, the painting was in the Neue Galerie at the Schloss Bellevue. In 1943 the painting was moved to a store elsewhere - Kassel was a target for Allied bombing and the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe was severely damaged. In 1956 the painting was moved to emergency headquarters of the Landesmuseum until in April 1974 it returned to Kassel, initially in the Corps de Logis at the Schloss Wilhelmshöhe.\n\n"}

Described as an \"allegory about the curative powers of story,\" the film centers on bibliophile Lessmore and his custodianship of a magical library of flying books. It was created using computer animation, miniatures and traditional hand-drawn techniques.\n\nAfter winning over a dozen film festivals, the film was awarded the Best Animated Short Film at the 84th Academy Awards. An official iPad app based on the film was also released in the Apple App Store. This however requires updating as it does not work with the current iOS. A book adaptation was released in late 2012.\n\nMorris Lessmore sits on a balcony in the French Quarter of New Orleans writing a memoir. Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris's writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings.\n\nAfter the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book's pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of Humpty Dumpty, who urges Morris to follow him.\n\nThe flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris.\n\nMorris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\" after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf. He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library.\n\nYears later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life's work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris's portrait added to the picture wall in the library.\n\nThe book was inspired by William Morris, children's books publisher at HarperCollins and Joyce's mentor. Joyce wrote a story about a man who gives his life to books when he was on an airplane flight to visit Morris. Joyce read the story to Morris, who died a few days after that.\n\nMorris Lessmore was visually modeled after the silent film actor Buster Keaton. The film drew particular inspiration from the storm scene in Keaton's \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" and the tornado from \"The Wizard of Oz\". Also an inspiration was the real-life Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans in 2005.\n\nLike \"The Wizard of Oz\", the film utilizes the contrast of color and black-and-white as a narrative device. In this case, the black-and-white represents the sadness and despair brought about by the storm.\n\nThe film has received 14 awards, including the Audience Award at the Austin Film Festival, \"Best Animated Short\" at the Cinequest Film Festival, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal congratulated Shreveport-based animation studio Moonbot Studios for winning an Oscar at the 84th Annual Academy Awards in Hollywood. \"Louisiana celebrates this Oscar win with the exceptionally talented and creative staff of Moonbot Studios in Shreveport,\" Jindal said. \"We're proud that Louisiana residents and a Louisiana-based company created this groundbreaking work that pays homage to a love of books and perseverance through a love of learning.\n\nThe book adaptation won a SIBA Book Award (children's category) in 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "43160597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43160597", "title": "Washington Redskins trademark dispute", "text": "Washington Redskins trademark dispute\n\nThe Washington Redskins trademark dispute was a legal effort by Native Americans who consider the term \"redskin\" to be an offensive and disparaging racial slur to prevent the owners of the Washington Redskins football team from being able to maintain federal trademark protection for this name. These efforts have primarily been carried forward in two cases brought before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). While prevailing in the most recent case in which the trademarks were cancelled, petitioners have withdrawn for further litigation now that the legal issue has become moot due to a decision in another case which found the relevant portion of the trademark law to be an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of speech.\n\nThe first action in the dispute occurred in 1992, when Suzan Shown Harjo, President of the Morning Star Institute, with six other prominent Native Americans represented by the Dorsey & Whitney law firm of Minneapolis, petitioned the USPTO to cancel the trademark registrations owned by the Redskins' corporate entity of Pro-Football, Inc. They based their lawsuit on the claim that federal trademark law states that certain trademark registrations are not legal if they are \"disparaging, scandalous, contemptuous, or disreputable.\" The legal battle went on for seven years. In 1999 the PTO judges canceled the federal registration of the mark REDSKINS \"on the grounds that the subject marks may disparage Native Americans and may bring them into contempt or disrepute.\" The owners appealed the decision to a district court in the District of Columbia in \"Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo\". The court reversed the USPTO's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement. Subsequent appeals have been rejected on the basis of \"laches,\" which means that the specific Native American plaintiffs had pursued their rights in an untimely and delayed manner. In 2009 the Supreme Court declined to take up the case.\n\nSince 1992, the USPTO has rejected eleven applications for other trademarks that included the word redskins, based on the same reason of disparagement. Some of the applications were made by Pro-Football, Inc., including \"Washington Redskins Cheerleaders\", some for other products.The USPTO rejected an application to register \"Redskins Hog Rinds\" because it \"consists of or includes matter which may disparage or bring into contempt or disrepute persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols\". \n\nA second case was filed, \"Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc.\", with younger plaintiffs whose standing might not be hindered by laches. On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) voted to cancel the six trademarks held by the team in a two-to-one decision that held that the term \"redskins\" is disparaging to a \"substantial composite of Native Americans\", and this is demonstrated \"by the near complete drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s.\" The Trademark board asked two questions in determining disparagement: 1) what is the meaning of the mark as it appears in connection with the goods and services in the registrations and 2) is the meaning of the marks one that may be disparaging. The questions are to be answered in the context of the respective dates of registration of each mark.\n\nEvidence of disparagement submitted by the petitioners in the case include the frequent references to \"scalping\" made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game, and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using \"redskin\" to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy. A linguistics expert for the team unsuccessfully argued that the name is merely a descriptive term no different than other uses of color to differentiate people by race. The TTAB also found that the term \"redskin\" refers to Native Americans (rather than having an \"independent meaning\" as the team sometimes claimed) as shown by the costumes worn by both the cheerleaders and marching band from the 1960s until the 1980s, and the native imagery used on the press guides for many years.\n\nIn a press release the trademark attorney for the team stated that they were confident that they would once again prevail on appeal, and that today's decision will make no difference in the continued use of the Redskins name. Plaintiff Amanda Blackhorse, a social worker and member of the Navajo Nation, said in an interview, \"We’ve been through this process for eight years now. We will continue to fight. And, you know, this is not the end for us.\" Some legal experts have opined that the ruling could stick this time.\n\nThe political columnist George Will portrayed the case as an example of overreach by government regulatory agencies, arguing that there was an \"absence of general or Native American revulsion\" toward the name. A sports columnist for \"The Washington Post\" compared the TTAB's actions to \"policing speech\". The cancellation of Federal registration in fact made no change to the team's use of the name, but withdrew the government from the responsibility to regulate the use of the name by anyone. The team retains other rights under common law, but must enforce them without government assistance. However, in the opinion of one intellectual property law firm, the team \"may be hesitant to sue another for infringing its marks because of the risk that a court could possibly determine that the team has no protectable interest in the name because of its disparaging nature\".\nThe Washington Redskins filed its appeal in the Blackhorse case on August 14, 2014, stating their belief \"that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) ignored both federal case law and the weight of the evidence\". They also cite infringement of their First Amendment right to free expression. On September 22, 2014 the Native Americans asked that the team's appeal be dismissed because it names them as individuals, which is contrary to federal law, and because the appeal was filed with the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, VA, stating that the Redskins should have filed its case against the patent office in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC. In Oct, 2014 Judge Gerald B. Lee rejected the Native American plaintiffs' attempts to have the team's appeal dismissed. The United States Department of Justice entered the case in a limited way by stating that it will defend the constitutionality of the trademark law.\n\nThe ACLU filed an Amicus brief stating that while it found the name Redskins repellant, the government should not be able to decide what types of speech are forbidden, and that the provision of the Lanham Act barring the trademark of disparaging terms is unconstitutionally vague in its wording and has not been applied with consistency. On March 23, 2015, the Attorney General's Office filed a brief addressing the Constitutional issues, stating that as commercial speech, the team name and logo are not protected by the First Amendment, and that there is a large number of cases supporting the cancellation of the trademarks. The brief also stated that the court should also reject the claim that the cancellation of trademarks constitutes an illegal taking of valuable property which is barred by the Fifth Amendment. By opening up an inquiry into constitutional issues regarding limits on disparaging speech in order to protect \"the unique cultural heritage\" of the American Indian population, the case may go well beyond what a football team calls itself. The Navajo Nation filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the decision to cancel the trademarks, due to Pro-Football, Inc. stating in its appeal that individual members of the Navajo Nation such as former chairman Peter McDonald do not find the name disparaging. The brief states that these individuals speak only for themselves, while the tribe’s elected, appointed and traditional leaders speak for the Navajo people and present “unified opposition” to the team name because it is disparaging and has a negative psychological effect on tribal members.\n\nOn July 8, 2015, Judge Lee affirmed the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Judge Lee denied the team's summary judgment motions challenging the constitutionality of the Lanham Act and granted the Blackhorse Defendants' summary judgment motions, finding that \"the evidence before the Court supports the legal conclusion that...the Redskin Marks consisted of matter that 'may disparage' a substantial composite of Native Americans.\" The decision does not bar the team from using the marks going forward, and the order itself is subject to further appeal.\n\nTeam president Bruce Allen expressed surprise at the decision, and that a summary judgement was made by the judge based upon the evidence submitted rather than proceeding to a trial. While the team continues to have certain rights to its trademarks, it must take action to protect those rights individually. The cancellation of federal registration of the trademarks means that the government will no longer take any action against anyone else using the name or logo, such as blocking counterfeit goods from being imported into the country.\n\nOn October 30, 2015 Pro-Football, Inc. filed its appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In addition to maintaining the validity of all the arguments rejected by both the TTAB and the first appeal, the team has added a list of offensive names that have been given trademarks, thus claiming unequal treatment. The names cited as offensive are mainly sexual or scatological, but do include the racial terms \"yid\", \"dago\", \"gringo\" and \"negro\". Eighteen law professors have jointly filed an \"amicus\" brief in the case stating that the relevant section of the Lanham Act is an unconstitutional intrusion into freedom of expression, and rejecting the TTAB opinion that trademarks are government speech not protected by the first amendment. Ron Katz, sports attorney and Chair Emeritus of the Institute of Sports Law and Ethics at Santa Clara University, expects the team to win its appeal based upon constitutional grounds, while describing the trademark as \"repugnant\".\n\nThese cases prompted a range of opinions from law professors.\n\nBoth the USPTO and Pro-Football, Inc. requested a review by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) of the same legal issue, the constitutionality of banning a disparaging trademark. The USPTO appealed the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit which found in December 2015 that part of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. That case (Matal v. Tam) involved the denial of a trademark for an Asian-American rock band, \"The Slants\". The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association (NAPABA) filed an amicus brief supporting the constitutionality of the Lanham Act, NAPABA President Cyndie Chang stating “Racial slurs should not be recognized as commercial speech through federally-protected trademarks. “Freedom of speech does not require that the government allow racially derogatory terms to be trademarked so that a trademark owner can have exclusive rights to use and monetize such terms.” On June 19, 2017 the court ruled unanimously in favor of Tam, the majority opinion stating \"The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech.\" Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department have withdrawn from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot.\n\n"}
