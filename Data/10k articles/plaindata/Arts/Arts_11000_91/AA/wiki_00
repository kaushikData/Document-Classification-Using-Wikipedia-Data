On January 16, 1928, Pan Am published one of their first timetables. It read \"The air-way to Havana, Pan American Airways, Pershing Square Building, New York\". \nMany airline timetables had colorful covers. The timetables of very small airlines, such as Scenic Airways, consisted of one sheet of paper, with their hub's flight time information on the front, and the return times on the back. \nIn recent years, most airlines have stopped production of printed timetables, in order to cut costs and reduce the delay between a change of schedule and a new timetable being in the hands of the public. As a consequence, most airlines now post their timetables only online (the larger airlines often offering a stand-alone application, while others provide just a downloadable document such as a PDF), and the value of many printed airline timetable has risen among collectors.\n\n"}
{"id": "19135007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19135007", "title": "Alternative exhibition space", "text": "Alternative exhibition space\n\nAn alternative exhibition space is a space other than a traditional commercial venue used for the public exhibition of artwork. Often comprising a place converted from another use, such as a store front, warehouse, or factory loft, it is then made into a display or performance space for use by an individual or group of artists. According to art advisor Allan Schwartzman \"alternative spaces were the center of American artistic life in the '70s.\"\n\nMacdonald argues that such spaces emerged in the wake of art practices in the 1960s and 1970s that reacted against the presumed neutrality of the \"white cube\" gallery space. A prominent wave of alternative spaces in the United States occurred in the 1970s, with the first spaces established in 1969, including Billy Apple's APPLE and Robert Newman's Gain Ground where Vito Acconci produced many important early works and Philadelphia's Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia. Some date the start of the tendency from 1970, when 112 Greene Street was founded in New York and with the early curatorial work of Alanna Heiss. The Kitchen was established in New York in 1971. A.I.R. Gallery opened in September 1972 as an alternative space women's co-op gallery. About this time And/Or Gallery opened in Seattle, Washington, the first alternative space of its kind in the Pacific Northwest. It was founded by Anne Focke. Bonnie Sherk's Crossroads Community (The Farm), another early alternative space, was established in San Francisco in 1974. Real Art Ways, in Hartford, Connecticut, was founded in 1975.\n\nThe wave of alternative spaces that emerged in the US during the late 1960s through the mid-1970s were typically organized by collectives of artists whose interests were focused on conceptual art, mixed media, electronic media, diversity and performance art. For instance, Franklin Furnace Archive in New York was established in 1976 by Martha Wilson to exhibit performance work. LACE in Los Angeles and Washington Project for the Arts showed performance and video work. One of the most enduring alternative spaces in New York, P.S 1, was founded in 1976. Exit Art in Manhattan opened in 1982. In 1981 the New Museum staged the exhibition \"Alternatives in Retrospect: An Historical Overview 1969-1975\", guest curated by Jacki Apple. This exhibition looked at early New York alternative galleries, Gain Ground, Apple, 98 Greene Street, 112 Greene Street Workshop, 10 Blecker Street, Idea Warehouse and 3 Mercer. The exhibition was documented with a publication and video. In Chicago, the exhibition \"Alternative Spaces\" curated by Lynne Warren at the Museum of Contemporary Art catalogued the scores of artists and artists' spaces to emerge during that period, including Artemisia Gallery (1973-2003), ARC Gallery (1973-), Gallery Bugs Bunny (1968-1972), N.A.M.E. Gallery (1973-1997), NAB Gallery (1974-1984), and Randolph Street Gallery (1979-1998). Earlier waves in Chicago produced the Hyde Park Art Center (1939-) and Contemporary Art Workshop (1950-2009), while later spaces included 1019 W. Lake St./Noise Factory (1981-1985), W.P.A. Gallery (1981-?) and Axe Street Arena (1985-1989). Hundreds of artists enacted those spaces, including Jim Nutt, H.C. Westermann, Ed Paschke (HPAC), Leon Golub, Nancy Spero (CAC), Hollis Sigler, Vera Klement (Artemisia), Phil Berkman and Gary Justis (N.A.M.E.).\n\nAmong the factors contributing to the demise of alternative spaces in the late 1980s in the USA was the reduction of public funding for artists and for the arts. With the election of Ronald Reagan as President came a restructuring of federal supports, such as an end to the CETA program, through which some artists found employment, and restrictions placed upon the National Endowment for the Arts. The net result of the rightward ideological movement in government – with its open hostility to non-traditional art – was that 'alternative artists' were not only de-funded, they and the galleries that featured them were prominently criminalized. By the 1990s, NEA funding was significantly reduced, and so was the number of non-profit galleries.\n\nIn Europe the culture of alternative exhibition spaces differs somewhat from the situation in the United States and has a strong root in the squatting counterculture, which is not illegal in every European country. Also many countries have governmental art funding structures that support many off spaces. In the Netherlands there is OT301, W139 and ADM (all in Amsterdam), Roodkapje (Rotterdam), Nest (The Hague), Sign (Groningen). In the UK there is the MK Gallery in Milton Keynes. Belgium has Het Bos in Antwerp. Liebig 12 is an alternative exhibition space in Berlin. In Vienna there is Moë. Ljubljana has Metelkova with many alternative art spaces, and Copenhagen has alternative spaces in Freetown Christiania. Grand Palace is an alternative art space in Bern, Switzerland. Hirvitalo is in Helsinki, Finland.\n"}

Paul took over the running of the Cassirer gallery, and supported various Secessionist artists including the sculptors Ernst Barlach and August Gaul, as well as promoting French Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.\n\nThe biggest conflict in the Berlin Secession was over the question of whether it should follow the new wave of Expressionism.\n\n"}

The \"Confessions\" was \"the first major work De Quincey published and the one which won him fame almost overnight...\"\n\nFirst published anonymously in September and October 1821 in the \"London Magazine\", the \"Confessions\" was released in book form in 1822, and again in 1856, in an edition revised by De Quincey.\n\nAs originally published, De Quincey's account was organized into two parts:\n\nThough De Quincey was later criticized for giving too much attention to the pleasure of opium and not enough to the harsh negatives of addiction, \"The Pains of Opium\" is in fact significantly longer than \"The Pleasures\". However, even when trying to convey darker truths, De Quincey's language can seem seduced by the compelling nature of the opium experience:\n\nFrom its first appearance, the literary style of the \"Confessions\" attracted attention and comment. De Quincey was well-read in the English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and assimilated influences and models from Sir Thomas Browne and other writers. Arguably the most famous and often-quoted passage in the \"Confessions\" is the apostrophe to opium in the final paragraph of \"The Pleasures\":\n\nDe Quincey modelled this passage on the apostrophe \"O eloquent, just and mightie Death!\" in Sir Walter Raleigh's \"History of the World\".\n\nEarlier in \"The Pleasures of Opium\", De Quincey describes the long walks he took through the London streets under the drug's influence:\n\nThe \"Confessions\" represents De Quincey's initial effort to write what he called \"impassioned prose\", an effort that he would later resume in \"Suspiria de Profundis\" (1845) and \"The English Mail-Coach\" (1849).\n\nIn the early 1850s, De Quincey prepared the first collected edition of his works for publisher James Hogg. For that edition, he undertook a large-scale revision of the \"Confessions\", more than doubling the work's length. Most notably, he expanded the opening section on his personal background, until it consumed more than two-thirds of the whole. Yet he gave the book \"a much weaker beginning\" and detracted from the impact of the original with digressions and inconsistencies; \"the verdict of most critics is that the earlier version is artistically superior\".\n\n\"De Quincey undoubtedly spoiled his masterpiece by revising it... anyone who compares the two will prefer the unflagging vigour and tension of the original version to the tired prosiness of much of the revised one\".\n\nThe \"Confessions\" maintained a place of primacy in De Quincey's literary output, and his literary reputation, from its first publication; \"it went through countless editions, with only occasional intervals of a few years, and was often translated. Since there was little systematic study of narcotics until long after his death, De Quincey's account assumed an authoritative status and actually dominated the scientific and public views of the effects of opium for several generations.\"\n\nYet from the time of its publication, De Quincey's \"Confessions\" was criticized for presenting a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, \"Advice to Opium Eaters\", was published \"to warn others from copying De Quincey.\" The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — Francis Thompson, James Thomson, William Blair, and perhaps Branwell Brontë — were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example. Charles Baudelaire's 1860 translation and adaptation, \"Les paradis artificiels\", spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the \"Confessions\". De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.\n\nMore generally, De Quincey's \"Confessions\" influenced psychology and abnormal psychology, and attitudes towards dreams and imaginative literature.\n\n\"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater\" also served as inspiration to one of Hector Berlioz's most famous pieces, \"Symphonie fantastique\". The play \"The Opium Eater\" by Andrew Dallmeyer was also based on \"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater\", and has been published by Capercaillie Books. In 1962, Vincent Price starred in the full-length film \"Confessions of an Opium Eater\" which was a reimagining of De Quincey's \"Confessions\" by Hollywood producer Albert Zugsmith.\n\n (plain text and HTML)\n"}
{"id": "23926474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23926474", "title": "Cultural Bolshevism", "text": "Cultural Bolshevism\n\nCultural Bolshevism (German: \"Kulturbolschewismus\"), sometimes referred to specifically as \"art Bolshevism\" or \"music Bolshevism\", was a term widely used by critics in Nazi Germany to denounce modernist movements in the arts, particularly when seeking to discredit more nihilistic forms of expression. This first became an issue during the 1920s in Weimar Germany. German artists such as Max Ernst and Max Beckmann were denounced by Adolf Hitler, the Nazi Party and other right-wing nationalists as \"cultural Bolsheviks\".\n\nThe development of modern art at the beginning of the 20th century – but with roots going back to the 1860s – denoted a revolutionary divergence from traditional artistic values to ones based on the personal perceptions and feelings of the artists. This rejection of traditional authority – intimately linked to the Industrial Revolution and the advance of democracy as the preferred form of government – was exhilarating to some, but extremely threatening to others, as it took away the security they felt under the old order, and the very cohesiveness of Western culture and civilization appeared to be in peril.\n\nThe modernist break occurred at around the same time as the October Revolution in Russia, and it was perhaps natural that those who felt threatened by the new artistic viewpoint would associate it with the group that came out on top after that revolution, the Bolsheviks with their Marxist–Leninist political philosophy. In reality, the connection between the modernism and Bolshevism was extremely tenuous, and primarily a matter of both existing at the same unsettled time in European history. Still, some artists in Western Europe drew inspiration from revolutionary ideals, to the extent that Dadaist Richard Huelsenbeck confidently declared in 1920 that Dada was a \"German Bolshevist affair.\"\n\nThe association of new art with Bolshevism circulated in right-wing and nationalist discourse in the following years; it was, for example, the subject of a chapter in Adolf Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\". Amid Hitler's rise to power the Nazis denounced a number of contemporary styles as \"cultural Bolshevism,\" notably abstract art and Bauhaus architecture. After seeing a colleague beaten by Nazi supporters for comments sympathetic to modern art, typographer Paul Renner published an essay against Nazi aesthetics titled \"Kulturbolschewismus?\" Around the same time, Carl von Ossietzky mocked the flexibility of the term in Nazi writings:\n\nCultural Bolshevism is when conductor [Otto] Klemperer takes tempi different from his colleague [Wilhelm] Furtwängler; when a painter sweeps a color into his sunset not seen in Lower Pomerania; when one favors birth control; when one builds a house with a flat roof; when a Caesarean birth is shown on the screen; when one admires the performance of [Charlie] Chaplin and the mathematical wizardry of [Albert] Einstein. This is called cultural Bolshevism and a personal favor rendered to Herr Stalin. It is also the democratic mentality of the brothers [Heinrich and Thomas] Mann, a piece of music by [Paul] Hindemith or [Kurt] Weill, and is to be identified with the hysterical insistence of a madman for a law giving him permission to marry his own grandmother.\n\nOnce in control of the government, the Nazis moved to suppress modern art styles and to promote art with national and racial themes. Various Weimar-era art personalities, including Renner, Huelsenbeck, and the Bauhaus designers, were marginalized.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "179339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179339", "title": "Decadence", "text": "Decadence\n\nThe word decadence, which at first meant simply \"decline\" in an abstract sense, is now most often used to refer to a perceived decay in standards, morals, dignity, religious faith, or skill at governing among the members of the elite of a very large social structure, such as an empire or nation state. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.\n\nUsage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin \"(dēcadentia)\", appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of social degeneration contributed to its modern meaning.\n\nIn literature, the Decadent movement—late nineteenth century \"fin de siècle\" writers who were associated with Symbolism or the Aesthetic movement—was first given its name by hostile critics. Later it was triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the Gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nDecadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics' naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the Gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe, and were associated with Symbolism and/or Aestheticism.\n\nThis concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from Montesquieu, and was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after Désiré Nisard used it against Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal \"progress.\" In the 1880s, a group of French writers referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic novel from this group is Joris-Karl Huysmans' \"Against Nature\", often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire's works.\n\nIn Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, Oscar Wilde. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.\n\nThe Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as \"decadent\" in the mid-1880s. Jean Moréas' manifesto was largely a response to this polemic. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.\n\nThis \"fertile culture\" of Berlin extended onwards until Adolf Hitler rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the Nazi Party. Likewise, the Nazis decried Berlin as a haven of vice. A new culture developed in and around Berlin, including architecture and design (Bauhaus, 1919–33), a variety of literature (Döblin, \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\", 1929), film (Lang, \"Metropolis\", 1927, Dietrich, \"Der blaue Engel\", 1930), painting (Grosz), and music (Brecht and Weill, \"The Threepenny Opera\", 1928), criticism (Benjamin), philosophy/psychology (Jung), and fashion. This culture was often considered to be decadent, and socially, morally, destructive.\n\nFilm was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called German Expressionism. \"Talkies\", the Sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.\n\nBerlin in the 20s also proved to be a haven for English writers such as W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood, who wrote a series of 'Berlin novels', inspiring the play \"I Am a Camera\", which was later adapted into a musical, \"Cabaret\", and an Academy Award winning film of the same name. Spender's semi-autobiographical novel \"The Temple\" evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Lenin, capitalism had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism's gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for socialist revolution in the West. Politically, World War I proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that capitalism had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.\n\nOne who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was José Ortega y Gasset in \"The Revolt of the Masses\" (1930). He argued that the \"mass man\" had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation. He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the Roman Empire.\n\nDecadence is an important aspect of contemporary left communist theory. Similar to Lenin's use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of Marx's method as well, expressed in famous works such as \"The Communist Manifesto\", \"Grundrisse\", \"Das Kapital\" but most significantly in \"Preface to the Critique of Political Economy\".\n\nContemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and Rosa Luxemburg to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism's decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the International Communist Current hold a basically Luxemburgist analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of Vladimir Lenin, Nikolai Bukharin and most importantly Henryk Grossman and Paul Mattick with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling rate of profit.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1934129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1934129", "title": "Explicit symmetry breaking", "text": "Explicit symmetry breaking\n\nIn theoretical physics, explicit symmetry breaking is the breaking of a symmetry of a theory by terms in its defining equations of motion (most typically, to the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian) that do not respect the symmetry. Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry-breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory. An example is the spectral line splitting in the Zeeman effect, due to a magnetic interaction perturbation in the Hamiltonian of the atoms involved.\n\nExplicit symmetry breaking differs from spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the ground state (vacuum) of the theory breaks it.\n\nExplicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. A system of accelerated charges results in electromagnetic radiation when the geometric symmetry of the electric field in free space is explicitly broken by the associated electrodynamic structure under time varying excitation of the given system. This is quite evident in an antenna where the electric lines of field curl around or have rotational geometry around the radiating terminals in contrast to linear geometric orientation within a pair of transmission lines which does not radiate even under time varying excitation.\n\n"}

His arrival in Ireland coincided with the Great Famine and he witnessed white people in what he considered to be a worse state than his fellow African Americans back in the US. The film follows Douglass back to America where he buys his freedom with funds raised in Ireland and Britain. Fellow passengers on his return journey include the Irish escaping the famine who arrive in their millions and would go on to play a major role in the New York Draft Riot of 1863 which Douglass could only despair over. The film examines (with contributions from the author of \"How The Irish Became White\" Noel Ignatiev amongst others) the turbulent relationship between African Americans and Irish Americans during the American Civil War, what drew them together and what drove them apart and how this would shape the America of the twentieth century and beyond.\n\n\n"}

The Center plays host to the Bowen Park Theatre and Opera Company (a professional theatre/opera company), the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra and Concert Chorus (community based performance groups), as well as numerous theatre, dance, and /visual art classes and private music and voice lessons. The center started out as a not-for-profit corporation in 1964. Upon the death of Jack Benny in 1974, the name was changed. The music and fine arts school became part of the Waukegan Park District in 1982 as a division of the recreation department.\n\nThe Waukegan Park District completed a new home for the center and its departments in Bowen Park in 1987 and had become its own division of the park district. Originally the Center had been in Bowen Park, moved to Powell Park for a time, and was delighted to return to Bowen Park. With the addition of Goodfellow Hall, an eighty-nine-seat lecture-recital hall, the division founded Bowen Park Theatre and Bowen Park Opera in the mid 1980s. These two companies went from semi-professional to fully professional, non-Equity, non-union in three years.\n\nWaukegan Symphony Orchestra was born on April 24, 1974, when favorite comedic son Jack Benny returned to his home town of Waukegan to star in the WSO's initial performance. It was a magical night, held at Waukegan High School's auditorium. Like the Music Center of Lake County, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has made itself synonymous with the broad range of culture that is the hallmark of the city. Through its thirty-five-plus-year history, the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra has engaged its audiences in both traditional and challenging works. Musical direction now rests in the hands of Maestro Stephen Blackwelder.\n\nWaukegan Concert Chorus was established as a community chorus in 1976 to sing with the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Verdi's \"Requiem\". Both the members of the community recognized the great benefit of retaining such a cultural asset in the community and the Chorus continued as an independent sister organization to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra.\n\nLynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Theatre Company in the spring of 1987 at approximately the same time as Bowen Park Opera. The company's objective was to produce mostly classical drama and comedies, avoiding musicals and the repertory of neighboring theatre groups. Within three years, Bowen Park Theatre became a fully professional, non-equity theatre, joining the professional ranks of only two other companies in Lake County. Currently, the Ensemble Players (college age), the Roundtree Players (14–18 years of age) and Stage One (8–13 years of age) give the youth to young adults of the community an opportunity to develop and study the art of acting, also use the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall.\n\nBowen Park Opera Company has its roots to the Waukegan Symphony Orchestra performances in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the new Jack Benny Center for the Arts facility was completed in Bowen Park. Lynn Schornick and Ken Smouse founded Bowen Park Opera Company to perform in Goodfellow Hall. Its first production was a double bill in the spring of 1987 of Holst's \"The Wandering Scholar\" and Mozart's \"The Impresario\". In 2003, Goodfellow Hall was renamed the Dr. Lynn Schornick Theatre in Goodfellow Hall to honor the man who had led the Cultural Arts to where it is today. Dr. Schornick retired from the Waukegan Park District in 2004.\n\nIn 1994, the Cultural Arts Division became responsible for the programs of the Waukegan Park District's Historic Districts.

Hewitt began her career as a child actress and singer, appearing in national television commercials before joining the cast of the Disney Channel series \"Kids Incorporated\" (1989–1991) as well as performing as a backup singer before recording her debut studio album at the age of 12, \"Love Songs\" (1992), which was released exclusively in Japan. Hewitt received her breakthrough role as Sarah Reeves Merrin on the Fox teen drama \"Party of Five\" (1995–1999), and rose to fame as a teen star for her role as Julie James in the horror film \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997) and its 1998 sequel.\n\nHewitt released her second and third studio albums with Atlantic Records, \"Let's Go Bang\" (1995) and \"Jennifer Love Hewitt\" (1996), both of which saw little commercial success. Thereafter, she starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in the romantic comedy film \"Heartbreakers\" (2001) and alongside Jackie Chan in the action comedy film \"The Tuxedo\" (2002). Hewitt released her fourth studio album and most recent to date with Jive Records in 2002, \"BareNaked\", which became her first album to chart in the United States, peaking at number 37 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Her most successful single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 was the 1999 release \"How Do I Deal\", which peaked at number 59.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Hewitt starred as Melinda Gordon on the CBS supernatural drama \"Ghost Whisperer\", for which she received two Saturn Awards in 2007 and 2008. She later starred on the Lifetime drama series \"The Client List\" from 2012 to 2013, and was previously nominated for a Golden Globe Award for the pilot film. From 2014 to 2015, she starred as Special Agent Kate Callahan on the CBS crime drama \"Criminal Minds\". In addition to acting, she has served as a producer on some of her film and television projects. Hewitt was identified as the \"number one reader choice\" on the November 1999 and May 2009 covers of \"Maxim\" magazine. \"TV Guide\" named her the sexiest woman on television in 2008.\n\nBeginning in 2018, she starred in the Fox first responder drama series \"9-1-1\", playing 9-1-1 dispatcher Maddie Buckley.\n\nHewitt was born in Waco, Texas, to Patricia Mae (née Shipp), a speech-language pathologist, and Herbert Daniel Hewitt, a medical technician. Hewitt grew up in Nolanville, in Central Texas, and has close kinship ties in parts of Arkansas. After their parents divorced, Hewitt and her older brother Todd were raised by their mother. Patricia Mae Hewitt died on June 12, 2012, aged 67, following a battle with cancer.\n\nAs a young girl, Hewitt was attracted to music, which led to her first encounters with the entertainment industry. At the age of three, she sang \"The Greatest Love of All\" at a livestock show. The following year, at a restaurant-dance hall, she entertained an audience with her version of \"Help Me Make it Through the Night\". By age five, she had tap dancing and ballet in her portfolio. At nine, she became a member of the Texas Show Team (which also toured in the Soviet Union).\n\nAt age ten, at the suggestion of talent scouts and after winning the title of \"Texas Our Little Miss Talent Winner\", she moved to Los Angeles with her mother to pursue a career in both acting and singing. In Los Angeles, she attended Lincoln High School where her classmates included Jonathan Neville, who became a talent scout and recommended Hewitt for her role in \"Party of Five\".\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Hewitt appeared in more than twenty television commercials, including some for Mattel toys. Her first break came as a child actor on the Disney Channel variety show \"Kids Incorporated\" (1989–1991), where she was credited as \"Love Hewitt.\" She later appeared in the live action video short \"Dance! Workout with Barbie\" (1992), released by Buena Vista.\n\nShe played Pierce Brosnan's daughter in a pilot for NBC called \"Running Wilde\" (1993), which featured Brosnan as a reporter for \"Auto World\" magazine, whose stories cover his own wild auto adventures. However, the series was not picked up and the pilot never aired. Hewitt later had roles in several short-lived television series, such as Fox's \"Shaky Ground\" (1992–1993), ABC's \"The Byrds of Paradise\" (1994), and \"McKenna\" (1994–95), and finally became a young star after landing the role of Sarah Reeves Merrin on the popular Fox show \"Party of Five\" (1995–99). She assumed the role of Sarah after joining that show during its second season and continued it on the short-lived \"Party of Five\" spin-off, \"Time of Your Life\" (1999), which she also co-produced. The show was cancelled after half a season.\n\nHewitt's first feature film role was in the independent film \"Munchie\" (1992). A year later, she achieved her first starring film role in \"Little Miss Millions\" (1993). She appeared as a choir member in \"\" (1993). Hewitt became a film star after a lead role in the horror film \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997), which enjoyed great box office success (US$125,000,000). Hewitt and her co-stars gained popular exposure from the film. She appeared in the sequel \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1998), which, though not as successful as the first film, took in more money on its opening weekend. She starred in the high-school comedy \"Can't Hardly Wait\" (1998).\n\nHewitt starred in \"The Audrey Hepburn Story\" (2000). That same year, she was the \"most popular actress on television\" for her Q-rating (a measurement of a celebrity's popularity) of 37. Noting her \"Q-rating,\" Nokia chose her to become its spokesperson.\n\nShe starred alongside Sigourney Weaver in the romantic comedy \"Heartbreakers\" (2001) and did voiceover work in the animated film \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame II\" (2002) as Madellaine, the main protagonist's love interest. Hewitt wrote and performed \"I'm Gonna Love You\" for the film; the song won \"Best Original Song\" at the DVD Premiere Awards. She starred alongside Jackie Chan in \"The Tuxedo\" (2002), which received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success. Hewitt appeared in \"If Only\" (2004) and co-wrote and performed \"Love Will Show You Everything\" and \"Take My Heart Back\" for the film's soundtrack. She starred in \"\" (2004), which became her highest-grossing film to date (US$200,804,534). She reprised her role for the sequel, \"\" (2006), which, though it did not perform as well as its predecessor, achieved a strong box office gross.\n\nHewitt starred in the television series \"Ghost Whisperer\" (2005–2010), which ran on CBS for five seasons before being canceled by the network in May 2010. She reunited with her \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" co-star, Freddie Prinze Jr., in \"Delgo\"; but when released in 2008, the film was a massive box office bomb, taking in only US$694,782 domestically.\n\nHewitt's next feature film was the independent drama \"Café\" (2010) with her then-boyfriend Jamie Kennedy. She starred in the Lifetime film \"The Client List\" (2010), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. The next year, Hewitt starred in the Hallmark Hall of Fame film \"The Lost Valentine\" (2011).\n\nIn 2011, Hewitt was announced to direct the film \"Wait Till Helen Comes\" (based on by Mary Downing Hahn). She had previously directed three episodes of \"Ghost Whisperer\", and this would be her feature film directorial debut. Production on the film was slated to begin in the summer of 2011, but no further announcements about the film have been made . She also starred alongside Ivan Sergei and Joel David Moore in the independent comedy \"Jewtopia\" (2012).\n\nHewitt was a guest star on TV Land's \"Hot in Cleveland\" in 2011 and 2012. She starred in the television series \"The Client List\" (2012–13) until its cancellation in late 2013.\n\nIn July 2014, CBS announced that Hewitt had joined the cast of \"Criminal Minds\" as Agent Kate Callahan in the series' 10th season. However, Hewitt became pregnant with her second child during the production of season 10 of \"Criminal Minds\", and left the cast of the show at the end of the season, with the possibility of further appearances left open.\n\nHewitt was one of the back-up singers in Martika's number-one single, \"Toy Soldiers\" (1989).\nAt the age of 12, Meldac funded the recording of Hewitt's debut studio album, \"Love Songs\" (1992). The album was released exclusively in Japan, where Hewitt became a pop star. Her explanation for her success in Japan is that the Japanese \"love perky music. The poppier the music, the better.\"\n\nAfter she joined the cast of \"Party of Five\", she signed to Atlantic Records, who rushed her second studio album, \"Let's Go Bang\" (1995), out in October. The album and its three singles failed to chart. Juggling her music career with her acting career, she recorded and released her self-titled follow-up album, \"Jennifer Love Hewitt\" (1996). The album, along with its four singles, failed to chart and Atlantic dropped Hewitt, who did not return to the music scene for three years.\n\nShe recorded the single \"How Do I Deal\" (1999) for the \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\" soundtrack. The song became Hewitt's first charting single, climbing to No. 59 on the Hot 100 and No. 36 on the Top 40 Mainstream. It reached No. 8 in Australia. Hewitt also recorded a cover of the Gloria Gaynor song \"I Will Survive\", which features briefly in the film.\n\nShe appeared in the LFO video for \"Girl on TV\" (1999), a song which band member Rich Cronin band wrote for her while the two were dating. She also appeared in the music video for the Enrique Iglesias song, \"Hero\" (2001), as the singer's love interest.\n\nIn 2002, Hewitt signed to Jive Records and recorded her fourth studio album with singer, songwriter, and producer Meredith Brooks. The first single, \"BareNaked\" (2002), became her biggest radio hit to date when it peaked at No. 24 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, No. 31 on the Adult Top 40 and No. 25 on the Top 40 Mainstream. It climbed to No. 6 in Australia, remaining there for two weeks, and reached No. 33 in the Netherlands. The song later featured in two episodes of \"Ghost Whisperer\": \"The Vanishing\" (Season 1, episode 20) and \"The Collector\" (Season 2, episode 20). The moderate success of the single propelled the album to peak at No. 37 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and No. 31 in Australia. However, it only remained on the chart for three weeks. The second single, \"Can I Go Now\" (2003), failed to chart in the US, while managing to peak at No. 8 in the Netherlands and No. 12 in Australia.\n\nSince 2004, Hewitt has remained inactive in the music industry, but she released the compilation albums \"\" (2006) in Asia and \"Hey Everybody\" (2007) in Brazil. In 2009, reports surfaced that Hewitt was planning on making a country album and was in the process of writing material for it. Jamie Kennedy, Hewitt's boyfriend at the time, said: \"I really want to make her a new demo for her music, because I think she should do singing again. She's so good.\" However, nothing has of yet come of the reports. Hewitt has remained mostly absent from the music industry, but in 2013, she recorded a cover of \"I'm a Woman\" to promote the second season of \"The Client List\" and shot a music video for the song, which reached the top ten in the iTunes Music Video chart.\n\nIn November 2009, Hewitt made a foray into comic books. Writer Scott Lobdell scripted the five-issue anthology, \"Jennifer Love Hewitt's Music Box\" (2009–2010), based on Hewitt's ideas. The series was published by IDW Publishing, and was collected in a trade paperback.\n\nShe wrote a book titled \"The Day I Shot Cupid\" (2010), in which she speaks of her experiences with love and dating. During a January 2010 interview on \"Lopez Tonight\", Hewitt said that there was a chapter in the book about \"vajazzling\" her \"vajayjay\" (decorating her vulva with Swarovski crystals); Hewitt is said to have contributed to the popularization of this trend. The book became a \"New York Times \"Bestseller the week of its release. She announced via her Twitter page in June 2011 that she was penning a follow-up.\n\nIn 2002, a conspiracy theorist and former social worker, Diana Napolis, was arrested for stalking and uttering death threats against Hewitt and Steven Spielberg after \"verbally confronting\" the actress at the 2002 Grammy Awards and attempting to pose as one of Hewitt's friends to enter the premiere of \"The Tuxedo\".\n\nNapolis admitted to being involved in a shoving match with Hewitt's mother while confronting the actress. Napolis accused Hewitt, along with director Spielberg, of controlling her thoughts through \"cybertronic\" technology and being part of a Satanic conspiracy against her. Napolis was charged with six felonies related to the incidents. After a year of involuntary commitment, Napolis pleaded guilty and was released on bail with a condition that she was barred from any contact with both Spielberg and Hewitt.\n\nIn late 2005, Hewitt began dating Scottish actor Ross McCall after he made an appearance on her show \"Ghost Whisperer\". They became engaged in November 2007, while vacationing in Hawaii. \"People\" magazine reported that Hewitt called off their engagement in late 2008.\n\nIn March 2012, Hewitt began dating her \"The Client List\" co-star Brian Hallisay. In June 2013, Hewitt announced that she and Hallisay were engaged and expecting their first child. A November 26, 2013 \"Us Weekly\" article reported that they had recently married, and their daughter was born that month.\nIn January 2015, the couple announced they were expecting their second child. In June 2015, Hewitt gave birth to a boy.\n\nHewitt is a supporter of the Scottish football team Glasgow Celtic.\n\n\nCredits as an author:\n\nOther credits:\n\n"}

{"id": "221562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221562", "title": "Jousting", "text": "Jousting\n\nJousting is a martial game or \"hastilude\" between two horsemen wielding lances with blunted tips, often as part of a tournament. The primary aim was to replicate a clash of heavy cavalry, with each participant trying hard to strike the opponent while riding towards him at high speed, if possible breaking the lance on the opponent's shield or jousting armour, or unhorsing him. The joust became an iconic characteristic of the knight in Romantic medievalism. The participants experience close to three and a quarter times their body weight in G-forces when the lances collide with their armour.\n\nThe term is derived from Old French , ultimately from Latin \"to approach, to meet\". The word was loaned into Middle English around 1300, when jousting was a very popular sport among the Anglo-Norman knighthood. The synonym tilt dates .\n\nJousting is based on the military use of the lance by heavy cavalry. It transformed into a specialised sport during the Late Middle Ages, and remained popular with the nobility in England and Wales and Germany throughout the whole of the 16th century (while in France, it was discontinued after the death of King Henry II in an accident in 1559). In England, jousting was the highlight of the Accession Day tilts of Elizabeth I and of James VI and I, and also was part of the festivities at the marriage of Charles I.\n\nJousting was discontinued in favour of other equestrian sports in the 17th century, although non-contact forms of \"equestrian skill-at-arms\" disciplines survived. There has been a limited revival of theatrical jousting re-enactment since the 1970s.\n\nThe medieval joust has its origins in the military tactics of heavy cavalry during the High Middle Ages. By the 14th century, many members of the nobility, including kings had taken up jousting to showcase their own courage, skill and talents, and the sport proved just as dangerous for a king as a knight, and from the 15th century on, jousting became a sport (\"hastilude\") without direct relevance to warfare.\n\nFrom the 11th to 14th centuries when medieval jousting was still practised in connection to the use of the lance in warfare, armour evolved from mail (with a solid, heavy helmet, called a \"great helm\", and shield) to plate armour. By 1400, knights wore full suits of plate armour, called a \"harness\" (Clephan 28-29).\n\nIn this early period, a \"joust\" was still a (martial) \"meeting\", i.e. a duel in general and not limited to the lance.\nCombatants would begin riding on one another with the lance, but might continue with shorter range weapons after the distance was closed or after one or both parties had been unhorsed.\nTournaments in the High Medieval period were much rougher and less \"gentlemanly\" affairs than in the late medieval era of chivalry. The rival parties would fight in groups, with the aim of incapacitating their adversaries for the sake of gaining their horses, arms and ransoms.\n\nWith the development of the courtly ideals of chivalry in the late medieval period, the joust became more regulated.\nThis tendency is also reflected in the pas d'armes in general. It was now considered dishonourable to exploit an opponent's disadvantage, and knights would pay close attention to avoid being in a position of advantage, seeking to gain honour by fighting against the odds.\nThis romanticised \"chivalric revival\" was based on the chivalric romances of the high medieval period, which noblemen tried to \"reenact\" in real life, sometimes blurring the lines of reality and fiction.\n\nThe development of the term \"knight\" (\"chevalier\") dates to this period. Before the 12th century, \"cniht\" was a term for a servant. In the 12th century, it became used of a military follower in particular. Also in the 12th century, a special class of noblemen serving in cavalry developed, known as \"milites nobiles\". By the end of the 13th century, \"chivalry\" (\"chyualerye\") was used not just in the technical sense of \"cavalry\" but for martial virtue in general. It was only after 1300 that \"knighthood\" (\"kniȝthod\", originally a term for \"boyhood, youth\") came to be used as a junior rank of nobility. By the later 14th century, the term became romanticised for the ideal of the young nobleman seeking to prove himself in honourable exploits, the knight-errant, which among other things encompassed the pas d'armes, including the joust. By the 15th century, \"knightly\" virtues were sought by the noble classes even of ranks much senior than \"knight\". The iconic association of the \"knight\" stock-character with the joust is thus historical, but develops only at the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe \"lists\", or \"list field\", was the arena where a jousting event was held. More precisely, it was the roped-off enclosure where tournament fighting took place. In the late medieval period, castles and palaces were augmented by purpose-built \"tiltyards\" as a venue for \"jousting tournaments\". Training for such activities included the use of special equipment, of which the best-known was the quintain.\n\nThe \"Chronicles of Froissart\", written during the 1390s, and covering the period of 1327 to 1400, contain many details concerning jousting in this era. The combat was now expected to be non-lethal, and it was not necessary to incapacitate the opponent, who was expected to honourably yield to the dominant fighter. The combat was divided into rounds of three encounters with various weapons, of which the joust proper was one. During this time, the joust detached itself from the reality on the battlefield and became a chivalric sport. Knights would seek opportunities to duel opponents from the hostile camp for honour off the battlefield.\n\nAs an example, Froissart records that, during a campaign in Beauce in the year 1380, a squire of the garrison of Toury castle named Gauvain Micaille (Michaille)—also mentioned in the \"Chronique du bon duc Loys de Bourbon\" as wounded in 1382 at Roosebeke, and again in 1386; in 1399 was in the service of the duke of Bourbon—yelled out to the English,\nThe challenge was answered by a squire named Joachim Cator, who said \"I will deliver him from his vow: let him make haste and come out of the castle.\"\n\nMicaille came to meet his opponent with attendants carrying three lances, three battle-axes, three swords and three daggers. The duel began with a joust, described as follows:\n\nThe meeting was then adjourned, and continued on the next day.\n\nIn spite of the French squire's injury, the duel was continued with three thrusts with the sword. After this, the encounter was stopped because of the Micaille's loss of blood. He was given leave to rejoin his garrison with a reward of a hundred francs by the earl of Buckingham, who stated that he had acquitted himself much to his satisfaction.\n\nFroissart describes a tournament at Cambray in 1385, held on the marriage of the Count d'Ostrevant to the daughter of Duke Philip of Burgundy. The tournament was held in the market-place of the town, and forty knights took part. The king jousted with a knight of Hainault, Sir John Destrenne, for the prize of a clasp of precious stones, taken off from the bosom of the Duchess of Burgundy; it was won by Sir Destrenne, and formally presented by the Admiral of France and Sir Guy de la Trimouille.\n\nA knightly duel in this period usually consisted in three courses of jousting, and three blows and strokes exchanged with battle-axes, swords, and daggers. This number tended to be extended towards the end of the century, until the most common number was five, as in the duel between Sir Thomas Harpenden and Messire Jean des Barres, at Montereau sur Yonne in 1387 (\"cinq lances a cheval, cinq coups d'épée, cinq coups de dague et cinq coups de hache\"). Later could be as high as ten or even twelve. In the 1387 encounter, the first four courses of the joust were run without decisive outcome, but in the fifth Sir Thomas was unhorsed and lost consciousness. He was revived, however, and all the strokes and blows could be duly exchanged, without any further injury.\n\nOn another instance, a meeting with sharp lances was arranged to take place near Nantes, under the auspices of the Constable of France and the Earl of Buckingham. The first encounter was a combat on foot, with sharp spears, in which one of the cavaliers was slightly wounded; the pair then ran three courses with the lance without further mishap. Next Sir John Ambreticourt of Hainault and Sir Tristram de la Jaille of Poitou advanced from the ranks and jousted three courses, without hurt. A duel followed between Edward Beauchamp, son of Sir Robert Beauchamp, and the bastard Clarius de Savoye. Clarius was much the stronger man of the two, and Beauchamp was unhorsed. The bastard then offered to fight another English champion, and an esquire named Jannequin Finchly came forward in answer to the call; the combat with swords and lances was very violent, but neither of the parties was hurt.\n\nAnother encounter took place between John de Chatelmorant and Jannequin Clinton, in which the Englishman was unhorsed. Finally Chatelmorant fought with Sir William Farrington, the former receiving a dangerous wound in the thigh, for which the Englishman was greatly blamed, as being an infraction of the rules of the tourney, but an accident was pleaded just as in the case of the 1380 duel between Gauvain Micaille and Joachim Cator.\n\nThe medieval joust took place on an open field. Indeed, the term \"joust\" meant \"a meeting\" and referred to arranged combat in general, not just the jousting with lances. At some point in the 14th century, a cloth barrier was introduced as an option to separate the contestants. This barrier was presumably known as \"tilt\" in Middle English (a term with an original meaning of \"a cloth covering\"). It became a wooden barrier or fence in the 15th century, now known as \"tilt barrier\", and \"tilt\" came to be used as a term for the joust itself by . The purpose of the tilt barrier was to prevent collisions and to keep the combatants at an optimal angle for breaking the lance. This greatly facilitated the control of the horse and allowed the rider to concentrate on aiming the lance. The introduction of the barrier seems to have originated in the south, as it only became a standard feature of jousting in Germany in the 16th century, and was there called the Italian or \" mode. Dedicated tilt-yards with such barriers were built in England from the time of Henry VIII.\nSpecialised jousting armour was produced in the late 15th to 16th century. It was heavier than suits of plate armour intended for combat, and could weigh as much as 50 kg (110 lb), compared to some 25 kg (55 lb) for field armour; as it did not need to permit free movement of the wearer, the only limiting factor was the maximum weight that could be carried by a warhorse of the period.\n\nDuring the 1490s, emperor Maximilian I invested a lot of effort into perfecting the sport, for which he received his nickname of \"The Last Knight\". ' and ' were two sportive forms of the joust developed during the 15th century and practised throughout the 16th century. The armours used for these two respective styles of the joust was known as ' and ', respectively.The ' in particular developed into extremely heavy armour which completely inhibited the movement of the rider, in its latest forms resembling an armour-shaped cabin integrated into the horse armour more than a functional suit of armour. Such forms of sportive equipment during the final phase of the joust in 16th-century Germany gave rise to modern misconceptions about the heaviness or clumsiness of \"medieval armour\", as notably popularised by Mark Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\". The extremely heavy helmets of the ' are explained by the fact that the aim was to detach the crest of the opponent's helmet, resulting in frequent full impact of the lance to the helmet.\n\nBy contrast the ' was a type of joust with lighter contact. Here, the aim was to hit the opponent's shield. The specialised ' was developed on the request of Maximilian, who desired a return to a more agile form of joust compared to the heavily armoured \"full contact\" '. In the ', the shield was attached to the armour with a mechanism of springs and would detach itself upon contact.\n\nIn France, the 1559 death of King Henry II of wounds suffered in a tournament led to the end of jousting as a sport.\n\nThe tilt continued through Henry VIII and onto the reign of Elizabeth I. Under her rule, tournaments were seen as more of a parade or show than an actual martial exercise.\n\nThe last Elizabethan Accession Day tilt was held in November 1602; Elizabeth died the following spring. Tilts continued as part of festivities marking the Accession Day of James I, 24 March, until 1624, the year before his death. In the early 17th century, the joust was replaced as the equine highlight of court festivities by large \"horse-ballet\" displays called carousels, although non-combat competitions such as the ring-tilt lasted until the 18th century.\n\nOne attempt to revive the joust was the Eglinton Tournament of 1839.\n\nThe two most common kinds of horse used for jousting were warmblood \"chargers\" and larger \"destriers\". Chargers were medium-weight horses bred and trained for agility and stamina. Destriers were heavier, similar to today's Andalusian horse, but not as large as the modern draft horse.\n\nDuring a jousting tournament, the horses were cared for by their grooms in their respective tents. They wore caparisons, a type of ornamental cloth featuring the owner's heraldic signs. Competing horses had their heads protected by a chanfron, an iron shield for protection from otherwise lethal lance hits (Clayton 22-56).\n\nOther forms of equipment on the horse included long-necked spurs which enabled the rider to control the horse with extended legs, a saddle with a high back to provide leverage during the charge or when hit, as well as stirrups for the necessary leverage to deliver blows with the lance (Tkačenko).\n\nJousting re-enactors have been active since the 1970s. A jousting show took place in 1972 at the Principality of Gwrych in North Wales near Abergele. The Company of Knights Limited, founded in early 1974, organised jousting shows including from five to as many as fifty actors.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1982 the Little England theme park in Orlando, Florida was planned as a jousting stadium. Although the first phase of the project was constructed, high interest rates cancelled the project. The medieval dinner re-enactment company Medieval Times includes the sport in its dinner show. Jousting shows are also offered seasonally at Warwick Castle and Hever Castle in the United Kingdom. And groups like the Knights of Royal England travel around Britain and Europe staging medieval Jousting Tournaments; at the Danish museum Middelaldercentret there are daily tournaments during the season.\n\nJousting exhibitions are also sometimes featured in Renaissance fairs or other historical markets.\n\n\"The Knights of Valour\" was a theatrical jousting group formed by Shane Adams in 1993. Members of this group began to practice jousting competitively, and their first tournament was held in 1997. Adams founded the World Championship Jousting Association (WCJA) as a body dedicated to jousting as a combat sport, which held its inaugural tournament in Port Elgin, Ontario on 24 July 1999. The sport is presented in the 2012 television show \"Full Metal Jousting\", hosted by Adams. The rules are inspired by \"Realgestech\" (also \"Plankengestech\"), one of the forms of \"stechen\" practised in 16th-century Germany, where reinforcing pieces were added to the jousting armour to serve as designated target areas. Instead of using a shield, the jousters aim for such a reinforcing piece added to the armour's left shoulder known as \"\" (also \"Stechtartsche\"). A number of Jousting events are held regularly in Europe, some organised by Arne Koets, including The Grand Tournament of Sankt Wendel and The Grand Tournament at Schaffhausen. Koets is one of a number of Jousters that travels internationally to events.\n\n\n\n"}

This list does not include books designed for use as premade adventures.\n\nThe \"Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set\" was the successor to original \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and was released while TSR, Inc. was working on the \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" set. This set was the beginning of the split into two separate games, driven by disagreements on the direction the game should take. The Basic set retained the simplicity and flexibility of the original game while Gary Gygax took \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" in a more structured and complicated direction.\n\nInitially it was expected that players would start using Basic edition and then graduate to \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\". However, in 1981 the \"Basic Set\" underwent a complete revision and not long after this the \"Expert Set\" was released for the first time. All references to a progression from the \"Basic Set\" to \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" were removed from the games and supplements as TSR, Inc. made clear that the expected progression was from the Basic Set to the Expert Set. From this point the \"D&D\" dichotomy became fixed and the \"Basic/Expert\" pair were considered a completely separate game from \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\".\n\n\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" (\"AD&D\") greatly expanded upon the rules and settings of the original \"D&D\" game when it was released in 1977. As such, this edition saw the publication of numerous books to assist players. The naming of the core books in this edition became the standard for all later editions.\n\nAround 1983, books such as \"MM\", \"PHB\", \"DMG\" and \"DDG\", all previous hardcover releases except \"Fiend Folio\", were upgraded with new cover art and unified in \"orange spine\" look. This included only minimal text change such as removal of rape references in \"DMG\" (books are now labeled \"ages 10 and up\"). \"MM2\" and the rest of the series followed the same format. By the end of its first decade, \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" line had expanded to a library of 14 hardcover rulebooks, including three books of monsters, and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings. \n\n\nIn 1989, \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" 2nd edition was published. Initially, the second edition would consolidate the game, with two essential hardcovers and a 3-ring monster document binder that Dungeon Masters can sort contents as they wish. Periodically, TSR published 3 lines of optional rulebooks (PHBR/DMGR/HR) and additional monster compendium to enhance game play.\n\nHowever, by popular demand TSR released a hardcover monster book in 1993. Also by 1995, with power creep from optional classes and races becoming prominent, they were forced to abandon their original plan and revise the entire line. Core rules were rewritten, reorganized and accompanied with new logo, new art and black bordered cover style but had only a few meaningful rule changes. Optional rules were also revised and reorganized in hardcover books in the same look.\n\n\n\n\n\nA major revision of the \"AD&D\" rules was released in 2000. As the Basic game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word \"Advanced\" was dropped and the new edition was called just \"Dungeons & Dragons\", but was still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or 3E for short).\n\nThis edition was the first to be released by Wizards of the Coast after their acquisition of the company, as well as the first to allow third-party companies to make supplemental materials by use of the Open Game License. A series of Map Folios were also produced.\n\nIn July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition \"D&D\" rules (termed version 3.5) was released that incorporated numerous rule changes, as well as expanding the \"Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual\".\n\n\n\n\nThe books from the \"main\" product line of 4th Edition are split into Core Rules and Supplement books. Unlike third edition of \"Dungeons & Dragons\", which had the core rulebooks released in monthly installments, the 4th editions of the \"Player's Handbook\", \"Monster Manual\", and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were all released in June 2008.\n\nIn addition, beginning in September 2010 the stand-alone \"Essentials\" product line was released, aiming at novice players.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially promoted in playtest materials as \"Dungeons & Dragons Next\", the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" 5th Edition was released in a staggered fashion through the second half of 2014. Unlike previous editions, this edition of the game was developed partly via a public open playtest.\n"}

Grand nephew of Naftali Herz Imber, author of the Israeli national anthem 'Hatikva'.\nAfter escaping the Nazi concentration camp in Dachau, he pledged to dedicate his art to perpetuating the memory of the Holocaust. Among his more famous works are \"The Hope\" and \"The Love of Torah\". His work can be seen around the world, in Northern Israel, the United States, and the Venezuelan Museum of Natural History in Caracas.\n\nNicky Imber was born in Vienna, Austria. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Vienna, he drew anti-Nazi caricatures for Jewish student publications. After several thwarted attempts by the family to leave Vienna, in 1938, in the wake of the 'Anschluss', Imber was deported to Dachau. Witnessing the murders of family and friends, he plotted his escape. Using skills he had learned in art school, he made a face mask out of bread and sand, stole a Nazi soldier's uniform and walked out the front gate unnoticed. In 1940, he boarded a ship headed to Haifa. The ship's passengers were refused entry by the British mandatory authorities and imprisoned in a detention camp in Mauritius.\n\nIn 1943, Imber worked out a deal with the authorities for his release by joining the British Army, serving as a war artist and a dental assistant in East Africa. After the war, he opened an art school in Nairobi, Kenya, and worked as a photographer and a safari guide.\n\nIn 1949 to 1954, he lived in Venezuela, where he was contracted to do an East African Diorama series. The National Museum added an entire wing to display it.During this period he got married and had a daughter Raquel, who accompanied and assisted him.\nIn 1959, Imber was commissioned to create sculptures and dioramas for the Haifa Prehistory Museum at Gan Ha-em in Haifa, Israel. In 1960 he returned to Venezuela to restaured the Phelps series of Dioramas for the Museum in Caracas.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1971 he travelled extensively around Europe and after establishing an international name for himself, returned to the United States. In New York he became famous for his realistic oil paintings of portraits of Aga Khan, Tyrone Power, Ava Gardner, David Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, Sir Richard Burton and Simon Bolivar.\n\nReturning to Venezuela in 1976, Imber created huge sculptures of prehistoric animals, forming one of the world's largest historical animal parks. During this period he also created realistic sculptures of famous Venezuelans for the country's National Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1978, Imber spent three years designing and building a Holocaust memorial park at the entrance to the city of Karmiel located in the Galilee, entitled 'From Holocaust to Resurrection.' Imber also established animal theme playgrounds around the city. \n\nIn the 1980s, Imber established residence in Karmiel, Israel. In Israel he was inspired to create highly emotional, life like collections.\n\nNicky Imber died in 1996 in Vienna, Austria.\n\n"}

The artwork consists of an enclosed park space in the form of a square placed within a square, the inner parameter being made from limestone-filled gabion baskets, and the outer from indigenous trees and shrubs. The park space is only accessible by a concrete enclosed tunnel. The installation has a landscape design that consists of over 3,000 individual plants species from 53 different genera.\n\n\"Park of Laments\" is situated in the woodland area southeast of the lake in 100 acres. The overall form of the park is a square within a square, one rigid and made of limestone-filled gabion baskets, while the other consisting of indigenous trees and shrubs. Natural, minimalist wooden benches, made from kiln-treated poplar, are built into the edge of an amphitheater of stairs, vines, and stones. The viewer begins their experience by walking down a concrete platform flanked on both sides with limestone-filled gabion baskets and indigenous shrubbery. During their walk, the baskets become taller in the form of a progressive step system that correlates with the actual topography of the landscape; the minimum height being at approximately 2’, and the maximum at about 12’. At that point the viewer is taken underground through a dark, pre-cast concrete “box culvert” tunnel (made of nine individual segments, attached and mortared together) and walk towards the sunlit area on the other end of the tunnel. The entire length of the tunnel is approximately 72’ in length. The visitor then proceeds up the stairs to reach the enclosed park area, where no other portion of the Art & Nature Park is visible due to both the surrounding gabion baskets and natural woodlands. There the visitor may sit or interact with the space and be surrounded by over 53 different indigenous plant species located within the installation (more than 3,000 plants total).\n\n\"Park of Laments\" is a project that follows along the lines of Jaar’s Public Intervention series in which the viewer/visitor is an active participant within the environment and contributes to the underlying theme or concept of the project. Visitors enter the work outside the park and continue through an underground tunnel. Moving towards the light, they approach stairs that lead them above ground into the center of the park where they are greeted by an isolated, calm, and secluded area conducive to meditation and lamentation. Like many of Jaar’s Interventions, the intention of the space’s design is to initiate a physical, emotional, and psychological journey within the viewer, ultimately drawing parallels between the experience of physical space and human emotion.\n\nThis artwork was installed at the IMA in May 2010.\n\nAlfred Jaar (b. 1956) is an artist, architect, and filmmaker who lives and works in New York and was born in Santiago de Chile. He attended Instituto Chileno-Norteamericano de Cultura, Santiago (1979) and Universidad de Chile, Santiago (1981). In addition to Park of Laments, Jaar has created more than sixty Public Interventions around the world. Alfredo Jaar incorporates photography, film, text, and sculpture into works that look to the relationship between ethics and aesthetics. His works draw from first-hand witness accounts and research of issues such as toxic waste in Africa, gold mining in Brazil, and genocide in Rwanda. Jaar has received many awards, including a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Award (2000); a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (1987); and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts (1987); and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1985). He has had major exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (2005); Museo d’Arte Contemporanea, Rome (2005); MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts (1999); and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1992).\n\nIn general, the maintenance, upkeep, and conservation of \"Park of Laments\" must be a cooperative effort and responsibility that is shared by conservators, grounds crew, security guards, horticulture personnel, curators, and registrars. The multifaceted artwork requires the attention of various museum professionals in order to maintain both the physical and conceptual aspects of the installation.\n\n"}

Size 0 and 00 were invented due to the changing of clothing sizes over time (referred to as vanity sizing or size inflation), which has caused the adoption of lower numbers. For example, a 2011 size 0 is equivalent to a 2001 size 2, and is larger than a 1970 size 6 or 1958 size 8. Modern size 0 clothing, depending on brand and style, fits measurements of chest-stomach-hips from 30-22-32 inches (76-56-81 cm) to 36-28-36 inches (90-71½-90 cm). Size 00 can be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 inches (1 to 5 cm) smaller than size 0. Size zero often refers to extremely thin individuals (especially women and adolescent girls), or trends associated with them.\n\nThe use of size 0 in advertisements and products of the clothing industry has been met with some media attention. In July 2009, Katie Green won a competition to represent Wonderbra. They referred her to the Premier Model Management agency for representation. Green reported that \"one of the guys from the PR agency from Wonderbra\" insisted that she lose weight, that it wasn't normal for models to be a (UK) size 8. \"Unless I could drop down to that weight, they wouldn't be willing to get me more work.\" Green at first complied, but then quit the agency. She then, with Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Öpik, launched a campaign titled \"Say No to Size Zero\". They began a petition drive with the goal to put an end to size zero and underweight models on the catwalk or working in the fashion industry. They set a goal to obtain 20,000 signatures and plan to present it to the UK Prime Minister and Parliament. They are campaigning for legislation that would require regular health checkups for all models before undertaking any assignments.\n\nAfter the death of Luisel Ramos from anorexia in August, 2006, Madrid Fashion Week banned size zero models the following month, and the Milan fashion show took the same action shortly afterward, banning models with a body mass index (BMI) of 18 or below. As a result, five models were banned from taking part.\n\nAs of 2007, the British Fashion Council promoted the creation of a task force to establish guidelines for the fashion industry. They also urged fashion designers to use healthy models.\n\nItalian fashion labels Prada, Versace and Armani have agreed to ban size zero models from their catwalks. Under the new self-regulation code drawn up in Italy by the government and designers, all models in future shows will be \"full-bodied\", and larger sizes will be introduced at shows. Fashion designer Giorgio Armani has given support to the effort to eliminate ultra-thin models. \"The time has now come for clarity. We all need to work together against anorexia.\"\n\nIsrael banned underweight models in March 2012. Their law stipulates that women and men hired as models must be certified by a physician as having a body mass index (BMI) of no less than 18.5. The legislation also requires the inclusion of an informational note in adverts using photos manipulated to make models look thinner. There were divergent views on the ban within the Israeli fashion industry. One modelling agent, who had helped promote the bill, suggested that the fall in typical dress sizes for models in the preceding 15–20 years amounted to \"the difference between death and life\". However, another described the law as \"arbitrary\" and \"not appropriate for every model\".\n\n"}

The book has seen publication in Spanish (1984), German (1985), Italian (1986), French (1988), and English (1991). The \"Book\" in 1991 had four English editions by different translators: Richard Zenith (editor and translator), Iain Watson, Alfred MacAdam and Margaret Jull Costa. The \"Book\" is a bestseller, especially in German (16 editions, from different translators and publishers).\n\nThe book was listed on the Norwegian Book Clubs list of the 100 best works of fiction of all time, based on the responses of 100 authors from 54 countries.\n\nTeresa Sobral Cunha considers that there are two versions of \"The Book of Disquiet\". According to Cunha, who with Jacinto do Prado Coelho and Maria Aliete Galhoz edited the first edition in 1982, there are two authors of the book: Vicente Guedes in a first phase (in the 1910s and 20s), and the aforementioned Bernardo Soares (late 1920s and 30s).\n\nHowever, António Quadros considers that the first phase of the book belongs to Pessoa himself. The second phase, more personal and diary-like, is the one credited to Bernardo Soares.\n\nRichard Zenith, editor of a new Portuguese edition in 1998, took the option of presenting a single volume, as in his English translation of 1991. In his introduction, he writes that \"if Bernardo Soares does not measure up to the full Pessoa, neither are his diary writings the sum total of \"Disquietude\", to which he was after all a johnny-come-lately. \"The Book of Disquietude\" was various books (yet ultimately one book), with various authors (yet ultimately one author), and even the word \"disquietude\" changes meaning as time passes.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3174307", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3174307", "title": "The Three Princes of Serendip", "text": "The Three Princes of Serendip\n\nThe Three Princes of Serendip is the English version of the story \"Peregrinaggio di tre giovani figliuoli del re di Serendippo\" published by Michele Tramezzino in Venice in 1557. Tramezzino claimed to have heard the story from one , who had translated the Persian fairy tale into Italian, adapting Book One of Amir Khusrau's \"Hasht-Bihisht\" of 1302. The story first came to English via a French translation, and now exists in several out-of-print translations.\n\"Serendip\" is the Old Persian name for Sri Lanka (Ceylon).\n\nThe story has become known in the English-speaking world as the source of the word serendipity, coined by Horace Walpole because of his recollection of the part of the \"silly fairy tale\" in which the three princes by \"accidents and sagacity\" discern the nature of a lost camel. In a separate line of descent, the story was used by Voltaire in his 1747 \"Zadig\", and through this contributed to both the evolution of detective fiction and the self-understanding of scientific method.\n\n\"In ancient times there existed in the country of Serendippo, in the Far East, a great and powerful king by the name of Giaffer. He had three sons who were very dear to him. And being a good father and very concerned about their education, he decided that he had to leave them endowed not only with great power, but also with all kinds of virtues of which princes are particularly in need.\"\n\nThe father searches out the best possible tutors. \"And to them he entrusted the training of his sons, with the understanding that the best they could do for him was to teach them in such a way that they could be immediately recognized as his very own.\"\n\nWhen the tutors are pleased with the excellent progress that the three princes make in the arts and sciences, they report it to the king. He, however, still doubts their training, and summoning each in turn, declares that he will retire to the contemplative life leaving them as king. Each politely declines, affirming the father's superior wisdom and fitness to rule.\n\nThe king is pleased, but fearing that his sons' education may have been too sheltered and privileged, feigns anger at them for refusing the throne and sends them away from the land.\n\nNo sooner do the three princes arrive abroad than they trace clues to identify precisely a camel they have never seen. They conclude that the camel is lame, blind in one eye, missing a tooth, carrying a pregnant woman, and bearing honey on one side and butter on the other. When they later encounter the merchant who has lost the camel, they report their observations to him. He accuses them of stealing the camel and takes them to the Emperor Beramo, where he demands punishment.\n\nBeramo then asks how they are able to give such an accurate description of the camel if they have never seen it. It is clear from the princes' replies that they have used small clues to infer cleverly the nature of the camel.\n\nGrass had been eaten from the side of the road where it was less green, so the princes had inferred that the camel was blind on the other side. Because there were lumps of chewed grass on the road that were the size of a camel’s tooth, they inferred they had fallen through the gap left by a missing tooth. The tracks showed the prints of only three feet, the fourth being dragged, indicating that the animal was lame. That butter was carried on one side of the camel and honey on the other was evident because ants had been attracted to melted butter on one side of the road and flies to spilled honey on the other.\n\nAs for the woman, one of the princes said: \"I guessed that the camel must have carried a woman, because I had noticed that near the tracks where the animal had knelt down the imprint of a foot was visible. Because some urine was nearby, I wet my fingers and as a reaction to its odour I felt a sort of carnal concupiscence, which convinced me that the imprint was of a woman’s foot.\"\n\n\"I guessed that the same woman must have been pregnant,\" said another prince, \"because I had noticed nearby handprints which were indicative that the woman, being pregnant, had helped herself up with her hands while urinating.\"\n\nAt this moment, a traveller enters the scene to say that he has just found a missing camel wandering in the desert. Beramo spares the lives of the three princes, lavishes rich rewards on them, and appoints them to be his advisors.\n\nThe three princes have many other adventures, where they continue to display their sagacity, stories-within-stories are told, and, of course, there is a happy ending.\n\nThe fairy tale \"The Three Princes of Serendip\" is based upon the life of Persian King Bahram V, who ruled the Sassanid Empire (420–440). Stories of his rule are told in epic poetry of the region (Firdausi's \"Shahnameh\" of 1010, Nizami's \"Haft Paykar\" of 1197, Khusrau's Hasht Bihisht of 1302), parts of which are based upon historical facts with embellishments derived from folklore going back hundreds of years to oral traditions in India and \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\". With the exception of the well-known camel story, English translations are very hard to come by.\n\nA version of the fable of a camel blind in one eye is included in the Talmud, attributed to Rabbi Yochanan. While it might be seen as implying that gentiles, in comparison to Jews, are rude and defecate on the road, it is worth noting that Jewish law has strong injunctions of modesty and cleanliness, including strict injunctions against open or public urination or defecation.\n\nIn chapter three of Voltaire's 1747 novel Zadig, there is an adaptation of \"The Three Princes of Serendip\", this time involving, instead of a camel, a horse and a dog, which the eponymous Zadig is able to describe in great detail from his observations of the tracks on the ground. When he is accused of theft and taken before the judges, Zadig clears himself by recounting the mental process which allows him to describe the two animals he has never seen: \"I saw on the sand the tracks of an animal, and I easily judged that they were those of a little dog. Long, shallow furrows imprinted on little rises in the sand between the tracks of the paws informed me that it was a bitch whose dugs were hanging down, and that therefore she had had puppies a few days before.\"\n\nZadig's detective work was influential. Cuvier wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology:\n\nT. H. Huxley, the proponent of Darwin’s theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article \"The method of Zadig\":\nEdgar Allan Poe in his turn was probably inspired by Zadig when he created C. Auguste Dupin in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\", calling it a \"tale of ratiocination\" wherein \"the extent of information obtained lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation.\"\nPoe's M. Dupin stories mark the start of the modern detective fiction genre. Émile Gaboriau, and Arthur Conan Doyle were perhaps also influenced by Zadig.\n\n"}
{"id": "48501189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48501189", "title": "This is For You, Anna", "text": "This is For You, Anna\n\nThis is For You, Anna is a 1983 play devised by a collective of women based out of Toronto theatre company Nightwood Theatre. Initially developed as a 20-minute production for the Women's Perspective Festival \"This is For You, Anna\" was re-written for longer performances, and went on to tour Canada and Britain throughout the 80's. The play was created collectively in response to a current event of the time wherein German woman Marianne Bachmeier walked into a courtroom and shot the man who killed her daughter. The feminist play explores themes of violence, revenge, domesticity, and questions the roles of western women at the end of the 20th century.\n\n\"This is For You, Anna\" was developed through the process of collective creation. This medium operates from a foundation of performers' own ideas and experiences, and the final production is largely devised within the rehearsal process itself. This differs from more traditional means of theatre creation in which the script is written independently of the rehearsal process, the cast are aware of their roles before the process begins, and the actors have less of a say in the content of the piece. Additionally, many collective creation plays are characterized by an episodic, nonlinear narrative, actors playing multiple characters within the narrative, and a collaborative creative process which often explores the creators' own interests. The qualities of collective creation are evident in \"This is For You, Anna\", as it rejects a linear chronology, each actor plays a number of roles (including each of the four actors portraying a different incarnation of Marianne Bachmeier herself), and the original cast of actors were also intimately involved in the creation of the text.\n\n\"This is For You, Anna\" is a one-act play composed of eight scenes which flow together thematically, though are not necessarily connected chronologically. The play makes use of a lyrical poetic style, and live accordion music is used to accompany frequent musical numbers which help to tell the story. This music does not work to create a traditionally polished musical theatre aesthetic. Rather, the music and storytelling create an ethereal, experimental 'folk' atmosphere characteristic of the early days of Nightwood Theatre. The most frequently recurring character in the play is Marianne Bachmeier who is played by each of the four actors throughout the play. This is indicated in the script as characters named Marianne 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nThe play opens on all four actors as different embodiments of Marianne, each in their own worlds. They reflect on the act of walking into the courtroom before the shooting. The scene transitions into that of a mother telling her daughter a bedtime story in which a woman is tortured by a wealthy baron she loves. The daughter reimagines the ending of the story to include the woman getting revenge on the man who tortured her, and the accordionist turns this new ending into a song. Scene three begins with a narrator providing backstory on Marianne's life, and a brief overview of the event which inspired the play. All four actors then embody Marianne at different points of her life, having conversations with various other absent characters such as Anna (her daughter who was killed), her ex-partner, and an interviewer visiting her in prison. In scene four, the actors tell a paraphrased version of the Roman legend of Lucretia, which is reinterpreted to focus on the parallels between Marianne's own story and the legend itself: namely victim blaming and a desire for revenge. In scene five, the four actors take on characters which speak to their own experiences with abuse and violence. They perform regimented choreography and talk amongst themselves; engaging in dialogue which communicates nuanced perspectives on the complications of living with and leaving abusive partners. Scene six deals with media portrayals of 'victims' and positions these as potentially problematic. In this scene, one of the actors takes on an 'interviewer' role, grills the other three with personal questions, and demands them to perform certain acts on command. In scene seven, all actors take on the role of Marianne once more, and delve into her intimate thoughts and feelings surrounding the courtroom shooting. The play concludes with 'The Jury Scene' in which the actors take on the role of the jury which found Marianne guilty of murdering the man who murdered her daughter. The characters in this scene condemn Marianne for her actions and defend the man's point of view (who argued in court that Marianne's seven-year-old daughter had flirted with him which led him to commit the murder).

The most valuable of all is the votive crown of king Reccesuinth with its blue sapphires from Sri Lanka and pendilia. Though the treasure is now divided and much has disappeared, it represents the best surviving group of Early Medieval Christian votive offerings.\n\nThe treasure, which represents the high point of Visigothic goldsmith's work, was dug between 1858 and 1861 in an orchard called \"Guarrazar\", in Guadamur, very close to Toledo, Spain. The treasure was divided, with some objects going to the Musée de Cluny in Paris and the rest to the armouries of the Palacio Real in Madrid (today in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain). In 1921 and 1936, some items of the Treasure of Guarrazar were stolen and have disappeared.\n\nSome comparable Visigothic filigree gold was found in 1926 at Torredonjimeno in the province of Jaén, consisting of fragments of votive crowns and crosses.\n\nThe jewellery found at Guarrazar is part of a continuous tradition of Iberian metalworking that goes back to prehistoric times. These Visigothic works were influenced heavily by the Byzantines, but the techniques of gem encrustation found at Guarrazar were practised throughout the Germanic world and the style of the lettering was Germanic too. The crowns, however, were purely Byzantine in form and never meant to be worn. They were gifts to the church, to be hung above the altar.\n\nThe most valuable remaining pieces of the find are the two royal votive crowns: one of King Reccesuinth and one of King Suinthila. Both are made of gold, encrusted with sapphires, pearls, and other precious stones. Suinthila's was stolen in 1921 and never recovered. There are several other small crowns and many votive crosses. There were belts in the original find as well, but these have since vanished.\n\nThese findings, together with other of some neighbors and with the archaeological excavation of the Ministry of Public Works and the Royal Academy of History (April 1859), formed a group consisting of:\n\n\nThere were also many fragments of sculptures and the remains of a building, perhaps a Roman sanctuary or place of purification. After its dedication to Christian worship as a church or oratory, it housed a number of graves. A skeleton lying on a bed of lime and sand was found in the best preserved grave. Its well-preserved stone slate has a Latin inscription that mentions a priest named Crispín, dating from 693 (51st year of the reign of Égica, year of the Sixteenth Council of Toledo). This slate is now in the National Archeological Museum of Spain in Madrid. The inscription on the Sónnica cross, a piece preserved in Paris, gives an indication about the name of this church.\nAccording to some hypothesis, the monastery of Sancta Maria in Sorbaces of Guarrazar served as a hideout for the real treasure of the court, Toledo churches and monasteries to prevent their capture by the Muslims' invasion of Spain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "857633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857633", "title": "Vernacular architecture", "text": "Vernacular architecture\n\nVernacular architecture is an architectural style that is designed based on local needs, availability of construction materials and reflecting local traditions. Traditionally, vernacular architecture did not use formally-schooled architects, but relied on the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. However, since the late 19th century many professional architects have worked in this style and interest in vernacular architecture now forms part of a broader interest in sustainable design.\n\nVernacular architecture can be contrasted against polite architecture which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term traditional architecture, which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.\n\nThe term vernacular is derived from the Latin \"vernaculus\", meaning \"domestic, native, indigenous\"; from \"verna\", meaning \"native slave\" or \"home-born slave\". The word probably derives from an older Etruscan word.\n\nThe term is borrowed from linguistics, where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place or group. In architecture, it refers to that type of architecture which is indigenous to a specific time or place (not imported or copied from elsewhere). It is most often applied to residential buildings.\n\nThe terms vernacular, folk, traditional, and popular architecture are sometimes used synonymously. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in \"Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions\" where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or \"folk architecture\" is built by \"persons not professionally trained in building arts\"; where \"vernacular architecture\" is still \"of the common people\" but may be built by trained professionals such as through an apprenticeship, but still using local, traditional designs and materials. \"Traditional architecture\" is architecture is passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term \"primitive architecture\" as having a negative connotation. The term popular architecture is used more in eastern Europe and is synonymous with folk or vernacular architecture.\nRonald Brunskill has defined the ultimate in vernacular architecture as:\n...a building designed by an amateur without any training in design; the individual will have been guided by a series of conventions built up in his locality, paying little attention to what may be fashionable. The function of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and imported quite exceptionally.\n\nThe vernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called \"traditional\" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of polite design: temples and palaces, for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of \"vernacular.\" In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with 'the polite', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional architect for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content, often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World\" defines vernacular architecture as:\n...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce them.\n\nVernacular architecture is a broad, grassroots concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecture and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as folk art is contrasted with fine art.\nArchitecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. Paul Oliver, in his book \"Dwellings\", states: \"...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular\". Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: \"\"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people.\"\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright described vernacular architecture as \"Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling\". suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was \"for us better worth study than all the highly self-conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe\".\n\nSince at least the Arts and Crafts Movement, many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy was appointed to design the town of New Gourna near Luxor. Having studied traditional Nubian settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons, but is the first recorded attempt by an architect to address the social and environmental requirements of building users by adopting the methods and forms of the vernacular.\n\nIn 1964 the exhibition \"Architecture Without Architects\" was put on at the Museum of Modern Art, New York by Bernard Rudofsky. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: \"For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be.\"\n\nSince the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular.\n\nSri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in South Asia. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include Charles Correa, a well known Indian architect; Muzharul Islam and Bashirul Haq, internationally known Bangladeshi architects; Balkrishna Doshi, another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in Ahmedabad to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and Sheila Sri Prakash who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck was also a proponent of vernacular architecture. Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be Samuel Mockbee, Christopher Alexander and Paolo Soleri.\n\nOliver claims that:\nAs yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and geography\n\nArchitects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design. \n\nVernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in structural forms.\n\nOne of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non-existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building.\nBuildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elemens included such design features as courtyards gardens with water features, scree n walls, reflected light, \"mashrabiya\" (the distinctive oriel window with timber lattice-work) and \"bad girs\" (wind-catchers). \n\nBuildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region – leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the Queenslander is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states. Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage.\n\nClimatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular Architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens.\n\nThe way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings.\n\nFor example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms.\n\nCulture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs.\n\nThere are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as huts, and if necessary, transport such as tents.\n\nThe Inuit people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the igloo (for winter) and the tupiq (for summer). The Sami of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture including the lavvu and goahti. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture.\n\nMany nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their gers (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in Iran. Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.\n\nAll the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperaturs of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional Berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle – and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.\n\nThe type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that.\n\nMaterials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately \"designed\" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure.\n\nOver time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale.\n\nThe local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) were part of a self-contained wind-powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular.\n\nConstruction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include:\n\nFollowing the eclipse by International Modernism of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American Arts and Crafts buildings and European National Romanticism, an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was Bernard Rudofsky's 1964 book \"Architecture Without Architects: a short introduction to non-pedigreed architecture\", based on his MoMA exhibition. The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and \"hard-won knowledge\" inherent in vernacular buildings, from Polish salt-caves to gigantic Syrian water wheels to Moroccan desert fortresses, and was considered iconoclastic at the time. Rudofsky was, however, very much a Romantic who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment. Rudofsky's book was also based largely on photographs and not on on-site study.\n\nA more nuanced work is the \"Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World\" edited in 1997 by Paul Oliver of the Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to \"ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term.\" Christopher Alexander, in his book \"A Pattern Language\", attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. Howard Davis's book \"The Culture of Building\" details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions.\n\nSome extend the term vernacular to include any architecture outside the academic mainstream. The term \"commercial vernacular\", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of Robert Venturi's \"Learning from Las Vegas\", refers to 20th-century American suburban tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an \"industrial vernacular\" with its emphasis on the aesthetics of shops, garages and factories. Some have linked vernacular with \"off-the-shelf\" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design.\n\nAmong those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of sociology. In this, many were influenced by The Practice of Everyday Life (1984) by Michel de Certeau.\n\nAn appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to disasters and the following construction of transitional shelter if it is needed. The work Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations, produced by Shelter Centre covers the use of vernacular in humanitarian response and argues its importance.\n\nThe value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.\n\nAs many jurisdictions introduce tougher building codes and zoning regulations, \"folk architects\" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities.\n\nA case that made news in Russia was that of an Arkhangelsk entrepreneur Nikolay P. Sutyagin, who built what was reportedly the world's tallest single-family wooden house for himself and his family, only to see it condemned as a fire hazard. The 13-storey, tall structure, known locally as \"Sutyagin's skyscraper\" (), was found to be in violation of Arkhangelsk building codes, and in 2008 the courts ordered the building to be demolished by February 1, 2009. On December 26, 2008, the tower was pulled down, and the remainder was dismantled manually over the course of the next several months.\n\nIraq\nGermany\n\nScotland\n\n\nSpain\n\nUnited States\n\nUkraine\n\nDifferent regions in Ukraine have their own distinctive style of vernacular architecture. For example, in the Carpathian Mountains and the surrounding foothills, wood and clay are the primary traditional building materials. Ukrainian architecture is preserved at The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central Naddnipryanshchyna located in Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine.\n\nWales\n\nArchitecture of Wales\n\nIndigenous architecture\n\nHouse types:\n\nArchitectural elements\n\nBuilding techniques and materials:\n\nOrganizations:\n\nRegional vernacular architecture: \n\nExamples:\nPeople:\n\n"}
