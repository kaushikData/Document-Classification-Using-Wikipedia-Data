Unlike the African mainland, Cape Verde was uninhabited until 1461 when the Portuguese arrived, most of the other islands were first inhabited after the end of the 15th century. Its architecture was introduced in the 1460s and has its first origins from Portuguese settlers from the Madeira Islands, after the first arrival of mainland Africans, a bit of African architecture would be elements mainly in rural areas. The Manueline was its first architectural style on the island, it was later followed by Renaissance, Baroque, Pombaline (late-Baroque and Neoclassical), Early Modern and Modern. It was one of the last in the whole of Africa to introduce architecture late. Cape Verde has one of the richest architecture in the western portion of West Africa, the sub-Saharan portion, the richest probably being Mali.\n\nAfter independence, modern architecture along with African continued to be influenced in newer buildings and is now the dominant influence on its buildings in the nation today, in its newer resorts particularly in Sal features a mixture of Spanish, African, probably Mexican and Moorish elements of architecture including the Garupa and the Funana hotels, both owned by RIU. Also Aristides Pereira International Airport has a mixture of African, Capeverdean and Arabic-Moorish architecture.\n\nThe nation also has several buildings and homes with a resemblance of Portuguese and mainland African architectural origins.\n\nIts main architectural styles includes funco, dominant on the islands of Fogo, Santiago and Maio, loja, used for bars and sobrado, a house style particularly founded in the city of São Filipe in Fogo. In the Colonial times, the funco style were mainly used for blacks, the loja style were once used for the mixed people and the sobrado style were for the white people used before independence.\n\nThe first 500 years would have mainly Portuguese elements in its architecture and continued until the independence of Cape Verde in 1975.\n\nWhen the city of Ribeira Grande (now Cidade Velha) was enlarged in its early years in the 1450s, in the 1490s and the start of the 15th century, Manueline architecture would be featured in its buildings. Some of its styles survived in some buildings in São Filipe. The town's pillory (not a building) is one example, the other was Nossa Senhora do Rosário church, the world's first colonial church and the Sé Cathedral. After the Cassard expedition of 1712, all of its buildings were destroyed. Its ruins remain on a few. By the 20th century, there were rebuilt in different locations and these buildings are part of UNESCO's World Heritage Site since 2009.\n\nMost of Cidade Velha's 500 buildings until the destruction of the French featured Renaissance and Mannerist architecture, it included the churches of São Roque, São Pedro, Monte Alverne, Nossa Senhora da Conceição, the chapel of Santa Luzia, and the church and hospital of Santa Casa de Misericórdia.\n\nFort Real de São Filipe built on Achada de São Filipe sobre Ribeira Grande, a fort built in 1585 to protect from further attacks from corsairs after the damages during the raid by Sir Francis Drake, it was restored in 1968 and in 1999. Minimal architectural changes occurred with the Habsburg Philippine Dynasty in the Portuguese Empire which included Cape Verde for sixty years.\n\nFortim Carlota in São Filipe, Fogo are one of the buildings, a fortress featuring Restoration era architecture. The Convent of Saint Francis (São Francisco) in Cidade Velha was built in the mid-16th century, it was destroyed by the French in 1712 during a raid and has been restored.\n\nRibeira Grande has examples of late 18th century architecture in the center of the city.\n\nAs the colonial capital of Praia was moved in 1770, some architectural buildings were added including the warehouses and the port office, late Baroque Pombaline architecture appeared in Praia, almost all of these would be demolished by around the late 19th century and were replaced by neoclassical buildings. Only the warehouse survives today which is in Praia da Gamboa.\n\nOther examples is São Filipe's Our Lady of Conception church ( \"Nossa Senhora da Conceição\") which was built in a comparatively simple style at the end of the 19th century. Opposite the church there are several well-preserved colonial houses dating from the 18th century. Another one was the Pedra de Lume saltworks built in the early 20th century and its residential complexes.\n\nNeoclassical architecture dominated the building styles from 1822 up to the start of the 20th century, its most prominent were in Praia, the Platô and Mindelo. Praia underwent large modernization by the colonial governor João da Mata Chapuzet, one of the buildings he designed was Quartel Jaime Mota. Most of the buildings features roofs detached from its walls, common in Portugal and the Portuguese Empire at the time.\nAs Mindelo flourished in the mid to late 19th centuries with its coal refueling and telegraph services, numerous Pombaline and neoclassical architecture appeared across Mindelo. notable examples include Centro Nacional de Artesanato (founded as Centro de Artesanato), Palácio do Povo which features Indian style architecture with its walls and fences in pink, today which serves as the center of the island's administration and offices, others are Fortim d'El-Rei built in 1852 and used as a defense of Porto Grande and the city, the Mindelo Cultural Center, Mindelo Library, the old barracks, a replica of Lisbon's Torre de Belém, Paço do Concelho, Liceu Gil Eanes, the former British consulate, the French Cultural Center, bandstands or kiosks of Praças Estreia and Amilcar Cabral and the Mindelo Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace.\n\nOther notable examples include those in Praia, the Praia City Hall and the buildings around Albuquerque square (also the 12 de Setembro Square) including the kiosk, Escola Grande and its buildings around Loreno Square, Museu Etnográfico da Praia, Praia Cathedral, the former Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU) Praia branch which is now the headquarters of Banco Comercial do Atlântico, Hospital Agostinho Neto (first as Praia Hospital), Praia Maria and Boutique hotels, Palácio Cultural Ildo Lobo, the building where Quintal da Música is located and most of all the Presidential Palace of Cape Verde with its luxuriant garden. On Fogo in São Filipe including one that is now Casa de Memória, the town kiosk which is also used as a bandstand and the Museu Municipal de São Filipe featuring a traditional hut and the municipal halls of Paul and Ribeira Grande.\nOther cities featuring late Pombaline and neoclassical architecture across Cape Verde are in the centers of Paul (Pombas), Ponta do Sol, Porto Novo, built when it was called Carvoeiros, Ribeira Brava, Tarrafal de São Nicolau, a few in Santa Maria, Sal Rei, Cidade do Maio, Pedra Badejo, Assomada, Calheta de São Miguel, Tarrafal, Cova Figueira, Mosteiros, Furna, Fajã de Agua and Nova Sintra and villages including Rabil and Povoação Velha, both on Boa Vista.\n\nOther churches built that time included Nossa Senhora da Conceição church located near Povoação Velha.\n\nIn the late 19th century, numerous lighthouses were built across Cape Verde and feature colonial architecture; notable ones includes Farol de Ponta Temerosa in Praia, Farol de Ponta Tumbo near Janela and Porto Novo, Farol de São Pedro southwest of Mindelo which has a rectangular building, Sal's Farol da Ponta Norte and Farol da Ponta do Sinó. Farol de Pedra de Lume, built in 1853 is a lighthouse that is also a chapel that has a white exterior, made out of tile and black and white horizontal bands painted on the roof and the edges, around it serves as a diurnal marking.\n\nLater neoclassical architecture in other parts of Praia are seen in Fazenda and Gamboa including the Electra offices.\n\nToday, some or most of the buildings in the Platô neighborhood have been demolished and replaced with newer buildings including Banco de Cabo Verde's headquarters and the colorful buildings in the middle of Avenida Andrade Corvo.\n\nBuilding projects slowed at the early 20th century which was led by drought and rain shortages across Cape Verde at the time.\n\nEarly modern architecture started to appear in newer buildings in the 1930s such as art nouveau. During the time, Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves was director of public works for Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, he also lived in Cape Verde for some years, he did architectural works including the terminal and facilities of the Sal International Airport (now known as Amílcar Cabral International Airport), Farol de Fiúra in the north point (Ponta Norte) of Sal, an urban plan for the square now known as 5 do Outubro in Praia.\n\nThere were hardly any building projects in Cape Verde during the Great Depression and the Famine of the 1940s and remained up until the 1950s.\n\nA town founded for airport services, the center of Espargos once known as Preguiça features late colonial and early modern architecture, one of its buildings is the Sal Municipal Hall.\n\nSeveral Mormon and Protestant churches built before independence have modern architecture.\n\nOther buildings built during that time included Estádio da Fontinha (now Estádio Municipal Adérito Sena) in Mindelo and Liceu Domingos Ramos in the north of the plateau. Seminaro de São José, located near Ponta Temerosa, Praia was also built during that time.\n\nAfter independence, as the population grew, a lot of buildings featuring modern architecture (or modernism) spread up and many buildings today have a flat roof as other modern buildings on the African mainland. Many houses and some buildings have little, poor or no architecture today. One of these were a building that is now part of the University of Cape Verde, its main campus in Palmarejo and other buildings in the new section of Palmarejo.\n\nOther areas with buildings that contain only modern architecture includes the towers of Gamboa/Chã das Areias in the center of Praia and nearby. Another is an information pavilion near Barragem de Poilão in the middle of the island of Santiago. Escola Jorge Barbosa and Hotel Porto Grande, both are in Mindelo also features modern architecture. Constructed in the late 1990s, one of the most notable is the National Library located in Várzea in the center of Praia. The other is the headquarters of the Bank of Cape Verde in the Plateau, being one of the first glass buildings.\n\nAfter the end of the 20th century, modern architecture are featured in several sports stadiums including the Estádio Marcelo Leitão in Espargos built in 2003, Estádio Municipal Arsénio Ramos in Sal Rei built in 2008 and Estádio Municipal do Porto Novo in 2009. Also in some resorts and vilas, Afro-Moorish architecture appears in Santa Maria (Funana, Garupa) and near Sal Rei (Karamboa, also features Arabesque architecture) along with a mixture of modern Afro-Northern Mediterranean architecture in places like Ribeira do Rabil southeast of Sal Rei and Murdeira, Sal. One of the recent international airports constructed was the Aristides Pereira International Airport, the airport of Boa Vista Island located in Rabil. Its style is a mixture of Portuguese origin and Moorish architectural elements and has peach-rose stone bricks with two arches, entrance and exit doors and a yellow exterior where the airport name is and in the south are three melon colored exteriors with two fudge-brown exteriors in between and are bordered with a stone-brick outer wall.\n\nOne of the unique architecture on Fogo was Chã das Caldeiras which has building material made out of lava, most of the buildings were built after independence especially the southwest part which were rebuilt after the 1995 eruption. Its architecture is not only of Portuguese origin but contain elements of mainland African styles such as old traditional huts and a circular plan as those in mainland African villages and towns and had only one story. It had straw roofs, bricks mainly black made out of lava, straw windowpanes and doors In other parts of Cape Verde, only a very few village have hut style buildings. Huts covered a quarter of the village. One of the most notable were a house with blue exterior walls with white facades, brown windowpane and door and on the bottom triangular bricks, painted houses did not dominate the majority of the village, another was a hut that housed the vineyard offices, The other was the Catholic church of Portela which had a circular roof, two rims and green doors. Some of the houses were rectangular with windows and some narrow doors and detached roofs, some buildings also had a flat roof. One other examples were the village's primary school which had stucco walls, white roofs and mostly white doors and some brown, nearby had a playground with its benches built out of lava, the other was Vinho do Fogo, where wine is manufactured, a small bungalow was in the middle with two small flat windows on each side, black-grey bricks made out of lava, wide doors and on the right is a part of the building, the others are outside but sheltered and a near rectangular café with sky blue exterior walls, windows and three narrow doors.\n\nAlmost the whole of the village were destroyed by lava flows of the 2014-15 eruption between November and February, several survive with minimal or moderate damages, a few were unharmed.\n\nIn early 2016, newer buildings and huts were built and out of lava and some new inhabitants moved in.\n\nThe rare architectural style's project was awarded the National Architecture Award in 2013, as Best Project of the Year and was awarded the Archdaily Building of the Year International Award in 2015.\n\nElsewhere on Fogo, some of the buildings built out of lava have good architecture and some of these are in the east of São Filipe.\n\nA documentary film titled \"Architecture of Cidade Velha\" (\"Arquitectura de Cidade Velha\") was released in 2007 and was directed by Catarina Alves Costa. The film was about all the historic buildings in Cidade Velha including the Nossa Senhora do Rosário church, the pillory and its fort.\n\n"}

It gives grants and acts as a channel for many gifts and bequests, as well as lobbying on behalf of museums and galleries and their users. It relies on members' subscriptions and public donations for funds and does not receive funding from the government or the National Lottery.\n\nSince its foundation in 1903 Art Fund has been involved in the acquisition of over 860,000 works of art of every kind, including many of the most famous objects in British public collections, such as Velázquez's \"Rokeby Venus\" in the National Gallery, Picasso's \"Weeping Woman\" in the Tate collection, the Anglo-Saxon Staffordshire Hoard in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the medieval Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant in the British Museum.\n\nThe original idea for an arts charity can be traced to a lecture given by John Ruskin in 1857 when he called for the establishment of a \"great society\" to save works of art for public collections and \"watch over\" them.\n\nArt Fund, then named National Art Collections Fund, was founded in 1903 in order to help museums and galleries acquire works of art. The founders, who included Christiana Herringham, DS MacColl and Roger Fry, were prompted by what they saw as the inadequacy of government funding of museums.\n\nArt critic Frank Rutter said it made him \"boil with rage\" that the Fund had spent thousands of pounds on Old Master paintings, some of which he considered of dubious merit or condition, but \"would not contribute one half penny\" to his appeal in 1905 to buy the first Impressionist painting for the National Gallery, although it welcomed the prestige of presenting the painting, Eugène Boudin's \"The Entrance to Trouville Harbour\", the following year. He said \"the Fund's inertia and snobbish ineptitude are entirely characteristic of the art-officialdom in England.\"\n\nIn 2005 Art Fund was caught up in the controversy surrounding the purchase by the Tate gallery of \"The Upper Room\" by Chris Ofili.\n\nIn the summer of 2006 the name was changed from the National Art Collections to The Art Fund. The same year it was caught out when it was discovered that the \"Amarna Princess\", purportedly an ancient Egyptian sculpture, was actually a forgery by Shaun Greenhalgh.\n\nIn addition to using its own funds to help museums and galleries acquire art, Art Fund organises national fundraising campaigns to secure significant works of art that are in danger of being lost from public view.\n\nIn 2009 Art Fund led a fundraising campaign to save the Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of over 3,500 gold and silver artefacts discovered in Staffordshire. Over £900,000 was raised through public donations, and the campaign received substantial funds from trusts and foundations. As a result of the campaign, the £3.3 million treasure was acquired for Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nIn 2010 \"The Procession to Calvary\" by Pieter Brueghel the Younger, which had been hung in Wakefield's Nostell Priory for over 200 years, came under risk of being sold on the open market. Art Fund worked with the National Trust to raise the £2.7 million required to purchase the painting for the National Trust's art collection.\n\nIn 2013 King and McGaw partnered with Art Everywhere, a charitable project putting on the world's largest art exhibition. This filled 22,000 billboards across the UK with art prints with all the profits going to the Art Fund. The following year the campaign was expanded to 30,000 billboards displaying 25 artworks including the \"Study of Cirrus Clouds\" by John Constable, \"The Circle of Lustful\" by William Blake and A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling by Hans Holbein the Younger.\n\nThe Art Fund sponsors the Museum of the Year award (known as the Gulbenkian Prize from 2003 to 2007 and the Art Fund Prize from 2008 to 2012). This is a £100,000 prize awarded annually to the museum or gallery that had the most imaginative, innovative or popular project during the previous year. The winners of the prize since its association with the Art Fund have been:\n\n\nIn 2008 Art Fund helped Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland acquire ARTIST ROOMS, a collection of postwar and contemporary art. Since then Art Fund has supported a tour of the collection around the UK, as well as providing additional funds to help museum display the works. By the beginning of 2011 ARTIST ROOMS tours had been seen by approximately 12 million people across Britain.\n\n"}

{"id": "2246106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246106", "title": "Carnyx", "text": "Carnyx\n\nThe carnyx was a wind instrument of the Iron Age Celts, used between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200. It was a type of bronze trumpet with an elongated S shape, held so that the long straight central portion was vertical and the short mouthpiece end section and the much wider bell were horizontal in opposed directions. The bell was styled in the shape of an open-mouthed boar's, or other animal's, head. \n\nIt was used in warfare, probably to incite troops to battle and intimidate opponents, as Polybius recounts. The instrument's significant height allowed it to be heard over the heads of the participants in battles or ceremonies.\n\nThe word “carnyx” is derived from the Gaulish root, \"carn-\" or \"cern-\" meaning \"antler\" or \"horn,\" and the same root of the name of the god, Cernunnos.\n\nUntil 2004, fragments of only five carnyces had been preserved, from modern Scotland, France, Germany, Romania and Switzerland, but in 2004 archaeologists discovered a first-century-BC deposit at Tintignac in Corrèze, France.\n\nIn September 2004, over 500 fragments of iron and bronze objects were discovered in a Gallic pit. The objects included a dozen swords and scabbards, iron spearheads, a shield, ten bronze helmets and an iron bird, 2 animal heads, one animal body, a cauldron, and seven Carnyces, one of which is almost complete. These unique military and religious objects are currently being studied by Christophe Maniquet’s team, and are in the process of conservation and restoration by the \"Materia Viva\" laboratory in Toulouse.\n\nFour of the carnyces had boar's heads, the fifth appears to be a serpent-like monster; they appear to represent a ritual deposit dating to soon after the Roman conquest of Gaul. The Tintignac finds enabled some fragments found in northern Italy decades before to be identified in 2012 as coming from a carnyx.\n\nThe only example from the British Isles is the Deskford Carnyx, found at the farm of Leitchestown, Deskford, Banffshire, Scotland in 1816. Only the boar's head bell survives, also apparently placed as a ritual deposit. It was donated to Banff Museum, and is now on loan from Aberdeenshire Museums Service to the Museum of Scotland. The location and age of the Deskford Carnyx suggests the instrument had a peaceful, ceremonial use and was not only used in warfare. \n\nBefore 2004 this was the best surviving example, and generally copied in earlier reconstructions. The Deskford find was made almost entirely of brass, a metal used almost exclusively by the Romans, and strictly controlled by them. Further, the basic size and shape of the Deskford find suggests it may in fact have been a Roman military draco standard.\n\nThe instrument is known from depictions on coins and reliefs, notably from Trajan's Column and the so-called initiation scene of the Gundestrup cauldron.\n\nThe name is known from textual sources, carnyces are reported from the Celtic attack on the Delphi in 279 BC, as well as from Julius Caesar's campaign in Gaul and Claudius' invasion of Britain. Diodorus Siculus around 60-30 BC said (Histories, 5.30):\nObjects found at Tintignac were exhibited at the 2012 exhibition \"Les Gaulois, une expo renversante\" (\"The Gauls, a stunning exhibition\").\n\nThe reconstruction of the Deskford Carnyx was initiated by Dr. John Purser, and commenced in 1991 funded jointly by the Glenfiddich Living Scotland award and the National Museums of Scotland. In addition to John Purser as musicologist, the team comprised the archaeologist Fraser Hunter, silversmith John Creed, and trombonist John Kenny. After 2,000 years of silence the reconstructed Deskford Carnyx was unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland in April 1993.\n\nIn 1993 Kenny became the first person to play the carnyx in 2,000 years, and has since lectured and performed on the instrument internationally, in the concert hall, on radio, television, and film. There are numerous compositions for the carnyx and it is featured on seven CDs. On March 15, 2003 he performed solo to an audience of 65,000 in the Stade De France in Paris.\n\nOn 15 June 2017 \"The Music of the Forest\", a specially commissioned work by Lakeland composer, Christopher Gibbs, featuring a reconstructed carnyx, received its world premiere at Slaidburn Village Hall. The four-part song cycle evoked the landscape and history of the Forest of Bowland and was performed by the Renaissance Singers of Blackburn Cathedral under the direction of Samuel Hudson. The carnyx was played by John Kenny.\n\nThe carnyx is featured in the opening battle scene of Gladiator \"Gladiator\" (2000); and is used as both a musical instrument and a fear-inducing weapon. It appears in several battle scenes of the French film, \"Druids\" (2001). A carnyx appears near the beginning of the 2012 Pixar computer animated movie \"Brave\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31337127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31337127", "title": "Catalan Gothic", "text": "Catalan Gothic\n\nCatalan Gothic is an artistic style, with particular characteristics in the field of architecture. It occurred under the Crown of Aragon between the 13th and 15th centuries, which places it at the end of the European Gothic period and at the beginning of the Renaissance. The term \"Catalan Gothic\" is confined to Barcelona and its area of influence (Girona, Northern Catalonia, Balearic Islands, etc.), which has its own characteristics.\n\nDespite its name, Catalan Gothic differs from the Gothics from other parts of Europe. In architecture, it does not seek excessive height, or have highlights in its flying buttresses, and its decoration is sober.\n\nThe style began because of the wealth generated by the expansion of the Counts of Barcelona and Crown of Aragon, first to the Languedoc and Balearic islands then across the Mediterranean to Sicily, the Kingdom of Naples and the Duchy of Athens. This resulted in a demand for an updating of existing Romanesque buildings and new public buildings as well as a demand for mansions for the newly enriched. The style reached its climax in the 15th century. After the unification of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, and the discovery of the Americas, Seville became Spain's major port, to the detriment of Barcelona.\n\nThe terms \"Gothic style\" and \"Gothic city\" are used in relation to the local time frame. It is not to be confused with Spanish or other Gothic styles, though the latest available technologies were always employed. There are many differences in, for example, the arch, rose window and struts. \n\nIn church architecture Catalan Gothic does not strive for great heights, but tends to balance dimensions of width with height, so there are no long sloping roofs so characteristic of central and northern Europe, and its buttresses are as tall as the naves. Buildings also have fewer windows because the Mediterranean light is much stronger than the rest of Europe. Sparsely decorated, they have no figurative motifs on their pillars and no notable intricacy in their vaults.\n\nThe main features of Catalan Gothic, compared with the international Gothic, are:\n\nIn sculpture and painting the peculiarities of Catalan Gothic are not as marked and as distinctive as either the Italian or Flemish styles. Nevertheless, there are several notable painters, including Ferrer Bassa, Pere Serra, Lluís Borrassà, Bernat Martorell, Lluís Dalmau and Jaume Huguet.\n\nReligious architecture tends to unify space, which is achieved through two methods: either with slender and thin columns spaced far enough apart to avoid interruption the view of the side ailes, which are often the same height as the nave, or constructing with a single nave of much wider span. The towers, usually one or two, stand out as smooth polygonal prisms (6 sides, 8 sides), and there are no transepts, though churches based on the Templar design, are planned as Greek crosses.\n\nThe abutments have two effects in addition to their role in bracing the walls. On the drawing the chapels can be distinguished, and the elevation of the building is continuous and visually smooth on the outside. When these appear on the main facade (usually the West Front), they create a rectangle that frames the doorway and perhaps a rose window.\n\nThe palace, with a larger street wall than other dwellings, is typical of 15th-century bourgeois spaces, the best examples of which are in the Carrer de Montcada in Barcelona's Ribera district. The building is accessed through a portal and is characterised by a courtyard, which is the centre of the building and contains the main staircase that is either open or half closed.\n\nOn the ground floor are the facilities for doing business and there may be an office on a mezzanine. The first floor is reserved for living, with main hall, richly decorated stretching along the facade, sometimes occupying it entirely. The following storey contains service rooms and secondary units. Some palaces have small towers for watching over the city rooftops.\n\nDuring the 15th century the Catalan Gothic was used in civil architecture, best exemplified in the Llotja of Barcelona, built between 1380 and 1392. It consisted of three naves separated by ogival arches resting on columns with beaded and flat roofs built in wood. Many features of the Barcelona Llotja was replaced in the 18th century by a neoclassical style.\n\nExamples of this type of architecture are the Cathedral of Barcelona, begun in 1298 or the Cathedral of Girona, started in 1312, which has three naves leading to the crossing where it continues as a single width. Its technical difficulties had to be addressed by a board or architects sent by the Crown of Aragon.\nOther good examples are:\n\n"}

The Art of the 90s\" curated by Peter Weibel at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).\n\nBoth exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.\n\n“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.” \n\nIt might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation \"KontextKunst\" instead of \"Context Art\" or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as \"Models of Participatory Practice\" in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate Relational Art based on the 2002 book \"Relational Aesthetics\" by Nicolas Bourriaud. \n\nThe accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish \"Context Art\" from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.\n\nFareed Armaly, Cosima von Bonin, Tom Burr, Clegg & Guttmann, Meg Cranston, Mark Dion, Peter Fend, Andrea Fraser, Inspection Medhermeneutics, Ronald Jones, Louise Lawler, Thomas Locher, Dorit Margreiter, Kasimir Malewitsch, Katrin von Maltzahn, Regina Möller, Reinhard Mucha, Christian Philipp Müller, Anton Olschwang, Hirsch Perlman, Dan Peterman, Adrian Piper, Mathias Poledna, Stephan Prina, Florian Pumhösl, Gerwald Rockenschaub, Julia Scher, Oliver Schwarz, Jason Simon, Rudolf Stingel, Lincoln Tobier, Olga Tschernyschewa, Christopher Williams, Peter Zimmermann, Heimo Zobernig \n"}

Bills of the payments for the work until 1447 have been preserved.\n\nIn the late 1430s, brother Filippo Lippi had left the convent of the Carmine convent to open an artist workshop of his own; however, having no money enough to pay assistants and apprentices, he worked alone with two usual collaborators, Fra' Carnevale and Fra' Diamante, along with an unknown \"Piero di Lorenzo dipintore\". For the \"Coronation of the Virgin\", however, Lippi had to call in a total of six external painters, who were responsible also for the gilded frame, now lost. Originally the work had a predella, also lost, with the exception of a small panel with a \"Miracle of St. Ambrose\", now in the Berlin State Museums.\n\nThe work was immediately admired and was copied by numerous painters. It remained in Sant'Ambrogio until 1810, when it was stolen. Later it was sold to the Galleria dell'Accademia, from which it was transferred to the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.\n\nThe work is composed of a single panel, divided into three sectors by the arches. At the sides of the central arch are two \"tondos\", depicting the Angel of Annunciation and the Virgin.\n\nThe main scene features a crowd of biblical figures, angels and saints,\nportrayed in informal positions; most of them are probably portraits of existing people. As usual, the scene is set in Heaven, but Lippi decided to avoid the outdated gilded background, replacing it with a striped sky which alludes to the seven sectors of the Paradise. In the middle, in a commanding position, are Christ and the kneeling Madonna who is going to be crowned, within a majestic marble throne in perspective. The latter includes the shell-shaped niche, featured in other paintings by Lippi.\n\nFour angels hold a gilded ribbon, while in the lower level is a series of kneeling saints; on the left and right are other two groups of saints and angels, inspired to the crowded choirs of older works, such as the \"Incoronation of the Virgin\" by Lorenzo Monaco. The elevated pavement of the side groups creates a perspective triangle whose apex is the Virgin's head.\n\nAmongst the figures in the middle can be recognized Mary Magdalene and St. Eustace (titular of one of the most important altars in the church) with his sons and his wife. These figures, all without a halo, are shorter than normal, as the painter imagined them to be correctly seen from below, in perspective, by the nuns of the Sant'Ambrogio convent from their separated choirs.\n\nKneeling at the side are the work's commissioner, facing a cartouche with the write \"ISTE PERFECIT OPUS\" (\"this one finished the work\"), while on the left is a self-portrait of Filippo Lippi in the robes of a Carmelite monk (as he was). Standing on the sides are the two titular saints of the church: St. Ambrose (left) and St. John the Baptist (right), whose austere representation reveal the influence of Masaccio.\n\nThis painting is described at length in lines 344-389 of Robert Browning's poem 'Fra Lippo Lippi', published in 1855 in his collection \"Men and Women\".\n"}

It is generally clear, well-argued, timely, and thought-provoking. Not the least of its merits, however, is that it contains a large element of truth. Huemer is understandably frustrated that so many people still misrepresent intuitionism and fail to take it seriously. But it is making a return, and currently has more proponents than he sometimes seems to suggest.

{"id": "29856751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29856751", "title": "Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)", "text": "Flaying of Marsyas (Titian)\n\nThe Flaying of Marsyas is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance artist Titian, probably painted between about 1570 and his death in 1576, when in his eighties. It is now in the Archbishop's Palace in Kroměříž, Czech Republic and belongs to the Archbishopric of Olomouc (administered by Olomouc Museum of Art – Archdiocesan Museum). It is one of Titian's last works, and may be unfinished, although there is a partial signature on the stone in the foreground.\n\nThe painting shows the killing by flaying or skinning alive of Marsyas, a satyr who rashly challenged the god Apollo to a musical contest. It is one of several canvases with mythological subjects from Ovid which Titian executed in his late years, mostly the \"poesie\" series for King Philip II of Spain, of which this painting seems not to have been part. \n\nThe painting has been in Kroměříž in Moravia since 1673, and was rather forgotten about, being off the beaten track as far as Venetian painting is concerned. It \"did not enter critical literature until 1909\". By the 1930s it was \"widely accepted as an important late work\" among scholars, but little known by a wider public. \n\nOn its first modern appearance abroad, it \"was greeted with astonished admiration\" as the \"star attraction\" of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1983, It was new to most viewers and was described by John Russell in the \"New York Times\" as \"the most astonishing picture in the show\". Beginning an extended analysis, Sir Lawrence Gowing wrote that \"All these months – it is not too much to say – London has been half under the spell of this masterpiece, in which the tragic sense that overtook Titian’s poesie in his seventies reached its cruel and solemn extreme. At most hours on most days there is a knot of visitors riveted and fairly perplexed in front of it. ... At the Academy people still ask, and on the radio well-meaning critics debate, how it is possible that a horribly painful subject should be the occasion of beauty or greatness in art.\"\n\nThe choice of such a violent scene was perhaps inspired by the death of Marcantonio Bragadin, the Venetian commander of Famagusta in Cyprus who was flayed by the Ottomans when the city fell in August 1571, causing enormous outrage in Venice. Titian's composition is undoubtedly derived from that of Giulio Romano from several decades before (see \"Visual sources\" below).\nBoth artists follow the account in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" (Book 6, lines 382–400), which covers the contest very quickly, but describes the flaying scene at relative length, though with few indications that would help to visualize it. Marsyas cries out \"Why do you tear me from myself?\". \n\nMarsyas was a skillful player of the classical aulos or double flute, for which by Titian's time pan pipes were usually substituted in art, and his set hangs from the tree over his head. Apollo played his usual lyre, which is here represented by a modern lira da braccio, an ancestor of the violin with up to seven strings. This is played by a figure of uncertain identity, who some scholars have said to be Apollo himself, perhaps appearing a second time, since Apollo is clearly the figure wearing a laurel wreath who is kneeling down and using his knife to flay Marsyas' chest. It has also been suggested that the musician is Orpheus, or Olympus, a devoted pupil of Marsyas, who Apollo later converts to playing the lyre, and Ovid mentions. The mythical King Midas, the seated old man on the right, is often thought to be a self-portrait. His downward line of gaze at Marsyas is parallel to that of the musician looking up to the heavens on the other side of the painting. \n\nOvid avoids the question of who the judges of the contest were. In most Greek accounts the Three Muses did the role, but the story early became confused with another, the \"Judgement of Midas\", which has happened here. This was another musical contest, always with lyre versus pan pipes, but with Pan himself on the pipes. Of course Apollo won, but in some accounts King Midas preferred Pan, and was given the ears of a donkey as punishment, while Pan was merely humiliated. The seated figure at right wears a diadem and is Midas, though his ears seem unaffected. The \"Judgement of Midas\" was also sometimes painted. Both stories were set in Phrygia, in modern Turkey, where Midas ruled, which in the ancient world had various associations with music. The Phrygians were not Greek, until Hellenized after Alexander the Great, but lived on the edge of the Greek world. The human with the knife wears a Phrygian cap. \nApollo is assisted by a sinister \"Scythian\" figure on the left, working on Marsyas' leg, and a satyr with a bucket behind Midas, perhaps to collect blood, or hold the removed skin, which in some versions of the story Apollo later had nailed up in a temple. A small boy, or boy satyr, restrains a large dog at right, while a much smaller dog is lapping at the blood that has fallen to the ground. As was typical in Titian's day, and especially in his works, the satyr is shown with the legs and feet of a goat, and inverting him emphasizes these, as well as giving him the position typical of mid-sized animals being slaughtered or skinned before butchering. Most of his body still seems unflayed, but Apollo holds a large flap of detached skin in the hand not holding his knife. \n\nCompositionally, the \"V\" shape made by Marsyas's legs is echoed by the highlighted \"V\"s of the bent arms of the four figures nearest to him, all of whom are looking at him. Indeed, his navel is almost exactly at the centre of the canvas as it now is. Technical examinations have determined that two of the main differences to the Giulio Romano composition are changes made well after painting was underway; originally the musician merely held his instrument, as in the Giulio Romano composition, and the boy or small satyr and the large dog were not present.\n\nMany writers have attempted to capture the meaning of the \"famously savage\" painting, which, despite \"the brutality of the treatment\", has been found powerfully compelling by many, and described as \"the most discussed, revered and loathed of all Titian's paintings\". One common suggestion has been that the painting reflects ideas in Renaissance Neoplatonism about the \"liberation of the spirit from the body\", or the acquisition of higher insight or clarity. Such ideas are usually considered to be involved in another famous treatment of flaying: the flayed skin carrying a self-portrait face of Michelangelo, held by Saint Bartholomew as his attribute in \"The Last Judgment\" in the Sistine Chapel. One of Michelangelo's poems had used the metaphor of a snake shedding its old skin for his hope for a new life after his death.\n\nIn this spirit, Dante began his \"Paradiso\" with a prayer addressed to Apollo, who he asks to \"Enter my breast, and so infuse me your spirit as you did Marsyas when you tore him from the cover of his limbs. In some other Renaissance depictions, Marsyas's furry legs appear human when flayed, so he \"is redeemed from the animality that condemned him to this terrible fate\".\n\nThe philosopher-turned-novelist Iris Murdoch was especially fascinated by the painting, which she described in an interview as \"the greatest in the Western canon\". It is mentioned in three of her novels, and sometimes discussed by the characters. In her portrait for the National Portrait Gallery by Tom Phillips, a reproduction occupies most of the wall behind her head. She said it was \"something to do with human life and all its ambiguities and all its horrors and terrors and misery, and at the same time there’s something beautiful, the picture is beautiful, and something also to do with the entry of the spiritual into the human situation and the closeness of the gods ...\"\n\nThe general interpretation of the story of Marsyas was as an illustration of the inevitable disaster that followed \"hubris\" in the form of a challenge to a god. An idea of the contest reinforcing the general moral and artistic superiority of the courtly lyre, or modern stringed instruments, over the rustic and frivolous wind family was present in much ancient discussion, and perhaps retained some relevance in the 16th-century. Gowing comments: \"It was on behalf of order and the laws of harmonious proportion, which sound in the music of strings, that Apollo claimed victory over the chaotic and impulsive sound of the pipes.\" For Edgar Wind the contest determined \"the relative powers of Dionysian darkness and Apollonian clarity; and if the contest ended with the flaying of Marsyas, it was because flaying was itself a Dionysian rite, a tragic ordeal of purification by which the ugliness of the outward man was thrown off and the beauty of his inward self revealed\". Alternatively, there have been suggestions that the painting has a political meaning, either general or specific, and depicts the \"just punishment\" of hubristic opponents.\n\nThe 'three ages of man' are all represented (if satyrs are allowed to count), indeed on the right they are aligned diagonally. The boy or young satyr is looking rather vacuously out at the viewer, those in their prime are concentrating on their tasks with a variety of expressions, and Midas contemplates the scene, apparently with melancholy resignation, but making no further attempt to intervene.\n\nIt is unknown whether the painting had an intended recipient; Titian's main client in his last years was King Philip II of Spain, but the picture is not mentioned in the surviving correspondence. The painting may well be one of those still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576. There are a number of these, including for example \"The Death of Actaeon\" in the National Gallery, London (certainly intended for Philip), and there is a general argument as to whether they should be regarded as finished or not. In this case the signature and areas of detailed finish may suggest that the painting had been completed. \n\nNothing is known of its history before it appears in an inventory of 1655 of the Arundel Collection, by then in exile from the English Civil War in Amsterdam. This was formed by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel (d. 1646) and his wife Alethea Howard, and was mostly dispersed by their son after Alethea's death in 1655. The collection had mostly been formed in the 1620s, when the Howards went on an extended visit to Italy, and it is presumed that the painting was bought there.\n\nThe painting was bought by Franz Imstenraed in 1655. He was the nephew of (Edvard, Everard or) Everhard Jabach, a banker from Cologne who was one of the greatest private collectors of the century, and also acted as an agent for Cardinal Mazarin and Louis XIV of France. In the 1650s the superb collection of Arundel's friend Charles I of England was being dispersed in London, and Jabach, acting on behalf of Louis, was one of many international buyers active, with agents on the ground.\n\nIn 1673 it was acquired by Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn, Bishop of Olomouc, after being a prize in a lottery. He also bought most of the collection of the brothers Bernhard and Franz Imstenraed, which remains intact in Kroměříž Castle, the former Archbishop's Palace, now the National Museum, in Kroměříž.\n\nIt appears the painting was cut down at top and bottom, and added to at the sides, especially on the right, during the 18th century. In modern times, the painting has been exhibited abroad in London in 1983 and 2003, in Washington in 1986, and in Paris, Vienna, Venice, Rome, and New York, most recently in \"Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible\", an exhibition of unfinished works, at Met Breuer in 2016.\n\nMarsyas, as a single figure, was a well-known subject in Roman and Hellenistic sculpture, with a famous type showing him tied and hanging with his arms above his head. This probably originated in Hellenistic Pergamon, and was well-known from various examples by the late Renaissance, followed for example by Raphael in a small scene on the ceiling of the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican. But this is not a very direct influence on Titian's composition.\n\nMuch closer is \"an awkward sketch for a now damaged fresco\" by Giulio Romano in the Palazzo Te in Mantua (1524–34), for which there is also a drawing in the Louvre; this is clearly the main source for the composition. It has all the same figures and elements except the boy and the dogs, in roughly the same positions, including, apparently for the first time in art, Marsyas shown tied upside down. The standing figure at left is a servant holding a lyre, rather than Titian's lira da bracchio player. The seated figure of Midas has donkey ears, and is more clearly distressed, holding his hands over his face, and Apollo, bending down rather than on one knee, is not cutting, but is pulling the skin off like a jacket.\n\nAndrea Schiavone's \"Judgement of Midas\" in the British Royal Collection (in 2017 displayed in the Gallery at Kensington Palace), is some twenty years earlier, from c. 1548–50, and is comparable to Titian, in atmosphere and some details of the composition. Titian \"must also have remembered elements of this painting: the pensive and abstracted attitudes of Apollo and Midas, and the radically free impressionistic brushwork used to heighten the dramatic mood of the story.\" Apollo also plays a lira da bracchio, and Midas, as yet with normal ears, looks straight at Pan.\n\nMidas or \"Midas/Titian adopts the traditional melancholic's pose\", which Titian would have known from Raphael's supposed portrait of Michelangelo as Heraclitus in \"The School of Athens\", and Albrecht Dürer's \"Melencolia I\", not to mention the Schiavone.\n\nThe technique is characteristic of Titian's late style. Nicholas Penny commented that there are \"intense greens and blues and reds (vermilion as well as crimson) ... after 1560 Titian began to apply these colours in scumbles, often with his fingers, so that they only half belong to any of the forms and seem to float on the surface of the painting: evidently he painted them last. ... one can still see passages of smoky preliminary painting (notably the ghostly body of Apollo) but the blood, dogs' tongues and the ribbons in the trees are brilliant red.\" \n\nDescribing a group of late works which he considers finished, including this, and contrasting them with the \"Death of Actaeon\", which he considers unfinished, Penny notes \"the impact of blurred areas of painting (... indecipherable distances, light piercing foliage) is enhanced by contrast with forms that were more fully modelled, if still often roughly painted, and, indeed, with some that were more detailed (Midas's diadem ...)\". There are strong white highlights on the knife blades, the bucket, and elsewhere, comparable with those in \"Tarquin and Lucretia\", which Titian delivered in 1571.\n\nBeyond the purely technical means, many critics have tried to articulate evocations of Titian's pictorial language in this and other very late paintings. According to Sidney Freedburg, \"the surfaces of bodies make a silvered incanescence and the atmosphere, almost unbreathably dense, is like dulled fire. ...There is a wry comedy within the cruelty, ugliness and strangeness within the magisterial beauty, and terror accompanies the sense of the sublime.\" For John Steer \"it is not individual colours that tell, but an all-over emanation of broken touches, evoking a greenish-gold, that is splattered, appropriately to the theme, with reds like splotches of blood. Vision and expression are here so much one that they cannot, even for the purposes of discussion, be separated. ... Titian's intense struggle to grasp in paint, through tone and colour, the physical realities of the scene is a fundamental part of their meaning.\"\n\n\n"}

It is part of the church treasure from the Cathedral of Lausanne sent to Bern after the Protestant conquest of Canton Vaud in 1536. The cope can be attributed to a master from the Netherlands in the circle of Rogier van der Weyden and was probably executed in Tournai where van der Weyden had a workshop from 1432 onwards.\n\nThe piece pictured is the hood. It depicts the Eucharist in the new tradition of the \"Devotio Moderna\" that arose in the Netherlands in the fifteenth century. The embroidery uses one of the most expensive of the Tournai embroiders' techniques, the \"or nué (shaded gold)\" technique in which the juxtaposed gold threads are more or less closely covered by silk threads. A famous example of this kind of work is the \"Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece\" dating from around 1425–1450 and now at the Imperial Treasury, Vienna.\n\nThe cope was commissioned by Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont and presented by him to the Bishop of Lausanne. The Coat of Arms of the Counts of Savoy is embroidered at the bottom and show that the work was made before 1478, the year Jacques of Savoy was admitted to the Order of the Golden Fleece, as it lacks the Collar of the Golden Fleece.\n\n\nCampbell, Lorne and Van der Stock, Jan.

Glitches appear in visual art such as the film \"A Colour Box\" (1935) by Len Lye, the video sculpture \"TV Magnet\" (1965) by Nam June Paik and more contemporary work such as \"Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn\" (2007) by Cory Arcangel.\n\nIn a technical sense, a glitch is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts. Early examples of glitches used in media art include \"Digital TV Dinner\" (1978) created by Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky, with glitch audio done by Dick Ainsworth. This video was made by manipulating the Bally video game console and recording the results on videotape.\n\nThe term glitch came to be associated with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica (see glitch music). Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the glitch as an aesthetic of the digital age, glitch art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.\n\nIn January 2002, Motherboard, a tech-art collective, held a glitch symposium in Oslo, Norway, to \"bring together international artists, academics and other Glitch practitioners for a short space of time to share their work and ideas with the public and with each other.\"\n\nOn September 29 thru October 3, 2010, Chicago played host to the first GLI.TC/H, a five-day conference in Chicago organized by Nick Briz, Evan Meaney, Rosa Menkman and Jon Satrom that included workshops, lectures, performances, installations and screenings. In November 2011, the second GLI.TC/H event traveled from Chicago to Amsterdam and lastly to Birmingham, UK. It included workshops, screenings, lectures, performance, panel discussions and a gallery show over the course of seven days at the three cities.\n\nWhat is called \"glitch art\" typically means visual glitches, either in a still or moving image. It is made by either \"capturing\" an image of a glitch as it randomly happens, or more often by artists/designers manipulating their digital files, software or hardware to produce these \"errors.\" Artists have posted a variety of tutorials online explaining how to make glitch art. There are many approaches to making these glitches happen on demand, ranging from physical changes to the hardware to direct alternations of the digital files themselves. Artist Michael Betancourt identified five areas of manipulation that are used to create \"glitchart.\" Betancourt notes that \"glitch art\" is defined by a broad range of technical approaches that can be identified with changes made to the digital file, its generative display, or the technologies used to show it (such as a video screen). He includes within this range changes made to analog technologies such as television (in video art) or the physical film strip in motion pictures:\n\nData manipulation (aka \"databending\") changes the information inside the digital file to create glitches. Databending involves editing and changing the file data. There are a variety of tutorials explaining how to make these changes using programs such as HexFiend. Adam Woodall explains in his tutorial\nLike all files, image files (.jpg .bmp .gif etc) are all made up of text. Unlike some other files, like .svg (vectors) or .html (web pages), when an image is opened in a text editor all that comes up is gobbldygook!\nRelated processes such as datamoshing changes the data in a video or picture file. Datamoshing with software such as Avidemux is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: \n\"Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (intra-coded picture, also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting the changes in the image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames.\"\n\nThis process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens. \"3D model glitching\" refers to the purposeful corruption of the code in 3D animation programs resulting in distorted and abstract images of 3D virtual worlds, models and even 3D printed objects\n\nMisalignment glitches are produced by opening a digital file of one type with a program designed for a different type of file, such as opening a video file as a sound file, or using the wrong codec to decompress a file. Tools commonly used to create glitches of this type include Audacity and WordPad. Artist Jamie Boulton explains the process and the glitches it produces, noting that these glitches depend on how Audacity handles files, even when they are not audio-encoded:\nThe easiest way to manipulate a file in Audacity is to select a section of the file and apply one of the built in sound effects to it. Now I’m no computing whizz kid but the way I see it when you apply a sound effect to a sound file, the program takes that file and alters the file data in the manner which it’s been told will achieve that effect. So, for example, if you were to apply an echo effect then it would repeat parts of the file, diminishing the repetition after each iteration. The wonderful thing is that it will do this regardless of what the file actually is. Audacity doesn’t know or care whether the file is a sound or not, it will alter it in the manner instructed.\nHardware failure happens by altering the physical wiring or other internal connections of the machine itself, such as a short-circuit, in a process called \"circuit bending\" causes the machine to create glitches that produce new sounds and visuals. For example, by damaging internal pieces of something like a VHS player, one can achieve different colorful visual images. Video artist Tom DeFanti explained the role of hardware failure in a voice-over for Jamie Fenton's early glitch video \"Digital TV Dinner\" that used the Bally video game console system:\nThis piece represents the absolute cheapest one can go in home computer art. This involves taking a $300 video game system, pounding it with your fist so the cartridge pops out while its trying to write the menu. The music here is done by Dick Ainsworth using the same system, but pounding it with your fingers instead of your fist.\nPhysically beating the case of the game system would cause the game cartridge to pop out, interrupting the computer's operation. The glitches that resulted from this failure were a result of how the machine was set-up:\nThere was ROM memory in the cartridge and ROM memory built into the console. Popping out the cartridge while executing code in the console ROM created garbage references in the stack frames and invalid pointers, which caused the strange patterns to be drawn. [...] The Bally Astrocade was unique among cartridge games in that it was designed to allow users to change game cartridges with power-on. When pressing the reset button, it was possible to remove the cartridge from the system and induce various memory dump pattern sequences. Digital TV Dinner is a collection of these curious states of silicon epilepsy set to music composed and generated upon this same platform.\nMisregistration is produced by the physical noise of historically analog media such as motion picture film. It includes dirt, scratches, smudges and markings that can distort physical media also impact the playback of digital recordings on media such as CDs and DVDs, as electronic music composer Kim Cascone explained in 2002:\n\n\"There are many types of digital audio ‘failure.' Sometimes, it results in horrible noise, while other times it can produce wondrous tapestries of sound. (To more adventurous ears, these are quite often the same.) When the German sound experimenters known as Oval started creating music in the early 1990s by painting small images on the underside of CDs to make them skip, they were using an aspect of ‘failure' in their work that revealed a subtextual layer embedded in the compact disc.\n\nOval's investigation of ‘failure' is not new. Much work had previously been done in this area such as the optical soundtrack work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Fischinger, as well as the vinyl record manipulations of John Cage and Christian Marclay, to name a few. What is new is that ideas now travel at the speed of light and can spawn entire musical genres in a relatively short period of time.\" \nDistortion was one of the earliest types of glitch art to be produced, such as in the work of video artist Nam June Paik, who created video distortions by placing powerful magnets in close proximity to the television screen, resulting in the appearance of abstract patterns. Paik's addition of physical interference to a TV set created new kinds of imagery that changed how the broadcast image was displayed:\nThe magnetic field interferes with the television’s electronic signals, distorting the broadcast image into an abstract form that changes when the magnet is moved.\nBy recording the resulting distortions with a camera, they can then be shown without the need for the magnet.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34753814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34753814", "title": "Inquisition post mortem", "text": "Inquisition post mortem\n\nAn Inquisition post mortem (abbreviated to Inq.p.m. or i.p.m., and formerly known as an escheat) (Latin, meaning \"(inquisition) after death\") is an English medieval record of the death, estate and heir of one of the king's tenants-in-chief, made for royal fiscal purposes. The process of making such inquisition was effected by the royal escheators in each county where the deceased held land. The earliest inq.p.m. was made in 1236, in the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272), and the practice ceased c.1640, at the start of the Civil War, and was finally abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, which ended the feudal system.\n\nThe escheators were ordered by a writ from the king's chancery to investigate the deaths of tenants-in-chief in order to assess what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called feudal incidents, comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the mediaeval royal revenues. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a relief, from Latin \"levo, levare\" (to lift-up), plus \"re\" (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a lord of the manor and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the feudal land tenure of barony had become a fixed sum under clause two of Magna Carta (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would \"escheat\" (i.e. revert to the demesne of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of \"escheats\". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which entailed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted a significant part of the royal revenues in mediaeval times.\n\nThe practice arose amongst tenants-in-chief of transferring the legal title in their lands to feoffees to uses, which effectively established trusts enabling the tenant-in-chief to continue to use the land and its revenues, but to avoid being officially recognised in law as the legal holder. This exempted him from the scope of the Inquisition post mortem, as the legal holders were effectively an immortal corporation one or two of whose constituent feoffees could on occasion die, only to be replaced by others. Such avoidance devices were apparently tolerated by the crown for a considerable time, yet on the accession of King Henry VII (1485–1509)\nthe king's ancient right to his feudal incidents was enforced with determination and ruthlessness.\n\nFor an heir to inherit his paternal lands a formal and lengthy standard procedure had to be completed, only at the end of which he could \"sue out his livery of seisin\" (i.e. gain physical possession of his inheritance), so it was in his best interest to get the process started as soon as possible after the death. He himself, or his relatives if a minor, would generally inform the king's chancery that the death had occurred, and this would prompt the production of a writ by the chancery under the king's great seal addressed to the various escheators of the counties in which the deceased held lands, known as a writ \"diem clausit extremum\". This writ, the earliest identified example of which dates from 1254, informed the escheator that the king had been informed (\"quia datum est nobis intelligi\" (\"because it has been given to us to know\")) that the tenant-in-chief named had \"closed his last day\", as the Latin phrase by which the writ has become known may be translated, and that he was ordered to hold an inquisition \"post mortem\", and to send the resultant report back to the chancery, with his seal and with the writ \"diem clausit extremum\" sewn onto it. On receipt of the writ the escheator requested the sheriff of the county concerned to empanell a jury made up of local freeholders, that is to say persons of social standing, who could be relied upon to provide the standard information required in accurate form. Such information, termed 'the jurors' \"verdict\"' comprised:\nThe most immediate order in the writ however was that requiring the escheator to take control of all the deceased's demesne lands, i.e. those which had not been sub-enfeoffed to mesne tenants but had been managed in-hand directly by the deceased and his household officials. All revenues resulting from such lands whilst in the hands of the escheator had to be audited (i.e. accounted for before the Barons of the Exchequer) periodically at the treasury.\n\nThe end result of the inquisition would be one of the three following, depending on what the jury reported:\n\nInquisitions post mortem (or \"escheats\") were recorded on two duplicate sheets of parchment. The original return was held in the records of the chancery, to which department the escheator had made his original return, the other by the treasury, which had caused a copy to be made for fiscal purposes, in order to verify the escheator's accounts which were presented to the treasury periodically. Unlike some other series of records, they were not historically sewn together as rolls, but in modern times the parchment sheets have been bound in files with covers, and are today held at the National Archives in Kew. The documents formerly comprising the chancery records are classified under the initial letter \"C\", whilst those from the exchequer bear the class letter \"E\". After the establishment of the Court of Wards in 1540 a copy of the Inq.p.m. was also sent to that court, and these records also survive at the National Archives classified as \"WARD 7\". When an Inq.p.m. had been held not as a result of a writ from chancery but under the escheator's own authority, the verdict was sent to the exchequer only.\n\nInquisitions post mortem form a valuable source for historians and genealogists, as they not only detail the familial relationships of many of the English nobility and gentry, but also provide information on the history of individual manors, including their size and forms of tenure by which they were held. They thus constitute \"one of the most important sources for the social and economic history of mediaeval England\". They also provide summaries and terms of settlements made during the lifetime of the deceased, for example settlement to feoffees, the original copy of which has rarely survived.\n\nThe following example of the abstracted Latin inq.p.m. of William Pagam (d.1422), published in 1995 as no. 932 in vol. 20, 6–10 Henry V, of the \"Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem\", illustrates many common elements:\n\n\"Writ 24 July 1422. Hampshire. Inquisition. Alton, 26 Aug.\nHe held of the king in-chief in his demesne as of fee the manor of Drayton, annual value 8 marks, for 6s. 8d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas and providing at his own expense for 15 days a hobbler to keep the castle in time of war. By an indenture of 26 Oct. 1418, shown to the jurors, William Tauk, Robert Monkeston and Thomas Welegh, who were seised in their demesne as of fee, granted the manor of Pury, a messuage, carucate and 13 acres meadow, 40 a. pasture and 20 a. wood at \"la Bere juxta Southwyke\" as lands and tenements in Pury, Badley, \"Colvyle\", \"Holdmede\", and \"Bere\", to William Pagam and his wife Agnes, who survives, for life of Agnes, remainder to William and his heirs in fee simple. The manor of Pury, annual value 6 marks, is held of the king in chief, service unknown. The messuage, carucate, arable, meadow, pasture and wood at \"le Bere\" annual value 40s. are held of the king in chief for 7s. 4d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas. He died on 15 July last. Philip Pagam is his son and next heir, aged 6 years and more. C 138/63, no.26A\"\n\nHere the manor of Drayton is held by the feudal military tenure of castle-guard; the manor of Pury had been transferred to feoffees to uses, and was re-granted by them in 1418 back to William and his wife for their uses under trust.\n\nPrinted calendars (abstracted summaries) of almost all the rolls of Inq.p.m.'s have been published in some form, with the exception of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1660. An extensive series of calendars extending from the reign of Henry III to that of Richard III, and with an appendix of lists to the reign of James VI and I, was published in four volumes by the Record Commission between 1806 and 1828, edited by John Caley and John Bayley. However, these volumes were later judged by Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte to be of \"unsatisfactory character\", and to contain many omissions. In 1865 two volumes were published, covering the reigns of Henry III and Edward I, in a new series edited by Charles Roberts entitled \"Calendarium Genealogicum\", which concentrated on providing the names of heirs omitted from the previous publications, designed to be of particular use to genealogists. In 1898 the production of three volumes covering the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509) was started, and was completed in 1955. In 1904 the first volume of a new series of Inq.p.m.'s was published, intended to be more complete and systematic, under Maxwell Lyte's editorship. It covered the reign of Henry III, from 1236, when the practice of producing inq.p.m.'s began. This \"first series\" continued for 26 volumes, the last volume having been published in 2009, although volumes were not published in chronological order. Winchester University and the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London are currently working on a project to publish on-line in searchable format a revised and expanded series of all existing texts covering the years 1236–1447 and 1485–1509. The project also aims in the long-term to produce calendars for the first time of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1542. A number of county record societies have published calendars of Inq.p.m.'s relating to their own counties, abstracted from the chancery and exchequer rolls.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "98141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98141", "title": "Kitsch", "text": "Kitsch\n\nKitsch (; loanword from German), also called cheesiness or tackiness, is art or other objects that appeal to popular rather than high art tastes. Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly ironic or humorous way. The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with aesthetics that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated sentimentality and melodrama. Hence, 'kitsch art' is closely associated with 'sentimental art'. Kitsch is also related to the concept of camp, because of its humorous and ironic nature.\n\nTo brand visual art as \"kitsch\" is generally pejorative, as it implies that the work in question is gaudy, or that it serves a solely ornamental and decorative purpose rather than amounting to a work of true artistic merit. The term is also sometimes applied to music or literature.\n\nAs a descriptive term, \"kitsch\" originated in the art markets of Munich in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches. In \"Das Buch vom Kitsch\" (\"The Book of Kitsch\"), Hans Reimann defines it as a professional expression \"born in a painter's studio\".\n\nThe study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in German until the 1970s, with Walter Benjamin being an important scholar in the field.\n\nModernist writer Hermann Broch argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good. According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch is, unlike art, a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer; it \"offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation\".\n\nKitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer. According to Roger Scruton, \"Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious.\"\n\nTomáš Kulka in \"Kitsch and Art\" starts from two basic facts that kitsch \"has an undeniable mass-appeal\" and \"considered (by the art-educated elite) bad\" and then proposes three essential conditions: \n\nThe Kitsch movement is an international movement of classical painters, founded in 1998 upon a philosophy proposed by Odd Nerdrum and later clarified in his book \"On Kitsch\" in cooperation with Jan-Ove Tuv and others, incorporating the techniques of the Old Masters with narrative, romanticism, and emotionally charged imagery.\n\n\n\n"}

It was compiled in 1835 by his student Heinrich Gustav Hotho, using Hegel's own hand-written notes and notes his students took during the lectures, but Hotho's work may render some of Hegel's thought more systematic than Hegel's initial presentation.\n\nHegel's Aesthetics is regarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been produced since Aristotle. Hegel's thesis about the historical dissolution of art has been the subject of much scholarly debate and influenced such thinkers like Theodor W. Adorno, Martin Heidegger, György Lukács, Jacques Derrida and Arthur Danto. Hegel was himself influenced by Johann Joachim Winckelmann, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Schiller and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. Heidegger calls Hegel's \"Lectures on Aesthetics\" \"the most comprehensive reflection on the essence of art that the West possesses\".\n\nHegel develops his account of art as a mode of absolute spirit that he calls \"the beautiful ideal,\" which he defines most generally as Now when truth in this its external existence [\"Dasein\"] is present to consciousness immediately, and with the concept remains immediately in unity with its external appearance, the Idea is not only true but \"beautiful\". \"Beauty\" is determined as the sensible \"shining\" of the Idea. This ideal is developed throughout the \"Lectures\" accordance Hegel's \"Logic\":\n\nIn these second two parts of the \"Lectures\", Hegel documents the development of art from the paradigmatically symbolic architecture to the paradigmatically classical sculpture to the romantic arts of painting, music, and poetry. At the time it was noted for the wealth of pictures included with it.\n\nContrary to once-common belief, Hegel nowhere declares art to be \"dead.\" What he says, in a representative statement is, \"For us art counts no longer as the highest mode in which truth procures existence for itself.\" He speaks frequently of its \"dissolution\" [\"Auflösung\"], not its end [\"Ende\"], despite Hotho's use of the latter for the heading of the final moment of the Romantic art form.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is dressed in a real bodice, tutu and ballet slippers and has a wig of real hair. All but a hair ribbon and the tutu are covered in wax. The 28 bronze repetitions that appear in museums and galleries around the world today were cast after Degas' death. The tutus worn by the bronzes vary from museum to museum.\n\nThe exact relationship between Marie van Goethem and Edgar Degas is a matter of debate. It was common in 1880 for the \"Petits Rats\" of the Paris Opera to seek protectors from among the wealthy visitors at the back door of the opera.\n\nRealistic wax figures with real hair and real clothes had also been popular in religious, Folk, and fine arts for centuries before Degas created his \"Little Dancer\".\n\nThe arms are taut, and the legs and feet are placed in a ballet position akin to fourth position at rest, and there is tension in the pose, an image of a ballerina being put through her paces, not posing in an angelic way. Her face is – \"contorted, people thought it was a deliberate image of ugliness, but you could also say it's the image of a sickly gawky adolesecent who is being made to do something she doesn't totally want to do.\"\n\nWhen the \"La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans\" was shown in Paris at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881, it received mixed reviews. Joris-Karl Huysmans called it \"the first truly modern attempt at sculpture I know.\" Certain critics were shocked by the piece, and the dancer was compared to a monkey and an Aztec. One critic, Paul Mantz, called her the \"flower of precocious depravity,\" with a face \"marked by the hateful promise of every vice\" and \"bearing the signs of a profoundly heinous character.\" Comparisons with older art were made, perhaps partly because it was exhibited in a glass case, like classical sculpture in the Louvre, and was dressed in wig and clothes.\n\nAfter Degas' death, his heirs (brother and sister's children) made the decision to have the bronze repetitions of \"Le Petite Danseuse\" and other wax and mixed-media sculptures cast. The casting took place at the Hébrard foundry in Paris from 1920 until 1936 when the Hébrard foundry went bankrupt and closed. Thereafter, \"Hébrard\" Degas \"Little Dancer\" bronzes were cast at the Valsuani foundry in Paris until the mid-1970s. Sixty-nine of Degas' wax sculptures survived the casting process. One copy of \"Le Petite Danseuse\" is currently owned by the creator and owner of Auto Trader, John Madejski. He stated that he bought the sculpture by accident. That copy was sold for £13,257,250 ($19,077,250) at Sotheby's on February, 3rd 2009. Another Hébrard \"Little Dancer\" bronze failed to sell at a November 2011 auction at Christie's.\n\nTo construct the statue, Degas used pigmented beeswax, with a metal armature, rope, and paintbrushes covered by clay for structural support.\n\nThe \"Little Dancer\" wax sculpture we see today is a reworked version of the original sculpture that was shown in 1881. After seeing the wax sculpture in Degas’ living quarters in April 1903, the New York collector Louisine Havemeyer expressed interest in buying the wax. After proposing a bronze or cast wax of the sculpture, which Mrs. Havemeyer refused, Degas took his wax figure upstairs to his working studio and told Vollard he was reworking the sculpture for Havemeyer for 40,000 francs. Degas never sold the sculpture to Mrs. Havemeyer. After Degas died, it was found in a corner of his studio. Paul Lefond, Degas’ biographer, described the \"Little Dancer\" wax after Degas’ death as \"nothing but a ruin;\" and Mary Cassatt telegraphed Mrs. Havemeyer \"Statue Bad Condition.\" However, the wax sculpture we know today is not a ruin. It is Degas' reworked second version of his wax figure. At some point before Degas extensively reworked his sculpture, he allowed a plaster to be cast from the wax figure. This recently re-discovered plaster records the \"Little Dancer\"’s original pose, bodice, and hairdo. The plaster is now in a private collection in the United States.\n\nThe original wax sculpture was acquired by Paul Mellon in 1956. Beginning in 1985, Mr and Mrs Mellon gave the National Gallery of Art 49 Degas waxes, 10 bronzes and 2 plasters, the largest group of original Degas sculptures. \"Little Dancer\" was among the bequests. In 1997, the Airaindor-Valsuani foundry in France began casting a limited edition of Degas bronzes from the pre-1903 \"Little Dancer\" plaster. One such \"Little Dancer\" bronze is owned by the M.T. Abraham Foundation, which, at times, is lent to other institutions and museums including the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Like the various states of many of Degas' prints, the Valsuani bronzes record the first version of Degas' \"Little Dancer\", while the Hébrard casts record the second and final state of the sculpture.\n\nArt historian Richard Kendall published a scholarly account of the history of Degas's sculpture, \"Degas and the Little Dancer\", with contributions by Douglas Druick and Arthur Beale. The BBC Two documentary \"The Private Life of a Masterpiece: Little Dancer Aged Fourteen\", produced in 2004, closely examines the sculpture, the model, the circumstances of her life, and the critical reaction to the work. Cathy Marie Buchanan's novel, \"The Painted Girls\", presents a fictionalised account of the life of Marie van Goethem, the model for the sculpture, as does Carolyn Meyer's young adult novel \"Marie, Dancing\" and Laurence Anholt's children's picture book \"Degas and the Little Dancer\". In 2014, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. premiered the stage musical, \"Little Dancer\", inspired by the story of the young ballerina immortalized by Edgar Degas in his famous sculpture. On September 12, 2016, Dr. Gregory Hedberg presented a paper entitled \"Unraveling the Mysteries of Degas’ \"Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen\",\" at the French Institute, Alliance Français, in New York City.\n\nThe piece inspired two of Damien Hirst's works, \"Virgin Mother\" and \"Verity\".\n\nThe sculpture is prominently featured in the 1993 thriller \"Malice\".\n\n"}

Although in a broader sense the term applies to art from this region from all periods, it generally refers to Romanesque art, with Mosan Romanesque architecture, stone carving, metalwork, enamelling and manuscript illumination reaching a high level of development during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe Meuse valley lay in the heart of the Carolingian Empire and therefore the style draws largely from the heritage of the Carolingian art tradition. Thus, Mosan art contains strong classical elements, which separates it from the international Romanesque style seen elsewhere during the period, for example in France, Germany England and Italy. However, it shares with mainstream Romanesque art elements such as the treatment of space. Although the iconography of 11th- and 12th-century Meuse valley art largely draws on Biblical inspiration, some of the elaborately carved capitals in the two main churches in Maastricht depict scenes from many aspects of daily life, as well as images from an intriguing world of fantasy.\n\nThe Mosan region was formed largely by the boundary of the Bishopric of Liège, which had strong political links to the emperors of the Holy Roman Empire, as well as to the bishops of Cologne. The region's main artistic centres were the cities of Liège, Huy, Dinant, Namur, Tongeren, Maastricht, Roermond and Aachen, as well as a number of important monasteries: Sint-Truiden, Aldeneik, Herkenrode, Averbode, Munsterbilzen, Susteren, Sint Odiliënberg, Rolduc, Burtscheid, Kornelimünster, Stavelot, Nivelles, Aulne, Floreffe, Flône, Celles, Gembloux and Lobbes. Mosan art at its peak had a strong influence on bordering regions, notably on Rhineland art (Cologne, Bonn).\n\nMosan Romanesque art has been described by art historians as the first golden age of Netherlandish art (before early Netherlandish painting and Dutch Golden Age painting). Usually the term Mosan art does not include Medieval literature although Heinrich von Veldeke may be considered the first poet writing in Middle Dutch (as well as Middle High German).\n\nMosan architecture can be seen as a distinctive branch in Romanesque architecture, a regional style that produced imposing churches in Aachen, Liège and Maastricht, as well as monasteries in rural areas. The fully developed Mosan style of the 12th century is a comprise between the older Meuse valley traditions and foreign influences, mainly coming from the Rhineland and Italy. An outstanding factor in Mosan architecture is the closed west front (westwerk). Unfortunately, some of the largest churches, notably Liège cathedral, and the Stavelot and Sint-Truiden abbeys, were destroyed.\nMosan stone carving reached a peak in the 12th century in Maastricht, Liège and Nivelles. Maastricht 'metsen' (stone carvers) worked on capitals and reliefs as far afield as Utrecht, Bonn and Eisenach.\nMetalwork has been considered the high art of the 12th and early 13th-century Meuse region, culminating in the work of Nicholas of Verdun, which is of exceptionally high quality. The Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral, the Anno Shrine in Siegburg and the Shrine of Our Lady in Tournai are among his best work. Other important metalworkers were Renier de Huy and Hugo d'Oignies.\nVery little has come to us from what must have been an impressive body of Mosan murals. Wolfram von Eschenbach, in his Parzival expressed his high regard for Maastricht (and Cologne) painters (Parzival, 158, 13-16). Book illumination, like the rest of the arts, was at its zenith in the second half of the 12th century. The principal centres were the abbey of Saint Laurent in Liège and the abbeys of Stavelot and Lobbes. Another highly developed art was vitreous enameling.\n\n\n"}

Students of Oberlin Conservatory enter a very broad network within the music world, as the school's alumni can be found in most major professional ensembles. It is one of the few American conservatories to be completely attached to a liberal arts college (Oberlin College). This allows students the opportunity to seriously pursue degrees in both music and a traditional liberal arts subject via the five year Double-Degree program. Oberlin College and Conservatory pride themselves on being almost exclusively undergraduate.\n\nThe Oberlin Collegiate Institute was built on of land, founded in 1833 and became Oberlin College in 1850. In 1867, two years after the Oberlin Conservatory's founding in 1865, the previously separate Oberlin Conservatory became incorporated with the college on a similar grant.\n\nIn tandem, the administration claimed that \"Oberlin is peculiar in that which is good,\" notable as the first college and first conservatory in the United States to regularly admit African-American students. Oberlin College's role as an educator of African-American students prior to the Civil War and thereafter is historically significant. Notable is the graduation of William Grant Still, a student who widely became regarded as the \"dean of African-American composers.\" These efforts have helped Oberlin remain committed to its values of freedom, social justice, and service.\nIt is also the oldest continuously operating coeducational conservatory, since its incorporation with Oberlin College, the first coeducational college. The college and conservatory were listed as a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, for its significance in social progress.\n\nDue to the Conservatory's affiliation with Elisha Gray, inventor of the electromechanical oscillator, and Thaddeus Cahill, inventor of the telharmonium, Oberlin Conservatory plays a role in the origins of electronic music. The TIMARA (Technology In Music And Related Arts) program was the world's first conservatory program in this field, established in 1967. Brian Jortner is widely recognized as the first student-professor to have performed noise music in an academic context, eventually becoming widely recognized for his famous \"I Make A Mess;;;\" series of acoustic pieces.\n\nOberlin Conservatory was the recipient of the 2009 National Medal of Arts, the highest award given by the United States government to artists and arts patrons in recognition of the wealth and depth of their creative expressions. The Oberlin Conservatory of Music is the only professional music school to be so honored by President Barack Obama.\n\nDue to the conservatory's affiliation with Oberlin College, students may either enter the Conservatory only or Oberlin's five year Double-Degree program, in which the student will complete both a Bachelor of Music degree as well as a Bachelor of Arts. Admission is based primarily on an extremely competitive audition: over 1,400 musicians from around the world apply for a freshman class of around 120.\n\nThe Conservatory was previously housed in Warner Hall, a large stone building where the King Building now stands. It now occupies four interconnected buildings on the south side of Tappan Square. The original structure of three big white buildings was designed by the Japanese-American architect Minoru Yamasaki in 1963, which closely resembles Yamasaki's later design of the World Trade Center in New York City.\n\nIn 2010, The Bertram and Judith Kohl Building opened to provide a new home for the Jazz Studies, Music History, and Music Theory departments. Kohl is connected to Robertson by a third-floor enclosed bridge, which also contains the Sky Bar, named for the iconic Cleveland jazz club that closed in 1954.\n\nThe Robertson Building houses around 150 practice rooms, most with windows. In addition, the Otto B. Schoepfle Vocal Arts Center, Career Resource Center, Kulas Organ Center, reed-making rooms, computer labs, faculty studios, and staff offices are located here.\n\nThe Conservatory contains the largest collection of Steinway & Sons pianos, outside of the Steinway factory, in the world.\n\nIn an interview between Frank J. Oteri and Timothy Weiss, the coach of the famous contemporary music ensemble \"eighth blackbird,\" Weiss states \"One advantage [of Oberlin] is that there are only undergraduates, and the reason I think this is an advantage is that at ... schools you might name that have a very strong or large population of graduate students is that those students, by their nature, tend to be somewhat more vocationally minded. They are understandably worried about their next step as musicians: How are they going to enter the industry? How are they going to make a living? And because of that, that can trickle down. The nice thing at Oberlin is that they are immensely talented, but they're not really concerned about their future. They might be a little bit, but it's not what occupies their thoughts. They are thinking about music as an art form. They're preoccupied with how they're going to change the artistic culture. And I think that's actually very important.\"\n\nBachelor of Music Program (BM):\nOberlin Conservatory offers private study in 31 applied areas and undergraduate majors, including a double major in piano performance and vocal accompanying.\n\n\nPerformance Diploma (PDip):\nThis four-semester program, offered only in certain performance departments, is designed for the very small number of gifted performers who have not yet completed the BM or its equivalent and who are seeking a very narrowly focused program of study leading to a performance-oriented career. Performance Diploma students may apply to transfer to the Bachelor of Music program before the end of the program. Students seeking admission to the BM degree must demonstrate skills necessary to complete both the performance and academic coursework required for the BM. Students who have completed requirements for both the BM and the Performance Diploma will receive only the BM.\n\nMaster of Music in Conducting (MM):\nThe MM in Conducting is available only as part of five-year programs integrated with an Oberlin Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Performance, Composition, or Music History.\n\nMaster of Music in Historical Performance (MM):\nThe MM in Performance on Historical Instruments is intended for a limited number of students who have acquired skills on historical instruments and who wish to pursue practical study in performance in combination with the study of performance practice and musicology. Concentrations are offered in harpsichord, fortepiano, organ, Baroque violin, Baroque flute, recorder, Baroque cello/viola da gamba, historical keyboard instruments (harpsichord, fortepiano, and organ, combined), and historical oboes (Baroque, Classical, and other oboes). Students holding an undergraduate degree from another institution will take four semesters to complete the program. Oberlin undergraduates may audition during their junior year for a five-year program which combines the Bachelor of Music degree in a modern instrument with the MM in an historical instrument.\n\nMaster of Music in Teaching (MMT):\nThe MMT is a fourteen-month degree program leading to teacher licensure and a master's degree in teaching. The degree is available in integration with an Oberlin Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Performance or Composition, or after completion of a Bachelor of Music degree in Performance or Composition from an institution other than Oberlin.\nLearn more about Master of Music Teaching\n\nArtist Diploma (ADip):\nThis four-semester program, offered only in certain performance departments, is intended for a limited number of exceptionally gifted performers who have completed the BM or its equivalent, who have acquired extensive musical background through institutional or private studies or through unusual performing experiences, and who wish to concentrate on private applied study without additional course requirements. Oberlin Conservatory Bachelor of Music graduates may apply to the Artist Diploma program only with the recommendation of the department and approval of the Office of Associate Deans of the Conservatory. Students who enroll in and/or complete the Artist Diploma program may not transfer to the Bachelor of Music degree program.\n\nThe Double-Degree Program:\nThe Double-Degree Program represents combined Study in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Conservatory of Music. Students accepted to both the College of Arts and Sciences and the Conservatory of Music pursue a degree in each division. Oberlin’s encouragement of such study–in conjunction with an exceptionally broad range of course options–makes Oberlin a uniquely effective environment for the study of both music and the liberal arts.\n\nFaculty\nAlumni\nSee also\n\n"}
{"id": "5967984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967984", "title": "Opus sectile", "text": "Opus sectile\n\nOpus sectile is an art technique popularized in the ancient and medieval Roman world where materials were cut and inlaid into walls and floors to make a picture or pattern. Common materials were marble, mother of pearl, and glass. The materials were cut in thin pieces, polished, then trimmed further according to a chosen pattern. Unlike tessellated mosaic techniques, where the placement of very small uniformly sized pieces forms a picture, \"opus sectile\" pieces are much larger and can be shaped to define large parts of the design.\n\nAlthough early examples have been found from Egypt and Asia Minor, the most prominent artifacts remain from 4th century Rome. A large set from the Basilica of Junius Bassus survived, depicting an elaborate chariot and other things. The popularity of \"opus sectile\" decoration continued in Rome through the 6th century, and affected areas as far as Constantinople (now Istanbul in Turkey). Particularly remarkable are a series of \"opus sectile\" glass panels, found in a possible sanctuary of Isis at the eastern Corinthian port of Kenchreai, in excavations carried out in the 1960s; they have scenes of famous authors like Homer and Plato, scenes of Nilotic landscapes, harbour-front cities and geometric panels. Recent work in Jerusalem has recovered enough pieces of floor tile from the Herodian Temple Mount to reconstruct geometric patterns of \"opus sectile\" flooring.\n\nAlthough the technique died in Rome with the decline of the Empire, it continued to be used prominently in Byzantine churches, primarily in floor designs. From Byzantium it was eventually brought back to Sicily and the Italian mainland, in the 12th century as the Cosmatesque style, concentrating on geometric patterns. There was a major revival from the Italian Renaissance in the form of pietra dura work, although this normally consists of much smaller compositions and it is used on furniture, mainly. Architectural work from later periods tends to be called Intarsia.\n\nIn England, the technique was revived in the late 19th century by artists working in the Arts and Crafts movement. Charles Hardgrave, whose designs were executed by James Powell & Sons at the Whitefriars Glass Works, was a noted designer in this technique.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57494507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57494507", "title": "Portrayal of women scientists in film", "text": "Portrayal of women scientists in film\n\nThe portrayal of women scientists in film refers to the way that professional women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are written as film characters. The portrayal of women is a hotly contested talking point in the film community, with feminists saying that women are not accurately depicted in films. Judith Mayne, author and professor of women's studies at Ohio State University, claims that the study of female characters in film began with movements from the 1960s and 1970s in the form of second-wave feminism, the rise of independent films, and the beginning of academic film studies.\n\nScholars offer several different stereotypes that academic women fall under in films. Eva Flicker, professor of sociology specializing in film at the University of Vienna, is a leading scholar on the topic of academic women in film, specifically women in the sciences. Flicker writes that the role of women scientists often reflect that \"job stereotypes are combined with gender stereotypes.\"\n\nNot all scholars believe that objectification is reserved solely for female characters in films. Nöel Carroll, professor of philosophy at Cornell University, writes that men are also strategically blocked for the audience's viewing pleasure. Carroll does not disagree with the notion that women are objectified in film; rather, his stance says that women are not the only ones affected by the erotic gaze of viewers.\n\nGorillas in the Mist (1988)\n\nThe film Gorillas in the Mist based on the book by Dian Fossey appears to show respect for the fact that a woman would rather work on her career than be a stereotypical housewife. The story is about the scientist Fossey that leaves the United States to study gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. As she bonds with the gorillas, she worries about poachers and devotes her time to protecting the animals. Fossey is shown as an independent woman, breaking the common trope of women being the homemaker.\n\nJurassic Park (1993)\n\nThe 1993 film Jurassic Park, based on the novel by Michael Crichton depicts a paleobotanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler. She is portrayed with great physical ability, allowing her to survive multiple attacks from dinosaurs. She is shown to have extensive knowledge about dinosaurs and plant life throughout the movie.\n\nGravity (2013)\n\nThe 2013 film \"Gravity\", directed by Alfonso Cuarón and starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, is often heralded as a breakthrough feminist film due to Bullock's starring role. Some who have critiqued the film have written that \"Gravity\" \"proves that a woman can anchor an action-packed blockbuster that does \"not\" have to include violence, superheroes, weapons and/or huge death tolls.\" While the film's lead is a woman, she gets by with help from her male counterpart, played by Clooney. Bullock's character Ryan Stone is described as \"the very model of the damsel in distress,\" as she can never get out of a situation on her own and must lean on Clooney's character to do the heavy lifting. The role of Bullock's character is thought to be an act of defiant feminism, as she is the lead in a science fiction film, but below the surface viewers find that the film actually subscribes to traditional gender stereotypes and does not at all portray Bullock's character as a true independent woman.\n\nIn terms of intelligence, women are not often portrayed as equal to men. Eva Flicker writes that in science fiction films, men are overwhelmingly portrayed as scientists, making up 82% of all film scientists. After reviewing 60 movies, Flicker has placed the women shown in science fiction films into six categories.\n\nThis type of woman scientist is \"only interested in her work\" and is often depicted having a nondescript appearance and style. As the film progresses, a man saves her and brings out her feminine side, after which she becomes more attractive. However, she loses credibility as an academic and suddenly makes more mistakes than when she did not focus as much on her appearance. Based on this type of story, Flicker concludes that \"femininity and intelligence are mutually exclusive characteristics in a woman's film role.\" An example of this woman in a film can be seen in \"Spellbound\", in the character Dr. Constance Peterson.\n\nThis type of woman works with men in an all male environment. Because of this, she has a \"harsh voice\" and occasionally \"succumbs to an unhealthy lifestyle,\" such as partaking in smoking and drinking, to fit in with the boys. Flicker claims that this type of woman is \"lost somewhere in the middle\" of masculinity and femininity, meaning she is not as sexual a character as other women are, but she is also not on the same level as the men she works with. This decreases her credibility both as a women and as one trying to fit into \"a man's world.\" In the end, her heightened female emotions allow her to contribute to a solution, which is her redeeming quality as a character. The \"male woman\" character appears in the 1970 science fiction film \"Andromeda Strain\".\n\nSeen in \"\", this woman scientist does very little. For the sake of the dramatization of the film, she is crucial, but she does not advance the story and does not contribute much to the solution. Instead, her femininity causes more trouble for the team of scientists. She is young, attractive, and subject to experience womanly emotions which add an extra layer to the existing predicament, forcing the man to solve the problem in order to get the team out of trouble. She is \"naïve in her actions,\" messing up every task that is given to her despite her extensive education and knowledge, while her male counterpart stands in stark contrast and ends up saving the day.\n\nThe \"evil plotter\" woman is young and very beautiful, and she uses her feminine charm to trick the men into doing what she wants. She has an ulterior motive, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from what the rest of the team is trying to accomplish. She is the character that the audience and the other characters despise by the end of the movie because she is devilishly smart and knows how to use her scientific knowledge and sexual prowess for evil. This bombshell character type was portrayed by Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider in \"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\".\n\nThis role of female scientist encompasses many feminine stereotypes portrayed in movies. In this role the woman is subordinate to her male counterpart, who is either her father or her lover. She is smart and capable, but her secondary role does not allow her to demonstrate her abilities. Flicker writes that when this woman plays the role of lover to the male scientist, \"her work place is limited to the bed.\" She is only good for sexual satisfaction, not for the degree she earned. The assistant role is seen in the female Dr. Medford in the film \"Them!\", as she is portrayed alongside an older gentleman of the same name.\n\nThis type of woman scientist is intelligent, attractive, and somewhat independent. Flicker says that she \"has appropriated some male traits,\" such as losing herself in her work. She is both sexual and smart, and she manages to exhibit both qualities in the film. Despite this, she is still subordinate to the men on her team, and depends on them and their work in order to gain respect. She is the most progressive of the woman scientist types, but she lacks her own form of independence and still must rely on a sexual relationship with a man in order to be seen as someone. The \"lonely heroine\" type is best seen in Jodie Foster's portrayal of Elleonore Arroway in the film \"Contact\".\nFlicker argues that women are often pigeonholed into these six limiting roles when written in films. Each of these roles places the female scientist character on the sidelines, and does not allow her to be on the same level as her male counterpart(s). Despite the fact that the women in these roles are educated, and often just as educated as the men on their team, they are used primarily as assistants and sexual characters. Producers strategically write women's roles for the male gaze, often making the female characters use their \"weapons of a woman,\" such as sex appeal, to be attractive to male characters and viewers alike.\n\nFeminist film theorist Laura Mulvey writes that in film, women are passive objects of the male gaze. Mulvey writes that movies fulfill \"a primordial wish for pleasurable looking,\" and that male audiences are largely catered to in the film industry. In her analysis of film, she states that the lead woman in a film often falls in love with her male counterpart, and when she does, she only exists as a character to please him. Through the male character's ownership of the woman, the men in the audience find themselves owning her as well.\n\nMale gaze is a big factor to consider when looking at female scientists and how they are portrayed in films. Typically women are viewed as sexual objects for pleasure of males who view these films. This has a direct effect on how people interpret women scientists and their role in movies. Instead of being portrayed as superheroes, they begin to obtain a reputation based on sexual appeal.\n\nConsidering superhero films, Amy Shackelford mentions how the male gaze is applied to hypersexualize the female character, further misinterpreting women in the media through visual depiction. Looking at these particular films, screenwriters have a difficult time accomplishing the task of writing female characters. Shackelford also states that it seems like the only way these screenwriters know how to portray female characters in superhero films power is to hypersexualize them.\n\nJudith Mayne supports Laura Mulvey's view. She writes that \"most feminist film theory and criticism of the last decade\" has been in written in response to Mulvey's 1975 assessment, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.\" She argues that understanding the often sexist portrayal of women in film requires \"an understanding of patriarchy as oppressive and as vulnerable.\" Mayne goes deeper in her argument claiming that feminist film theory inspired feminist documentaries that are \"aimed at rejecting stereotyped images of women.\" This criticism also opens the question about \"the notion of woman as 'image.'\"\n\nLaw professor Sarah Eschholz and her colleagues Jana Bufkin and Jenny Long write that in film, women are often young, and female characters are rarely played by middle aged or older women. Often the only role available to these women is that of the mother, who is not meant to be a leading character. They write that \"females' primary societal value is based on physical appearance and youthful beauty.\" According to their assessment, men are valued at all ages, and arguably more so as they age and become wiser. Most women in film are 35 years old or younger, while their male costars are often older. Despite women in film having impressive credentials and extensive educations, they are often reduced to objects for looking, due to a reluctance to hire an older, less attractive woman for a major role.\n\nIn the traditional husband and wife family, women are often portrayed as the second in command. Their husbands take on the role of family head and get to maintain a bachelor level of freedom, which allows them to work and spend time out with the guys. Eschholz, Bufkin, and Long report on studies that show female characters are more likely to be married and have a family than male characters. Men have the freedom to work and be protagonists through their actions, while their wives or girlfriends are forced to take a back seat in the story in order to care for the family.\n\nNöel Carroll references Mulvey's pivotal paper on psychoanalysis and visual pleasure in his writing, and plays devil's advocate to her claim that women are the only subjects of gaze. Carroll acknowledges and agrees with Mulvey's assessment that women in film are strategically placed for the male gaze despite the role of their actual character. Carroll states, \"Women in Hollywood film are staged and blocked for the purpose of male erotic contemplation and pleasure.\" However, Carroll adds that men in films are also strategically placed for the purpose of pleasure. He cites such examples as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, big bodybuilding actors \"whose scenes are blocked and staged precisely to afford spectacles of bulging pectorals and other parts.\" Similarly to actresses, male actors are also heralded for their facial attractiveness and are sometimes lauded exclusively for being attractive. As an example, Carroll brings in Leslie Howard, an actor in \"Of Human Bondage\" and \"Gone With the Wind,\" who was highly successful in the industry despite being \"staggeringly ineffectual.\" According to Carroll, being subject to the erotic gaze of the audience is not an exclusively female burden; rather, both sexes fall prey to Hollywood camera angles that best show off their bodies.\n\nKristin Thompson, an American film theorist, analyzes the film \"Laura.\" In her analysis, she claims that the main character, Laura, was written to embody the role of \"passive visual object,\" which Mulvey and Flicker claim is an extremely prevalent role of women in film. However, Thompson, like Carroll, does not believe that this passive role is limited to women in the industry. Thompson claims that Mulvey's assessment stating that women are used as objects and men cannot handle being the subject of gaze is \"common but not universal\" in the film industry. She claims that men are also presented in flashy ways in film, and gives the example of Howard Keel in the film \"Show Boat.\" Her analysis aligns with Carroll's conclusion that both sexes must be the subject of the audience's gaze, and that objectification is all-encompassing.\n\nStudies have shown that female scientists are either underrepresented or misrepresented as film characters. As Eva Flicker writes, film has a way of taking social realities and expressing women in . The media formats then are able to influence the audience by creating a mirror of metaphors, myths, opinions and a social memory resulting in stereotypes. The ways that women scientists are portrayed in films have contributed to viewers holding certain stereotypes of scientists. A 2007 meta-analysis by Jocelyn Steinke of Western Michigan University and colleagues looked at gender stereotyping by children who have been exposed to images of scientists through films, television shows, and books. One study reported on consisted of elementary school students taking the Draw-a-Scientist-Test, or DAST. The results showed that out of the over 4,000 children who participated in the DAST, only 28 girls drew female scientists. Another study of 1,137 Korean students between the ages of eleven and fifteen found that 74 percent of them drew male scientists, while only 16 percent had depicted female scientists. The study includes the result that gender stereotypes can be the product of the environment a person possess and can influence how a person views themselves and others around them. As social media platforms are being used more and more each day by adolescences, the reinforcement of cultural norms is at an all time high. Even before young women reach adolescence, social media platforms transform their images of women into the different stereotypes of dependent, emotional and less capable beings.\n\n"}
{"id": "17010814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17010814", "title": "Rio Grande (song)", "text": "Rio Grande (song)\n\n\"Rio Grande\" is a psychedelic western saga co-written by Brian Wilson and Andy Paley and co-produced by Brian Wilson and Lenny Waronker for Brian Wilson's first solo album. Its modular set of movements hearkened back to the style that Brian Wilson used during the \"Good Vibrations\"/\"Smile\" era with musique concrète. \"Rio Grande\" was evidence that he could still create brilliant, pictorial landscapes of music similar to \"Smile\" whenever he had the freedom, confidence, and courage to do so. It is the longest piece of music in the Brian Wilson catalogue at eight minutes and 12 seconds.\n\nAlthough it did not contain Van Dyke Parks' imagery or have the out-of-the-box, ambitious enlightenment of the \"Smile\"-era work, it gave \"Brian Wilson\" the progressive relativity of a genuine comeback album. Mostly, \"Rio Grande\" unmasked a notion of the old Brian Wilson and helped bridge a gap between the original \"Smile\" and the long-awaited, eventual 2004 release of \"Smile\".\n\nWaronker and Seymour Stein, the President of Sire Records, encouraged Wilson to make an impressionistic collage that had made \"Smile\" an interesting listening experience. Eugene Landy suggested to Brian to make a suite about the development of an individual. However, it was Lenny Waronker who insinuated to Brian to undertake a more complex, revealing, and provisional composition with an Old West theme inspired by the Howard Hawks film \"Red River\" and also the movie \"Rio Grande\". A Hawaiian theme was also being considered at the time but was dropped in favor of a Western theme. Work on \"Rio Grande\" began on October 1, 1987, which happened at the same time as a Los Angeles earthquake. A similar concept being worked on during the same period involved \"Saturday Morning in the City\" and \"Saturday Evening in the City\" about describing an ordinary Californian suburban weekend but was soon dropped. Early titles before \"Rio Grande\" was chosen included 'Baby, Child, Adult,' 'Child, Adult, and Parent,' and \"Life's Suite.\" The lyrics of \"Life's Suite\" (pun intended), written by Landy, were brought in at the last moment and were rejected out of hand by Waronker.\n\nThe idea of \"Rio Grande\" was conceived as far back as 1970 when Waronker came by Brian's Bellagio mansion with Brian playing him the basic melody of \"Cool, Cool Water.\" Waronker got the notion if he ever got the chance to produce him; he would want a synthesis of the commercial \"Good Vibrations\" combined with the pacific \"Cool, Cool Water\" leading to \"Rio Grande\" years later. Its different \"feels\" and movements relate specifically to \"Cabin Essence\", \"Cool, Cool Water\", and most of all, \"Heroes and Villains.\" The mosaic suite could easily be compared to the Who's \"A Quick One While He's Away\" and \"Rael\" as a mini-rock opera. It also would easily have been perfect for the unrealized Americana theme on the original \"Smile\". The ending of the short snippet of \"Walk On By\" on the Friends/20/20 two-fer is reminiscent of \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" which later showed up in the middle of Part C of \"Rio Grande\" (see below). \"Rio Grande\" was recorded in sections at different studios across Los Angeles to sound like one cohesive work like earlier \"Smile\" recordings.\n\nThe first part, Part A, starts off with calliope-like music similar to the \"Fire\" music he had created 20 years before. The Baystate Bluegrass Band contributed to the suite as well as other different groups as stated above. 'Ride 'Em Cowboy' is repeated in a chant similar to his work on \"Smile\" (e.g. \"You're Welcome\", \"With Me Tonight\"). It segues into Part B with a steam engine whistle similar to the ending of \"Roll Plymouth Rock\" on the 2004 \"Smile\".\n\nPart B is the main theme of \"Rio Grande\" like an old cowboy song sung by Gene Autry or Roy Rogers. It has a riff similar to one from The Beach Boys' \"That Same Song.\" Part B is meta-physical and autobiographical in the sense of the 'river-as-allegory-of-life' idea, and the main character 'would swim the river but can't.' The Rio Grande also takes him on an adventure or journey like a Lewis and Clark expedition. It evokes images of Lone Ranger, Tom Mix, and Hopalong Cassidy as well as other iconic Western figures and makes explicit reference to the Cherokee Trail. In an earlier version of \"Rio Grande\", Part B included \"Cool, Cool Guy\" but was left out in the released version.\n\nIn Part C, the listener is taken to what sounds like a campfire vignette before being interrupted by a Native American rain dance followed by thunder and rain. The wordless vocal lines are similar to the \"Fire\" music from \"Smile\".\n\n\"Take Me Home\" is the name of Part D, in which the music slows down to a dream-like state where the main character is thinking about his girl who on the other side. It sounds like a variation of Part B before ending with a vocal segue.\n\nPart E is the profound \"Night Bloomin' Jasmine\" section, which was written in 1979. It was one of a short list of songs or pieces by Wilson written in a minor key. An early version was recorded in 1982 with brother Dennis at the infamous \"hamburger sessions\" and/or \"cocaine sessions.\" The odd 'Get A Job' interlude in the early version was excluded from the final version.\n\nThe music in the last section is a reprise of Part B, bringing the journey full-circle in which the main character experienced one man out in the wilderness against nature, the old west, and the great outdoors. Like the opposites in \"Smile\" such as \"Heroes and Villains\" and 'Lost & Found' in Cabin Essence, opposites exist in \"Rio Grande.\" These include: big man against little man, cowboy against Indian, and all men against nature.

{"id": "5601289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5601289", "title": "Royalty Theatre", "text": "Royalty Theatre\n\nThe Royalty Theatre was a small London theatre situated at 73 Dean Street, Soho, which opened in 1840 as Miss Kelly's Theatre and Dramatic School and finally closed to the public in 1938. The architect was Samuel Beazley. The theatre's opening was ill-fated, and it was little used for a decade. It changed its name twice and was used by an opera company, amateur drama companies and for French pieces.\n\nIn 1861, it was renamed the New Royalty Theatre, and the next year it was leased by Mrs Charles Selby, who enlarged it from 200 seats to about 650. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. In the 1860s, it featured F. C. Burnand's burlesque of \"Black-Eyed Susan\", which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, \"The Merry Zingara\". The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s, who also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's \"The Realm of Joy\" and \"Ought We to Visit Her?\" On 25 March 1875 the Royalty, under the direction of Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with \"Trial by Jury\".\n\nIn 1877, Kate Santley took control of the theatre, running it for nearly 30 years. She had the theatre rebuilt and it reopened in 1883. In this period, it featured opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer and plays in French. It was increasingly hard for the theatre to compete with larger new London theatres. In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama, presenting plays by Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw. When the theatre finally had a great success, with \"Charley's Aunt\" in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to a larger theatre. In 1895–96 the theatre underwent another renovation. Arthur Bourchier's \"The Chili Widow\" ran for over 300 nights. In the new century, Mrs. Patrick Campbell played at the theatre. After another renovation in 1906, Sarah Bernhardt led her own company in a season. In 1912, \"Milestones\", by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch had over 600 performances. \"The Man Who Stayed at Home\" played for 584 performances.\n\nThe Co-Optimists played at the theatre after the war as did Noël Coward's \"The Vortex\". In 1932, \"While Parents Sleep\" was a hit. The theatre closed in 1938 and was demolished in 1953.\n\nThe actress Frances Maria \"Fanny\" Kelly (1790–1882), used the fortune saved from her highly popular career to establish a dramatic academy with a 200-seat theatre attached. The architect of the theatre was Samuel Beazley. The theatre and school were completed in 1837. Kelley's engineer friend, Rowland Macdonald Stephenson, persuaded her to build into the theatre new machinery that he had invented to move the stage and scenery; theoretically a significant step forward in theatre technology. It took more than two years to install the machinery in the theatre. The theatre was \"obscurely sited [and] perilously combustible\", but it had \"a relatively spacious stage, and Beazley's work in the auditorium was thought pretty.\" \"The Times\" described the fashionable little theatre as \"most elegantly fitted up and appointed, and painted in a light tasteful manner.\" \nIt turned out that the machinery was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: \"Summer and Winter\", by Morris Barnett; a melodrama, \"The Sergeant's Wife\"; and a farce, \"The Midnight Hour\". The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill. She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of Charles Dickens's productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property.\n\nIn January 1850 the theatre was reopened as the Royal Soho Theatre, after redecoration by W. W. Deane and S. J. Nicholl, changing its name to the New English Opera House from November 1850, and in the following year an entrance portico was built. Various types of productions played at the theatre, including English Grand Opera. Performances were mostly by amateurs, hiring the theatre at standard rates. At other times, as the Theatre Français, it attracted patrons chiefly among the foreigners in Soho.\nIn 1861, the direction of the theatre was assumed by Albina di Rhona, a Serbian ballerina and comic actress. She renamed it the New Royalty Theatre, and had it altered and redecorated by \"M. Bulot, of Paris, Decorator in Ordinary to his Imperial Majesty, Louis Napoleon\", with \"cut-glass lustres, painted panels, blue satin draperies and gold mouldings\". In the opening programme, di Rhona danced, the leader of the Boston Brass Band from America played a bugle solo, and a melodrama, \"Atar Gull\", was performed, with a 14-year-old Ellen Terry in the cast. Still, the reopening was not a success.\n\nIn 1862, the theatre was leased by, Mrs Charles Selby, who also ran an acting school. She enlarged the original theatre to accommodate about 650 people. She used it to showcase her pupils and occasionally rented it to others. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. It was managed, from 1866 to 1870, by Martha Cranmer Oliver, who featured mostly burlesques, including F. C. Burnand's burlesque of \"Black-Eyed Susan\", which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, \"The Merry Zingara\". The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s. She also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's \"The Realm of Joy\" and \"Ought We to Visit her?\" In 1872, it became known as the Royalty Theatre and retained this name (although it was occasionally known as the New Royalty Theatre).\n\nOn 25 March 1875 the theatre, under the direction of Madame Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with \"Trial by Jury\", the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera produced by Richard D'Oyly Carte. It premiered together with Jacques Offenbach's \"La Périchole\" and another one-act farce, \"Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata\". Carte soon moved his Gilbert and Sullivan company to another theatre. In January 1876 at the Royalty, Pauline Rita appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in \"The Duke's Daughter\".\n\nIn 1877, Kate Santley \"seems to have acquired the head lease.\" She controlled the theatre for nearly 30 years. Carte joined forces with Santley in January 1877 to present \"Lischen and Fritzen\", Jacques Offenbach’s \"Orpheus in the Underworld\", and Carte's own operetta, \"Happy Hampstead\" written with his secretary, Frank Desprez. Later that year, the First Chief Officer of the London Fire Brigade strongly recommended that the theatre be closed. Santley had the theatre rebuilt, hiring architect Thomas Verity, who provided additional exits, and it reopened in 1883, with Santley receiving praise for the renovations. Many of the productions in these years were opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer, formerly of the Gaiety Theatre, staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the Comédie-Française appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognized home of the Parisian drama.' The opening of Shaftesbury Avenue and of larger new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the Lyric Theatre and the Apollo Theatre, drew audiences away from the Royalty, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.\nIn 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama. Ibsen's \"Ghosts\" premièred, to predictable outrage, at the theatre, in a single private London performance on 13 March 1891. The Lord Chamberlain's Office censorship was avoided by the formation of a subscription-only Independent Theatre Society, which included Thomas Hardy and Henry James among its members. Again, for the Society, George Bernard Shaw premièred \"Widowers' Houses\", his first play, here the following year. When the theatre finally had a great success, with Brandon Thomas’s play \"Charley's Aunt\" in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger Globe Theatre.\n\nIn 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was Arthur Bourchier, and the theatre underwent another renovation, by architect Walter Emden. Bourchier produced, among other plays, \"The Chili Widow\", an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights. In 1899, the first production of the Incorporated Stage Society took place with the first performance of Shaw's \"You Never Can Tell\". In 1900–01 Mrs. Patrick Campbell hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre. Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by W. B. Yeats and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of Synge's first play, \"The Shadow of the Glen\". In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.\n\nAgain, the theatre was threatened with closure by the authorities, but Santley had it rebuilt again in 1906 to meet safety requirements. After redecoration in French Regency style, which increased the capacity of the theatre to 657 seats, the Royalty reopened on 4 January 1906 with a season of Theatre Français directed by Gaston Mayer. Sarah Bernhardt led her own company in \"La Tosca, Phedre\" and \"La Dame aux Camelias\" in 1907. In 1911, J. E. Vedrenne and Dennis Eadie acquired the theatre, and in 1912, they staged \"Milestones\", by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch (later Knoblock), which had over 600 performances. Owen Nares, Gladys Cooper Lynn Fontanne appeared at the theatre early in their careers. \"The Man Who Stayed at Home\" was a hit at the Royalty in 1914, playing for 584 performances. Henry Daniell starred as Bobby Gilmour in \"The Man from Toronto\" at the theatre in May 1918.\n\nA post-war success was the concert-party entertainment, \"The Co-Optimists\", first staged in 1921. The year 1924 saw the first West End production at the theatre of Noël Coward's \"The Vortex.\" \"Juno and the Paycock\" was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's \"Pillars of Society\" played in 1926. Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with \"While Parents Sleep\". By 1936 the danger of fire from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the Lord Chamberlain that the theatre had been on the site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. J. B. Priestley's \"I Have Been Here Before\" was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players.\n\nAlthough several schemes were considered for its rebuilding, but with the growing threat of war, the theatre remained empty and soon became derelict. It was damaged in the World War II Blitz. The Royalty was demolished in 1953 and a block of offices, Royalty House, was erected on the site.\n\nA modern Royalty Theatre was opened in the basement of an office block at Portugal Street near Aldwych in 1960. This was bought by the London School of Economics and renamed the Peacock Theatre in 1996. It is a lecture hall by day and a venue for the Sadler's Wells Theatre company by night.\n\n"}
{"id": "58255345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58255345", "title": "Seymour Rosofsky", "text": "Seymour Rosofsky\n\nSeymour Rosofsky (b. 1924 – d. 1981) was an American artist, who has been described as one of the key figures in twentieth-century Chicago art. He emerged in the late 1940s at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (BFA, 1949; MFA, 1951), one of several G.I. Bill veterans, including Leon Golub, Cosmo Campoli and H. C. Westermann, who would join Don Baum, Dominick Di Meo, June Leaf, and Nancy Spero to form the influential movement later dubbed the “Monster Roster” by critic Franz Schulze, which was a precursor to the more well-known Chicago Imagists. Like others in the group, Rosofsky was drawn to the unsettling, macabre side of Surrealism, initially creating gestural, expressionist renderings of grotesque, existentially angst-ridden figures in isolated or uncomfortable situations, that gave way in the 1960s to more fantastical, observational paintings that examined power, politics and domestic relationships in an unflinching way. \nRosofsky was recognized for his deftness as a painter, his interest in drawing as a process and medium, and as a caricaturist. His work was exhibited in numerous Art Institute of Chicago “Chicago and Vicinity” shows, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago survey \"Art in Chicago: 1945–1995,\" the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a retrospective at the Krannert Art Museum (1984). He was also featured in the Franz Schulze’s book \"Fantastic Images\" (1972) and \"Monster Roster: Existential Art in Postwar Chicago\" (2016). His work can be found in the public collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, among others.\n\nRosofsky was born to Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants on the West Side of Chicago in 1924. He painted from an young age and took weekend classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) as a young teen. After he enrolled there, his studies were interrupted by military service in the Army during World War II from 1943–6; he completed his BFA in 1949 and an MFA in 1951, while also taking humanities courses at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University. At SAIC, Rosofsky studied oil painting with the Russian–born artist Boris Anisfeld, a former student of Marc Chagall, whose disciplined, academic teaching instilled in him an appreciation for art history and classical painting skills. He exhibited in the seminal, student-driven Momentum Exhibitions of 1948-1950, organized in protest over the exclusion of students from the Art Institute's prestigious \"Chicago and Vicinity\" shows. He was also featured, along with Campoli, Golub, and Theodore Halkin in the Art Institute’s \"Veteran's Exhibition\" of 1948. In 1958, he received a Fulbright Fellowship to go to Rome; in 1962, a Guggenheim Foundation grant took him and his family to Paris. \n\nRosofsky was part of the loose group of artists dubbed the “Monster Roster,” which attracted a degree of international attention in the 1950s as a “Chicago School” He was part of a 1956 show at Beloit College curated by Allan Frumkin that brought the group into focus, and the later shows, “The New Chicago Decade: 1950–1960” (Lake Forest College, 1959) and “Haut artistes de Chicago” (Paris, 1962). Throughout his career, Rosofsky was associated with Chicago’s more international galleries, such as Richard Feigen, Richard Gray, and B. C. Holland. Rosofsky’s work has continued to be shown since his death in museums, galleries and public spaces. In 2011, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel chose Rosofsky’s striking but grim \"Unemployment Agency\" (1957–8) from the Art Institute’s collection to hang on the wall behind his desk at City Hall.\nRosofsky taught at Chicago Loop College (later Harold Washington College) from 1964 until his death from a heart attack in 1981. He has been cited by many artists, including Phyllis Bramson and William Conger, as an influence.\n\nRosofsky wrestled with his experiences through intensely personal, penetrating, often brutal, imagery created in a staunchly figurative, gestural style that critics likened to June Leaf’s, and described as a mix of expressionism and “surrealist hysteria.” Unlike most of the Monster Roster artists, however, his work was more grounded in realism, due to his studies with Boris Anisfeld. Critic Franz Schulze applauded his “rich color, carefully interwoven tonalities and assured drawing.” The Chicago Tribune’s Alan Artner called his sense of composition masterly, his palette subtle, and his way with the figure strong, but noted a tendency to overload his works that sometimes made them difficult to understand.\n\nRosofsky was drawn to doleful and withering themes, such as the individual’s loss of power in modern life, fraught male-female relationships, the abuse of power and the absurdity of war, often borne out in battered, distorted, sometimes grotesquely comic figures in haunting, fantastical interiors and cityscapes. A lifelong Chicagoan, Rosofsky is considered the post-war artist for whom Chicago—the lake, people, buildings, and abrasive character—was most integral, his bizarre figures and settings often bearing a specificity to the city’s locales and conditions. Critic Alan Artner described him as a “poet of exhaustion” depicting an urban carnival of malaise, “disappointment and dejection, of things passing away without proper eulogy, of winter and fading light.”\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Rosofsky often focused on nightmarish modern narratives that featured faceless men, often in hospitals, wheelchairs, and other uncomfortable, vulnerable situations or empty spaces, which he depicted in agitated lines that some critics liken to Alberto Giacometti’s graphic work and Francis Bacon’s tortured interiors (e.g., \"Patient in a Dentist Chair\", 1961). \"Unemployment Agency\" (1957) features several rows of identical men in hats, sitting in severe, tall-backed chairs, facing rows of boxes that recede into a foreboding, bureaucratic infinity. he depicts a funhouse mirror-laden carnival scene in similar fashion in \"Tilt-a-Whirl\" (1957).\n\nTime spent in Paris on a fellowship led to a greater surrealist turn in Rosofsky’s work, realized in a fantastical, frightening vocabulary of clowns, menacing faces, and bizarre scenarios urgency and a more intense color palette. He often employed these figures in works examining power (e.g., his sardonic depiction of Chicago politics, \"Daley Machine\", 1968) and social issues (\"Homage to Spain, Thalidomide Children and Others\", 1965) that in their focus on generalized dehumanization shared more with New York artist George Tooker, than with Rosofsky’s former classmate, Leon Golub’s more political work. By the 1970s, Rosofsky turned to caustic depictions of fraught male-female relationships and roles that portrayed cardboard cutouts or stage puppet-like men and women, enacting disturbing scenes in theatrical domestic scenes, such as \"The Couple\" (1973) or \"The Love Fountain\" (1967). Rosofsky’s last works were lighter and more detached, and included “commedia dell’ arte” drawings commissioned for the 1982 Venice Biennale’s Carnevale del Teatro.\n\nRosofsky's work belongs to numerous public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Art Institute of Chicago, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, National Gallery of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Smart Museum of Art, and Block Museum of Art. Rosofsky was recognized with Fulbright (1958) and Guggenheim Foundation fellowships (1962).\n"}

Kriegsmann studio, a company specializing in headshot photography. During the several-month long period of making the photographs in Kriegsmann's Times Square studio in New York City, Robbins functioned as the \"agent\" for the artists – scheduling the shoots, styling the artists' look, and paying the bill. The resultant collection of headshots were produced in an edition of 100 as, according to the Kriegsmann Studio, aspiring entertainers seeking work customarily order them.\n\nTalent updated the image of the artist from that of modern art's tortured genius to, instead, a more complex portrayal of a willing participant in the entertainment industry. The piece was instrumental in modernizing the art context for the Information Age. Visual artists such as Degas and Picasso had long depicted musicians, harlequins, and actors using fine art media, and the Pop artists had introduced commercial production techniques such as silkscreen to create images taken from popular culture, but \"Talent\" collapsed the distance at which visual artists had previously held entertainment culture.\n\nThe eighteen artists featured in the piece include Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer, Robert Longo, Allan McCollum, Ashley Bickerton, Michael J. Byron, Thomas Lawson, Clegg & Guttmann, Jennifer Bolande, Larry Johnson, Alan Belcher, Peter Nagy, Steven Parrino, Joel Otterson, Robin Weglinski, Gretchen Bender, and David Robbins.\n\nIn May 2012 artist Michelle Grabner curated \"25 Years of Talent,\" an exhibition at Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York, featuring later work from each of the artists included in the original piece.\n"}

Actor-producer Vishal has been elected as the President of the Producers council after he won the election held in April 2017.\n\nElection for new office bearers was held on 2 April 2017 at Kandasamy Naidu College in Anna Nagar, conducted by election officer S.

Operated from both Seoul and San Francisco by Tapas Media, Tapastic features a large collection of short-form, English-language webcomics and webtoons from over 5,000 artists. The website aims to create a platform where comic creators can publish their works without cost, describing itself as the \"YouTube of Comics.\" Since 2016, the Tapas Media's mobile app also publishes books through a freemium business model.\n\nChang Kim came up with the idea of starting an open-publishing platform after wondering if there was a singular online location to read all the webcomics he was a fan of. While YouTube users were making money through uploading independent video content, there existed no equivalent for comic creators. Kim also noted that this business model was already successful in South Korea. With $3.4 million in backing from both American and Korean investors, including Daum Kakao and former Facebook Chief Technology Officer Adam D’Angelo, Kim started up Tapastic in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, Tapastic reached a partnership with Daum Communications, which operates the largest webtoon portal in South Korea. Through this partnership, Tapastic hopes to bring over successful Korean titles to see if they can find success in the United States market. The partnership deal also resulted in $2 million USD of Series A funding for Tapastic.\n\nIn April 2016, Tapas Media released a new mobile app, simply titled \"Tapas\". Using a freemium business model by offering content to readers for free as an incentive to pay more, the app added books to its line-up of offered media. According to Tapas Media, around 10–20% of the books are offered for free, creating a form of sample preview. Books are split up into \"bite-sized micro chapters\" in order to allow people to read portions within a few minutes. The model was inspired by free-to-play video games, such as \"Candy Crush\".\n\nOn April 17, 2017, Tapastic announced that it had changed its name to Tapas, redesigning parts of their website in the process. Tapas Media changed its terms of service the same day: the addition of a \"Right of First Refusal\" clause spurred controversy among the service' users. According to this clause, Tapas Media had the right to negotiate and refuse licensing deals for its users. Tapas Media reversed its decision on May 18, 2017 due to poor reception.\n\nIn sync with their name change, they have also added several features such as friend codes, which benefits gives the code-owner and the invitee 200 coins, used for unlocking episodes and chapters.\n\nAt its launch, Tapastic billed itself as the \"YouTube of Comics\". By 2015, the website features a collection of webcomics from over 5,000 unique artists. Kim stated that slice-of-life-style webcomics are the most popular on the service, which is likely because of their \"shareability\" and because they can quickly be read. Kim also noted that webcomics featuring school life and work life are \"deeply relatable\" to Tapastic readers.\n\nThe website has formed an interactive community, with fans discussing the comics and some creators asking for fan feedback. According to \"Publishers Weekly\", Tapastic had over a million active readers by April 2016, most of which are from North America and 90% of which are under the age of 34. Tapastic allows its content creators to profit from their work by selling premium webcomic series and by receiving donations in turn of exclusive benefits. Some artists on Tapastic make over $800 USD per month on the service. Creators on Tapastic are also supported by shared ad revenue.\n\nTapastic features a subscription feed similar to that of RSS, which is optimized to be used on the company's mobile app. In contrast, Caitlin Rosberg of \"The A.V. Club\" described using the Tapastic website as a \"steep but fast learning curve.\" Tapastic offers a translation service for its Korean and French creators, as some of the company's internal staff is bilingual.\n\n"}
{"id": "47026703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47026703", "title": "Te Moemoea no Iotefa", "text": "Te Moemoea no Iotefa\n\nTe Moemoea no Iotefa was the first exhibition held in a civic art gallery in New Zealand focused on contemporary Pacific art.\n\nThe exhibition was curated by art historian Rangihiroa Panoho for the Sarjeant Art Gallery in Whanganui in 1990 and the metropolitan City Galleries in Wellington and in Auckland in 1991. It's starting point and its iconic motif was a Tahitian tivaevae featuring the Genesis story of the 'Dream of Joseph' or \"Te moemoea no Iotefa\". The exhibition initially filled all spaces of the historic Sarjeant Gallery building, an earlier version of the Wellington City Art Gallery and the entire first floor of the Auckland Art Gallery. In the exhibition catalogue Panoho outlined the South Pacific as, 'Aotearoa's most immediate historical, geographical and cultural context', and that he was seeking to 'examine and explore the visual side of this context and the ways in which artists in this country are exploring it'. The exhibition brought together four strands of art making:\n\n1. The wealth of material culture from the Pacific Islands found in museums, libraries, private collections - taonga such as historical writing, photographs, tapa, tivaevae, weaving and carving.\n\n2. Work currently being produced by Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand such as tivaevae and carving.\n\n3. Work by palagi artists in this country (e.g. Fomison, Shepherd, Lynn, Lett, Hanly, McMillan, Adams, and Jowitt) which constitutes a response to Pacific Island subject and motif.\n\n4. Work by contemporary Pacific artists utilising a Western aesthetic - to draw on and interpret their particular island cultures.\n\nThe exhibition 'wove together the various aspects of Pacific culture as it persists in Aotearoa'. Art historian Nicholas Thomas writes 'Museum artifacts were placed with contemporary art, folk crafts with paintings, archive photographs with contemporary images, and Pacific artists among white appropriators of culture'.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue contains interviews with 10 contemporary artists included in the show:\n\n\nTe Moemoea was also an exploration of Pacificness as it more diversely related to broader creative activity in Aotearoa. As curator Panoho was not exclusively looking at contemporary Pacific art. As with his show 'Whatu Aho Rua' (1989/1992 - another Sarjeant exhibition involving historical and contemporary material) he was also interested in historical Pacific collections of tapa, fibre, photography and carving and in how non-Pacific artists were working with Pacific communities and in how they were interpreting the material and the ideas that they valorised. Te Moemoea while initiated from within a regional institution travelled to and was reinvented by Panoho and gallery staff within the Whanganui, Wellington and Auckland gallery spaces. A newspaper review from Wellington helps clarify the complexity and the layered nature of the content within Te Moemoea: \"'Cross-currents crackle around the latest exhibition at Wellington's City Gallery. People who like to keep art in neat pigeonholes... will probably find Te Moemoea no Iotefa (Joseph's dream defeats them. Rangihīroa Panoho...has curated a lively exhibition which aims to be a lot more than a showcase for artists with a Pacific Island background who are working in New Zealand. It is that, but it's also a visual essay about cross-fertilisation\".' \n\n\"Te Moemoea no Iotefa\" has been described as 'the first group exhibition to celebrate the dynamism of Pacific art'.\n\nPacific art historian Peter Brunt saw Te Moemoea as, \"'The first exhibition to focus on contemporary Pacific art in a civic gallery in New Zealand was Te Moemoea no Iotefa '[the Dream of Joseph: A Celebration of Pacific Art and Taonga]...The exhibition thematized the presence of Pacific culture in New Zealand society, introduced community-based arts like tivaevae into the contemporary gallery, and canvassed the work of migrant artists like Fatu Feu'u, Johnny Penisula, Michel Tuffery and others, only then beginning to garner serious public attention. But it was the title that was the most prescient about its own historical significance. The title was borrowed from the title of a tivaevae it showed, and refers to the biblical story of Joseph sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers, eventually to rise to a position of power in the Pharoah's court. Joseph's dream turns out to be an allegory of the moment of recognition when, as an exile, he reveals himself to his brothers as the important person he has become. The ambiguity of the allegory lies in the question of whether recognition in Egypt or escape from Egypt (if we can pardon the Orientalism) is the preferable goal\".' \n\nThe exhibition contributed to a sense of group identification amongst a group of young or emerging artists, including Ioane, Tuffery, Laita and John Pule.The exhibition is seen as an important precursor to Bottled Ocean, a 1994 exhibition focused on the work of contemporary Pacific artists.\n\nArt historian Karen Stevenson notes the importance of the exhibition in building the careers of participating artists:\n\nWith the success of \"Te Moemoea no Iotefa\", Pacific artists found exhibition space more readily available, and as recognition of Pacific artists grew, dealer galleries and community centers became interested in hosting \"Pacific\" exhibitions. Group \"Pacific\" shows became regular occurrences in art galleries throughout the country, as did solo exhibitions at dealer galleries.\"\n"}

{"id": "792934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=792934", "title": "Textiles in mythology and folklore", "text": "Textiles in mythology and folklore\n\nThe theme of textiles in mythology and folklore is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art. In traditional societies today, westward of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, weaving is a mystery within woman's sphere. Where men have become the primary weavers in this part of the world, it is possible that they have usurped the archaic role: among the gods, only goddesses are weavers. Herodotus noted, however, the cultural difference between gender identities and weaving among Hellenes and Egyptians: among Egyptians it was the men who wove.\n\nWeaving begins with spinning. Until the spinning wheel was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with distaff and spindle. In English the \"distaff side\" indicates relatives through one's mother, and thereby denotes a woman's role in the household economy. In Scandinavia, the stars of Orion's belt are known as \"Friggjar rockr\", \"Frigg’s distaff\".\n\nTextiles have also been associated in several cultures with spiders in mythology.\n\nThe spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler's eighth-century BCE inscription at Karatepe:\n\"In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles\"\n\nIn the adjacent region of North Syria, historian Robin Lane Fox remarks funerary stelae showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.\n\nIn pre-Dynastic Egypt, \"nt\" (Neith) was already the goddess of weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She protected the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she was known as the most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. Nit is identifiable by her emblems: most often it is the loom's shuttle, with its two recognizable hooks at each end, upon her head. According to E. A. Wallis Budge (\"The Gods of the Egyptians\") the root of the word for \"weaving\" and also for \"being\" are the same: \"nnt\".\n\nIn Greece the Moirai (the \"Fates\") are the three crones who control destiny, and the matter of it is the art of spinning the thread of life on the distaff. Ariadne, the wife of the god Dionysus in Minoan Crete, possessed the spun thread that led Theseus to the center of the labyrinth and safely out again.\n\nAmong the Olympians, the weaver goddess is Athena, who, despite her role, was bested by her acolyte Arachne, who was turned later into a weaving spider. The daughters of Minyas, Alcithoe, Leuconoe and their sister, defied Dionysus and honored Athena in their weaving instead of joining his festival. A woven peplum, laid upon the knees of the goddess's iconic image, was central to festivals honoring both Athena at Athens, and Hera.\n\nIn Homer's legend of the Odyssey, Penelope the faithful wife of Odysseus was a weaver, weaving her design for a shroud by day, but unravelling it again at night, to keep her suitors from claiming her during the long years while Odysseus was away; Penelope's weaving is sometimes compared to that of the two weaving enchantresses in the \"Odyssey\", Circe and Calypso. Helen is at her loom in the \"Iliad\" to illustrate her discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail.\n\nHomer dwells upon the supernatural quality of the weaving in the robes of goddesses.\n\nIn Roman literature, Ovid in his \"Metamorphoses\" (VI, 575–587) recounts the terrible tale of Philomela, who was raped and her tongue cut out so that she could not tell about her violation, her loom becomes her voice, and the story is told in the design, so that her sister Procne may understand and the women may take their revenge. The understanding in the Philomela myth that pattern and design convey myth and ritual has been of great use to modern mythographers: Jane Ellen Harrison led the way, interpreting the more permanent patterns of vase-painting, since the patterned textiles had not survived.\n\nFor the Norse peoples, Frigg is a goddess associated with weaving. The Scandinavian \"Song of the Spear\", quoted in \"Njals Saga\", gives a detailed description of Valkyries as women weaving on a loom, with severed heads for weights, arrows for shuttles, and human gut for the warp, singing an exultant song of carnage. Ritually deposited spindles and loom parts were deposited with the Pre-Roman Iron Age ritual wagon at Dejbjerg, Jutland, and are to be associated with the wagon-goddess.\n\nIn Germanic mythology, Holda (Frau Holle) and Perchta (Frau Perchta, Berchta, Bertha) were both known as goddesses who oversaw spinning and weaving. They had many names.\n\nHolda, whose patronage extends outward to control of the weather, and source of women's fertility, and the protector of unborn children, is the patron of spinners, rewarding the industrious and punishing the idle. Holda taught the secret of making linen from flax. An account of Holda was collected by the Brothers Grimm, as the fairy tale \"Frau Holda\". Another of the Grimm tales, \"Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle\", which embeds social conditioning in fairy tale with mythic resonances, rewards the industrious spinner with the fulfillment of her mantra:\n\nThis tale recounts how the magic spindle, flying out of the girl's hand, flew away, unravelling behind it a thread, which the prince followed, as Theseus followed the thread of Ariadne, to find what he was seeking: a bride \"who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest\". He arrives to find her simple village cottage magnificently caparisoned by the magically-aided products of spindle, shuttle and needle.\n\nJacob Grimm reported the superstition \"if, while riding a horse overland, a man should come upon a woman spinning, then that is a very bad sign; he should turn around and take another way.\" (\"Deutsche Mythologie\" 1835, v3.135)\n\nAlso the Norns, female giantesses, weavers of fate, belong in this folklore of weaving.\n\nThe goddess Brigantia, due to her identification with the Roman Minerva, may have also been considered, along with her other traits, to be a weaving deity.\n\nWeavers had a repertory of tales: in the 15th century Jean d'Arras, a Northern French storyteller (\"trouvere\"), assembled a collection of stories entitled \"Les Évangiles des Quenouilles\" (\"Spinners' Tales\"). Its frame story is that these are narrated among a group of ladies at their spinning.\n\nIn Baltic myth, Saule is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous presence is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic connection between the sun and spinning is as old as spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.\n\nThe Finnish epic, the \"Kalevala\", has many references to spinning and weaving goddesses.\n\n\"When Adam delved and Eve span...\" runs the rhyme; though the tradition that Eve span is unattested in Genesis, it was deeply engrained in the medieval Christian vision of Eve. In an illumination from the 13th-century Hunterian Psalter (\"illustration. left\") Eve is shown with distaff and spindle.\n\nIn later European folklore, weaving retained its connection with magic. Mother Goose, traditional teller of fairy tales, is often associated with spinning. She was known as \"Goose-Footed Bertha\" or \"Reine Pédauque\" (\"Goose-footed Queen\") in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.\n\nThe daughter who, her father claimed, could spin straw into gold and was forced to demonstrate her talent, aided by the dangerous earth-daemon Rumpelstiltskin was an old tale when the Brothers Grimm collected it. Similarly, the unwilling spinner of the tale \"The Three Spinners\" is aided by three mysterious old women. In \"The Six Swans\", the heroine spins and weaves starwort in order to free her brothers from a shapeshifting curse. \"Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle\" are enchanted and bring the prince to marry the poor heroine. Sleeping Beauty, in all her forms, pricks her finger on a spindle, and the curse falls on her.\n\nIn Alfred Tennyson's poem \"The Lady of Shalott\", her woven representations of the world have protected and entrapped Elaine of Astolat, whose first encounter with reality outside proves mortal. William Holman Hunt's painting from the poem (\"illustration, right\") contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth (\"Hesperides\") and Religion (\"Prayer\") echo the mirror's open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings \"'Tirra lirra' by the river\" as in Tennyson's poem.\n\nA high-born woman sent as a hostage-wife to a foreign king was repeatedly given the epithet \"weaver of peace\", linking the woman's art and the familiar role of a woman as a dynastic pawn. A familiar occurrence of the phrase is in the early English poem \"Widsith\", who \"had in the first instance gone with Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Anglen to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker...\"\n\nIn Inca mythology, Mama Ocllo first taught women the art of spinning thread.\n\n\nMultiple saints are designated as patron saints of various aspects of textile work. The mythology and folklore surrounding their patronage can be found in their respective hagiographies.\nAnthony Mary Claret is a Roman Catholic patron saint of textile merchants. Saint Homobonus is a Roman Catholic patron saint of tailors and clothworkers. Saint Maurice is considered a patron saint of weavers, dyers, and clothmaking in general in Coptic Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Parascheva of the Balkans is a patron of embroiderers, needle workers, spinners, and weavers among the Eastern Orthodox.\nSt. Blaise is the patron saint of drapers.\n\nLydia of Thyatira, a New Testament figure, is a patron saint of dyers in the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church. Saint Maurice (see section on patron saints of textiles in general) is also associated with dyers.\nAnastasius the Fuller is the patron saint of fulling in the Roman Catholic Church.\nMary Magdalene is a patron saint of glove-making in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church. Gummarus is a patron saint of glove-making in the Roman Catholic church. \nSaints Crispin and Crispinian are Eastern Orthodox patron saints of glove-making. Although their feast day was removed from the Roman Catholic Church's universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council, the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Catholic Church martyrology. \nSaint Fiacre is the patron saint of hosiers. \nSaints Crispin and Crispinian (see above) are considered the patron saints of lacework.\nClare of Assisi and Saint Veronica are the patron saints of laundry and laundry workers.\nSeverus of Avranches is the Roman Catholic patron saint of millinery. \nIn the Roman Catholic Church, Clare of Assisi is the patron saint of needlework, and Rose of Lima is the patron saint of embroidery, a specific type of needlework. Parascheva of the Balkans is the patron saint of needlework and other aspects of textiles (see section on patron saints of textiles in general) among the Eastern Orthodox.\nSaint Brioc is the patron saint of pursemakers. \nSaint Anne is regarded as the patron saint of seamstresses in both Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions.\nSeverus of Avranches is the Roman Catholic patron saint of silk workers.\nSaint Catherine is the patron saint of spinners.\n\nFrancis of Assisi is the patron saint of tapestry workers. \nOnuphrius is considered a patron saint of weaving in Coptic Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church. Saint Maurice and Parascheva of the Balkans are also patrons of weaving, as is Severus of Avranches (see section on patron saints of textiles in general).\nSaint Blaise is a patron saint of wool workers and is revered in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and \nOriental Orthodox Church. Severus of Avranches is also considered a patron saint of wool workers in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4416125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4416125", "title": "The Falling Man", "text": "The Falling Man\n\nThe Falling Man is a photograph taken by Associated Press photographer Richard Drew of a man falling from the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:41:15 a.m. during the September 11 attacks in New York City. The subject of the image, whose identity remains uncertain, was one of the people trapped on the upper floors of the skyscraper who either fell searching for safety or jumped to escape the fire and smoke.\n\nThe photograph gives the impression that the man is falling straight down; however, a series of photographs taken of his fall showed him to be tumbling through the air.\n\nThe photographer has noted that, in at least two cases, newspaper stories commenting on the image have attracted a barrage of criticism from readers who found the image \"disturbing.”\n\nOf the nearly 3,000 people killed on 9/11, at least 200 people are believed to have fallen or jumped to their deaths, while other estimates say the number is half of that or fewer. Officials could not recover or identify the bodies of those forced out of the buildings prior to the collapse of the towers. All deaths in the attacks except those of the hijackers were ruled to be homicides due to blunt trauma (as opposed to suicides). The New York City medical examiner's office said it does not classify the people who fell to their deaths on September 11 as \"jumpers\". According to Ellen Borakove, the examiner's office spokeswoman, \"A 'jumper' is somebody who goes to the office in the morning knowing that they will commit suicide. These people were forced out by the smoke and flames or blown out.\"\n\nThe photograph initially appeared in newspapers around the world, including on page 7 of \"The New York Times\" on September 12, 2001. The photo's caption read, \"A person falls headfirst after jumping from the north tower of the World Trade Center. It was a horrific sight that was repeated in the moments after the planes struck the towers.\" It appeared only once in the \"Times\" because of criticism and anger against its use. Six years later, it appeared on page 1 of \"The New York Times Book Review\" on May 27, 2007.\n\nThe identity of the subject of the man has never been officially confirmed. The large number of people trapped in the tower has made identifying the man in the 12 photos difficult. It is thought, though the number is uncertain, that at least 200 people fell to their deaths.\n\nReporter Peter Cheney suggested in the nationally distributed Canadian newspaper \"The Globe and Mail\" that the man pictured in the photo may have been Norberto Hernandez, a pastry chef at Windows on the World, a restaurant located on the 106th floor of the North Tower. Some members of Hernandez's family agreed with Cheney, but after examining the entire photo sequence and noting details of his clothing, were no longer convinced.\n\n\"The Falling Man\", an article about the photograph by American journalist Tom Junod, was published in the September 2003 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. It was adapted into a documentary film by the same name. The article gave the possible identity of the falling man as Jonathan Briley, a 43-year-old audio technician for Windows on the World. Briley, a resident of Mount Vernon, New York, was a sound engineer. His brother Alex is an original member of the 1970s disco group Village People. Briley had asthma and would have known he was in danger when smoke began to pour into the restaurant.\n\nMichael Lomonaco, the Executive Chef/Director at Windows on the World, also suggested that the man was Briley. Briley was initially identified by his brother, Timothy. Lomonaco could identify Briley by his clothes and his body type. In one of the pictures, the Falling Man's shirt or white jacket was blown open and up, revealing an orange t-shirt similar to one shirt that Briley often wore. Briley's older sister, Gwendolyn, originally helped in identifying the victim. She told reporters of \"The Sunday Mirror\", \"When I first looked at the picture [...] and I saw it was a man—tall, slim—I said, 'If I didn't know any better, that could be Jonathan.\n\n\"9/11: The Falling Man\" is a 2006 documentary film about the picture and the story behind it. It was made by American filmmaker Henry Singer and filmed by Richard Numeroff, a New York-based director of photography. The film is loosely based on Junod's \"Esquire\" story. It also drew its material from photographer Lyle Owerko's pictures of falling people. It debuted on March 16, 2006, on the British television network Channel 4. It later made its North American premiere on Canada's CBC Newsworld on September 6, 2006, and has been broadcast in more than 30 countries. The U.S. premiere was September 10, 2007, on the Discovery Times Channel.\n\nThe novel \"Falling Man\", by Don DeLillo, is about the September 11 attacks. The \"falling man\" in the novel is a performance artist recreating the events of the photograph. DeLillo says he was unfamiliar with the title of the picture when he named his book. The artist straps himself into a harness and jumps from an elevated structure in a high visibility area (such as a highway overpass), hanging in the pose of \"The Falling Man\".\n\n\n\n"}

Andrew Lang included it, as The Shifty Lad in \"The Lilac Fairy Book\".\n\nA widow wanted her son to learn a trade. He insisted that he wanted to be a thief. She predicted he would end up hanging from a bridge. One day he did not go to church, and told her that the first trade she heard when she came out would be his. He came to the path and shouted \"Thievery\" in a disguised voice. She again predicted he would hang from the bridge but gave him to the Black Gallows Bird to learn the trade. The man taught him, and then said they must rob a man who had sold his cattle. On Halloween, they hid in the loft. The shifty lad went down and stirred up the cattle, sending people out; while they were gone, he stole nuts and sewed a leather hide to the thief. He cracked nuts, though the thief warned him he would be heard. He was heard, and the people came, and the thief ran off with the hide still attached. The people said he was stealing the hide and chased him. The Shifty Lad stole the gold and silver while they were gone, and brought them to the thief; they split them. \n\nSoon, a tenant sent a man to get a wether to give as a wedding gift. The Shifty Lad bet his master that he could steal it from the man's back. When he was coming, the lad put a dirty shoe in his path; the man said that if he had the other one, he would clean this one and have a pair. The Shifty Lad ran ahead of his, and put the shoe in the way again. The man went back to get the other, and the lad took the wether and the shoes and won his bet. The tenant sent the same man after a kid. The lad bleated like the wether, and when the man searched for it, thinking to come back with both, the lad stole the kid. The third time, the tenant directed him to never let the wether go, and so he brought it home.\n\nThe shifty lad had his master hang him, and let him down when he kicked his legs. He praised it, and his master let him hang him, but the lad killed him. His wife was angry, and the lad fled. He took service with a wright who lived next to the king's storehouse, and broke into it to steal. The gifts persuaded the wright and his wife to let him. At the advice of the Seanagal, the king set a hogshead of pitch to catch the thief, and it caught the wright. The lad cut off his head to prevent their learning who he was.\n\nThe king displayed the body to discover who grieved at the sight, but when the wright's wife cried out, he cut his foot and pretended she cried over that. Then the body was hung from a tree for the same reason. The lad took a horse with casks of whiskey by them, as if he were hiding from the soldiers. They chased him, and he fled, leaving the horse. They took it back, found the whiskey, and became drunk. The lad took the body. The king sent a black pig about to dig up the body. When it rooted about the wright's house, the lad sent the soldiers inside to eat and drink while it searched. He killed the pig and buried it while they ate. The king sent men to discover where people had pig's flesh they could not account for; the lad killed the soldiers sent to his house, and then started a rumor that the soldiers meant to massacre them, so all the people killed the soldiers. \n\nThe Seanagal advised to give a ball, since the man would be the boldest and dance with the princess; when the lad did so, the Seanagal marked him with a black dot, but the lad saw it and marked the Seanagal himself with two and twenty other men with one. The king decided that he was beaten, and that he wanted so clever a man for his son-in-law. He had all the men with the black dots put in a room, and had a child give one an apple. The lad drew him with a shaving and a drone, and the child gave him the apple. They took the shaving and drone, but the child remembered them and still gave him the apple, so the shifty lad married the princess. \n\nOne day, while they walked on the bridge, the lad told the princess that his mother said he would hang from that bridge. She said that if he wished to go over the wall, she would hold him by her handkerchief. He did, and hanged there, but a cry went up about a fire, startling the princess. She let go. The lad fell and died.\n\n"}

In that way urban art combines street art and graffiti and is often used to summarize all visual art forms arising in urban areas, being inspired by urban architecture or present urban lifestyle. Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as vandalism and destruction of private property.\n\nAlthough urban art started at the neighborhood level, where a lot of people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with graffiti culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, Le Mur is a public museum of urban art.\n\nThough starting as an underground movement, urban artists like Banksy and Adam Neate have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the Tate calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008.\n\nThe band Gorillaz uses an urban art style to promote their band.

Some of the tales are very current, others are less well known.\n\nEach story is preceded by a short introduction by the author, giving a brief history of the tale's literary mutations, or remarking on the strange similarities that versions exhibit across great geographical or historical distances. The collection has had a broad appeal. For instance Canadian poet P. K.

The title alone of one of his daughter Saira Shah's books, \"The Storyteller's Daughter\", gives some indication, while his son Tahir Shah's book \"In Arabian Nights\", itself an exploration of the power of the folktale, recalls: \n\nThe book was first published in large format by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich with each tale illustrated.
