Edwards instead puts forth the idea that the reason for God's creation of the world was not human happiness, but the magnification of his own glory and name. Edwards then continues to argue that since true happiness comes from God alone, human happiness is an extension of God's glory, and that there are \"ultimate\" ends and \"chief\" ends, but they all end at the same conclusion. Edwards, like in \"Virtue\", discusses how there is no true happiness without being happy in God.\n\nModern day evangelicals such as John Piper still use Edwards' works today in their own congregations. In his book \"God's Passion for His Glory\", which includes the complete text of \"The End for Which God Created the World\" as the second half of the book, Piper argues that the longer he lives \"the more clearly I see my dependence on those who have gone before,\" that \"Edwards's relentless God-centeredness and devotion to the Biblical contours of doctrine are profoundly needed in our day,\" and that Edwards is in \"a class by himself in American history, perhaps in the history of Christendom.\"\n\n\n"}

It is not known when Wright painted the picture, but it was first exhibited in 1769 in London with the Society of Artists. This was one of the earliest of many lamplight or candlelight paintings and portraits for which Wright is famed.\n\nThis picture was described in the catalogue of the 1801 sale as a companion to \"The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus\". Each has a main figure in the foreground with two subsidiary ones behind, both are night scenes and show old men engaged in scientific research.\n\nThe painting shows an old man who is thought to be a philosopher or a pilgrim,examining a collection of human bones in a lamp-lit cave. Two smaller men, or boys, dressed as pilgrims (as identified by the scallop shells in their hats: the emblem of St James) seem to be approaching him. The size of these figures is a lot smaller than the main character in the painting. Outside the cave the dark landscape is lit by the moonlight breaking through the clouds. Shells were the sign of pilgrims but they were also the emblem of the Darwin family which included Erasmus Darwin who was a leading member of the Lunar Society and Derby Philosophical Society which linked key men in the age of enlightenment.\n\nExperts believe that this painting was based on Salvator Rosa's \"Democritus in Meditation\". Wright’s friend John Hamilton Mortimer was a follower of Rosa’s so it is possible that Wright would have seen Rosa's work or an engraving of it. Democritus was a Greek philosopher who is remembered for making fun of the foolishness of mankind.\n\nThough the painting's subtitle is \"A Hermit Studying Anatomy\", his attitude towards the bones he is holding does not suggest particularly serious scrutiny. He is surrounded by symbols of the ephemeral nature of the human condition which include the skeleton, a lamp that will burn all its fuel, the moon which has to be reborn every four weeks and an hour glass. The moon was also the symbol of the Lunar Society which Wright was strongly associated with although he never became a member.\n\nThe preoccupation of the philosopher and trepidation of the two pilgrims may be a reflection on concerns about the new scientific understanding and enlightenment at the time Wright lived.\n"}

{"id": "167021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=167021", "title": "Christian art", "text": "Christian art\n\nChristian art is sacred art which uses themes and imagery from Christianity. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of iconoclasm within Christianity.\n\nImages of Jesus and narrative scenes from the Life of Christ are the most common subjects, and scenes from the Old Testament play a part in the art of most denominations. Images of the Virgin Mary and saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nChristianity makes far wider use of images than related religions, in which figurative representations are forbidden, such as Islam and Judaism. However, there is also a considerable history of aniconism in Christianity from various periods.\n\nEarly Christian art survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest Christian sculptures are from sarcophagi, dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. The largest groups of Early Christian paintings come from the tombs in the Catacombs of Rome, and show the evolution of the depiction of Jesus, a process not complete until the 6th century, since when the conventional appearance of Jesus in art has remained remarkably consistent.\n\nUntil the adoption of Christianity by Constantine Christian art derived its style and much of its iconography from popular Roman art, but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which mosaics in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples. Christian art was caught up in, but did not originate, the shift in style from the classical tradition inherited from Ancient Greek art to a less realist and otherworldly hieratic style, the start of gothic art.\n\nMuch of the art surviving from Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire is Christian art, although this in large part because the continuity of church ownership has preserved church art better than secular works. While the Western Roman Empire's political structure essentially collapsed after the fall of Rome, its religious hierarchy, what is today the modern-day Roman Catholic Church commissioned and funded production of religious art imagery.\n\nThe Orthodox Church of Constantinople, which enjoyed greater stability within the surviving Eastern Empire was key in commissioning imagery there and glorifying Christianity. As a stable Western European society emerged during the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church led the way in terms of art, using its resources to commission paintings and sculptures.\n\nDuring the development of Christian art in the Byzantine Empire (see Byzantine art), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in Hellenistic art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and color were ignored in favor of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of \"graven images\", the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of Byzantine Iconoclasm led to a standardization of religious imagery within the Eastern Orthodoxy.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople in 1453 brought an end to the highest quality Byzantine art, produced in the Imperial workshops there. Orthodox art, known as icons regardless of the medium, has otherwise continued with relatively little change in subject and style up to the present day, with Russia gradually becoming the leading centre of production.\n\nIn the West, the Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the Protestant Reformation Christian art continued to be commissioned in great quantities by churches, clergy and by the aristocracy. The Reformation had a huge effect on Christian art, rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.\n\nArtists were commissioned more secular genres like portraits, landscape paintings and because of the revival of Neoplatonism, subjects from classical mythology. In Catholic countries, production continued, and increased during the Counter-Reformation, but Catholic art was brought under much tighter control by the church hierarchy than had been the case before. From the 18th century the number of religious works produced by leading artists declined sharply, though important commissions were still placed, and some artists continued to produce large bodies of religious art on their own initiative.\n\nAs a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, ancient and Medieval Christian art began to be collected for art appreciation rather than worship, while contemporary Christian art was considered marginal. Occasionally, secular artists treated Christian themes (Bouguereau, Manet) — but only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as Rouault or Stanley Spencer). However many modern artists such as Eric Gill, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Jacob Epstein, Elizabeth Frink and Graham Sutherland have produced well-known works of art for churches. Salvador Dali is an artist who had also produced notable and popular artworks with Christian themes. Contemporary artists such as Makoto Fujimura have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include Larry D. Alexander and John August Swanson. Some writers, such as Gregory Wolfe, see this as part of a rebirth of Christian humanism.\n\nSince the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as Mihály Munkácsy. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of holy cards. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as Thomas Blackshear and Thomas Kinkade, although widely regarded in the fine art world as kitsch, have been very successful.\n\nSubjects often seen in Christian art include the following. See Life of Christ and Life of the Virgin for fuller lists of narrative scenes included in cycles:\n\n\n\n"}

Besides religious ceremonies and the procession, there are musical and theatrical shows and bike races.\n\nFather Palumbo was born in Alcamo on 29 August 1915 and became a priest in 1941; he soon had the office of Vicar Cooperator in the parishes of the Church of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew, Church of the Holy Crucifix (or Saint Francis of Paola) and Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. He was also nominated as honorary Canon (priest) of the collegiate church of the Mother church.\n\nOn bare feet, with a cross on his hands and a great number of believers, on 30 April 1944 he went towards the quarter of \"Balatelle\" (a suburb at that time) on the piece of land which had been donated to him by Mrs. Annunziata Macaluso, the widow of the chemist doctor Fazio, put down the cross there and, since then, every Sunday he celebrated the Holy Mass on a makeshift altar. \n\nUntil he stayed in seminary he was a great devotee of Saint Joseph: during the night he got up, kneeled and recited the rosary in honour of him, this prayer in dialect, very interesting also from the symbolical point of view:\n\n\"Scura stasira agghiorna dumani \"\n\n\"la pruvvidenza m’aviti a mannari\".\n\n(It was a prayer asking for Providence from the Saint).\nHe asked for saint Joseph’s protection both for his family and the Church, then he put his project on the Saint’s hands.\nIn 1947 he succeeded in completing the basement below the Church and start celebrating Mass there.[4]\n\nWith his zeal and faith, Father Palumbo succeeded in dragging all the district and citizens to contribute to the costs for completing the building of the Church by any type of offerings, even in kind (wheat, eggs, legumes, flour, etc.). He used all these things, however, to help a lot of people in need too; there are so many stories about his great goodness.\nHe succeeded also in creating a parish community very united and open to charity.\n\nWith the bishop’s bull of May 3, 1947, the Church was elevated to a parish and the following day the Bishop of Mazara del Vallo, His Excellency Monsignor Ballo, gave father Palumbo the canonical possession. \nFather Palumbo's mother, signora Vita Rocca, had donated her dowry for the legal recognition of the Parish, which was given with the Decree of the President of Republic on 10 June 1948.\n\nOn 30 May he died, leaving his parish community and the whole town in anguish for his untimely end: there were thousands of people at his funeral.\n\nHe was buried in the old cemetery \"Cappuccini\" in Alcamo and, after the approval by His Excellency Mons. Alessandro Plotti, on 22 October 2013, by popular demand of believers, his mortal remains were moved to his Church.\n\nThe façade is elegant and in Romanesque style; the interior is with one nave and a coffered ceiling.\n\nThere are these works: :\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982394", "title": "Cultural appropriation", "text": "Cultural appropriation\n\nCultural appropriation, at times also phrased cultural misappropriation, is the adoption of elements of a minority culture by members of the dominant culture. Because of the presence of power imbalances that are a byproduct of colonialism and oppression, cultural appropriation is distinct from equal cultural exchange. Particularly in the 21st century, cultural appropriation is often considered harmful, and to be a violation of the collective intellectual property rights of the originating, minority cultures, notably indigenous cultures and those living under colonial rule. Often unavoidable when multiple cultures come together, cultural appropriation can include using other cultures' cultural and religious traditions, fashion, symbols, language, and songs.\n\nAccording to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from acculturation, assimilation, or cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of colonialism: cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.\n\nOften, the original meaning of these cultural elements is lost or distorted, and such displays are often viewed as disrespectful, or even as a form of desecration, by members of the originating culture. Cultural elements which may have deep meaning to the original culture may be reduced to \"exotic\" fashion or toys by those from the dominant culture. Kjerstin Johnson has written that, when this is done, the imitator, \"who does not experience that oppression is able to 'play', temporarily, an 'exotic' other, without experiencing any of the daily discriminations faced by other cultures.\" The African-American academic, musician and journalist Greg Tate argues that appropriation and the \"fetishizing\" of cultures, in fact, alienates those whose culture is being appropriated.\n\nThe concept of cultural appropriation has also been widely criticised. Some writers on the topic note that the concept is often misunderstood or misapplied by the general public, and that charges of \"cultural appropriation\" are at times misapplied to situations such as eating food from a variety of cultures, or learning about different cultures. Commentators who criticize the concept believe that the act of cultural appropriation does not meaningfully constitute a social harm, or that the term lacks conceptual coherence. Some argue that the term sets arbitrary limits on intellectual freedom and artists' self-expression, reinforces group divisions, or itself promotes a feeling of enmity or grievance, rather than liberation.\n\nCultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas, symbols, artifacts, or other aspects of human-made visual or non-visual culture.\n\nAs a concept that is controversial in its applications, the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the dominant culture or when there are other issues involved, such as a history of ethnic or racial conflict. This is often seen in cultural outsiders' use of an oppressed culture's symbols or other cultural elements, such as music, dance, spiritual ceremonies, modes of dress, speech, and social behaviour, notably when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion, rather than respected within their original cultural context. Opponents view the issues of colonialism, context, and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. They argue that mutual exchange happens on an \"even playing field\", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.\n\nA different view of cultural appropriation characterizes critics of the practice as \"engaged in a deeply conservative project: one which first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture.\" Proponents of cultural appropriation view it as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy as among its benefits. For example, the film \"Star Wars\" appropriated elements from Akira Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\", which itself appropriated elements from Shakespeare; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as American Chinese cuisine, modern Japanese sushi, and bánh mì, each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.\n\nCultural appropriation is a relatively recent subject of academic study. \nThe term emerged in the 1980s, in discussions of post-colonial critiques of Western expansionism, though the concept had been explored earlier, such as in \"Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism\" by Kenneth Coutts‐Smith in 1976.\n\nCultural and racial theorist George Lipsitz has used the term \"strategic anti-essentialism\" to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of one's own, to define oneself or one's group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures, and is not confined only to the use of the other. However, Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture, it must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations.\n\nA common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the iconography of another culture, and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture's mores. Examples include sports teams using Native American tribal names or images as mascots; wearing jewelry or fashion with religious symbols such as the war bonnet, medicine wheel, or cross without any belief in those religions; and copying iconography from another culture's history such as Polynesian tribal tattoos, Chinese characters, or Celtic art worn without regard to their original cultural significance. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as kitsch risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions.\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal artists have discussed an \"authenticity brand\" to ensure consumers are aware of artworks claiming false Aboriginal significance. The movement for such a measure gained momentum after the 1999 conviction of John O'Loughlin for the fraudulent sale of works described as Aboriginal but painted by non-indigenous artists.\n\nIn Europe and North America a common example of cultural appropriation is the misrepresentation of East Indian symbols, mythology and religious ideas as typified in Rudyard Kipling's stories and Talbot Mundy's Jimgrim book series including the highly discussed Nine Unknown and King of the Khyber Rifles. Movements to undo the biases, misrepresentations, and cultural inaccuracies made popular by authors like Kipling and Mundy have gained significant momentum since Kipling's poem \"If—\" was scrubbed off Manchester University walls by student leaders. AAJA, a watchdog organization for fair and respectful cultural representation, works to point out and prevent these cultural inaccuracies in the media.\n\nHistorically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. Some scholars of the Ottoman Empire and ancient Egypt argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab.\n\nAmong critics, the misuse and misrepresentation of indigenous intellectual property is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism, and one step in the destruction of indigenous cultures.\n\nThe results of this use of indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, and the United Nations General Assembly, to issue several declarations on the subject. The \"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality\" includes the passage:\nArticle 31 1 of the United Nations \"Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\" states:\n\nMany Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be cultural appropriation of their sweat lodge and vision quest ceremonies by non-Natives, and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They also contend that there are higher safety risks when the ceremonies are conducted by non-Natives, pointing to deaths or injuries in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile deaths in 2009.\n\nIn 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the Rainbow Family members whose acts of \"cultural exploitation... dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking.\"\n\nCultural appropriation is controversial in the fashion industry due to the belief that some trends commercialise and cheapen the ancient heritage of indigenous cultures. There is debate about whether designers and fashion houses understand the history behind the clothing they are taking from different cultures, besides the ethical issues of using these cultures' shared intellectual property without consent, acknowledgement, or compensation. In response to this criticism, many fashion experts claim that this occurrence is in fact \"culture appreciation\", rather than cultural appropriation. Companies and designers claim the use of unique cultural symbols is an effort to recognize and pay homage to that specific culture.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the forerunner to the three piece suit was appropriated from the traditional dress of diverse Eastern European and Islamic countries. The Justacorps frock coat was copied from the long zupans worn in Poland and the Ukraine, the necktie or cravat was derived from a scarf worn by Croatian mercenaries fighting for Louis XIII, and the brightly colored silk waistcoats popularised by Charles II of England were inspired by exotic Turkish, Indian and Persian attire acquired by wealthy English travellers.\n\nDuring the Highland Clearances, the British aristocracy appropriated traditional Scottish clothing. Tartan was given spurious association with specific Highland clans after publications such as James Logan's romanticised work \"The Scottish Gael\" (1831) led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans and tartan became a desirable material for dresses, waistcoats and cravats. In America, plaid flannel had become workwear by the time of Westward expansion, and was widely worn by Old West pioneers and cowboys who were not of Scottish descent. In the 21st century, tartan remains ubiquitous in mainstream fashion.\n\nBy the 19th century the fascination had shifted to Asian culture. English Regency era dandies adapted the Indian churidars into slim fitting pantaloons, and frequently wore turbans within their own houses. Later, Victorian gentlemen wore smoking caps based on the Islamic fez, and fashionable turn of the century ladies wore Orientalist Japanese inspired kimono dresses. During the tiki culture fad of the 1950s, white women frequently donned the qipao to give the impression that they had visited Hong Kong, although the dresses were frequently made by seamstresses in America using rayon rather than genuine silk. At the same time, teenage British Teddy Girls wore Chinese coolie hats due to their exotic connotations.\n\nIn Mexico, the sombrero associated with the mestizo peasant class was appropriated from an earlier hat introduced by the Spanish colonials during the 18th century. This, in turn, was adapted into the cowboy hat worn by American cowboys after the US Civil War. In 2016, the University of East Anglia prohibited the wearing of sombreros to parties on campus, in the belief that these could offend Mexican students.\n\nAmerican Western wear was copied from the work attire of 19th century Mexican Vaqueros, especially the pointed cowboy boots and the guayabera which was adapted into the embroidered Western shirt. The China poblana dress associated with Mexican women was appropriated from the choli and lehenga worn by Indian maidservants like Catarina de San Juan who arrived from Asia from the 17th century onwards.\n\nIn Britain, the rough tweed cloth clothing of the Irish, English and Scottish peasantry, including the flat cap and Irish hat were appropriated by the upper classes as the British country clothing worn for sports such as hunting or fishing, in imitation of the then Prince of Wales. The country clothing, in turn, was appropriated by the wealthy American soc and later preppy subcultures during the 1950s and 1980s due to both its practicality and its association with the English elite. During the same period the British commedian Tommy Cooper was known for wearing a Fez throughout his performances.\n\nWhen keffiyehs became popular in the late 2000s, experts made a clear distinction between the wearing of a genuine scarf, and a fake made in China. Palestinian independence activists and socialists denounced the wearing of scarves not made in Palestine as a form of cultural appropriation, but encouraged young white people and fellow Muslims to buy shemaghs made in the Herbawi factory to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian people and improve the economy of the West Bank. In 2017, Topshop caused controversy by selling Chinese-made playsuits that imitated the pattern of the keffiyeh.\n\nIn 2012 during the annual Victoria's Secret fashion show, model Karlie Kloss was scrutinized for wearing a Native American headdress during her walk on the runway. There was a mixed public response. People of mixed heritage were the most sensitive to headdress. \"USA Today\" ran a feature where they interviewed a woman of mixed heritage who said that the headdress is a symbol of leadership and honour, and also has a religious meaning behind it. This cultural meaning was not considered in Victoria’s Secret’s use of the headdress as an accessory. Victoria's Secret issued an apology stating that they had no intentions of offending anyone.\n\nArchbishop Justin Welby of the Anglican Church has claimed that the crucifix is \"now just a fashion statement and has lost its religious meaning.\". Crucifixes have been incorporated into Japanese lolita fashion by non-Christians in a cultural context that is distinct from its original meaning as a Christian religious symbol.\n\n\nWhile the history of colonization and marginalization is not unique to the Americas, the practice of non-Native sports teams deriving team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada, and has persisted to some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups. Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. It is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism.\n\nSuch practices may be seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities which have a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion. In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that create a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the NCAA initiated a policy against \"hostile and abusive\" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI).\n\nWhile the leadership of nearly all Native American tribes object to their depictions as sports mascots, only one tribe explicitly approves of such representations. The Florida State Seminoles use the iconography of the Seminole tribe. Their mascots are Osceola and Renegade, depictions of the Seminole chief Osceola and his Appaloosa horse. After the NCAA attempted to ban the use of Native American names and iconography in college sports in 2005, the Seminole Tribe of Florida passed a resolution offering explicit support for FSU's use of Seminole culture and Osceola as a mascot; the university was granted a waiver, citing the close relationship with and consultation between the team and the tribe. In 2013, the tribe's chairman objected to outsiders meddling in tribal approval, stating that the FSU mascot and use of Seminole iconography \"represents the courage of the people who were here and are still here, known as the Unconquered Seminoles.\" Conversely, in 2013, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma expressed disapproval of \"the use of all American Indian sports-team mascots in the public school system, by college and university level and by professional sports teams\", and not all members of the tribe's Florida branch are supportive of its stance.\n\nIn other former colonies in Asia, Africa, and South America, the adoption of indigenous names for majority indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnicity-related team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area, such as the Boston Celtics, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThe 2018 Commonwealth Games to be held on the Gold Coast in Australia from 4 April 2018 has named its mascot Borobi, the local Yugambeh word for \"koala,\" and has sought to trademark the word through IP Australia. The application is being opposed by a Yugambeh cultural heritage organisation, which argues that the Games organising committee used the word without proper consultation with the Yugambeh people.\n\nThe term wigger (common spelling \"wigga\") is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms, language, and fashions associated with African-American culture, particularly hip hop, and, in Britain, the grime scene, often implying the imitation is being done badly, although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent. Wigger is a portmanteau of \"white\" and \"nigger\" or \"nigga,\" and the related term wangsta is a mashup of \"wannabe\" or \"white\", and \"gangsta\". Among black hip-hop fans, the word \"nigga\" can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting, but when used by whites, it is usually viewed as offensive. \"Wigger\" may be derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, black British, and white culture (when used as synonym of white trash). The term is sometimes used in a racist manner, by other white people to belittle the person perceived as \"acting black\", but it is also widely used by African Americans like 50 Cent offended by the wigga or wanksta's demeaning of black people and culture.\n\nThe phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since slavery was abolished in the Western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the \"white negro\" in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s, as examined in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay \"The White Negro\". It was later seen in the zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s, the hipster of the 1940s, the beatnik of the 1950s–1960s, the blue-eyed soul of the 1970s, and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper \"The Independent\" described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were \"wannabe Blacks\". 2005 saw the publication of \"Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wangstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America\" by Bakari Kitwana, \"a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years\"\".\"\n\nRobert A. Clift's documentary \"Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity\" questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. Clift's documentary examines \"racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of Stephen Foster, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman, Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones -- all the way up to Vanilla Ice (popular music's ur-wigger...) and Eminem.\" A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as \"white poseurs\", and states that the term \"wigger\" \"is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture\".\n\nUse of minority languages is also cited as cultural appropriated, such as when non-speakers of Scottish Gaelic or Irish get tattoos in that language. Likewise, the use of incorrect Scottish Gaelic in a tokenistic fashion aimed at non-Gaelic speakers on signage and announcements has been criticized as disrespectful to fluent speakers of the language.\n\nSince the early 2000s, it has become increasingly popular for people not of Asian descent, to get tattoos of Indian devanagari, Korean letters or Han characters (traditional, simplified or Japanese), often without knowing the actual meaning of the symbols being used.\n\nAccording to last US Census (2010), Asian-Americans make up 4.8 percent of the population. However, according to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2016, only one out of 20 (which corresponds to 5 percent) speaking roles go to Asian-Americans, and they are given only one percent of lead roles in film. White actors account for 76.2 percent of lead roles, while representing 72.4 percent of the population according to the last US census. \n\nIn 2017, \"Ghost in the Shell\", which is based on the seinen manga \"Ghost in the Shell\" by Masamune Shirow, provoked disputes over whitewashing. Scarlett Johansson, a white actress, took the role of Motoko Kusanagi, a Japanese character. This was seen as cultural appropriation by some fans of the original manga who expected the role to be taken by an Asian or Asian-American actor.\n\nDuring Halloween, some people buy, wear, and sell Halloween costumes based on cultural or racial stereotypes. Costumes that depict cultural stereotypes, like \"Indian Warrior\" or \"Pocahottie\" are sometimes worn by people who do not belong to the cultural group being stereotyped. These costumes have been criticized as being in poor taste at best and, at worst, blatantly racist and dehumanizing. There have been public protests calling for the end to the manufacture and sales of these costumes and connecting their \"degrading\" portrayals of Indigenous women to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) crisis. In some cases, theme parties have been held where attendees are encouraged to dress up as stereotypes of a certain racial group. A number of these parties have been held at colleges, and at times other than Halloween, including Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month.\n\nIn chapter four of his book \"Playing Indian\", Native American historian Philip J. Deloria refers to the Koshare Indian Museum and Dancers as an example of \"object hobbyists\" who adopt the material culture of indigenous peoples of the past (\"the vanishing Indian\") while failing to engage with contemporary native peoples or acknowledge the history of conquest and dispossession. Some Native Americans have stated that all such impersonations and performances are a form of cultural appropriation which place dance and costumes in an inappropriate context devoid of their true meaning, sometimes mixing elements from different tribes.\n\nFor 2015, the Koshare's Winter Night dances were canceled after a request was received from Cultural Preservation Office (CPO) of the Hopi Nation asking that the troop discontinue their interpretation of the dances of the Hopi and Pueblo Native Americans. Director of the CPO Leigh Kuwanwisiwma saw video of the performances online, and said the performers were \"mimicking our dances, but they were insensitive, as far as I'm concerned.\" In the 1950s, the head councilman of the Zuni Pueblo saw a performance and said: \"We know your hearts are good, but even with good hearts you have done a bad thing.\" In Zuni culture, religious object and practices are only for those that have earned the right to participate, following techniques and prayers that have been handed down for generations.\n\nThere are many other examples of groups associated with scout troops attempting to duplicate Native American dance with varying degrees of authenticity.\n\nSome people in the transgender community have protested against the casting of straight, cis-gender actors in trans acting roles, such as when Eddie Redmayne played the role of artist Lili Elbe in the film \"The Danish Girl\" and when Jared Leto played the role of a trans woman named Rayon in \"Dallas Buyers Club\". The gay community has expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters, a practice nicknamed \"gay for pay\"; this occurs in films such as \"Call Me by Your Name\" (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet), \"Brokeback Mountain\" (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), \"Philadelphia\" (starring Tom Hanks), \"Capote\" (starring Philip Seymour Hoffman) and \"Milk\" (with Sean Penn playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist, Harvey Milk). Jay Caruso calls these controversies \"wholly manufactured\", on the grounds that the actors \"are playing a role\" using the \"art of acting\".\n\nIn some cases, a culture usually viewed as the target of cultural appropriation can be accused of appropriation, particularly after colonization and an extensive period re-organization of that culture under the nation-state system. For example, the government of Ghana has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean Emancipation Day and marketing it to African American tourists as an \"African festival\".\n\nFor some members of the South-Asian community, the wearing of a bindi dot as a decorative item, by a non-Hindu, or by a woman who is not South Asian, is considered cultural appropriation.\n\nA common term among Irish people for someone who imitates or misrepresents Irish culture is \"Plastic Paddy\".\n\nIn 2003, Prince Harry of the British royal family used Indigenous Australian art motifs in a painting for a school project. One Aboriginal group labelled it \"misappropriation of our culture\", saying that to Aboriginal people, the motifs have symbolic meanings \"indicative of our spiritualism\", whereas when non-Aborigines use the motifs they are simply \"painting a pretty picture\".\n\nIn the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012, former Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss donned a Native American-style feathered headdress with leather bra and panties and high-heeled moccasins. This was said to be an example of cultural appropriation because the fashion show is showcasing the company's lingerie and image as a global fashion giant. The outfit was supposed to represent November, and thus \"Thanksgiving\", in the \"Calendar Girls\" segment. The outfit met with backlash and criticism as an appropriation of Native American culture and tradition. Victoria's Secret pulled it from the broadcast and apologized for its use. Kloss also commented on the decision by tweeting \"I am deeply sorry if what I wore during the VS Show offended anyone. I support VS's decision to remove the outfit from the broadcast.\"\n\nAvril Lavigne has been cited as appropriating Japanese culture in her song \"Hello Kitty\". The song and music video depict Asian women dressed up in matching outfits and Lavigne eating Asian food while dressed in a pink tutu. Its depiction of Japanese culture was met with widespread criticism, which has included suggestions of racism. Lavigne responded by stating \"I love Japanese culture and I spend half of my time in Japan. I flew to Tokyo to shoot this video ... specifically for my Japanese fans, \"with\" my Japanese label, Japanese choreographers \"and\" a Japanese director \"in\" Japan.\" A lot of the feedback Lavigne received on Twitter was favorable, and those who blamed her for racism were non-Japanese.\n\nWhen Selena Gomez wore the bindi during a performance, there was debate on her reasoning behind wearing the culture specific piece. Some viewed this as \"casting her vote for Team India\" but it was also viewed as misuse of the symbol as Selena was seen as not supporting or relating the Bindi to its origin of Hinduism, but furthering her own self-expression. In 2014, Pharrell Williams posed in a Native American war bonnet on the cover of \"Elle\" UK magazine, after much controversy and media surrounding the photo Williams apologized.\n\nActress Amandla Stenberg made a school-related video called \"Don't Cash Crop on My Cornrows\" about the use of black hairstyles and black culture by non-black people, acussing like Katy Perry and Iggy Azalea of using \"black culture as a way of being edgy and gaining attention\". Stenberg later criticized Kylie Jenner for allegedly embracing African-American aesthetic values without addressing the issues that affect the community. The African-American hip hop artist Azealia Banks has also criticized Iggy Azalea \"for failing to comment on 'black issues' despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music.\" Banks has called Azalea a \"wigger\" and there have been \"accusations of racism against Azalea\" focused on her alleged \"insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\"\n\nRachel Dolezal made headlines in 2015 when it was discovered that she was not African-American, as she had claimed. She is an American former civil rights activist known for being exposed as Caucasian while falsely claiming to be a black woman. Doležal was president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter in Spokane, Washington, from February 7, 2014 until June 15, 2015 when she resigned amid suspicion she had lied about nine alleged hate crimes against her. She received further public scrutiny when her white parents publicly stated that Doležal was a white woman passing as black.\n\nIn 2017, Miley Cyrus talked to Billboard magazine regarding her new image. She criticized the same African-American stereotypes and cultural elements that she had previously incorporated into her work. This was met with backlash, with people saying Cyrus has a history of appropriating hip hop culture.\n\nIn 2011, a group of students at Ohio University started a poster campaign denouncing the use of cultural stereotypes as costumes. The campaign features people of color alongside their respective stereotypes with slogans such as \"This is not who I am and this is not okay.\" The goal of the movement was to raise awareness around racism during Halloween in the university and the surrounding community, but the images also circulated online.\n\n\"Reclaim the Bindi\" has become a hashtag used by some people of South Asian descent who wear traditional garb, and object to its use by people not of their culture. At the 2014 Coachella festival one of the most noted fashion trends was the bindi, a traditional Hindu head mark. As pictures of the festival surfaced online there was public controversy over the casual wearing of the bindi by non-Indian individuals who did not understand the meaning behind it. #CoachellaShutdown has been used in conjunction with #ReclaimtheBindi in order to protest against the use of the bindi at music festivals, most notably the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Reclaim the Bindi Week is an event which seeks to promote the traditional cultural significance of the bindi and combat its use as a fashion statement.\n\nJohn McWhorter, a professor at Columbia University, has criticized the concept, arguing that cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization is a generally positive thing, and is something which is usually done out of admiration, and with no intent to harm, the cultures being imitated; he also argued that the specific term \"appropriation,\" which can mean theft, is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource: unlike appropriating a physical object, others imitating an idea taken from one group's culture don't inherently deprive that originating group of its use.\n\nIn 2016, author Lionel Shriver gave a speech at the Brisbane Writers Festival, asserting the right of authors to write from any point of view, including that of characters from cultural backgrounds other than their own – as writers \"should be seeking to push beyond the constraining categories into which we have been arbitrarily dropped by birth. If we embrace narrow group-based identities too fiercely, we cling to the very cages in which others would seek to trap us.\" She also asserted the right of authors from a cultural majority to write in the voice of someone from a cultural minority, attacking the idea that this constitutes unethical \"cultural appropriation\". Referring to a case in which U.S. college students were facing disciplinary action for wearing sombreros to a 'tequila party', she said \"The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: \"you're not supposed to try on other people's hats\". Yet that's what we’re paid to do, isn't it? Step into other people's shoes, and try on their hats.\" Sudanese-Australian social activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied walked out on Shriver's speech. Abdel-Magied later wrote a dissenting opinion piece, published in \"The Guardian\"; which has run a series of articles covering the debate over \"cultural appropriation\" matters. In it, she called the speech \"a poisoned package wrapped up in arrogance and delivered with condescension\". She reiterated the basic premises and arguments which form the ideological basis of \"cultural appropriation\", as stated in the above sections, regarding majority/minority, group identity, oppression, colonialism, etc.; but did not address Shriver's arguments about the merits of imagination and intellectual freedom.\n\n"}

It is currently kept at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.\n\nThis painting was commissioned in 1882 by the merchant Paul Durand-Ruel who wanted works on the theme of the ball. He bought it in 1886, exhibited it for the first time in April 1883, and kept it until Renoir's death in 1919. A complementary painting on the same theme, named \"Dance in the City\", was also painted by Renoir the same year.\n\nThe painting, influenced by the artist's trip in Italy in 1881 where he found inspiration from Raphael, marked an evolution of the painter who tried then to break away from Impressionism.\n\nThe painting depicts a couple dancing under a chestnut tree: the man is Paul Lhôte, a friend of the painter, and the woman is Aline Charigot, who later became the wife of the painter. Both figures are painted life-size and occupy almost the entire painting. However, a table in the background on the right, and a hat on the ground, and a pair of faces below the level of the dance floor, can be seen. The woman who holds a fan in her right hand, displays a smiling face and looks towards the viewer. The scene is bathed in a bright and cheerful atmosphere, and the women's clothes use warm colors (yellow gloves, red hat).\n\n"}

It first originated in Bishnupur, the town of Bankura District. In the 16th century, Bir Hambir, the king of Bishnupur, invented this card. There are ten avatars of Bishnu in the cards. It is a unique example of Bengal’s folk art.\n\nIn 1592, Bir Hambir became king of Bishnupur. He had a great relationship with Akbar, so, a lot of times he went to Akbar's court. Seeing the playing of cards he was surprised. Coming to his kingdom, he thought of creating a new card in God-goddess of uniqueness. According to his directive, artist from Bishnupur, Kartik Faujdar, made the Dashabatar Cards. kings of Mallabhum play this card at leisure for entertaining. \n\nHowever, Indian scholar Haraprasad Shastri said that this game first originated in the 8th century. In 1895 he said in the Asiatic society's journal:\n...I fully believe that the game was invented about eleven or twelve hundred years before the present date.\n\nBecause the placement of Jagannath (Buddha) is in the 5th position in Dashabatar card, but in common belief, Jagannath is in the 9th position.\n\nPrabhat Kumar Saha, an expert on Dashavatar cards, said: \"Malla dynasty ruled from about 12th century AD to 1622\". He confirmed that the Foujdars were the only makers of these cards in Bengal.\n\nThe artists from the Faujdar family of Bishnupur specialise in making these cards. At first, a piece of cloth is folded a number of times. Then glue is pasted, made from tamarind seeds. After drying this, a layer of chalk dust is applied on the cards. Both sides are evened out with a smooth stone. The cards are then cut into round shapes of a 4.5-inch radius. Various deities and their symbols are painted on these using various colours. On the reverse part, a layer of lac and vermillion is applied.\n\nDashavatar cards are the 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu - Matsya, Kurma, Baraha, Nrisingha, Buddha(Jagannath), Baaman, Ram, Balaram, Parshuram and Kalki are drawn on these cards. \n\nThe Dashavatar card game is a complicated one. It is played using 120 cards with numerous rules and regulations. \n\nSital Fouzdar claims to be the 87th generation of artisans.Nowadays, Vidyut Fouzdar makes them.\n\n"}
{"id": "18948474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18948474", "title": "Drafter", "text": "Drafter\n\nA drafter, draughtsman (British English) or draftsman, drafting technician (American English and Canadian English) is a person who makes detailed technical drawings or plans for machinery, buildings, electronics, infrastructure, sections, etc. Drafters use computer software and manual sketches to convert the designs, plans, and layouts of engineers and architects into a set of technical drawings. Drafters operate as the supporting developers and sketch engineering designs and drawings from preliminary design concepts.\n\nIn the past, drafters sat at drawing boards and used pencils, pens, compasses, protractors, triangles, and other drafting devices to prepare a drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released and was able to produce technical drawings at a faster pace. \n\nMany modern drafters now use computer software such as AutoCAD, Revit, and SolidWorks to flesh out the designs of engineers or architects into technical drawings and blueprints but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Many of these drawings are utilized to create structures, tools or machines. In addition, the drawings also include design specifications like dimensions, materials and procedures. Consequently, drafters may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians. \n\nWith CAD systems, drafters can create and store drawings electronically so that they can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into automated manufacturing systems. CAD systems also permit drafters to quickly prepare variations of a design. Although drafters use CAD extensively, it is only a tool. Drafters still need knowledge of traditional drafting techniques, in addition to CAD skills. Despite the near global use of CAD systems, manual drafting and sketching are used in certain applications.\n\nDrafters' drawings provide visual guidelines and show how to construct a product or structure. Drawings include technical details and specify dimensions, materials, and procedures. Drafters fill in technical details using drawings, rough sketches, specifications, and calculations made by engineers, surveyors, architects, or scientists. For example, drafters use their knowledge of standardized building techniques to draw in the details of a structure. Some use their understanding of engineering and manufacturing theory and standards to draw the parts of a machine; they determine design elements, such as the numbers and kinds of fasteners needed to assemble the machine. Drafters use technical handbooks, tables, calculators, and computers to complete their work.\n\nDrafting work has many specialities such as:\n\n\nDrafters work in architectural offices, manufacturing companies, engineering firms, CAD-specific work-groups, construction companies, engineering consultancy firms, the government, natural resource companies or are independently self-employed. Drafting technologists and technicians often work as part of a broader multidisciplinary engineering team in support of engineers, architects or industrial designers or they may work on their own. The position of a drafter is one of a skilled assistant to architects and engineers. Drafters usually work in offices, seated at adjustable drawing boards or drafting tables when doing manual drawings, although modern drafters work at computer terminals much of the time. They usually work in an office environment, but some may have to travel and spend time on manufacturing plants or construction sites. As drafters spend long periods in front of computers doing detailed technical work, they may be susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems. Most drafters work standard 40-hour weeks; only a small number work part-time.\n\nHigh school courses in English, mathematics, science, electronics, computer technology, drafting and design, visual arts, and computer graphics are useful for people considering a drafting career. Attributes required by drafters include technical writing skills, problem-solving skills, the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional drawings as well as drawing the relationships between parts in machinery and various pieces of infrastructure. Other skills include an in-depth knowledge of the qualities of metals, plastics, wood and other materials used in the overall manufacturing processes and of construction methods and standards. Technical expertise, a strong understanding of construction and the manufacturing process, and a solid knowledge of drafting and design principles are also important assets in becoming a drafter. In the modern job marketplace, in addition to technical skills enabling CAD drafters to draw up plans, soft skills are also crucial as CADD drafter have to communicate with clients and articulating their drawing plans in an effective way with fellow team members in a real-world setting.\n\nEmployers prefer applicants who have also completed training after high school at a trade or technical school. Prospective drafters will also need to have a strong background knowledge and experience with CADD software. Though licenses aren’t a prerequisite for becoming drafters, the American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) does offer certification and licensing. Licensing and certification highlights one's core competence and knowledge of a specific drafting specialty.Drafting and design certificates and diplomas are generally offered by career training schools, trade and technical schools and non-university higher education institutions like community colleges or industrial training institutes. \n\nApprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training and experience with in-class instruction. People interested in becoming drafters can get qualified as either drafting technologists or drafting technicians. Drafting technologists usually have a 2 to 3-year diploma in engineering design or drafting technology from a community college or technical school. Drafters starting out tend to move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. A more senior drafter often moves up into a management position where they become able to supervise entire projects as they gain more experience or they can start their own business and become self-employed. It is also possible for experienced drafters to enter related fields such as engineering, architecture, industrial design, interior design, exhibit design, landscape design, set design, and animation.\n\n"}
{"id": "235721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235721", "title": "Elegance", "text": "Elegance\n\nElegance is beauty that shows unusual effectiveness and simplicity. It is frequently used as a standard of tastefulness particularly in the areas of visual design, decoration, the sciences, and the aesthetics of mathematics. Elegant things exhibit refined grace and suggest maturity.\n\nEssential components of the concept include simplicity and consistency of design, focusing on the essential features of an object. In art of any kind one might also require dignified grace, or restrained beauty of style.\n\nVisual stimuli are frequently considered elegant if a small number of colors and stimuli are used, emphasizing the remainder.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, there are two concepts referring to two aspects of simplicity. Elegance (syntactic simplicity) means the number and complexity of hypotheses. Parsimony (ontological simplicity) is the number and complexity of things postulated.\n\nThe proof of a mathematical theorem exhibits mathematical elegance if it is surprisingly simple yet effective and constructive; similarly, a computer program or algorithm is elegant if it uses a small amount of code to great effect.\n\nIn engineering, a solution may be considered elegant if it uses a non-obvious method to produce a solution which is highly effective and simple. An elegant solution may solve multiple problems at once, especially problems not thought to be inter-related.\n\nIn chemistry, chemists might look for \"elegance\" in theory and method, in technique and procedure. For example: elegance might comprise creative parsimony and versatility in the utilization of resources, in the manipulation of materials, and in effectiveness in syntheses and analysis.\n\nIn pharmacy, elegance in formulation is important for quality as well as effectiveness in dosage form design, a major component of pharmaceutics.\n"}
{"id": "575960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575960", "title": "Inker", "text": "Inker\n\nThe inker (sometimes credited as the finisher or embellisher) is one of the two line artists in traditional comic book production.\n\nThe penciller creates the initial drawing or sketch. Using \na pen or a brush, the inker adds depth and shading to give the image more definition. Only then does the image take shape. Inking was necessary in the traditional printing process as presses could not reproduce pencilled drawings. \"Inking\" of text is usually handled by another specialist, the letterer,\nthe application of colors by the colorist.\n\nAs the last hand in the production chain before the colorist, the inker has the final word on the look of the page, and can help control a story's mood, pace, and readability. A good inker can salvage shaky pencils, while a bad one can obliterate great draftsmanship and/or muddy good storytelling.\n\nWhile inking can involve tracing pencil lines in a literal sense, it also requires interpreting the pencils, giving proper weight to the lines, correcting mistakes, and making other creative choices. The look of a penciler's final art can vary enormously depending on the inker. A pencil drawing can have an infinite number of shades of grey, depending on the hardness of the graphite and the pressure applied by the artist. By contrast, an ink line generally can be only solid black. Accordingly, the inker has to translate pencil shading into patterns of ink, as for example by using closely spaced parallel lines, feathering, or cross-hatching.\n\nSome inkers will often do more than simply interpreting the pencil markings into pen and brush strokes; depending on how much detail the penciler puts into the pencil drawings, the inker might add shading or be responsible for the placement of black spaces and shadows in the final drawing. An experienced inker paired with a novice penciler might be responsible for correcting anatomical or other mistakes, modifying facial expressions, or changing or improving the artwork in a variety of other ways. Alternatively, an inker may do the basic layout of the page, give the work to another artist to do more detailed pencil work, and then ink the page himself (as Joe Simon often did when inking Jack Kirby, or when Michael T. Gilbert collaborated with penciller P. Craig Russell on the Elric of Melniboné series).\n\nThe division between penciller and inker described here is most frequently found where the penciler and inker are hired independently of each other by the publisher. Where an artist instead hires his own assistants, the roles are less structured; an artist might, for example, ink all the faces of the characters while leaving the assistant to ink in the backgrounds, or work with the inker in a more collaborative fashion. Neal Adams' Crusty Bunkers worked like this, with say one inker responsible for the characters' heads, another doing bodies, and a third embellishing backgrounds. The inking duo Akin & Garvey had a similar arrangement, with one inking the figures and the other the backgrounds.\n\nOne can ink digitally using computers, a practice that has started to become more common as inkers learn to use powerful drawing and editing tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Inkscape, Corel Painter, and Manga Studio. A graphics tablet is the most common tool used to accurately ink digitally, and use of vector-based programs precludes pixelization due to changes in resolution. However, many regard the process as more time-consuming.\n\nFor a long time, inking was considered a minor part of the comics industry, only marginally above lettering in the pecking order. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired \"packagers\" to produce entire books. Although some \"star\" creators' names (such as Simon and Kirby or Bob Kane) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally didn't care which artists worked on the book. Packagers instituted an assembly line style method of creating books, using top talents like Kirby to create the look and pace of the story and then handing off the inking, lettering, and coloring to largely anonymous — and low-paid — creators to finish it.\n\nDeadline pressures and a desire for consistency in the look of a feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. At Marvel Comics, where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books he could do by leaving the inking to others. By contrast, at other companies where the writer did the frame-by-frame breakdown in script form, more artists inked or even lettered their own work. Joe Kubert and Jim Aparo would usually pencil, ink and letter, considering the placing of word balloons as an integral part of the page, and artists such as Bill Everett, Steve Ditko, Kurt Schaffenberger, and Nick Cardy almost always inked their own work (and sometimes the work of other pencilers as well). Most artists, however — even experienced inkers of their own work like Lou Fine, Reed Crandall, Will Eisner, and Alex Toth — at times hired or allowed other artists to ink their drawings. Some artists could make more money by pencilling more pages and leaving the inking to others; different artists with different working methods might find it more profitable to both pencil and ink, as they could place less information and detail in the pencil drawings if they were inking it themselves and could put that detail in at the inking stage.\n\nDue to the absence of credits on most Golden Age comic books, many inkers of that period are largely forgotten. For those whose names are known, it is difficult to compile résumés. Inkers like Chic Stone, George Papp, and Marvin Stein embellished thousands of pages during that era, most of which are still unidentified.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Marvel Comics began giving the inker credit in each of their publications. This allowed finishers like Dick Ayers, Joe Sinnott, Mike Esposito, John Severin, Syd Shores, and Tom Palmer to earn a reputation as inkers as well as pencillers. In addition, penciller-inker teams like Kirby and Sinnott, Curt Swan and Murphy Anderson, Gene Colan and Palmer, and John Byrne and Terry Austin captured the attentions of comic book fandom.\n\nIn 2008 Marvel and DC inker Bob Almond founded the Inkwell Awards, which is an award established to celebrate the craft of inking and to lift the profile of the art in general. The Inkwell Awards has gained much publicity and counts notable inkers such as Joe Sinnott, Nathan Massengill and Tim Townsend as members and associates.\n\n\n\n"}

Lightpainting (one word) is not to be confused with light painting (two words), the latter of which is a photographic process recording traces of light on film or digital media to create images that must be reproduced in printed or transparency form. Lightpainting uses white light projected in space through specially coated glass that breaks the light into bands of color, producing optically complex virtual 3D images that sit at the intersection of painting and sculpture. Lightpaintings can take the form of moveable wall-mounted panels but the most spectacular effects are achieved in large-scale architectural installations. Layers of metallic coating are applied to glass pieces to refract and reflect colors, which becomes the palette to be used as pure chroma or mixed into a wide spectrum of colors. Glass is cut into various sizes and shapes that determine planes of color and other elements that can be used much as in traditional painting or sculpture.\n\nArt critic Vince Carducci states:\n\n“The lightpaintings can and should be situated within the lineage of recent art. The optical tour-de-force of much of the work establishes its affinity with the eye-bending paintings of Op Artists such as Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely. And yet the more serene passages, in which translucent color washes over veils of other translucent color, evoke the lyrical abstractions of less-hyperactive modernist masters such as Morris Louis and Helen Frankenthaler. Perhaps the most appropriate forebears are the examples of Zen-like perceptual presence achieved by California Light and Space artists such as Robert Irwin, James Turrell, and Eric Orr. But [lightpaintings] can be distinguished from all of these...in [the] use of light purely in and of itself not as a collateral effect of pigment or architectural structure.”\n\n"}

The practice of banning books is a form of censorship, from political, legal, religious, moral, or (less often) commercial motives. This article lists notable banned books and works, giving a brief context for the reason that each book was prohibited. Banned books include fictional works such as novels, poems and plays and non-fiction works such as biographies and dictionaries.\n\nSince there are a large number of banned books, some publishers have specialized in them. The best-known examples are the Parisian Obelisk Press, which published Henry Miller's sexually frank novel \"Tropic of Cancer\", and Olympia Press, which published William Burroughs's \"Naked Lunch\". Both of these, the work of father Jack Kahane and son Maurice Girodias, specialized in English-language books which were prohibited, at the time, in Great Britain and the United States. , also located in Paris, specialized in books prohibited in Spain during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Russian literature prohibited during the Soviet period was published outside of Russia.\n\nBooks are still banned throughout the world. Nowhere in the world can everything be published, although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another: hate speech, for example, is prohibited in a number of countries, such as Sweden, though the same books may be legal in the United States or United Kingdom, where the only prohibition is on child pornography. \n\nIn the United States, books have been and still are banned by school and public libraries, despite the opposition of the American Library Association to book bans. This is usually the result of complaints from parents, who find particular books not appropriate for their children (e.g., books about sexual orientation such as \"And Tango Makes Three\"). In many libraries, including the British Library and the Library of Congress, erotic books are housed in separate collections in restricted access reading rooms. In some libraries, a special application may be needed to read certain books. Libraries sometimes avoid purchasing controversial books, and the personal opinions of librarians have at times impacted book selection.\n\n\nAll about UAE *http://www.uaeemployments.com*\n\n"}

It is based in Milan, Italy.\n\nAs a vertically integrated company, Luxottica designs, manufactures, distributes and retails its eyewear brands, including LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Apex by Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision, Sears Optical, Target Optical, Eyemed vision care plan, and Glasses.com. Its best known brands are Ray-Ban, Persol, and Oakley.\n\nLuxottica also makes sunglasses and prescription frames for designer brands such as Chanel, Prada, Giorgio Armani, Burberry, Versace, Dolce and Gabbana, Miu Miu, DKNY, and Tory Burch.\n\nIn January 2017, Luxottica announced a merger with Essilor The combined entity will command more than one quarter of global value sales of eyewear. In March 2018, the European Commission unconditionally approved the merger of Essilor and Luxottica.\nOn October 1st 2018 the new holding company EssilorLuxottica was born, resulting in combined market capitalization of approximately €57 billion.\n\nLeonardo Del Vecchio started the company in 1961, in Agordo north of Belluno, Italy; today the company is headquartered in Milan.\n\nDel Vecchio began his career as the apprentice to a tool and die maker in Milan, but decided to turn his metalworking skills to making spectacle parts. So in 1961, he moved to Agordo in the province of Belluno, which is home to most of the Italian eyewear industry. The new company was Luxottica s.a.s., a limited partnership with Del Vecchio as one of the founding partners. In 1967, he started selling complete eyeglass frames under the Luxottica brand, which proved successful enough that by 1971 he ended the contract manufacturing business.\n\nConvinced of the need for vertical integration, in 1974, he acquired Scarrone, a distribution company. In 1981, the company set up its first international subsidiary, in Germany, the first in a rapid period of international expansion. The first of many licensing deals with a designer was struck with Armani, in 1988.\n\nThe company listed in New York in 1990, and in Milan in December 2000, joining the MIB-30 (now FTSE MIB) index in September 2003. The listing raised money for the company and allowed it to use its shares to acquire other brands, starting with Italian brand Vogue Eyewear in 1990, Persol and the United States Shoe Corporation (LensCrafters) in 1995, Ray-Ban in 1999 and Sunglass Hut, Inc. in 2001. Luxottica later increased its presence in the retail sector by acquiring Sydney-based OPSM in 2003, Pearle Vision and Cole National in 2004. Luxottica acquired Oakley in November 2007 for US$2.1 billion. Oakley had tried to dispute their prices because of Luxottica's large marketshare, and Luxottica responded by dropping Oakley from their stores, causing their stock price to drop, followed by Luxottica's hostile take over of the company. In August 2011, Luxottica acquired Erroca for €20 million.\n\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Luxottica would partner with Google on the development of Google Glass and its integration into Luxottica's eyewear.\n\nOn 1 September 2014, a new organizational structure was announced, composed of two co-CEOs, one focusing on market development and the other overseeing corporate functions. After the exit of former CEO Andrea Guerra, Enrico Cavatorta was appointed CEO of Corporate Function and Interim CEO of Market (until new and permanent appointment to this role).\n\nEnrico Cavatorta left the company 40 days after being appointed CEO. In 2016, it was reported that Luxottica had lost its third chief executive in a year and a half as Adil Mehboob-Khan stepped down a year after he replaced Cavatorta.\nIn January 2017, the company agreed on a merger with Essilor. The deal will also help to offer a succession plan for Leonardo Del Vecchio, the company's founder. On October 1st 2018 the new holding company EssilorLuxottica is born, resulting in combined market capitalization of approximately €57 billion. \n\nIn August 2018, Luxottica restored Accademia Bridge in Venice.\n\nLuxottica's two main product offerings are sunglasses and prescription frames. The company operates in two sectors: manufacturing & wholesale distribution, and retail distribution.\n\nThe house brands include the following:\n\nThe company also makes eyewear under license for the following designer labels:\nThese brands are sold in the company's own shops, as well as to independent distributors such as department stores, duty-free shops, and opticians.\n\nLuxottica Retail has approximately 9,000 retail locations in the United States, Latin America, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates. The headquarters of the retail division is in Mason, Ohio, United States (North America). Their retail banners include the following:\nLuxottica is the largest optical retailer in the United States, with 7.3% of US retail sales in 2015.. With its merger with Essilor in 2018 the company owns Coastal/Clearly, an online contacts and glasses retail giant bought in 2014 that ships to over 200 countries beside its original North American market.\n\nLuxottica also owns EyeMed Vision Care, a managed vision care organization in the United States. As of 2014, it is the second largest vision benefits company in the United States.\n\nThe company has been criticised for the high price of its brand-name glasses, such as Ray-Ban, Oakley, and several others. A 2012 \"60 Minutes\" segment focused on whether the company's extensive holdings in the industry were used to keep prices high. Luxottica owns not only a large portfolio of brands (over a dozen) such as Ray-Ban and Oakley but also retailers such as Sunglass Hut and Oliver Peoples, the optical departments at Target and Sears, as well as key eye insurance groups including the second largest glasses insurance firm in the US. It has been accused of operating a complete monopoly on the optical industry and overcharging for its products — for example, temporarily dropping competitor Oakley from its frame design list, then, when the company stock crashed, purchasing the company, then increasing the prices of its Ray-Ban sunglasses. In addition, it has been argued that, by owning the vision insurance company EyeMed, it also controls part of the buyers' market as well.\n\nThe company says that the market is highly competitive, and their frames account for ~10% of sales worldwide and ~20% in the United States. Euromonitor International estimates that Luxottica's market share is 14% worldwide, and the second-largest company in the industry, Essilor, has a 13% market share. The third-largest player is Johnson & Johnson, with a 3.9% market share. As of October 2018, Luxottica and Essilor have merged into a single company, EssilorLuxottica, representing almost a billion pairs of lenses and frames sold annually.\n\nThe HBO series Last Week Tonight with John Oliver has also criticized the company in the show’s feature on corporate consolidation.\n\nIn December 2013, Luxottica Group paid €33 million to the Italian Agency of Revenue to settle transfer pricing issues that arose in 2007.\n\nThe list of Luxottica shareholders with more than 2% of holdings, represented by voting shares at 23 December 2014.\n\nIn September 2012, Delfin S.a.r.l. reduced its share of Luxottica from 66% to 62.1%, but later increased its share to 66% again.\n\n"}

It is commonly used to describe the surface of plants or the skin of animals. In plants, mottling usually consists of yellowish spots on plants, and is usually a sign of disease or malnutrition. Many plant viruses cause mottling, some examples being:\n\nMottling is sometimes used to describe uneven discolored patches on the skin of humans as a result of cutaneous ischemia (lowered blood flow to the surfaces of the skin) or Herpes zoster infections. The medical term for mottled skin is dyschromia. Although this is not always the case, mottling can occur in the dying patient and commonly indicates that the end of life is near. Mottling usually occurs in the extremities (lower first) and progresses up as cardiac function declines and circulation throughout the body is poor. In animals, mottling may be a sign of disease, but may also be a hereditary trait, such as seen with the champagne and leopard complex genes in horses.\n\nMottles can also refer to discoloration in processed food, such as butter.\n\nIn geology, mottled refers to a patchy/blotch texture of alteration or interbedding, commonly found in limestone and commonly caused by bioturbation.\n\nMottling can also refer to an undesirable defect which can occur with effect coatings, most obvious on light metallic finishes. The total color impression shows irregular areas of lightness variations. These \"patches\" are usually visually evaluated, described as a mottling effect. Some also feel that it reminds them of clouds. This effect is especially noticeable on large body panels. It can be caused by the coating formulation, as well as variations in the application process. For example, disorientation of the metallic flakes or film thickness variations of the basecoat can lead to various mottle sizes resulting in a non-uniform appearance. The visual perception of mottling is dependent on the viewing distance: Large mottles can be seen in far distance evaluation, while small mottles are more noticeable in close up evaluation. The visual evaluation of mottling is very subjective, as it depends\non the illumination conditions, the observing distance and the viewing angle.\n\nIn graphics printing mottling refers to an uneven coloration resulting from letterpressed printing of textured papers, mainly in larger colored surfaces. Due to the uneven surface, not all fibers of the paper are evenly saturated with color unlike offset printing.\n\nThe irregular lightness variations caused by mottling can be objectively measured with specially made instruments. These instruments simulate visual evaluation under different observing angles and characterize clouds / mottles by their size and visibility. Small to large mottles are measured under three observing angles, in which the scan length can usually be varied from 10 to 100 cm. The measurement results are independent of color and curvature of the surface and thus can be considered objective.\nThe specific measurement process for one such instrument is as follows.\nIt first optically scans the surface and measures the lightness variations. The specimen is illuminated with a white light LeD at a 15° angle and the lightness is detected under three\nviewing angles to simulate visual evaluation under different observing conditions: 15°, 45° and 60° measured from the specular reflection. The mottling meter is rolled across the surface for a defined distance of 10 to 100 cm and measures the lightness variations point by point. The measurement signal is divided via mathematical filter functions into 6 different size ranges and a rating value is calculated for each angle and mottle size. The higher the value is, the\nmore visible the mottling effect. The measured values are displayed in a graph showing the mottle size on the X-axis and the rating value on the Y-axis. Thus, target values for small and large mottle sizes can be established for paint batch approval as well as process control.\n\nMilitary battledress often use a mottle pattern, such as Frog Skin and Flecktarn.\n"}
{"id": "404656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404656", "title": "Mythologies (book)", "text": "Mythologies (book)\n\nMythologies is a 1957 book by Roland Barthes. It is a collection of essays taken from \"Les Lettres nouvelles\", examining the tendency of contemporary social value systems to create modern myths. Barthes also looks at the semiology of the process of myth creation, updating Ferdinand de Saussure's system of sign analysis by adding a second level where signs are elevated to the level of myth.\n\n\"Mythologies\" is split into two: Mythologies and Myth Today, the first section consisting of a collection of essays on selected modern myths and the second further and general analysis of the concept.\n\nThe first section of \"Mythologies\" describes a selection of modern cultural phenomena, chosen for their status as modern myths and for the added meaning that has been conferred upon them. Each short chapter analyses one such myth, ranging from \"Einstein's Brain\" to \"Soap Powders and Detergents\". They were originally written as a series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine \"Les Lettres Nouvelles\".\n\nIn a typical example, Barthes describes the image that has been built up around red wine and how it has been adopted as a French national drink, how it is seen as a social equaliser and the drink of the proletariat, partly because it is seen as blood-like (as in Holy Communion) and points out that very little attention is paid to red wine's harmful effects to health, but that it is instead viewed as life-giving and refreshing — 'in cold weather, it is associated with all the myths of becoming warm, and at the height of summer, with all the images of shade, with all things cool and sparkling.'\n\nIn another chapter, Barthes explores the myth of professional wrestling. He describes how, unlike in the sport of boxing, the aim of theatrical stunt fighting is not to discover who will win or 'a demonstration of excellence', it is a staged spectacle acting out society's basic concepts of good and evil, of 'Suffering, Defeat and Justice'. The actors pretending to be wrestlers, like characters in a pantomime, portray grossly-exaggerated stereotypes of human weakness: the traitor, the conceited, the 'effeminate teddy-boy'. The audience expects to watch them suffer and be punished for their own transgressions of wrestling's rules in a theatrical version of society's ideology of justice.\n\nIn an interview Barthes once mentioned working on an essay on hidden tracks in recorded music. This essay, however, has never been published.\n\n\nIn the second half of the book Barthes addresses the question of \"What is a myth, today?\" with the analysis of ideas such as: myth as a type of speech, and myth on the wings of politics.\nFollowing on from the first section, Barthes justifies and explains his choices and analysis. He calls upon the concepts of semiology developed by Ferdinand de Saussure, who described the connections between an object (the signified) and its linguistic representation (such as a word, the signifier) and how the two are connected. Working with this structure Barthes continues to show his idea of a myth as a further sign, with its roots in language, but to which something has been added. So with a word (or other linguistic unit) the meaning (apprehended content) and the sound come together to make a sign. To make a myth, the sign itself is used as a \"signifier\", and a new meaning is added, which is the \"signified\". But according to Barthes, this is \"not\" added arbitrarily. Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the ruling class and its media.\n\nBarthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from \"Paris Match\" edition no. 326, of July 1955, showing a young black soldier in French uniform saluting. The \"signifier\": a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the young man's life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the young man; the picture, in combination with the \"signifieds\" of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about France and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate 'that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,' etc., but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus; a property of 'significance' for the picture.\n\nExploring the concept of myth, Barthes seeks to grasp the relations between language and power. He assumes that myth helps to naturalize particular worldviews.\n\nAccording to Barthes, myth is based on humans’ history, and myth cannot naturally occur. There are always some communicative intentions in myth. Created by people, myth can easily be changed or destroyed. Also, myth depends on the context where it exists. By changing the context, one can change the effects of myth. At the same time, myth itself participates in the creation of an ideology. According to Barthes, myth doesn’t seek to show or to hide the truth when creating an ideology, it seeks to deviate from the reality. The major function of myth is to naturalize a concept, a belief. Myth purifies signs and fills them with a new meaning which is relevant to the communicative intentions of those who are creating the myth. In the new sign, there are no contradictions that could raise any doubts regarding the myth. Myth is not deep enough to have these contradictions; it simplifies the world by making people believe that signs have inherent meaning. Myth “abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences…”\n\nWhy do people believe in myth? The power of myth is in its impressive character. It seeks to surprise the audience. This impression is way more powerful than any rational explanations which can disprove the myth. So, myth works not because it hides its intentions, but because the intentions of myth have been naturalized. Through the usage of myths, one can naturalize “the Empire, [the] taste for Basque things, the Government.”\n\nSpeaking of myth and power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. He uses the term ex-nomination (or exnomination), by which he \"means 'outside of naming'. Barthes' point was that dominant groups or ideas in society become so obvious or common sense that they don't have to draw attention to themselves by giving themselves a name. They're just the 'normality', against which everything else can be judged.\" For example he says, \"[the bourgeoisie] makes its status undergo a real \"ex-nominating operation\": the bourgeoisie is defined as \"the social class which does not want to be named\"\" (italics in original). Myth removes our understanding of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon Karl Marx, Barthes states that even the most natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (\"des mythes forts et des mythes faibles\"). Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political character. However, this character can be brought back by “the slightest thing”. \nBarthes also provides a list of rhetorical figures in bourgeoisie myths:\n\nThe model of semiosis suggested by Barthes seeks to link signs with the social myths or ideologies that they articulate.\n\nIn writing about the mythologisation process, Barthes refers to the tendency of socially constructed notions, narratives, and assumptions to become \"naturalised\" in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes finishes \"Mythologies\" by looking at how and why myths are built up by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works including \"The Fashion System\".\n\n\n"}

Ohrstrom, Sr. The founders of the National Sporting Library focused their new organization on accessibility of research materials on horse and field sports, finding other libraries on these topics to be insufficiently accessible to the public. The first President of the National Sporting Library was Fletcher Harper, long-time Master of the Orange County Hunt in The Plains, Virginia. Additional founders included Lester Karow, and Alexander Mackay-Smith, Editor of \"The Chronicle of the Horse\". When Ohrstrom, Jr. died in 1955, his son, George L. Ohrstrom, Jr., became an officer of the library.\n\nThe National Sporting Library was originally housed in the Duffy House, located on Washington Street in Middleburg. An emblem with a fox mask, horseshoe, rifle, and fishing rod was designed to serve as the library's logo. The library grew its collections through donations, and when the collection outgrew the space in the library's building, the National Sporting Library moved to Vine Hill, built in 1804. During these years, the library shared space with the offices of \"The Chronicle\". An underground, fire-proof vault with capacity for 6,000 volumes was installed in Vine Hill to house the library's rare titles.\n\nThe library was housed in Vine Hill from 1969 to 1999, when it moved to its current location, a new building resembling an English carriage house. The move was necessitated to house the library's growing collection, which included 16,000 volumes dating to the 17th Century and over 100 sporting art prints. Construction of the building took 18 months, and was completed in July 1999. The library moved its collections into the building in August 1999 and a grand opening was held on September 18, 1999. Funding for the library's new building came from many of the library's members, including a $1 million donation from Paul Mellon, who also donated a weather vane to be installed atop the building's cupola.\nIn 2009, the National Sporting Library re-branded as National Sporting Library & Museum (NSLM) and began expansion of Vine Hill to include 13,000 feet of art gallery space. The new museum opened on October 7, 2011 with the inaugural exhibition \"Afield in America: 400 Years of Animal & Sporting Art\".\n\nThe NSLM's library collections include over 20,000 books, periodicals, archives, and ephemera objects. Overall, the collection dates to the 16th century, with rare and antiquarian titles housed in the library's F. Ambrose Clark Rare Book Room.\n\nIn 1995, the library received a gift of 5,000 rare and antiquarian books from John H. Daniels, CEO of Archer Daniels Midland and member of the library's board of directors. The gift included the library's earliest-printed book (published in 1523) and was a major factor in the move to a new library building. The Daniels collection is stored among the library's rare books and is one of several other named collections maintained at NSLM.\n\nThe NSLM's inaugural exhibition was based on the 2008 book \"Animal & Sporting Artists in America\" by F. Turner Reuter, Jr. \"Animal & Sporting Artists in America\" was published by the National Sporting Library in 2009 and included an encyclopedic listing of over 2,300 animal and sporting artists who produced work in North America. Reuter served as guest curator for the exhibition, which featured works by many notable sporting an animal artists, including John James Audubon, Edward Troye, and Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait. The exhibition opened on October 8, 2011 and closed May 10, 2012. The exhibition opening drew over 400 visitors to the new museum, and the entire exhibition saw over 4,000 visitors.\n\n\"Munnings: Out in the Open\" offered a selection of 68 open-air works by Sir Alfred Munnings. The exhibition was open from April 24 through September 15, 2013, and included 68 pieces of artwork from private collections and public institutions, including the Sir Alfred Munnings Art Museum, the Yale Center for British Art, the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, and Pebble Hill Plantation. The exhibition opening included a screening of the film \"Summer in February\", as well as an exhibit in the NSLM library of Munnings' letters and drawings.\n\nNSLM developed \"The Horse in Ancient Greek Art\" in partnership with the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, exploring the depiction of equestrian sports in ancient Greek pottery from the 8th through 4th centuries BCE. \"The Horse in Ancient Greek Art\" featured more than 70 works from museums across the United States, as well as objects from private collections. The exhibition was co-curated by NSLM's Curator of Permanent Collections Nicole Stribling and VMFA's Jack and Mary Ann Frable Curator of Ancient Art Peter Schertz. More than 200 guests visited NSLM for the exhibition opening. The exhibition opened September 9, 2017 at the NSLM and closed January 14, 2018 before traveling to VMFA. The exhibition opened at VMFA on February 17, 2018 and closed on July 8, 2018. The exhibition's catalog was distributed worldwide by Yale University Press. In May 2018, \"The Horse in Ancient Greek Art\" was named \"New Event of the Year\" in the Visit Loudoun Awards.\n\n"}

New Orleans Airlift is dedicated to producing innovative projects for New Orleans-based artists to collaborate and engage with diverse communities locally and internationally. Airlift projects are identified by collaboration, experimentation and a belief in the artist’s role in creating a just, equitable and joyous future.\n\nAirlift's programming highlights New Orleans’ underground art and experimental artists. Through networks, friendships, and close connections to New Orleans' street life, Airlift is able to cultivate and foster long-standing relationships with artists locally and globally. The organization understands how important a dynamic street culture, living culture and a thriving contemporary arts scene are to the neighborhoods within New Orleans. By transporting that which is unique to New Orleans to workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects, Airlift is able to bring recognition to New Orleans as well as provide inspiration and creative collaboration around the globe.\n\nAirlift was founded in 2008 by Delaney Martin and Jay Pennington. Pennington and Martin began to collaborate just after Hurricane Katrina. As they witnessed the particular devastation of the Storm on the New Orleans artistic community, Pennington and Martin saw collaborative creativity as a way of coming together and mending their community.\n\nTogether they organized an event called The New Orleans Airlift, which brought New Orleans artists to Berlin, Germany in 2009. Jay and Delaney named this project, thought to be a one-time-event, after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Soon after returning from Berlin, though, Jay and Delaney decided to continue the cultivation of unique artistic collaborations, and kept the organization under the name New Orleans Airlift.\n\nAirlift projects are hallmarked by creative collaboration, and artistic experimentation. One of the most successful projects to date has been The Music Box, a multi-disciplinary project dedicated to the exploration and performance of musical architecture. This project was inspired by the twin pillars of New Orleans culture, music and architecture.\n\nFrom 2011 through 2012 the first ever installation of The Music Box called \"A Shantytown Sound Laboratory\" presented groundbreaking musical performances and hosted free public hours in its inaugural location, the historic Bywater neighborhood. Constructed from the remains of a blighted house, invented instruments were embedded into the walls, ceilings and floors of structures created by 25 collaborating artists. The Music Box captured the hearts of New Orleans community and the attention of international press including NPR who said: “High concept and nontraditional as it may be, The Music Box has found a place in the long history of New Orleans music.\"\n\nNew Orleans Airlift continues to pair New Orleans artists with influential institutions, individuals and community members to collaborate to create artistic productions that are participatory, multifaceted and high quality. In the spring of 2015, New Orleans Airlift completed their installment of the Roving Village Residencies, an ambitious project where the musical houses travel to different neighborhoods around New Orleans. The first residency took place in City Park. Over the course of six weeks (April to May 2015) over 10,000 audience members explored the installation through night time orchestral concerts, free public hours on weekends, educational workshops and artist talks. Over 700 children participated in the Music Box Roving Village: City Park through school field trips and after school partnerships. The Village also hosted musicians from all musical backgrounds and locations such as Bruce “Sunpie” Barnes, Solange Knowles, Wilco, influential Jazz musicians William Parker and Cooper Moore, Lost Bayou Ramblers, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band, to name a few. Having proved to be a great success, a permanent Music Box Village and headquarters for New Orleans Airlift has been erected in the Bywater, neighborhood of New Orleans.\n"}
{"id": "27879991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27879991", "title": "Ormside bowl", "text": "Ormside bowl\n\nThe Ormside Bowl is an Anglo-Saxon double-bowl in gilded silver and bronze, with glass, perhaps Northumbrian, dating from the mid-8th century which was found in 1823, possibly buried next to a Viking warrior in Great Ormside, Cumbria, though the circumstances of the find were not well recorded. If so, the bowl was probably looted from York by the warrior before being buried with him on his death. The bowl is one of the finest pieces of Anglo-Saxon silverwork found in England.\n\nThe bowl is a double-shelled cup made from 2 pieces riveted together with dome-headed rivets and beaded collars. The surface of the bowl is decorated with a chased repousse technique.\nSometime after it was originally made the bowl was converted into a drinking vessel.\n\nThe inner cup is made from gilt-bronze and is riveted with studs of blue glass and silver. The base plate of the internal bowl features 16 circular pieces of glass within a ring of cloisons and five further rivets, of which the central is missing. The gilding on the bowl was added after the other decoration. The inner bowl could have been made in York as a blue-glass stud matching the bowl's was found there.\n\nThe outer shell is made from silver-gilt, the rim once had a U-sectioned strip of ungilded silver although this has now mostly been lost. This strip was originally attached using 4 clips in the shape of animal heads although 2 of these have also been lost.\nThe bowl's gilt-silver exterior is decorated with Anglo-Saxon style interlaced fabulous creatures amid Continental style vines, the frontal gaze of some of the creatures on the bowl is a common occurrence in carvings of this type. These decorations show plants, grapes, fruit, animals and birds in both naturalistic and grotesque style.\nAnother beaded band is riveted on in four places outside the rim. These rivets have square mountings, in one of which a piece of blue glass survives. The external base plate features five domed rivets. The interlaced cruciform decoration between these rivets has been made using a repoussé technique. The bowl may also once have had a footring made from gilded wire.\n\nThe Ormside bowl is similar in aspects of its style to several bowls from the St Ninian's Isle Treasure but is closer in style to the Witham bowl, a lost early eighth century hanging-bowl found in the River Witham. The decoration on the bowl has been compared to the St Petersburg Bede, Barberini Gospels, Gandersheim Casket and Rupertus Cross.\nThe conical bosses on the base of the bowl resemble features of the Kildalton Cross.\n\nThe embossed and fine-lined filigreed designs on the bowl have been compared to those of the Wye Down pendant and the Book of Durrow leading to it being dated in 1958 by G. Haseloff to 650–700, though this now seems too early.\n\nThe bowl was found buried in 1823 in what is now St James' Churchyard in Great Ormside. The bowl was amongst the first objects donated to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society in 1823, before the construction of the Yorkshire Museum in 1829-30. It latterly formed part of the permanent collection of the museum. In 1898 the burial of a Viking warrior was found in the same churchyard. This burial, including a sword, is now in the Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery in Carlisle where it forms an important part of their early medieval collection. David M. Wilson does not consider the bowl to have actually been buried with the Viking warrior, and instead assumes it was really found inside the church, as he considers the bowl to be too fragile to have survived burying.\n\nIn 1951 the bowl was cleaned and treated in the laboratory of the British Museum, including the removal of a silver patch so that all of the metalworking detail could be seen. It was then exhibited at the York Festival before returning briefly for exhibition in the British Museum in 1952.\n\nIt was on display in the 1980s as the centerpiece of the Anglo-Saxon gallery, surrounded by swords and sculptures.\n\nThe bowl was temporarily displayed again in the British Museum in 2010. This was the first time a regional museum has shown its collection at the British Museum and Margaret Hodge the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport encouraged everybody to view the exhibit. It returned to the Yorkshire Museum for its reopening on Yorkshire Day of the same year after a £2m refurbishment of the galleries.\n\nFrom 2017 the bowl formed part of a touring exhibition titled 'Viking: Rediscover the Legend' and is displayed alongside the Bedale Hoard, the Vale of York hoard and the Cuerdale hoard, with the tour starting at the Yorkshire Museum in May 2017 with subsequent displays at the Atkinson Art Gallery and Library in Southport, Aberdeen Art Gallery, Norwich Castle Museum, and the University of Nottingham.\n\nThere is also a small exhibition about the bowl in St James' Church in Great Ormside.\n\n"}

{"id": "36994726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36994726", "title": "Phallic architecture", "text": "Phallic architecture\n\nPhallic architecture consciously or unconsciously creates a symbolic representation of the phallus. Buildings intentionally or unintentionally resembling the human penis are a source of amusement to locals and tourists in various places around the world. Deliberate phallic imagery is found in ancient cultures and in the links to ancient cultures found in traditional artifacts.\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated phallic festivals and built a shrine with an erect phallus to honor Hermes, messenger of the gods. Those figures may be related to the ancient Egyptian deity Min who was depicted holding his erect phallus. Figures of women with a phallus for a head have been found across Greece and Yugoslavia. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architectural tradition of ancient Babylon. The Romans, who were deeply superstitious, also often used phallic imagery in their architecture and domestic items. The ancient cultures of many parts of the Far East, including Indonesia, India, Korea and Japan, used the phallus as a symbol of fertility in motifs on their temples and in other areas of everyday life.\n\nScholars of anthropology, sociology, and feminism have pointed out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally or perhaps subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that can be interpreted as phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.\n\nThe worship of the phallus has existed since the Stone Age, and was particularly prevalent during the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age.\n\nPhallic architecture became prominent in ancient Egypt and Greece, where genitalia and human sexuality received a high degree of attention. The ancient Greeks honored the phallus and celebrated phallic festivals. The Greco-Roman deity Priapus was worshiped as a god of fertility, depicted with a giant phallus in numerous public architectural pieces.\n\nThe Greeks regularly built a shrine which they called \"Herm\" at the entrance of major public buildings, homes and along roads to honor Hermes, messenger of the gods. The shrines typically \"took the form of a vertical pillar topped by the bearded head of a man and from the surface of the pillar below the head, an erect phallus protruded\". It is believed that they sought their inspiration from the ancient Egyptians and their phallic image of Min, the valley god, who was similarly \"depicted as a standing bearded king with simplified body, one arm raised, the other hand holding his erect phallus.\"\n\nHerodotus, the ancient Greek historian, documented women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments the size of a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.\n\nSimilar figurines of women with phallus heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast majority of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes. In these parts of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of the masculine earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.\nAlthough phallic architecture as individual pieces was not prevalent in ancient Rome as it was in ancient Greece or Egypt, the Romans were deeply superstitious and often introduced phallus-related components as architectural pieces and domestic items. Archaeologists unearthing a site in Pompei discovered many vases, ornaments and sculptures unearthed revealing the preoccupation with the phallus, also unearthing an 18-inch terracotta phallus protruding from what was believed to have been a bakery with the inscription, \"Hie habitat felicitas\" (here dwells happiness), and many Romans wore phallus amulets to ward off the evil-eye.\n\nPriapic worship amongst the women of Sicily continued into the 18th century; worshiping phallic votive objects and kissing such offerings before placing them upon the altar in the churches. Fetishism with the phallus architecturally and in smaller implements was also exhibited by certain Christian sects in medieval times, such as the Manichaeans, and was connected with masochism and sadism, a form of religious flagellantism. Smaller phallic shaped monuments in the form of idols, even vases, rings, drinking vessels and jewellery have been well-documented and could be found within medieval churches of Ireland.\nIn Hinduism, the Hindu trimurthi represents Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver and Shiva, the destroyer. Shiva, the main deity in India, is both destroyer and is stated to also include his role of creation; this creation role is represented by the phallic symbol, known as \"lingam\" in which form he is worshiped or in the form of male trinity of penis and two testicles. The \"linga\", or phallus, is a common feature of Hindu temples across India, engrained as reliefs or other forms. The Brihadeeswarar Temple of Tanjore in Tamil Nadu, built during the Chola Dynasty, is dedicated to Shiva, and features \"lingam\" between the cells; it is especially renowned for its \"Hall of One Thousand Lingas\".\n\nIn Indonesia, the phallic \"lingga\" and feminine \"yoni\", remain common symbols of harmony. The Sultan's Palace of Kasepuhan, in West Java, has a number of \"lingga-yoni\" carvings along its walls. According to the Indonesian chronicles of the Babad Tanah Jawi, Prince Puger gained the kingly power from God, by ingesting sperm from the phallus of the already-dead Sultan Amangkurat II of Mataram.\n\nCandi Sukuh temple of Ngancar, East Java, was built in the 10th century and is dedicated to Shiva. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5 ft) representation of \"lingga\" with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. Phallic references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.\n\nIn Africa, Ancient Malians, particularly the royals of Djenne, decorated their palaces with phallus like piers and columns at the entrance of their palaces and decorated the walls with phallus motifs. Similar features can be seen on the pillars of many temples across Africa, often interpreted by western scholars to be phallic symbols, but may often be more subtle and subject to varying interpretations. Like the ancient Egyptian pharaohs, Aksumite kings built temples with phallic pillars in ancient Ethiopian cities such as Konsu, and monolithic pillars with phallic representation have also been discovered in Madagascar. In ancient Maya, phallic architecture was rare but Uxmal in particular has a considerable number of phallus-like architectural pieces. It contains a temple known as the Temple of the Phallis and phallic sculptures and motifs.\n\nClaude Nicholas Ledoux was a major exponent of architectural development in the 17th century which \"articulated across the tensions of form and ornament, symbol, and allegory, dogma, and fantasy\", at a time when western society was oppressive and particularly sensitive to public displays of sexuality; blatant and graphic phallic architecture would have been considered an embarrassment and a shameful act. In his initial draft for the House of Pleasure in Chaux (a proposed ideal city, near the Forest of Chaux), Ledoux drew upon allegorical ideas in his design with the union of man and woman, a physiological interpretation of intercourse and penetration. Private bedrooms were designed to \"thrust out from the circular ring of the building, metaphorically representing penetration, the circular ring representing the vaginal passage and womb of the female.\n\nThe second revised design is said to \"subliminate both elevated site and female gender\" with a \"lonely phallus\", without the original planned animated circular ring representing the female reproductive organs. Ledoux drew upon phallic and sexually charged inspiration in other buildings which he designed. His design of Besançon Theatre for instance was fueled by the exigencies of prostitution and ancient sexual ritual. However, in comparison to the likes of Jean-Jacques Lequeu, who gained notoriety for his pornographic architectural concoctions, Ledoux's architectural inspiration was relatively mild, and he is said to have omitted towers from his designs on occasion as he was aware that they would be frowned upon shamefully by general society as a too obvious representation of the phallus; Ledoux's \"missing erection\" is explained to this effect in Jacques Lecan's \"Significance of the Missing Phalus\".\n\nAccording to Oscar Reutersvärd, the interest in neoclassical architecture in the 18th century was synonymous with and motivated by a similar interest in masculine virility. Works such as Francesco Colonna's \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" (1467) and Giovanni Battista Piranesi's \"Campo Marzio\" (1762) show profoundly the ancient influence of phallic architecture in design and worship, and contain numerous illustrations of Priapic temples and architecture. Piranesi in particular is said to have offered a \"prototype for the mysterious architecture of phallic worship that more closely resembles the houses of pleasure\" in his etchings.\n\nHe located two designs for the Bustum Caesaris Augusti, concluding that they were based upon sexual ritual, with \"two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula\". Piranesi believed that the purpose of the phallic designs were to celebrate virility and male regenerative power. Other commentators such as Carl August Ehrensvärd also provided illustrations and analysis of Priapic temples and the meaning of phallic architecture. A work of note to this effect is \"Neoclassical Temple of Virility and the Buildings with a Phallic Shaped Plan\" (1977) of the Institute for Art History of the University of Lund, Sweden.\n\nIn America, especially in Chicago and New York, and numerous other global cities, high rise skyscrapers of phallic shape grew up in the 20th century. Le Corbusier, the famous architect, propagated it in Europe in place of traditional decorative architecture. Similar futuristic developments took place in Italy with the initiative of Sant’Elia, symbolizing the triumph of man. Yet unlike those of ancient times which were blatant architectural representations of the phallus, in the West in modern times \"shrines to the phallus\" are more subtle, and may often be subject to interpretation as such; very few architects have specifically admitted the human phallus as a source for their architectural creation. The Italian Fascists were cited as having an obsession with phallic architecture which was rigid and impermeable. In the last few decades the high-rise phallic skyscraper has been a symbol of government quest for economic power in China, Hong Kong and South Korea and the other ASEAN/Pacific Rim nations. China fuels billions of dollars annually into high-rise office and residential buildings with the aim of increasing GDP, at a rate far greater than they can be occupied.\n\nIn art and architecture, acutely vertical buildings are often seen as a symbol of masculinity and horizontal buildings are seen as more feminine. The terms \"phallic verticality\", \"phallic erectility\" and \"phallic brutality\" have been referred to by architectural theorists, including the likes of French sociologist Henri Lefebvre, who argued that buildings of phallic architectural type metaphorically symbolize \"force, male fertility, masculine violence\". Phallic erectility \"bestows a special status on the perpendicular, proclaiming phallocracy as the orientation of space\" while phallic brutality \"does not remain abstract, for it is the brutality of political power.\"\n\nLefebvre conducted considerable research into the meaning of high-rise buildings. He said \"The arrogant verticality of skyscrapers, and especially of public and state buildings, introduces a phallic or more precisely a phallocratic element into the visual realm; the purpose of this display, of this need to impress, is to convey an impression of authority to each spectator. Verticality and great height have ever been the spatial expression of potentially violent power.\" Sigmund Freud metaphorically drew a comparison between \"high achievement and the acquisition of wealth as building monuments to our penises.\"\n\nIn the 19th century, Thomas Mical argues that surrealists \"capitalized on the phallic symbolism of monuments such as the ancient Egyptian obelisk from Luxor in the Place de la Concorde or the Vendome Column\" by \"supplementing these phallic structures with female counterparts\". Jules Breton for example suggested moving the obelisk to La Villette abattoir and designing a large gloved hand of a woman holding the obelisk in a suggestive manner, and adapting the Vendome into a factory chimney with a nude woman climbing it.\nAuguste Bartholdi's 1870 monument \"Defense of Paris\" for instance, a commemoration of Leon Gambetta's escape from Paris in balloon during the Franco-Prussian War, was also subject to debate amongst Parisian artists of the late 19th century as they believed it resembled a testicle. Arthur Harfaux proposed turning the monument into \"an enormous sex, the balloon forming a testicle and the phallus being horizontal\", while Breton proposed turning it into copulating genitals, adding a twin balloon to form two testicles.\nContemporary scholars in architectural criticism have investigated the relationship between architecture and the body, sexuality, sex, power, and place. Feminists in particular, such as Margrit Kennedy, perceive high-rise phallic-like buildings on the urban landscape as \"phallic symbols of male domination, power and rational instrumentality.\" Esther M. K. Cheung believes the form of monumental high-rise building which grew up in 20th century America can \"be read as a phallic symbol of power\". The present trend symbolises \"Science and technology over nature, incorporating all the maleness which that with sci-fi utopias.\" Elizabeth Grosz, however, offers a counter argument to phallocentrism in urban design theories, saying \"not so much the dominance of the phallus as the pervasive unacknowledged use of the male or masculine to represent the human. The problem, then, is not so much to eliminate as to reveal the masculinity inherent in the notion of the universal, the generic human, or the unspecified subject.\" Marc C. Taylor discusses phallic architecture and what makes a building masculine or feminine in his book \"Disfiguring: Art, Architecture, Religion\".\n\nDuring the modern era, many sculptors have created some public phallic works of art, with varying degrees of subtlety. One of these examples may be the statue in honor to the Carnation Revolution on the top of a hill in Lisbon, Portugal by the sculptor João Cutileiro. Perhaps the greatest example of a phallic cemetery is the Khalid Nabi Cemetery in hills of northeastern Iran near the border with Turkmenistan, roughly northeast of Gonbad-e Kavous. According to a popular belief, the cemetery house the tomb of a pre-Islamic prophet, Khalid Nabi, who was born 40 years prior to the birth of Muhammad, in c. 530. The ancient graveyard contains some 600 tombstones of unknown origin, many of which are clear representations of the phallus; from a distance they resemble stone pegs.\nPhallic shrines are common in Far East Asia, especially in Buddhist parts of Korea and Japan where they are seen as symbols of fertility or prowess. In Dragon Pool Temple in Jeju City, there is a phallic shrine which is visited by female pilgrims who come to worship it for its perceived fertility blessings. The phallic stone is made from granite, quite small in size and white and was reportedly found in a field nearby by a farmer.\n\nIn Thailand, the phallus is also considered to be a symbol of good luck and representative of fertility. There are numerous shrines in the country featuring phallic architecture. Chao Mae Tuptim shrine in Bangkok, behind the Swissôtel Bangkok hotel has over a hundred colored circumcised wooden penis statues of all shapes and sizes which are said to possess special cosmic powers and endow good fortune and fertility on anybody coming into contact with them.\n\nNear Erdene Zuu Monastery in Övörkhangai Province of Mongolia is Kharkhorin Rock which contains a massive statue of a penis raised on a platform on the steppe. The statue has dual functions; primarily it is a reminder to the monks to remain celibate, but it is also a symbol of fertility and human life. A smaller statue of a phallus is nearer the monastery. Haesindang Park (also known as \"Penis Park\") in Gangwon Province of South Korea, located about south of Samcheok, is a nature park which contains a number of erect statues. A tragic legend shrouds them in that a virgin was once swept out to sea and drowned, unable to be saved by her lover. The townspeople were devastated and helpless, and a curse appeared to have been cast over them, ruining the local fishing industry. One day, a local fisherman relieved himself in the sea and miraculously the fishing industry revived. He discovered that her restless spirit could be appeased in such a manner, so the townsfolk compensated for the woman's inability to consummate beyond the grave by placing sexually potent phallic statues in view of the shore. The statues range in size and styles; some have faces on them and are more animated in appearance and more colorful, but others are exact depictions of the human penis.\n\nIn some Asian countries such as Bhutan, many have a belief that a phallus brings good luck and drives away evil spirits. Phallus symbols are routinely painted outside walls of the new houses and carved wooden phalluses are hung (sometimes crossed by a design of sword or dagger) outside, on the eves of the new homes, at the four corners. On a road drive from Paro airport to Thimphu explicit paintings of phalluses are a common sight on the white-washed walls of homes, shops and eateries. In the Chimi Lhakhang monastery, the shrine dedicated to Drupka Kinley, several wooden penises are used to bless people who visit the monastery on pilgrimage seeking blessings to bear a child or for welfare of their children. The glaringly displayed phallus in the monastery is a brown wooden piece with a silver handle, a religious relic considered to possess divine powers and hence used for blessing the spiritually oriented people. It is also said to prevent quarrels among family members in the houses which are painted with these symbols.\n\nThe 102-story Empire State Building, located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the intersection of Fifth Avenue and West 34th Street, is one of the world's most famous landmarks, and is generally thought of as an American cultural icon. Cited by Valerie Briginshaw as a symbol of American pride and \"the ultimate sign of American phallic power\", it was inaugurated on 31 May 1931.\n\nDesigned in the Art Deco style, it has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 meters), and with its antenna spire included, it stands a total of 1,454 ft (443.2 m) high. It stood as the world's tallest building for 40 years, from its completion in 1931 until construction of the World Trade Center's North Tower was completed in 1972. After the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11, 2001, it remained the tallest building in New York City for 13 years until the One World Trade Center was completed. Numerous people have mentioned its similarities in appearance to the phallus, with its \"tall and glinting\" towers.\n\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa, Italy, dating from around 1173, has long suffered from structural problems. The tower is eight stories high at and before restoration work from 1990 leaned 5.5 degrees. It currently leans about 4 degrees but due to foundation problems it continues to sink about 1mm annually. The resemblance of the tower to a penis has seen the \"Leaning Tower of Pisa\" became a sexual slang term for a half erect penis. Local retailers have attempted to capitalize on the tower as a phallic architectural piece by making souvenirs featuring underwear with the tower resembling a penis. The Catholic Church denounced the promotion of the tower in such a manner as showing \"a complete lack of respect\" and a \"disgrace\" and retailers can now be fined up to €500 for selling items promoting the tower as a penis.\n\nNelson's Column, a monument to Admiral Horatio Nelson, was erected by a grateful nation between 1840 and 1843 to commemorate Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar. However the Nelson Memorial Committee ran out of money, having only raised £20,485 in public subscriptions. The column is Corinthian with a granite shaft. In his poem \"A Ballad of the Good Lord Nelson\", Lawrence Durrell included the multiply allusive lines \"Now stiff on a pillar with a phallic air/Nelson stylites in Trafalgar Square/Reminds the British what once they were.\"\n\nColonna Mediterranea is a monumental column in Luqa, Malta. It has been described by its artist Paul Vella Critien as an \"Egyptian symbol\". However at a glance it could be observed to look similar to a large penile, and therefor was largely described to be a \"phallic monument\". The monument has managed to attract several international media coverage in specific before and during the visit of Pope Benedict XVI to Malta as the pope mobile, carrying the papacy, had been planned and passed by it. Similarly the same artist has created another monumental column, the Kolonna Eterna, which was also described as being phallic by critics.\n\nThe Obelisk of Luxor, which stands in the Place de la Concorde of Paris, France, was given to the French by the Egyptians in the 1800s. The 23-meter (75-foot) obelisk originally stood at the front of Luxor Temple, honoring Ramses II, pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt. According to Michael D. Garval, the French perceived the obelisk as \"prodigiously phallic\" from the moment it arrived.\n\nThe Oriental Pearl TV Tower, located in Pudong Park in Lujiazui, Shanghai, China, is the world’s third tallest TV and radio tower at , the tallest such building in Asia. The tower houses restaurants, theaters, a conference hall, and a hotel and is a significant tourist attraction in the city. The tower has been met a mixed reception, however. \"The New York Times\" described it as a \"great phallic monster of truly monumental ugliness, a bit like an enormous asparagus with a silver ball on top.\" The long steel column tower is considered by some to be proof of the city's phallic worship, and that such skyscrapers indicative of wealth are an increasing aphrodisiac of the materialist in Chinese cities.\n\nThe Burj Qatar was designed by French architect Jean Nouvel. In 2004, the project was first called the \"High Rise Office Building\". Following completion in 2012, it was originally called the \"Burj Doha\" by its owner, H. E. Sheikh Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani. \nThe public has noted the building's \"phallic form\", suggestive of what Nouvel calls a “fully assumed virility.”\n\nThe State Capitol building of Lincoln, Nebraska has been cited as the \"apex\" of phallic architecture. At 15 stories and 400 feet (121 m) tall, it is the second-tallest U.S. statehouse, surpassed only by the 34-story Louisiana State Capitol. It is the tallest building in Lincoln, the third-tallest in the state, and also the heaviest Capitol building in North America. The building was designed by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, who drew upon Classical and Gothic architectural traditions. It was constructed between 1922 and 1932, of Indiana limestone, with a golden dome. The building is nicknamed \"The Phallus of the Plains\" for its phallus-like appearance.\n\n30 St Mary Axe opened in London in April 2004. Designed by Norman Foster, the structure, London’s first environmentally sustainable tall building using recycled and recyclable materials, has been compared to the phallus and a gherkin, which also is a slang term for \"small penis\"; its nicknames include Gherkin, the Erotic Gherkin, Towering Innuendo and the Crystal Phallus. Also likened to a \"phallic fat cigar\", the building has been cited as a \"crude anatomical metaphor\", yet has become one of the London's most iconic buildings. \"Cabinet\" voted it the \"Best Uncircumcised Building in the World\".\n\nThe Torre Agbar is a 38-story skyscraper located in the Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes of the Poblenou neighborhood of Barcelona, Spain. Designed by Jean Nouvel, it is named after its owners, the Agbar Group, a holding company whose interests include the Barcelona water company Aigües de Barcelona. An example of high-tech architecture in the city, its design combines a number of different architectural concepts, resulting in a striking structure built with reinforced concrete, covered with a facade of glass, and over 4,500 window openings cut out of the structural concrete. The building stands out on the skyline of Barcelona; it is the third tallest building in the city, standing at 144.44 m (473.88 ft), with an area of over 50,000 square metres, of which 30,000 are offices. 2,500 LED bulbs cause the tower to change color at night. It was officially opened by the King of Spain on 16 September 2005. Nouvel claims it to be inspired by a geyser and the nearby mountain of Montserrat, although he does note its phallic appearance. Although many draw comparisons with the phallus, locals refer to the structure as \"el supositorio\" (the suppository), a drug delivery system that is inserted into the rectum or vagina.\n\nThe Washington Monument in Washington D.C. is often seen as a prime example of phallic architecture and American masculinity. The towering monument, made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, it is both the world's tallest stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk, standing according to the National Park Service. Construction of the monument began in 1848, was halted from 1854 to 1877, and was completed in 1884. In a \"Journal\" review, dated 17 October 1911, Arnold Bennett said of the monument, \"Saw Washington monument. Phallic. Appalling. A national catastrophe – only equalled by the Albert Memorial. Tiny doll-like people waiting to go into it.\" Dan Burstein says of it, \"Speaking of sex symbols, there is no more phallic symbol in existence than the Washington Monument, and the Capitol dome can be viewed as breastlike.\" James Webb used a metaphor to praise the \"uplift[ing]\" power of the Washington Monument as a white phallus, \"piercing the air like a bayonet\". In the futuristic film \"Hardwired\", set in the United States where everything noteworthy is commercialized, the Washington Monument is used as a giant Trojan condoms billboard.\n\nYpsilanti Water Tower is a historic water tower in Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States, listed as a National Register of Historic Places building in 1981. The tower was designed by William R. Coats and constructed as part of an elaborate city waterworks project that began in 1889. Located on the highest point in Ypsilanti, the tower was completed in 1890 at a cost of $21,435.63. Today the tower is frequently joked about for its phallic shape and has earned the nickname \"Brick Dick\".\n\nIt has become a well-known landmark in Ypsilanti, and due to the building's shape and location, the tower is frequently used by residents as a point for providing directions for visitors and residents. Iggy Pop said of it in a 1996 interview, \"The most famous thing in Ypsilanti is this water tower made out of brick, about 175 years old. It looks like this big penis.\"\n\nThe World's Most Phallic Building contest was a contest held in 2003 by \"Cabinet\" magazine to find the building which most resembled a human phallus. The contest originated when writer Jonathan Ames drew the ire of \"Slate\" readers by claiming, in a diary that was later published in his book \"I Love You More Than You Know\", that the Williamsburg Bank Building in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, was the world's most phallic. This led Cabinet magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the \"world's most phallic\". Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors. After months of entries and discussion, the Ypsilanti Water Tower was announced as the winner, although the winner of a readers' poll was the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee. Another notable nominee was the Torre Agbar of Barcelona.\n\nThe Christian Science Dixon church in Dixon, Illinois strongly resembles a penis when viewed from the air.The church, however, claims it was tastefully designed around an old oak tree and declared that \"We didn’t design it to be seen as what they’re seeing. And we didn’t design it to be seen from above.\"\n\nIn 2012, a beehive metal sculpture by Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was criticized by the council for installment adjacent to the children’s play area in Hyde park for looking too rude and phallic. Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved it to another part of the park.\n\nA new headquarters for the \"People's Daily\" newspaper has been under construction and is slated for completion in 2014. In May 2013, China attempted to censor jokes about its phallic shape.\n\nThe high Hyde Park Obelisk, located in Hyde Park, Sydney Australia at the intersection of Elizabeth Street and Bathurst Street, is both a former sewer ventshaft and a notable landmark in the Sydney CBD. Its phallic appearance was emphasised on 7 November 2014, when the AIDS Council of NSW (ACON) temporarily installed a giant condom over the Obelisk as part of a HIV awareness campaign. The installation generated a lot of media interest—including many phallic innuendos—and drew the ire of the Australian Christian Lobby.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "103895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103895", "title": "Pop art", "text": "Pop art\n\nPop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s. The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of \"popular\" (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any culture, most often through the use of irony. It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.\n\nAmong the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of abstract expressionism, as well as an expansion of those ideas. Due to its utilization of found objects and images, it is similar to Dada. Pop art and minimalism are considered to be art movements that precede postmodern art, or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.\n\nPop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of \"Campbell's Soup Cans\", by Andy Warhol. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by Warhol's \"Campbell's Tomato Juice Box,\" 1964 (pictured).\n\nThe origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain. In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to hard-edged composition and representational art. They used impersonal, mundane reality, irony, and parody to \"defuse\" the personal symbolism and \"painterly looseness\" of abstract expressionism. In the U.S., some artwork by Larry Rivers, Alex Katz and Man Ray anticipated pop art.\n\nBy contrast, the origins of pop art in post-War Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American pop culture as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society. Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by American popular culture \"when viewed from afar\". Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of Dadaism. While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture. Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp, and Kurt Schwitters.\n\nAlthough both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, Marcel Duchamp and others in Europe like Francis Picabia and Man Ray predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American \"proto-pop\" origins which utilized \"as found\" cultural objects. During the 1920s, American artists Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy, Charles Demuth and Stuart Davis created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost \"prefiguring\" the pop art movement.\n\nThe Independent Group (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement. They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled \"Bunk!\" that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949. This material of \"found objects\" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented \"American\" popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's \"I was a Rich Man's Plaything\" (1947), which includes the first use of the word \"pop\", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver. Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.\n\nAccording to the son of John McHale, the term \"pop art\" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with Frank Cordell, although other sources credit its origin to British critic Lawrence Alloway. (Both versions agree that the term was used in Independent Group discussions by mid-1955.)\n\n\"Pop art\" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term \"pop art\" first appeared in published print in the article \"But Today We Collect Ads\" by IG members Alison and Peter Smithson in Ark magazine in 1956. However, the term is often credited to British art critic/curator Lawrence Alloway for his 1958 essay titled \"The Arts and the Mass Media\", even though the precise language he uses is \"popular mass culture\". \"Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954-55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation...\" Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art.\n\nIn London, the annual Royal Society of British Artists (RBA) exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-\"Young Contemporaries\" of all put David Hockney, the American R B Kitaj, New Zealander Billy Apple, Allen Jones, Derek Boshier, Joe Tilson, Patrick Caulfield, Peter Phillips and Peter Blake on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions. Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.\n\nAlthough pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term \"pop art\" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a \"Symposium on Pop Art\" organized by the Museum of Modern Art. By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements and inflections of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials. As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.\n\nTwo important painters in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. While the paintings of Rauschenberg have relationships to the earlier work of Kurt Schwitters and other Dada artists, his concern was for the social issues of the moment. His approach was to create art out of ephemeral materials. By using topical events in the life of everyday America, he gave his work a unique quality. Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is classified as Neo-Dada, and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.\nRoy Lichtenstein is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of parody, probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other. Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in his best known works, such as \"Drowning Girl\" (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' \"Secret Hearts\" #83. (\"Drowning Girl\" is part of the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.) His work features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, \"[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's.\" Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix.\n\nThe paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, Tom Wesselmann and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production. \n\nAndy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol \"the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced\". Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.\n\nClaes Oldenburg, Jim Dine and Tom Wesselmann had their first shows in the Judson Gallery in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with James Rosenquist, George Segal and others at the Green Gallery on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed installations and assemblages, \"New Media - New Forms\" featured Hans Arp, Kurt Schwitters, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Jim Dine and May Wilson. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, \"Environments, Situations, Spaces\". Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery, where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.\n\nDonald Factor, the son of Max Factor Jr., and an art collector and co-editor of avant-garde literary magazine \"Nomad\", wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, \"Nomad/New York\". The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, \"Four Artists\", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.\n\nIn the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many \"happenings\", which were performance art-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was \"Ray Gun Theater\". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists Lucas Samaras, Tom Wesselmann, Carolee Schneemann, Öyvind Fahlström and Richard Artschwager; dealer Annina Nosei; art critic Barbara Rose; and screenwriter Rudy Wurlitzer. His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with \"profound\" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's Lower East Side to house \"The Store\", a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.\n\nOpening in 1962, Willem de Kooning's New York art dealer, the Sidney Janis Gallery, organized the groundbreaking \"International Exhibition of the New Realists\", a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian \"New Realism\", and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included Richard Lindner, Wayne Thiebaud, Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting Blam), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Tom Wesselmann, George Segal, Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (\"The Love Wall\" from 1961), Yves Klein, Arman, Daniel Spoerri, Christo and Mimmo Rotella. The show was seen by Europeans Martial Raysse, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jean Tinguely in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were Marisol, Mario Schifano, Enrico Baj and Öyvind Fahlström. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Adolph Gottlieb and Philip Guston quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann. At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: \"at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed\". Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York.\n\nA bit earlier, on the West Coast, Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; Phillip Hefferton and Robert Dowd from Detroit; Edward Ruscha and Joe Goode from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the \"New Painting of Common Objects\" show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by Walter Hopps at the Pasadena Art Museum. Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the Guggenheim Museum exhibited \"Six Painters and the Object\", curated by Lawrence Alloway. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol. Another pivotal early exhibition was \"The American Supermarket\" organised by the Bianchini Gallery in 1964. The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the Tate Gallery's \"Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture\".\n\nBy 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The Ferus Gallery presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and Ed Ruscha in 1963). In New York, the Green Gallery showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The Stable Gallery showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The Leo Castelli Gallery presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.\n\nIn 1968, the \"São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967\" featured the \"Who's Who\" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the \"classical phase\" of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were Edward Hopper, James Gill, Robert Indiana, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol and Tom Wesselmann.\n\n\"Nouveau réalisme\" refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre Restany and the artist Yves Klein during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the \"Constitutive Declaration of New Realism,\" in April 1960, proclaiming, \"Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real.\" This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and the Ultra-Lettrists, Francois Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Jacques de la Villeglé; in 1961 these were joined by César, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle and Gérard Deschamps. The artist Christo showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.\n\nContemporary of American Pop Art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with Fluxus and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose Nice, on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the movement. In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct appropriation of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a \"poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality\".\n\nIn Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the \"new figurative\", which arose from the roots of the crisis of informalism. Eduardo Arroyo could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both mass media communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of \"pop\" art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.\n\nAlso in the category of Spanish pop art is the \"Chronicle Team\" (\"El Equipo Crónica\"), which existed in Valencia between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists Manolo Valdés and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as \"pop\" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. Filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar emerged from Madrid's \"La Movida\" subculture of the 1970s making low budget super 8 pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book \"Almodovar on Almodovar\", he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film \"Funny Face\" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.\n\nIn Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent avant-garde scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by Harue Koga in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art. The work of Yayoi Kusama contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol. In the mid-1960s, graphic designer Tadanori Yokoo became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from The Beatles, Marilyn Monroe, and Elizabeth Taylor, among others. Another leading pop artist at that time was Keiichi Tanaami. Iconic characters from Japanese manga and anime have also become symbols for pop art, such as Speed Racer and Astro Boy. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as Takashi Murakami and his superflat movement.\n\nIn Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the \"Scuola di Piazza del Popolo\" in Rome, with pop artists such as Mario Schifano, Franco Angeli, Giosetta Fioroni, Tano Festa, Claudio Cintoli, and some artworks by Piero Manzoni, Lucio Del Pezzo, Mimmo Rotella and Valerio Adami.\n\nItalian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists Enrico Baj and Mimmo Rotella to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a \"non-representational genre\", despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary \"kitsch\", which turned out to be a \"gold mine\" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.\n\nThe novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside \"domestic walls\" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the \"new world\", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including Gianni Ruffi, Roberto Barni, Silvio Pasotti, Umberto Bignardi, and Claudio Cintoli, who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of \"let me have fun\" à la Aldo Palazzeschi.\n\nIn Belgium, pop art was represented by Paul Van Hoeydonck, whose sculpture \"Fallen Astronaut\" was left on the moon during one of the moon missions. Internationally recognized artists such as Marcel Broodthaers (\" 'vous êtes doll? \"\") and Panamarenko are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was George Segal. Another well-known artist, Roger Raveel, mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the Vietnam War's increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day.\n\nWhile there was no formal pop art movement in the Netherlands, there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include Daan van Golden, Gustave Asselbergs, Jacques Frenken, Jan Cremer, Wim T. Schippers, and Woody van Amen. They opposed the Dutch petit bourgeois mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include \"Sex O'Clock,\" by Woody van Amen, and \"Crucifix / Target\", by Jacques Frenken.\n\nRussia was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s. Russia was a communist country at that point and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was Soviet-themed and was referred to as \"Sots Art\". After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power and the Russian revolution was beginning, and with it came a freedom to express. That is when pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by Dmitri Vrubel with his painting titled \"My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love\" in 1990. One might argue that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.\n\n\n"}

The woman holds a stylus and wax tablet, emphasizing that she is educated and literate, and is managing the bakery. It is suspected, based on the physical features of the couple, that they are Samnites, which may explain the desire to show off the status they have reached in Roman society. \n"}

It moved to its present location, The Mildmay Hall, The Mount (near Reading University) in 1951.\n\nIn 1964, after a fund raising campaign, the freehold of the building was bought. After modernisation, the theatre now seats 97 people.\n\nKenneth Branagh, who was a member of the theatre in the late 1970s (http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/local-news/kenneth-branaghs-latest-role-progress-4211832) became Progress Theatre patron in 2011.\n\nIn the 1950s a Student Group for 14- to 18-year-olds was set up. A charitable organisation, \"The Progress Theatre\" was established in 1962 with the object of promoting education in performing arts in Reading and the surrounding area. Since 2009, the Progress Youth Theatre consists of two groups for 15- to 18-year-olds and groups for school years 4 to 6 (ages 8 to 11), 7 to 8 (ages 11 to 13) and 9 to 10 (ages 13 to 15).

{"id": "2494405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2494405", "title": "Rushnyk", "text": "Rushnyk\n\nRushnyk, Rushnik (, , ) is a ritual cloth embroidered with symbols and cryptograms of the ancient world. They have been used in sacred Eastern Slavic rituals, religious services and ceremonial events such as weddings and funerals. Each region has its own designs and patterns with hidden meaning, passed down from generation to generation and studied by ethnographers. \n\nThere are many rushnyk collections in ethnographic museums. In Ukraine, the Rushnyk Museum is located in Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine as part of The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central Naddnipryanshchyna. A Russian rushnyk collection is housed at the Hermitage Museum.\n\nThe rectangular shape of the fabric indicates a life's journey and the ornamentation captures the cultural ancestral memory of the region. The material used is either linen or hemp. The act of spinning thread and the process of weaving linen embodies spiritual power dating back to the ancient deity Mokosh who is often represented in embroidery. The needle has its own energy, an idea similar to acupuncture, and the color of the thread has sacred meaning. Red represents life and is the main color used. A rushnyk is given to a baby at birth, it follows the person throughout life and used in the funeral service after death.\n\nA Rushnyk has many uses. The very basic rushnik is colloquially called the \"utyralnyk\" or wiper and serves as a towel. The utyralnyk either has no designs on it or it has very narrow strip on the edges. In contrast, a \"nabozhnyk\" is a highly decorated Rushnyk composing of embroidery and of lace. \"Nabozhnyks\", also called \"nabraznyks\" or \"nakutnyks\" are used to decorate icons and icon corners in homes. \n\nColour plays a very important symbolic role in traditional Slavic embroidery. Red is the colour of life, the sun, fertility and health. The majority of rushnyks are embroidered with red threads. The very word \"red\" means \"beautiful\" and \"splendid\" in Old Russian and Ruthenian: a red girl, a red sun or a red spring. The phrase \"Krasnaya devitsa\" in Old Russian language for example is an old idiomatic expression which means beautiful girl, the word \"Krasnaya\" translates in Russian language also into red. The diamond-shaped design of the rushnyk is an ancient agricultural symbol, which means a sown field, or the sun, and expresses the idea of fertility and protection against evil. Ducks, in the centre of the rushnyk, symbolize the element of life-giving water. In wedding folklore a duck and a drake symbolize a bride and a groom, in other words a pair of ducks is a symbol of family life.\n\nDuring a wedding ceremony, the bride and groom are standing on a Rushnyk called a \"pidnozhnyk,\" which translates as step-on towel. What happens to the pidnozhnyk is that the bride will drag the towel behind her, and her bridesmaids follow behind her. Tradition has it that when the bridesmaids follow behind the pidnozhnyk, they are following the path of the bride and hopefully be married.\n\nThe words are created with the common suffix \"-nyk\" (\"-nik\") that indicates a general association of the new word with the base one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2406973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2406973", "title": "Snow globe", "text": "Snow globe\n\nA snow globe (also called a waterglobe, snowstorm, or snowdome) is a transparent sphere, traditionally made of glass, enclosing a miniaturized scene of some sort, often together with a model of a town, landscape or figure. The sphere also encloses the water in the globe; the water serves as the medium through which the \"snow\" falls. To activate the snow, the globe is shaken to churn up the white particles. The globe is then placed back in its position and the flakes fall down slowly through the water. Snow globes sometimes have a built-in music box that plays a song. Some snow globes have a design around the outerbase for decoration.\n\nWhen exactly the first snow globes became well-known remains uncertain, but the popularity seemingly dates to the early 19th century in France. They may have appeared for glass blowers as adjuncts to paperweight, which had become popular a few years earlier. Snow globes were exhibited at the Paris Universal Expo of 1878, and by 1879 at least five or more companies were producing and selling snow globes throughout Europe.\n\nIn 1889, a snow globe containing a model of the newly built Eiffel Tower was produced to commemorate the International Exposition in Paris, which marked the centenary of the French Revolution. Snow globes became popular in England during the Victorian era and, in the early 1920s, crossed the Atlantic to the United States of America where they became a popular collectors item. Many of these globes were produced by Atlas Crystal Works, which had factories in Germany and America.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the Austrian Erwin Perzy, a producer of surgical instruments, invented the so-called \"Schneekugel\" (snow globe) and got the first patent for it. Originally his goal was to develop an extra bright lightsource for use as a surgical lamp. As he tried to intensify the candlepower of a so-called \"Schusterkugel\" (a water filled flask used to focus light since the Middle Ages) with particles made out of different materials for reflection purpose,\nthe effect reminded him of snowfall and it's said that by this he got the idea for a snow globe. He then built his first actual globe with the basilica of Mariazell as a model in it. Because of the great request for his snow globes, Perzy, along with his brother Ludwig opened a shop in Vienna, where the production continues until today as a family business. Today the globes get exported throughout the world; the material out of which the \"snow\" is made is handed down from generation to generation as a production secret (it should float as long as possible in the water before sinking down).\n\nIn the United States, the first snow globe-related patent was granted in 1927 to Joseph Garaja of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1929, Garaja convinced Novelty Pool Ornaments to manufacture a fish version underwater.\n\nIn America, during the 1940s, snow globes were often used for advertising. In Europe, during the 1940s and 1950s, religious snow globes were common gifts for Catholic children. Snow globes have appeared in a number of film scenes, the most famous of which is the opening of the 1941 classic \"Citizen Kane\".\n\nIn the 1950s, the globes, which were previously made of glass, became available in plastic. Currently, there are many different types of snow globes available. These globes are produced by a number of countries and range from the mass-produced versions of Hong Kong and China to the finely crafted types still produced in Austria. Snow globes feature diverse scenes, ranging from the typical holiday souvenirs to more eclectic collectibles featuring Christmas scenes, Disney characters, popular icons, animals, military figures, historical scenes, etc. Snow globes have even been used for election campaigns. Since 2000 fashion and luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Ladurée, Sonia Rykiel, or Martin Margiela, got hold of the trend and grew particularly fond of snow globes as collectible totems and emblems of their brand image. Such enthusiasm was reinforced by presence in numerous art collections of contemporary artists Walter Martin & Paloma Muñoz (also known as Martin & Muñoz) who use snow globes as a medium, or museums who paid tribute to famous artists such as French sculptor Auguste Rodin in creating high quality numbered glass dome snow globes.\n\nInitially snow globes consisted of a heavy lead glass dome which was placed over a ceramic figure or tableau on a black cast ceramic base, filled with water and then sealed. The snow or \"flitter\" was created by use of bone chips or pieces of porcelain, sand or even sawdust. As they became more sophisticated, the glass became thinner, the bases were lighter (Bakelite was popular during the Art Deco period) and the snow was made out of particles of gold foil or non-soluble soap flakes. For health and safety reasons, white plastic has become more common in the construction of modern snow globes. The liquid has evolved to light oil and then a mixture of water and antifreeze (glycerin or glycol). An added benefit was that glycerin and glycol slowed the descent of the snow. Caution should be taken if a snow globe is broken because the liquid, which can contain antifreeze, can be deadly to cats and dogs if ingested or licked off their fur.\n\nToday's snow globes can include music boxes, moving parts, internal lights, and even electric motors that make the \"snow\" move so that it is no longer necessary to shake the globe. Some also have central slots for positioning items such as photographs.\n\nIn 2005, many U.S. stores started to sell inflatable snow globes as part of their Christmas décor. These have a base with a blower, forcing air which carries polystyrene pellets from the bottom and through a tube up the back to the top, where they are blown out and fall down inside the front, which is made of transparent vinyl. The rest of the globe, including the characters inside, are made of colorful nylon fabric. These globes are typically large decorations for the front yard, and are lighted internally with a few C7 (nightlight-type) incandescent light bulbs (which are enclosed in plastic spheres to prevent heat damage to the fabric).\n\nA variation on this is the \"tornado globe\", where small foam objects spin around inside a globe. This is more common for Halloween, where foam bats or sometimes ghosts may fly around the Halloween figures in the middle. These were most common in 2006, and come in both large inflatables, and smaller tabletop versions with rigid plastic globes about 8 to 12 inches or 20 to 30 centimeters in diameter. As with the snow globes, static cling often causes the foam to stick to the plastic (especially vinyl) when humidity is low, while condensation will do the same thing on outdoor inflatables when humidity is high, or rainwater has seeped in while it is deflated.\n\nIn modern culture, snow globes often symbolize childhood, innocence, or so-called \"happy days\". However, they are also sometimes used, with dark humor, to evoke more gruesome scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1860 the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty was signed; this free trade treaty introduced new competition into the industry, leading to a collapse in the local economy.\n\nThomas Stevens, a local weaver, responded by adapting the Jacquard looms used in Coventry to weave colourful pictures from silk. By 1862, Stevens could produce four different designs and by the late 1880s this had to over 900; they became known as \"Stevengraphs\", after their maker. Many of these designs were used to produce bookmarks, while others were used to make greeting cards and other silk objects.\n\nBy the 1930s, Stevengraphs were considered collectable items, but the hobby was considered eccentric and mainly confined to female collectors. During the Second World War Coventry was attacked by German bombers; on 14 November 1940 the Coventry Blitz occurred, destroying the Stevens factory and apparently all records of the Stevengraphs.\n\nIn the late 1950s it emerged that Henry Stephens, a descendent of Thomas, had saved one of the pattern books the night before the attack and kept it in safe storage; Henry donated it to the Coventry City Council, who in turn entrusted it with the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. Stevengraphs became valuable, with more male collectors entering the hobby. Prices rose, particularly for unusual or rarer images less popular during the Victorian period.\n\nStevengraphs normally measured 140mm x 64mm (5½ x 2½ inch) and were often mounted on cardboard. A printed label on the reverse would indicate that the design was registered and could not be copied. Several other Coventry firms also produced silk-work pictures including \"W H Grant\" and \"Welch & Lambton\".\n\n"}

{"id": "28186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28186", "title": "Symmetry group", "text": "Symmetry group\n\nIn group theory, the symmetry group of an object (image, signal, etc.) is the group of all transformations under which the object is invariant with composition as the group operation. For a space with a metric, it is a subgroup of the isometry group of the space concerned. If not stated otherwise, this article considers symmetry groups in Euclidean geometry, but the concept may also be studied in more general contexts as expanded below.\n\nThe \"objects\" may be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a wallpaper pattern. The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern, e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also want to take their physical composition into account. The group of isometries of space induces a group action on objects in it.\n\nThe symmetry group is sometimes also called full symmetry group in order to emphasize that it includes the orientation-reversing isometries (like reflections, glide reflections and improper rotations) under which the figure is invariant. The subgroup of orientation-preserving isometries (i.e. translations, rotations, and compositions of these) that leave the figure invariant is called its proper symmetry group. The proper symmetry group of an object is equal to its full symmetry group if and only if the object is chiral (and thus there are no orientation-reversing isometries under which it is invariant).\n\nAny symmetry group whose elements have a common fixed point, which is true for all finite symmetry groups and also for the symmetry groups of bounded figures, can be represented as a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(\"n\") by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(\"n\"), and is therefore also called rotation group of the figure.\n\nA discrete symmetry group is a symmetry group such that for every point of the space the set of images of the point under the isometries in the symmetry group is a discrete set. The number of elements in the group may be either finite or infinite.\n\nDiscrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite point groups, which include only rotations, reflections, inversion and rotoinversion – they are just the finite subgroups of O(\"n\"), (2) infinite lattice groups, which include only translations, and (3) infinite space groups which combines elements of both previous types, and may also include extra transformations like screw displacements and glide reflections. There are also \"continuous\" symmetry groups, which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances. The group of all symmetries of a sphere O(3) is an example of this, and in general such continuous symmetry groups are studied as Lie groups. With a categorization of subgroups of the Euclidean group corresponds a categorization of symmetry groups.\n\nTwo geometric figures are considered to be of the same symmetry type if their symmetry groups are conjugate subgroups of the Euclidean group E(\"n\") (the isometry group of R), where two subgroups \"H\", \"H\" of a group \"G\" are \"conjugate\", if there exists such that . For example:\n\nWhen considering isometry groups, one may restrict oneself to those where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed. This includes all discrete isometry groups and also those involved in continuous symmetries, but excludes for example in 1D the group of translations by a rational number. A \"figure\" with this symmetry group is non-drawable and up to arbitrarily fine detail homogeneous, without being really homogeneous.\n\nThe isometry groups in one dimension where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are:\n\nSee also symmetry groups in one dimension.\n\nUp to conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:\n\n\nC is the trivial group containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure has no symmetry at all, for example the letter F. C is the symmetry group of the letter Z, C that of a triskelion, C of a swastika, and C, C, etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.\n\nD is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of bilateral symmetry, for example the letter A.\n\nD, which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.\n\nD, D etc. are the symmetry groups of the regular polygons.\n\nThe actual symmetry groups in each of these cases have two degrees of freedom for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.\n\nThe remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point, where for all points the set of images under the isometries is topologically closed are:\n\nFor non-bounded figures, the additional isometry groups can include translations; the closed ones are:\n\nUp to conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 separate ones. In crystallography they are restricted to be compatible with the discrete translation symmetries of a crystal lattice. This crystallographic restriction of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 from the 7 infinite series, and 5 of the 7 others).\n\nThe continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:\n\nFor objects and scalar fields the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical planes of reflection. However, for vector fields it does not: in cylindrical coordinates with respect to some axis, \nformula_1 has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis if and only if formula_2 and formula_3 have this symmetry, i.e., they do not depend on formula_4. Additionally there is reflectional symmetry if and only if formula_5.\n\nFor spherical symmetry there is no such distinction, it implies planes of reflection.\n\nThe continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a screw axis, such as an infinite helix. See also subgroups of the Euclidean group.\n\nIn wider contexts, a symmetry group may be any kind of transformation group, or automorphism group. Once we know what kind of mathematical structure we are concerned with, we should be able to pinpoint what mappings preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry can define the structure, or at least clarify what we mean by an invariant, geometric language in which to discuss it; this is one way of looking at the Erlangen programme.\n\nFor example, automorphism groups of certain models of finite geometries are not \"symmetry groups\" in the usual sense, although they preserve symmetry. They do this by preserving \"families\" of point-sets rather than point-sets (or \"objects\") themselves.\n\nLike above, the group of automorphisms of space induces a group action on objects in it.\n\nFor a given geometric figure in a given geometric space, consider the following equivalence relation: two automorphisms of space are equivalent if and only if the two images of the figure are the same (here \"the same\" does not mean something like e.g. \"the same up to translation and rotation\", but it means \"exactly the same\"). Then the equivalence class of the identity is the symmetry group of the figure, and every equivalence class corresponds to one isomorphic version of the figure.\n\nThere is a bijection between every pair of equivalence classes: the inverse of a representative of the first equivalence class, composed with a representative of the second.\n\nIn the case of a finite automorphism group of the whole space, its order is the order of the symmetry group of the figure multiplied by the number of isomorphic versions of the figure.\n\nExamples:\n\nCompare Lagrange's theorem (group theory) and its proof.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29874992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29874992", "title": "The Durham Proverbs", "text": "The Durham Proverbs\n\nThe Durham Proverbs is a collection of 46 mediaeval proverbs from various sources. They were written down as a collection, in the eleventh century, on some pages (pages 43 verso to 45 verso, between a hymnal and a collection of canticles) of a manuscript that were originally left blank. The manuscript is currently in the collection of Durham Cathedral, to which it was donated in the eighteenth century. The \"Proverbs\" form the first part of the manuscript. The second part, to which it is bound, is a copy of Ælfric's \"Grammar\" (minus its glossary). Each proverb is written in both Latin and Old English, with the former preceding the latter. Olof Arngart's opinion is that the Proverbs were originally in Old English and translated to Latin, but this has since been disputed in a conference paper by T. A. Shippey .\n\nWhile Richard Marsden's introduction in \"The Cambridge Old English Reader\" discusses the essentials of the Durham Proverbs, there is still more to be learned. The Durham Proverbs are held in a manuscript that is kept in the library of Durham Cathedral, which is why they are named the \"Durham\" Proverbs. The original home of the manuscript is thought most likely to have been in Canterbury. The original manuscript of the Durham Proverbs contains copies of Ælfric's own work. Several of the proverbs also appear in later works of the thirteenth-century. Considering the repetition of their use, during later times and in future works, stresses their importance from the eleventh-century society. For every one of the Durham Proverbs, there is a Latin version. The commonalities between the Latin version of the proverbs and the Old English version, in more than one manuscript, suggest that there was a common source from which the Durham Proverbs were created in Old English from Latin.\n\nThe Durham Proverbs are considered to have been used to document everyday business of the people of Anglo-Saxon England. The proverbs were used in monastic schools to teach text along with other manuscripts such as the \"Disticha Catonis\" (also known as the \"Dicts of Cato\") and a Middle English collection titled the Proverbs of Hendyng. Several of the proverbs have parallels within other proverbs listed below, as well as the Old English Disticha Catonis and the Proverbs of Hendyng. Despite their use, the source of these proverbs is largely debated and still considered unknown.\n\nOlof Arngart's notes on the Durham Proverbs say that some of the proverbs have a biblical reference. The book of Proverbs in the Bible resembles the Durham Proverbs by providing teachings on morals for a society of its time. The \"Dicts of Cato\" were also influenced by the Durham Proverbs, which in turn, influenced Christianity. The first of the Durham Proverbs can even be seen in the Dict of Cato 23.\n\nThe Durham Proverbs comprise a mixture of true proverbs and maxims, and are clearer in this regard, according to linguist and Anglo-Saxon anthropologist Nigel Barley , than the collection of Old English poems entitled the \"Maxims\" are — the latter's status being comparatively unclear. According to the \"Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages\" a maxim is a short statement that (as Laingui puts it) \"sets out a general principle\", that briefly expounds a liturgical, legal, moral, or political rule as a short mnemonic device. The Durham Proverbs are called proverbs because the collection has what Marsden calls \"transferability\" to man.\n\nThe Durham Proverbs are not as serious as some of the Old English maxims and can even be considered humorous in some areas. The proverbs are similar to fables or parables seen in Modern English. Each proverb has a lesson to teach, as do the fables and parables. It is important to note the proverbs' resemblance to Old English poetry. Using alliteration and rhythm, the proverbs show some of the earliest uses of words and phrases, such as \"cwæþ se (þe)\" which translates to \"quoth he who\", and is later seen in more Middle English sources. In addition to their importance of gaining knowledge of the Old English history, the proverbs include many words that are not seen anywhere else in Old English writings. Arngart suggests that the study of the proverbs \"furnishes insights into contemporary folklore and social life\".\n\nThe proverbs have their roots in gnomic poetry, and show a relationship in some places to the \"Disticha Catonis\" and other works of the surviving Anglo-Saxon corpus. The Old English versions are sometimes (but not always) alliterative, or in verse form, and employ the same formulae with \"sceal\" and \"byþ\" as other works do. However, they have a distinctive flavour of their own, one outstanding characteristic of which is the humorous expression that they embody (as in number 11, for example) — a quality that is lacking in the gnomes. A yet more distinctive feature is how often the proverbs echo the verse of other works, such as the echo of \"The Wanderer\" in number 23.\n\nBelow are the first 25 Durham Proverbs:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24349531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24349531", "title": "Weser Renaissance", "text": "Weser Renaissance\n\nWeser Renaissance is a form of Renaissance architectural style that is found in the area around the River Weser in central Germany and which has been well preserved in the towns and cities of the region.\n\nBetween the start of the Reformation and the Thirty Years War the Weser region experienced a construction boom, in which the Weser, playing a significant role in the communication of both trade and ideas, merely defined the north-south extent of a cultural region that stretched westwards to the city of Osnabrück and eastwards as far as Wolfsburg. Castles, manor houses, town halls, residential dwellings and religious buildings of the Renaissance period have been preserved in unusually high density, because the economy of the region recovered only slowly from the consequences of the Thirty Years War and the means were not available for a baroque transformation such as that which occurred to a degree in South Germany.\n\nThe term, coined around 1912 by Richard Klapheck, suggested that the Renaissance along the Weser independently developed its own distinct style. Max Sonnen, who used the newly coined term in 1918 in his book \"Die Weserrenaissance\", classified buildings, without regard for the circumstances of their historical background, but from a purely formal perspective in order to derive a history of the development of the style. The notion of a regional renaissance in the sense of an autonomous cultural phenomenon was based on a nationalistic mindset that had arisen since the end of the 19th century, in which things provincial also had their place in establishing identity (other examples include German Sondergotik, Rhenish or Saxon Romanesque architecture). \n\nIn 1964 Jürgen Soenke and the photographer, Herbert Kreft, presented an inventory of Renaissance buildings, which also went under the title of \"Die Weserrenaissance\". In its closing remarks it said: \"This architecture is rooted in the landscape in which it stands. It is folksy because those who created it […] came from the people. The Weser Renaissance is, simply, folk art.\" For Soenke an autochthonous (indigenous) evolution of architectural style lay hidden behind its common features. His work, that appeared in six editions up to 1986, helped to give this art-historical concept a level of popularity that went far beyond the realm of the specialist and became a kind of popular trademark.\n\nThe term Weser Renaissance gained international recognition thanks to Henry-Russel Hitchcock, who used it in his \"German Renaissance Architecture\" of 1981, although he stressed its distinctive regional features rather less and pointed out its more significant linkages with the overall historical development of Renaissance architecture. In more recent times the idea of a regional cultural identity, that did not exist in the Early Modern Period, was criticised in research by the Weser Renaissance Museum at Brake Castle, which had been founded in 1986. This research highlighted the carriers of cultural transference, such as the architectural drawing business, non-local architects, pan-regional builders and the obligatory, Europe-wide requirements of court fashion.\n\nThe hallmark of aristocratic building activity in the 16th century was the transformation of a medieval castle, the \"Burg\", into a royal residence or \"Schloss\". Initially these were often built with two wings, but later the enclosed courtyard, with its wings joined in the corners by imposing towers with flights of stairs, became the preferred layout for the homes of the aristocracy in the Weser region during the course of the 16th century, a form of building that was soon also adopted by its lesser noblemen. The characteristic \"Zwerchhaus\" (Middle High German: \"twerh\" = \"quer\" i.e. across or lateral) with so-called \"welsch\" (i.e. Italian) gables was particularly well suited as a symbol of power, because on castles like those at Detmold, Celle or Bückeburg, which were surrounded by high ramparts, they could be seen from a long way off. In addition to four-sided castles, there were also castles with three wings, either geometrically fully enclosed, like the Wewelsburg, or opening onto the castle farmyard as at Schwöbber. Even double-winged and single-winged buildings were included in the repertoire of castle architecture along the Weser.\n\nThese aristocratic designs were not only embraced by the lesser nobles; middle-class builders also copied the new forms of building in order to show off their growing social influence. Town halls, like those in Celle and Lemgo, were designed with gables along the sides and sometimes faced with an entire renaissance façade, as occurred in Bremen. From Nienburg, to Minden, Hamelin and Höxter, Hannoversch Münden and Einbeck magnificent townhouses appeared, that were often distinguished by their great gateway into the inner hall. Other important architectural features of the Weser Renaissance style are the ornately decorated gables, the use so-called \"Bossenquader\" or bossage stone, the alcoves (\"Standerker\", \"Ausluchten\" or \"Utluchten\") and double windows.\n\nChurch builders were also eager to explore new architectural designs. By elevating the position of the pulpit and placing it immediately opposite to and facing the pews, the importance of the spoken word within the Christian faith was also visible from the layout of the church interior. The castle chapels of Celle and Bückeburg are also clear examples of this arrangement as are the important parish churches of Wolfenbüttel and Bückeburg. Protestant art experienced a high point in the Weser region under the Schaumburg prince, Ernest, who at the beginning of the 17th century, had the Stadthagen Mausoleum and tomb built by Adriaen de Vries, which recalled the Florentine Renaissance. At the same time the goldsmith, Anton Eisenhoit created the altar decorations for the Catholic prince-bishop, Dietrich von Fürstenberg, and the sculptor Heinrich Gröninger, whose monumental tomb lies in Paderborn Cathedral.\n\n\n\n\nBy the Thirty Years War over 30 builders had worked in the Weser Renaissance style.\n\n\n"}

Pieces can be performed by the writer, or by another performer, sometimes anonymously. Since its launch, \"YKB\" has been continuously performed across the United States.\n\n\"Yoni Ki Baat\" was developed in 2003 by South Asian Sisters, a non-profit collective of South Asian women based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Co-founders Maulie Dass, Sapna Shahani, and Vandana Makker sent out a call in February 2003, and described receiving an outpouring of submissions. The first public performances in July 2003 at UC Berkeley included monologues dealing with abuse, menstruation, masturbation, orgasms, marriage, religious faith, and political protest.\n\nAccording to co-founder Vandana Makker:\"\"Yoni Ki Baat\" allows individuals who identify as women of South Asian ancestry the space to share their stories around issues that are often 'taboo' (and therefore not discussed) in our communities. Stories around sex, body image, abuse, violence. Stories around sex, body image, abuse, violence, pleasure, hair, relationships, bodily functions, strong emotions—pleasure, hair, relationships, bodily functions, strong emotions—those things we often can’t even admit to ourselves. These are the stories that we seek out and then perform on stage. Sometimes the writers perform their own pieces and sometimes we have other women perform them. In the spirit of \"The Vagina Monologues\", a portion of the proceeds from each show are donated to organizations that support survivors of domestic violence.\"\"Yoni Ki Baat\" performances and spinoffs have been performed in various parts of the United States by campus organizations and local South Asian organizations, sometimes borrowing scripts from South Asian Sisters, holding calls for submissions, or a combination of the two. The majority of proceeds are donated to organizations supporting survivors of domestic violence in the South Asian community. In addition to South Asian Sisters' regular performances in the San Francisco Bay Area, \"YKB\" has been staged in New York City, Seattle, Chicago, Madison, Cambridge, Ann Arbor, Worcester, Grinnell, and Palo Alto.\n"}
{"id": "13584579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13584579", "title": "Züschen (megalithic tomb)", "text": "Züschen (megalithic tomb)\n\nThe Züschen tomb (, sometimes also \"Lohne-Züschen\") is a prehistoric burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near Fritzlar, Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (\"hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste\"), it is one of the most important megalithic monuments in Central Europe. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late Neolithic Wartberg culture. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric rock art elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Züschen and from tomb I at Warburg.\n\nThe tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of sandstone blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a basalt outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the Chatti, a local Iron Age tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the antiquarian Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was excavated, still in 1894, by Johannes Boehlau, former director of the State Museum at Kassel. Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of Marburg.\n\nThe rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.\n\nA terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5 m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called \"Seelenloch\" (German for \"soul hole\"), of 50 cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some ritual, perhaps an offering ceremony. Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in France, is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial tumulus. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).\n\nThe earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an Urnfield period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.\n\nMost finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related Lohra tomb and collared bottles connected with the northern Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called \"Giant Urn\" belongs to the later burial.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber. Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent (Bronze or Iron Age) carvings at Valcamonica near Capo di Ponte, Northern Italy and at Mont Bégo in the French part of the Ligurian Alps. The symbols are normally assumed to reflect Neolithic ideological or religious ideas.\n\nA reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (\"Hessisches Landesmuseum\") in Kassel.\n\nLike any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150 m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1 km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent basalt dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4 km to the east.\n\n\n\n"}
