Tagged as \"The first Iranian vampire Western\", it was chosen to show in the \"Next\" program at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe film is described as being set in \"the Iranian ghost-town Bad City\" and depicts the doings of \"a lonesome vampire\".\n\nA young, hardworking Iranian man named Arash lives with and takes care of his heroin-addicted father, Hossein. They are harassed by a cruel, drug-dealer pimp named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.\n\nSaeed comes across a strange young woman in a chador at night. She seduces Saeed to take him back to his apartment. While there, she grows long fangs and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his car keys along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a costume party at a night club dressed up as Dracula, where he is seduced by Shaydah into taking one of the ecstasy pills he is selling. Under the influence, he is rejected by her, and ends up lost at night on the street.\n\nThe woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, skateboarding, or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and – at her request – pierces her ears with a safety pin, but she eventually leaves.\n\nAtti, a prostitute who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.\n\nSuffering from heroin withdrawal, Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.\n\nThe following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and undecided about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.\n\n\nAn early short film with the same title from Amirpour screened at festivals and won Best Short Film at the Noor Iranian Film Festival.\n\nAn Indiegogo campaign was launched in July 2012 to fund the feature-length version of the film. On August 27, 2012, the campaign's goal of $55,000 was surpassed. The project ended up with a total sum of $56,903 raised by 290 backers.\n\nThe film was shot in the town of Taft in Kern County in southern California.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics, holding a 96% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 121 reviews.\n\nGuy Lodge of \"Variety\" said in his review that \"Ana Lily Amirpour's auspicious debut feature is a sly, slinky vampire romance set in an imaginary Iranian underworld\". Andrew O'Hehir of \"Salon\" called the film \"the year's biggest discovery\" and praised its feminist themes. Boyd van Hoeij, in his review for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", praised the movie, saying \"this moody and gorgeous film is finally more about atmosphere and emotions than narrative and none the worse for it\". Drew Taylor of Indiewire graded the film A− and said that it gives \"the impression that you're witnessing something iconic and important unfold before you\".\n\nThe film was adapted into a graphic novel published by Radco in 2014.\n\nThe Belgian band The Black Heart Rebellion created an alternative soundtrack for the film and played it live several times while playing the film in the background.\n\n"}
{"id": "1634258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1634258", "title": "Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps", "text": "Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps\n\nAlexandre-Gabriel Decamps (March 3, 1803August 22, 1860) was a French painter noted for his Orientalist works.\n\nDecamps was born in Paris. In his youth he travelled in the East, and reproduced Oriental life and scenery with a bold fidelity to nature that puzzled conventional critics. His powers, however, soon came to be recognized, and he was ranked along with Delacroix and Ingres as one of the leaders of the French school. At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 he received the grand or council medal. Most of his life was passed in the neighborhood of Paris. He was fond of animals, especially dogs, and indulged in all kinds of field sports.\n\nHe died in 1860 in consequence of being thrown from a horse while hunting at Fontainebleau.\n\nDecamps was the founding father of Orientalism since he revealed everyday Oriental life in the 1831 Salon in Paris. His subjects and style with strong contrast of light and thick material became the reference for painters but also photographers and writers.\nHe was the most influential painter on Orientalism and was proclaimed the chief of the new Orientalist School. Delacroix referred to him in the \"Women of Algiers\" (1834), and the \"Fanatics of Tangiers\" (1838). Théophile Gautier’s \"Constantinople\" (1853) was described as an “immense verbal Decamps” by Henry James. Maxime Du Camp named him the Christopher Columbus of the Orient and Théophile Gautier compared his role as the discoverer of the Orient to the role of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the discoverer of nature in the eighteenth century. Christine Peltre concludes that the only equivalent to his fame were the \"Arabian Nights\" (\"One Thousand and One Nights\").\n\nDecamps' style was characteristically and intensely French. It was marked by vivid dramatic conception, bold and even rough brushstrokes, and startling contrasts of color and of light and shade. His subjects embraced an unusually wide range. He availed himself of his travels in the East in dealing with scenes from Scripture history, which he was probably the first of European painters to represent with their true and natural local background. Of this class were his \"Joseph sold by his Brethren\", \"Moses taken from the Nile\", and his scenes from the life of Samson, nine vigorous sketches in charcoal and white.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive of his historical pictures is \"Defeat of the Cimbri\", representing the conflict between a horde of barbarians and a disciplined army. Decamps produced a number of genre pictures, chiefly scenes from French and Turkish domestic life, the most marked feature of which is humour. The same characteristic attaches to many of his numerous animal paintings; Decamps was especially fond of painting monkeys. His well-known painting \"The Monkey Connoisseurs\" satirizes the jury of the French Academy of Painting, which had rejected several of his earlier works on account of their divergence from any known standard.\n\nHis paintings and drawings were first made familiar to the English public through the lithographs of Eugene le Rouit.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59551", "title": "Art Nouveau", "text": "Art Nouveau\n\nArt Nouveau (; ) is an international style of art, architecture and applied art, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1890 and 1910. A reaction to the academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.\n\nEnglish uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art). The style is related to, but not identical with, styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time: in Austria it is known as \"Secessionsstil\" after \"Wiener Secession\"; in Spanish \"Modernismo\"; in Catalan \"Modernisme\"; in Czech \"Secese\"; in Danish \"Skønvirke\" or \"Jugendstil\"; in German \"Jugendstil\", Art Nouveau or \"Reformstil\"; in Hungarian \"Szecesszió\"; in Italian Art Nouveau, \"Stile Liberty\" or \"Stile floreale\"; in Lithuanian \"Modernas\"; in Norwegian \"Jugendstil\"; in Polish \"Secesja\"; in Slovak \"Secesia\"; in Ukrainian and Russian \"Модерн\" (Modern); in Swedish and Finnish \"Jugend\".\n\nArt Nouveau is a total art style: It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, furniture, textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work. \n\nBy 1910, Art Nouveau was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by Art Deco and then by Modernism.\n\nArt Nouveau took its name from the \"Maison de l'Art Nouveau\" (\"House of the New Art\"), an art gallery opened in 1895 by the Franco-German art dealer Siegfried Bing that featured the new style. In France, Art Nouveau was also sometimes called by the British term \"Modern Style\" due to its roots in the Arts and Crafts movement, \"Style moderne\", or \"Style 1900.\" It was also sometimes called \"Style Jules Verne\", \"Le Style Métro\" (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), \"Art Belle Époque\", and \"Art fin de siècle\".\n\nIn Belgium, where the architectural movement began, it was sometimes termed \"Style nouille\" (noodle style) or \"Style coup de fouet\" (whiplash style).\n\nIn Britain, it was known as the \"Modern Style\", or, because of the Arts and Crafts movement led by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, as the \"Glasgow\" style.\n\nIn Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's Liberty & Co department store (mostly designed by Archibald Knox), it was sometimes called the \"Stile Liberty\" (\"Liberty style\"), \"Stile floral\", or \"Arte nova\" (New Art).\n\nIn the United States, due to its association with Louis Comfort Tiffany, it was often called the \"Tiffany style\".\n\nIn Germany and Scandinavia, a related style emerged at about the same time; it was called \"Jugendstil\", after the popular German art magazine of that name. In Austria and the neighboring countries then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a similar style emerged, called \"Secessionsstil\" in German, (, ) or \"Wiener Jugendstil\", after the artists of the Vienna Secession.\n\nThe style was called \"Modern\" (Модерн) in Russia and \"Nieuwe Kunst\" (new art) in the Netherlands. In Spain the related style was known as \"Modernismo\", \"Modernisme\" (in Catalan), \"Arte joven\" (\"young art\"); and in Portugal \"Arte nova\" (new art). \n\nSome names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the Art Nouveau artists: \"Stile Floreal\" (\"floral style\") in France; \"Paling Stijl\" (\"eel style\") in the Netherlands; and \"Wellenstil\" (\"wave style\") and \"Lilienstil\" (\"lily style\") in Germany.\n\nThe new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of William Morris, and in the Arts and Crafts movement founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the lavish Peacock Room by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painters, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including Selwyn Image, Heywood Sumner, Walter Crane, Alfred Gilbert, and especially Aubrey Beardsley.\n\nIn France, the style combined several different tendencies. In architecture, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, a declared enemy of the historical Beaux-Arts architectural style. In his 1872 book \"Entretiens sur l'architecture\", he wrote, \"use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament.\" This book influenced a generation of architects, including Louis Sullivan, Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, and Antoni Gaudí.\n\nThe French painters Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. \"I believe that before everything a painting must decorate\", Denis wrote in 1891. \"The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the colored surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions.\" These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.\n\nAnother important influence on the new style was Japonism: the wave of enthusiasm for Japanese woodblock printing, particularly the works of Hiroshige, Hokusai, and Utagawa Kunisada which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising Siegfried Bing founded a monthly journal, \"Le Japon artistique\" in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including Gustav Klimt. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain, jewelry, and furniture.\n\nNew technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and color lithographs, played an essential role in popularizing the new style. \"The Studio\" in England, \"Arts et idèes\" and \"Art et décoration\" in France, and \"Jugend\" in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. Aubrey Beardsley in England, and Eugène Grasset, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Félix Vallotton achieved international recognition as illustrators.\n\nWith the posters by Jules Cheret for dancer Loie Fuller in 1893, and by Alphonse Mucha for actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. Toulouse-Lautrec and other artists achieved international celebrity status.\n\nThe Franco-German art dealer and publisher Siegfried Bing played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize Japonism in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them Pierre Bonnard, Félix Vallotton, Édouard Vuillard, Toulouse-Lautrec and Eugène Grasset, which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the Société nationale des beaux-arts in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at 22 rue de Provence in Paris, the \"Maison de l'Art Nouveau\", devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect Henry Van de Velde, one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The \"Maison de l'Art Nouveau\" showed paintings by Georges Seurat, Paul Signac and Toulouse-Lautrec, glass from Louis Comfort Tiffany and Emile Gallé, jewelry by René Lalique, and posters by Aubrey Beardsley. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, \"Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies.\"\n\nThe first Art Nouveau houses, the Hôtel Tassel by Victor Horta and the Bloemenwerf house by Henry Van de Velde, were built in Brussels in 1893–1895. Both Horta and Van de Velde designed not only the houses, but also all of the interior decoration, furniture, carpets, and architectural details.\n\nHorta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element became the stairway, beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.\n\nVan de Velde was by training a designer, not an architect, and collaborated with an architect on the plan of the Bloemenwerf, the house that he built for himself. He was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly William Morris's Red House, and like them he designed all aspects of the building, including the furniture, wallpaper and carpets.\n\nAfter visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, Hector Guimard built the Castel Béranger, the first Paris building in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under Napoleon III by Georges-Eugène Haussmann. They welcomed Guimard's colorful and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new Paris Métro system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900 \"Exposition Universelle\".\n\nThe Paris 1900 \"Exposition universelle\" marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and Beaux-Arts architecture: the main exhibit hall, the Grand Palais had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.\n\nThe Exposition particularly highlighted French designers, who all made special works for the Exhibition: Lalique crystal and jewelry; jewelry by Henri Vever and Georges Fouquet; Daum glass; the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres in porcelain; ceramics by Alexandre Bigot; sculpted glass lamps and vases by Emile Gallé and Louis Comfort Tiffany, and Company from the United States; furniture by Édouard Colonna and Louis Majorelle; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms from around Europe and the world. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Siegfried Bing presented a pavilion called \" Art Nouveau Bing\", which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.\n\nWhile the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition marked the beginning of the Modernisme style in Spain, with some buildings of Lluís Domènech i Montaner. The \"Esposizione internazionale d'arte decorativa moderna\" of 1902 in Turin, Italy, showcased designers from across Europe.\n\nFollowing the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by Jules Lavirotte, who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the Lavirotte Building, at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including \"Maxim's\" at 3 rue Royale, and \"Le Train bleu\" at the Gare de Lyon (1900).\n\nThe city of Nancy in Lorraine became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the \"Alliance provinciale des industries d'art\", also known as the \"École de Nancy\", was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts. The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators Emile Gallé, the Daum brothers in glass design, and the designer Louis Majorelle, who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect Henri Sauvage brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his Villa Majorelle in 1898.\n\nThe French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including \"The Studio\", \"Arts et Idées\" and \"Art et Décoration\", whose photographs and color lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.\n\nIn France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion, virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these continue to be manufactured in the style today.\n\nBelgium was an early center of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of Victor Horta, who designed the first Art Nouveau houses, the Hôtel Tassel in 1893, and the Hôtel Solvay in 1894. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of the young Hector Guimard. Other important designers included architect Paul Hankar, who built an Art Nouveau house in 1893; the architect and furniture designer Henry van de Velde, the decorator Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, and the graphic artist Fernand Khnopff. Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of ivory imported from the Belgian Congo; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as Philippe Wolfers, was popular.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the style was known as the \"Nieuwe Kunst\", the New Art. Architects included Hendrik Petrus Berlage, who designed a more functional, rational variant, while Carel Adolph Lion Cachet, Theo Nieuwenhuis and Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof designed a more picturesque and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), while textiles were influenced by the designs and techniques of batik.\n\nProminent Swiss artists of the period included painter and graphic artist Théophile Steinlen, creator of the famous poster for the Paris cabaret \"Le Chat noir\", and the artist, sculptor and decorator Eugène Grasset, who moved from Switzerland to Paris where he designed graphics, furniture, tapestries, ceramics and posters. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (\"École normale d'enseignement du dessin\"), where his students included Augusto Giacometti and Paul Berthon.\n\nArt Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the arts and crafts movement of the 1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function and nature. One notable early example Arthur Mackmurdo's design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of Sir Christopher Wren, published in 1883.\n\nOther important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers Aubrey Beardsley whose drawings featured the curved lines which became the most recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing wrought iron from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included Walter Crane and Charles Ashbee.\n\nThe Liberty department store in London played an important role, through its colorful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewelry designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) Archibald Knox. His jewelry designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewelry design.\n\nFor Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important center in Britain was Glasgow, with the creations of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow School, whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the Glasgow School of Art (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the \"Glasgow Rose\".\n\nLéon-Victor Solon, made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in tube-lined vases marketed as \"secessionist ware\" (usually described as named after the Viennese art movement). Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the Leek silk industry and doublures for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under Lyme), who patented the \"Sutherland\" binding in 1895.\n\nThe Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the printing works of Edward Everard, features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of Johannes Gutenberg and William Morris, both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the \"Spirit of Light\", while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.\n\nGerman Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, \"Jugendstil\". The name is taken from the artistic journal, \"Die Jugend\", which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: \"Jugendstil\" (\"youth style\"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like \"Jugend\", \"Pan\", and \"Simplicissimus\", it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt (Mathildenhöhe).\n\nTwo other journals, \"Simplicissimus\", published in Munich, and \"Pan\", published in Berlin, proved to be important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of \"Jugendstil\", especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters. Designers often used unique display typefaces that worked harmoniously with the image.\n\nOne of the most famous German artists associated with both \"Die Jugend\" and \"Pan\" was Otto Eckmann. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the leitmotif for the Jugendstil.\n\nOne of the most prominent German designers in the style was Richard Riemerschmid, who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.\n\nVienna became the center of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the Vienna Secession, an art movement that was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists which included Gustav Klimt, Koloman Moser, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Max Kurzweil, and Otto Wagner. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward historicism expressed by Vienna Künstlerhaus, the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, \"Ver Sacrum\", to promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the \"Jugendstil\" in neighboring Germany. The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists. The architectural style of the Vienna Secession had an influence well beyond the city. Buildings in the style appeared in the other major cities of the Empire and beyond; one of the most famous examples is the Stoclet Palace built by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels in 1905–11. The interior is entirely decorated in Secession style, including notable paintings by Gustav Klimt.\n\nKlimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. Koloman Moser was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, furniture, and more. He often worked in collaboration with Hoffmann and Klimt; the three together created the interiors, furnishing and even clothing to be worn in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. In 1903, he and Hoffmann founded the Wiener Werkstätte, a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects.\n\nIn the capitals of Central Europe, then ruled by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Vienna, national forms of Art Nouveau are quick to appear, and often took on historical or folkloric elements. The furniture designs of Ödön Faragó in Budapest (Hungary) combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. Pál Horti, another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.\n\nPrague, in the Czech Republic, has a notable collection of Art Nouveau architecture, including the \"Hotel Central\" and the Jubilee Synagogue, built in 1908.\n\nThe style of combining Art Nouveau and national architectural elements was typical also for a Slovak architect Dušan Jurkovič who was under the influence of Hungarian Art Nouveau. His most original works are the Cultural House in Skalica in Slovakia (1905), buildings of spa in Luhačovice in the Czech Republic (1901–1903) and 35 war cemeteries near Nowy Żmigród in Galicia (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko (Rusyn) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917). Another example of Secession architecture in Slovakia is the Church of St. Elisabeth (The Little Blue Church) in Bratislava.\n\nItaly's \"Stile Liberty\" took its name from the British department store Liberty, the colorful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers included Galileo Chini, whose ceramics were inspired both by majolica patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas \"Gianni Schicchi\" and \"Turandot\".\n\nThe Teatro Massimo in Palermo, by the architect Ernesto Basile, is an example of the Italian variant of the style, architectural style, which combined Art Nouveau and classical elements.\n\nThe most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was Carlo Bugatti, the son of an architect and sculptor, and brother of the famous automobile designer. He studied at the Milanese Academy of Brera, and later the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.\n\nIn Spain, a highly original variant of the style, Catalan \"Modernisme\", appeared in Barcelona. Its most famous creator was Antoni Gaudí, who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very novel way in \"Palau Güell\" (1886). His designs from about 1903, the \"Casa Batlló\" (1904–1906) and \"Casa Milà\" (1906–1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau. However, famous structures such as the \"Sagrada Família\" characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist Neo-Gothic. Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the Castell dels Tres Dragons (1888), Palau de la Música Catalana and Casa Lleó Morera (1905). Another major modernista was Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who designed the Casa Martí and its Quatre Gats café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the CaixaFòrum art museum), Casa Macaya, Casa Amatller, the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa de les Punxes (\"House of Spikes\"). Also well-known is Josep Maria Jujol, with houses in Sant Joan Despí (1913–1926), several churches near Tarragona (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in Barcelona. A few other major architects working outside of Barcelona were Lluís Muncunill i Parellada, with a magnificent textile factory in Terrassa (Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover, now the Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia – Museu de la Ciència i de la Tècnica de Catalunya) and a \"farmhouse\"/small manor house called Masia Freixa in the same city; and Cèsar Martinell i Brunet, with his spectacular \"wine cathedrals\", housing town cooperative wineries throughout southern and central Catalonia. A Valencian architect who worked in Catalonia before emigrating to the States was Rafael Guastavino. Attributed to him is the Asland Cement Factory in Castellar de n'Hug, among other buildings.\n\nThe Catalan furniture designer Gaspar Homar (1870–1953), influenced by Antoni Gaudí, often combining marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings. Examples of Art Nouveau (\"Arte nova\"), based largely on the French model, appeared in Portugal in Porto and Aveiro. A notable example is the 'Livraria Lello' bookstore in Porto, designed by Xavier Esteves (1906).\n\nArt Nouveau was popular in the Nordic countries, where it was usually known as Jugendstil, and was often combined with the National Romantic Style of each country. In Norway the Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by Viking folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and Celtic patterns, and Gerhard Munthe, who designed a chair with a stylized dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics. Other examples include the Skien Church (1887–1894) and Fagerborg Church in Kristiania (Oslo) (1900–1903).\n\nIn Finland, good examples are the Helsinki Central railway station, designed by Eliel Saarinen, father of the famous American modernist architect Eero Saarinen. Examples of the style include the Finnish National Theatre, Kallio Church, the Finnish National Museum, and Tampere Cathedral. In contrast to the very elaborate furniture of the Norwegian Art Nouveau, Finnish Art Deco was extremely simple and functional, as in the chairs designed by Eliel Saarinen (1907-1908).\n\nA very colorful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and Saint Petersburg in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, \"Мир искусства\" (transliteration: \"Mir Iskusstva\") (\"The World of Art\"), by Russian artists Alexandre Benois and Léon Bakst, and chief editor Sergei Diaghilev. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including Mikhail Vrubel, Konstantin Somov, Isaac Levitan, and the book illustrator Ivan Bilibin. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colors and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the \"World of Art\" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new ballet company, the \"Ballets Russes\", headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colorful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, \"L'Illustration\", \"La Vie parisienne\" and \"Gazette du bon ton\", and the Russian style became known in Paris as \"à la Bakst\". The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the Russian Revolution in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.\n\nMoscow and Saint Petersburg have several prominent Art Nouveau buildings constructed in the last years before the Revolution; notably the Hotel Metropol in Moscow, which features a ceramic mural on the façade, \"The Princess of Dreams\", by scenic designer Mikhail Vrubel; and the Vitebsk Railway Station in Saint Petersburg (1904)\n\nIn the United States, the firm of Louis Comfort Tiffany played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the National Academy of Design in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its coloring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and coloring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of color In 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of Thomas Edison, he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicolored glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewelry. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the \"1900 Exposition Universelle\" in Paris; his stained glass window called the \"Flight of Souls\" won a gold medal.\n\nAnother important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect Louis Sullivan, best known as the architect of some of the first American iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned \"White City\", he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida.\n\nAlthough Art Nouveau acquired distinctly localised tendencies as its geographic spread increased, some general characteristics are indicative of the form. A description published in \"Pan\" magazine of Hermann Obrist's wall hanging \"Cyclamen\" (1894) described it as \"sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip\", which became well known during the early spread of Art Nouveau. Subsequently, not only did the work itself become better known as \"The Whiplash\" but the term \"whiplash\" is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists. Such decorative \"whiplash\" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.\n\nThe origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the artist William Morris to the cluttered compositions and the revival tendencies of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the Arts and crafts movement. Arthur Mackmurdo's book-cover for \"Wren's City Churches\" (1883), with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first realisation of Art Nouveau. About the same time, the flat perspective and strong colors of Japanese wood block prints, especially those of Katsushika Hokusai, had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau. The \"Japonisme\" that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references to the natural world. Besides being adopted by artists like Emile Gallé and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Japanese-inspired art and design was championed by the businessmen Siegfried Bing and Arthur Lasenby Liberty at their stores in Paris and London, respectively. \nIn architecture, hyperbolas and parabolas in windows, arches, and doors are common, and decorative mouldings 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the structure.\n\nArt Nouveau in architecture and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival styles of the 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' some of the more abstract elements of Rococo style, such as flame and shell textures, they also advocated the use of very stylised organic forms as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use seaweed, grasses, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century auricular style, best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.\n\nAs an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the Pre-Raphaelites and the Symbolist styles, and artists like Aubrey Beardsley, Alphonse Mucha, Edward Burne-Jones, Gustav Klimt and Jan Toorop could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the artisan-oriented Arts and Crafts Movement, Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and abstraction in the service of pure design.\n\nArt Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as Auguste Rodin.\n\nArt Nouveau architecture made use of many technological innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.\nArt Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In Denmark, for example, it was one aspect of \"Skønvirke\" (\"aesthetic work\"), which itself more closely relates to the Arts and Crafts style. Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the \"Młoda Polska\" (\"Young Poland\") style in Poland. \"Młoda Polska\", however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.\n\nThe graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly color lithography which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.\n\nIn Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was Aubrey Beardsley (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", then black and white illustrations for Salome by Oscar Wilde (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine \"The Studio\", which helped publicize European artists such as Fernand Khnopff in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text. \n\nThe Swiss-French artist Eugène Grasset (1845-1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret Le Chat noir in 1885 and made his first posters for the \"Fêtes de Paris\". He made a celebrated posters of Sarah Bernhardt in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers Jules Chéret, Georges de Feure and the painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The Czech artist Alphonse Mucha (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play \"Gismonda\" by Victorien Sardou. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewelry for the actress. Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure. He went on to design products, from jewelry to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style. \n\nIn Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was Koloman Moser (1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffmann, and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, \"Ver Sacrum\", as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.\n\nPainting was another important domain of Art Nouveau, though most Art Nouveau painters were also associated with other art movements, particularly the Nabis in France and the Symbolists in France and Austria. In 1892, Siegfried Bing organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven painters, including Pierre Bonnard, Édouard Vuillard, Félix Vallotton, and Maurice Denis; and his \"Maison de l'Art Nouveau\" exhibited paintings by Georges Seurat, Paul Signac, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Eugène Grasset, Koloman Moser and Gustav Klimt moved comfortably in the avant-garde and Art Nouveau. In Belgium, Fernand Khnopff worked in both painting and graphic design. Paintings by Gustav Klimt were an integral part of he decorative scheme of Josef Hoffmann for the Palais Stoclet. One common theme of both symbolist and Art Nouveau painters of the period was the stylized depiction of women. One popular subject was the American dancer Loie Fuller, portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.\n\nGlass art was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which permitted production in series. The city of Nancy became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of Emile Gallé and the Daum studio, led by Auguste and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including Ernest Bussière, Henri Bergé, and Amalric Walter. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer Louis Majorelle, whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the Villa Majorelle and other houses.\n\nIn Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of Val Saint Lambert, which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by Philippe Wolfers. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of symbolist glass, often with metal decoration attached. In Bohemia, then a region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire noted for crystal manufacture, the companies Lobmeyr and Loetz-Witwe also experimented with new coloring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colors. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.\n\nIn Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; Otto Prutscher was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement.\n\nIn Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh for the architectural display called \"The House of an Art Lover.\"\n\nIn the United States, Louis Comfort Tiffany and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of coloring glass, patenting in 1894 the process Favrile glass, which used metallic oxides to color the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the Tiffany lamp in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by Siegfried Bing, and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, Steuben Glass, was founded in 1903 in Corning, NY, by Frederick Carder, who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colors. Another notable American glass artist was John La Farge, who created intricate and colorful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.\n\nThe 19th-century architectural theorist Viollet-le-Duc had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects Victor Horta and Hector Guimard went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.\n\nIn the United States, the designer George Grant Elmslie made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect Louis Sullivan.\n\nWhile French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, Joseph Maria Olbrich and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.\n\nArt Nouveau is characterized done by soft, curved shapes and lines, and usually features natural designs such as flowers, birds and other animals. The female body is a popular theme and is featured on a variety of jewelry pieces, especially cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of amethyst, peridot, or citrine.\n\nThe Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewelry industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewelry had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewelers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including agate, garnet opal, moonstone, aquamarine and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others enameling, and new materials, including horn, molded glass, and ivory.\n\nEarly notable Paris jewelers in the Art Nouveau style included Louis Aucoc, whose family jewelry firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, René Lalique, served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewelry and glass, using nature, from dragonflies to grasses, as his model. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as Paul Follot, best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included Jules Brateau and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was Louis Comfort Tiffany, whose work was shown at the shop of Siegfried Bing and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition.\n\nIn Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty & Co. designer Archibald Knox, who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. C. R. Ashbee designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile Glasgow designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the center for \"Jugendstil\" jewelry was the city of Pforzheim, where most of the German firms, including Theodor Fahrner, were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.\n\nArt Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.\n\nThe style first appeared in Brussels' Hôtel Tassel (1894) and Hôtel Solvay (1900) of Victor Horta. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by Hector Guimard, who used the same style in his first major work, the Castel Béranger (1897–98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new Paris Métro, which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.\n\nIn Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building facades by Georges-Eugène Haussmann, the prefect of Paris under Napoleon III. Bow windows were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of Jules Lavirotte, which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighborhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of Nancy, around the Villa Majorelle (1901–02), the residence of furniture designer Louis Majorelle. It was designed by Henri Sauvage as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.\n\nFurniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings; the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.\n\nIn France, the center for furniture design and manufacture was in Nancy, where two major designers, Émile Gallé and Louis Majorelle had their studios and workshops, and where the \"Alliance des industries d'art\" (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of marquetry in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included Eugène Vallin and Émile André; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other notable French designers included Henri Bellery-Desfontaines, who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of Viollet-le-Duc; and Georges de Feure, Eugène Gaillard, and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer Siegfried Bing to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for \"abstract naturalism\", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its rococo influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was François-Rupert Carabin, a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with Symbolism. Other influential Paris furniture designers were Charles Plumet, and Alexandre Charpentier. In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century Rococo furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.\n\nIn Belgium, the pioneer architects of the \"Art Nouveau movement\", Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde, designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration. The Belgian designer Gustave Serrurier-Bovy added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called \"Nieuwe Kunst\" or New Art, H.P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English Arts and Crafts movement, with more geometric rational forms.\n\nIn Britain, the furniture of Charles Rennie Mackintosh was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration. Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of Peter Behrens and the Jugendstil was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the Wiener Werkstätte in Vienna, led by Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Josef Maria Olbrich and Koloman Moser. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the Biedemeier style.\nItalian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. Carlo Bugatti in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of Antoni Gaudi and the \"Modernismo\" movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.\n\nIn the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was Charles Rohlfs in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of Celtic Art and Gothic art, with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.\n\nThe last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (\"grand feu\") porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional \"grés\" methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, Jules Lavirotte and Hector Guimard among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of Alexandre Bigot, giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.\n\nOne of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was Ernest Chaplet, whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter Paul Gauguin on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors Félix Bracquemond, Jules Dalou and Auguste Rodin. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.\n\nThe major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres outside Paris; Nymphenburg, Meissen, Villeroy & Boch in Germany, and Doulton in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included Taxile Doat, , Edmond Lachenal, and Auguste Delaherche.\n\nIn France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine \"Dancer with a Scarf\" by Agathon Léonard, made for the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres, won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.\n\nThe Zsolnay factory in Pécs, Hungary, was led by Miklós Zsolnay (1800–1880) and his son, Vilmos Zsolnay (1828–1900,) with Tádé Sikorski (1852–1940) chief designer, to produce stoneware and other ceramics in 1853. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of eosin. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a \"Grand Prix\". Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.\n\nTextiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs oWilliam Morris had helped launch the Arts and Crafts Movement and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the Liberty department store in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the Silver Studio, which provided colorful stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from Glasgow School, and Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the \"Rose of Glasgow\".\n\nIn France, a major contribution was made by designer Eugène Grasset who in 1896 published \"La Plante et ses applications ornamentales\", suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer Hermann Obrist specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the \"whiplash\" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian Henry van de Velde presented a textile work, \"La Veillée d'Anges\", at the Salon \"La Libre Esthéthique\" in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of Paul Gauguin and of the Nabis. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by batik patterns from the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of Gerhard Munthe and Frida Hansen in Norway. The \"Five Swans\" design of Otto Eckmann appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer János Vaszary combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On the north side facing Blackwell Street, there are recessed brick panels, granite lintels and window sills, and a granite panel reading \"Baker Building.\" A Mail Pouch Tobacco sign covers the south side of the building.\n\nThe \"Opera House\" was built by William Henry Baker as a vaudeville theater. The grand opening was on April 5, 1886 with the Alfa Norman English Opera Company performing \"The Bobetuian Girl\". On April 6 the same company performed \"The Mikado\". Tickets cost $1.00 to $1.50. Later fare included other Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas, magic shows and minstrel shows featuring Arthur Deming. In 1906 the theater was thoroughly reconstructed and started showing silent films along with vaudeville performances after it reopened on December 5, 1906.\n\nThe renovation cost $75,000 and included many plaster ornaments and friezes. Movies started at 7 P.M. with five vaudeville acts started at 8 P.M. with both shows accompanied by a seven piece orchestra. After W. H. Baker died in 1910 his son Henry O. Baker took over the business closing it for another reconstruction and fireproofing in 1924. It reopened with 1,600 seats on December 22, 1924. Stanley Fabian later took over the theater, which showed its first talking picture, \"On Trial\" on March 18, 1929.\n\nStars who have visited the theater or appeared on the stage include Al St. John, Buster Keaton, Pearl White, DeWolf Hopper, Helen Hayes, Lillian Russell, Ethel Barrymore and Abbott and Costello.\n\nThe building was nearly demolished in 1977 before its purchase by the Morris County Trust for Historic Preservation. It was then listed on the New Jersey registry of historic sites and in 1981 on the National Register of Historic Places.\n"}

Its establishment was encouraged by Alsager's \"Queen Square Select Society\" and John Ella's \"Musical Union\". The Beethoven Quartet Society was based at the \"Beethoven Rooms\" at 76 Harley Street, London. Concerts were given under the title \"Honour to Beethoven\", and included works by other composers. One of its express aims was to study the late quartets from score. After Alsager's death in 1846 French cellist Scipion Rousselot directed the society. Violist Henry Hill (1837–1856) undertook writing the programme notes.\n\nThe society were the first to present a performance of the complete cycle of the Beethoven string quartets, running from April 21, 1845 and June 16, 1845, with Camillo Sivori, Prosper Sainton, Henry Hill and Scipion Rousselot.\n\nOther musicians, who played at the society's concerts, include Joseph Joachim, Henryk Wieniawski (both as violinist and violist), Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst, Alfredo Piatti, Louis Ries, William Sterndale Bennett and Ludwig Strauss.\n\nOne particular line-up during the 1850s was noted by Joachim's biographer Andreas Moser with Joachim and Ernst playing the violin, Wieniawski the viola, and Piatti the cello. This, however, is highly unlikely since Wieniawski first visited England in 1859 and Ernst's last stay dates from 1858 or even 1856.\n\nHector Berlioz attended at least one of the society's concerts at the \"New Beethoven Room\" (at the building at 27 Queen Anne Street, where Berlioz lived) and this made enough of an impression to mention it in his book \"Evenings with the Orchestra\".\n\n\n"}

The film was directed and produced by Lisa Immordino Vreeland (Diana’s granddaughter-in-law), Bent-Jorgen Perlmutt, and Frédéric Tcheng. It premiered at the 2011 Venice International Film Festival and the Telluride Film Festival. It has a total running time of 86 minutes, and can be seen with English, French, and Italian subtitles.\n\nThe film features recorded audio and filmed interviews of Vreeland, as well as interviews with colleagues, family, and friends of Vreeland. Beginning with an exploration of Vreeland’s childhood, the film offers a glimpse of fashionable Paris during the Belle Époque, a time when Vreeland had access to exciting and influential friends of her parents, such as ballet dancer Sergei Diaghilev. She even claimed to have ridden with Buffalo Bill Cody, though the documentary makes it clear that Vreeland would occasionally exaggerate for the sake of storytelling. \n\nThe film then focuses on Diana’s move to New York City in the 1920s, where she was inspired by the dancing, jazz, and new fashions of the time, and her subsequent move to London with her husband, Reed Vreeland. Here she opened a lingerie shop, thus beginning her career in fashion. Shortly after moving back to New York when war broke out in Europe, Vreeland was asked to do a column in \"Harper’s Bazaar\" called “Why Don’t You…?” She quickly became the magazine’s fashion editor and, as such, revolutionized fashion by doing such acts as popularizing the blue jean and the bikini.\n\nMuch of the documentary looks at Vreeland’s time at \"Vogue\", where she began working after nearly two-and-a-half decades at \"Harper’s Bazaar\". Vreeland quickly became the editor-in-chief at \"Vogue\", making the magazine into a much-loved artistic publication. The documentary features several accounts from people who worked with Vreeland during this time, including models, photographers, and fellow editors, discussing Vreeland’s drive and her vision for the magazine.\n\nThe film ends with Vreeland’s time as a consultant for the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which she became after being asked to leave Vogue in 1971, and final recollections of Vreeland and her fashion legacy.\n\nThe film has received positive critical review.\nJohn DeFore of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" claims, “The vibrant, entertaining and of course stylish doc should enjoy a nice arthouse run before becoming an essential presence on the DVD shelves of fashionistas everywhere.”\n\nWriting for \"Variety\", Jay Weissberg says, “Few names conjure ‘style’ with the zest of Diana Vreeland, and documentary \"The Eye Has to Travel\" gets the zing just right.”\n\nCurrently, the film has a rating of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 63 reviews and an average score of 7.2/10.\n\n"}

The name may derive from the fox-like reddish-brown color of the stains, or the rust chemical ferric oxide which may be involved. Paper so affected is said to be \"foxed\".\n\nAlthough unsightly and a negative factor in the value of the paper item for collectors, foxing does not affect the actual integrity of the paper.\n\nFoxing also occurs in biological study skins or specimens, as an effect of chemical reactions or mold on melanin.\n\nAside from foxing, other types of age-related paper deterioration include destruction of the lignin by sunlight and absorbed atmospheric pollution, typically causing the paper to go brown and crumble at the edges, and acid-related damage to cheap paper such as newsprint, which is manufactured without neutralizing acidic contaminants.\n\nThe causes of foxing are not well understood. One theory is that foxing is caused by a fungal growth on the paper. Another theory is that foxing is caused by the effect on certain papers of the oxidation of iron, copper, or other substances in the pulp or rag from which the paper was made. It is possible that multiple factors are involved. High humidity may contribute to foxing.\n\nFoxed documents can be repaired, with greater or lesser success, using sodium borohydride, or proprietary bleaches, dilute hydrogen peroxide or lasers. Each method risks side effects or damage to the paper or ink. \n\nAnother method is to scan the image and process that image using a high-level image processing program. This can usually remove the effects of foxing while leaving text and images intact.\n\nIt is generally not advisable to repair study specimens, except perhaps for mechanical damage. Type specimens should – if at all possible – not be altered in any way. If foxing affects the study value of a specimen (e.g. in bird or mammal skins or in insects, where it might affect diagnostic coloration), this might rather be remarked on the specimen label. Color standards can provide a means of documenting coloration before or in the early stages of foxing.\n\n\n\n"}

She is known for her roles as Kimberly Brock in the CBS series \"Picket Fences\" (1992–1996), Piper Halliwell in The WB series \"Charmed\" (1998–2006) and Ella Montgomery in the Freeform series \"Pretty Little Liars\" (2010–2017).\n\nCombs was born in San Diego, California and has described herself as being of Irish descent. At the time of her birth, her mother, Lauralei Combs (née Berckhem), was 16 years old, and her father was 17. Combs's biological parents married, but the two split up after two years, feeling they were too young to make a marriage work. \n\nWhile Combs was learning to walk, she fell and hit her head on a marble table, resulting in a noticeable 'split' at the top of her right eyebrow. She lived in many different homes with her mother, near the beach in San Diego, often having very little privacy, while her mother attempted to pursue an acting career. When Combs was 7, she and her mother moved to New York City where she spent most of her growing years. Combs was 12 when her mother married her stepfather. In New York City, Combs attended Beekman Hill Elementary and then the Professional Children's School. In an interview when she was in Sydney, Australia, for Supanova Expo, she said that she was a certified scuba diver at 13.\n\nWhen she was 14 years old, Combs landed her first major role in \"Sweet Hearts Dance\" (1988), a comedy drama film directed by Robert Greenwald. She played Debs Boon, the daughter of Wiley Boon (played by Don Johnson) and Sandra Boon (played by Susan Sarandon). Her next major role was in Oliver Stone's \"Born on the Fourth of July\" (1989), a film adaptation of the best selling autobiography of the same name by Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic. Combs portrayed Jenny in the film, which also starred Tom Cruise. Her other roles included Helena in the 1989 anthology film \"New York Stories\", and Kim Fields in Hal Hartley's \"Simple Men\" (1992). Also in 1992, Combs made an appearance in Temístocles López's \"Chain of Desire\" as Diana, and in the slasher film \"Dr. Giggles\", in which she played Jennifer Campbell, the 19-year-old daughter of Tom Campbell (played by Cliff De Young) and girlfriend of Max Anderson (played by Glenn Quinn).\n\nCombs's first major breakthrough as an actress came at the age of 18, in the CBS television series \"Picket Fences\". She portrayed Kimberly Brock, the daughter of Sheriff Jimmy Brock (played by Tom Skerritt) and his first wife Lydia for the show's four seasons (1992–96). Jimmy's second wife, Dr. Jill Brock (played by Kathy Baker), was her stepmother. Combs auditioned for the role in New York. The casting agent told her that she wasn't right for the part because she \"didn't have a big enough heart.\" Combs retorted, \"If you're looking for someone with a big heart, what the hell are you doing in New York?\". She was later called back and offered the job. Combs won a Young Artist Award for her performance on the show. During 1996, Combs starred as Sophie DiMatteo in \"Sins of Silence\", a drama/horror television film directed by Sam Pillsbury. The following year, Combs portrayed real-life convicted murderer Diane Zamora in the television film \"Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder\", and appeared in the fact-based drama film \"Daughters\" as Alex Morell, one of the two daughters of a murdered heiress.\n\nIn 1998, Combs landed a lead role in The WB television series \"Charmed\", in which she portrayed Piper Halliwell, the middle of three sisters who are witches. Following Shannen Doherty's departure after season three (2000–01), Combs's character became the eldest sister for the remaining five seasons of the show. Combs also became a producer for \"Charmed\" from season five onwards. The series ended its eight-season run on May 21, 2006. In 2007 and 2008, AOL named Combs's character Piper the third greatest witch in television history. Combs was the only cast member to appear in every episode of the series, including the original unaired pilot.\n\nDuring \"Charmed\", Combs made a cameo appearance in Steven Soderbergh's \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001), and starred opposite Charisma Carpenter in the romantic comedy film \"See Jane Date\" (2003), portraying the role of \"a struggling actress whose career benefits from an affair with an A-list actor.\" In 2007, she starred in the Lifetime television film \"Point of Entry\" (also titled \"Panic Button\") as Kathy Alden, a wife and mother of a single child whose family moves to a \"beautiful and supposedly secure gated community after she's the victim of a violent house break-in.\" The following year, Combs signed a contract with Lifetime to produce and star in a series \"Mistresses\", based on the British series of the same name. However, that version of the show never made it to air. (ABC later made a version featuring Combs's former \"Charmed\" co-star Alyssa Milano.) In 2010, Combs was cast in the Freeform series \"Pretty Little Liars\" as Ella Montgomery, the mother of one of the main characters, Aria Montgomery (played by Lucy Hale). Combs was a series regular for the first three seasons, but became credited as a special guest star from season four onwards. \"Pretty Little Liars\" ended after seven seasons, and Combs returned for the show's final episode on June 27, 2017.\n\nCombs and Doherty starred in their own road trip reality show \"Off the Map with Shannen & Holly\", which premiered on Great American Country on January 2, 2015.

It may be more or less clearly distinguished from \"hymnody\", the creation and practice of such song. Hymnologists, such as Erik Routley, may study the history and origins of hymns and of traditions of sung worship, the biographies of the women and men who have written hymns that have passed into choral or congregational use, the interrelationships between text and tune, the historical processes, both folk and redactional, that have changed hymn texts and hymn tunes over time, and the sociopolitical, theological and aesthetic arguments concerning various styles of sung worship.\n\nHymnology is sometimes more strictly construed, as in \"A Dictionary of Hymnology\", edited by John D. Julian, which concerns itself very largely with the history, textual changes, and translations of hymns, and with the biographies of hymnographers, and very little with the poetic metres of these hymns, or with the hymn tunes to which these are sung. \n\n\n"}

Braunstein from a screenplay by Daniel Gilboy. It is the third installment in the series. Sarah Butler reprises her role as Jennifer Hills from the 2010 film \"I Spit on Your Grave\". \n\nThe film follows the life of Jennifer Hills, continuing her story from \"I Spit on Your Grave\". After Jennifer survived her assault and exacted revenge on the men who raped her, she avoided conviction for her killing spree and settled in Los Angeles. She is no longer an aspiring writer and now devotes herself between working as an assault hotline operator and going to group counseling under the assumed name Angela Jitrenka. She is also periodically shown attending personal therapy for her ordeal. Jennifer's scarring experience has left her highly distrustful and defensive towards most men, including her colleague Matthew, who has a seemingly genuine interest in her.\n\nWhile in group counseling, Jennifer develops a bond with one of the girls in the group, Marla, who also does not trust men. The duo began their own personal crusade, by exacting poetic justice for victims of sexual assault. However, just as Jennifer begins to enjoy life, Marla dies under mysterious circumstances and no one is found guilty of her death. She becomes acquainted with Detective McDylan, an investigator to Marla's death who, however, fails to bring justice for Marla nor closure for Jennifer. Distraught and enraged at how the law could not help Marla nor the rape victims in her support group, she decides to get revenge for them.\n\nOne by one, Jennifer stalks and lures the unpunished rapists to a private place to torture and kill them. Her first victim is Marla's estranged boyfriend and alleged murderer, soon followed by the stepfather of a teenage member of the group. After befriending Oscar, the only male member of the support group who lost his daughter to suicide after a sexual assault, Jennifer tracks down his daughter's rapist. The man manages to overpower her as she tries to attack him, until he is shot dead by the police, whose attention Jennifer had been drawing through her actions. The police take Jennifer in for questioning, revealing their knowledge of her real identity in an attempt to obtain a confession. However Oscar, who had grown sympathetic to Jennifer's cause, walks into the police station after slashing his own arms, and publicly admits to the murders before dying from his wounds.\n\nNo longer the prime suspect, Jennifer is released but stays under police watch as a person of interest. She has a nervous breakdown, becoming further disillusioned with society and no longer able to discern well-meaning men from sexual predators. Clad in a suggestive red dress in order to bait men, Jennifer leaves her home, evading the police watch. First she unsuccessfully attacks Matthew and scares him away, then she tries to lure a local thug who had been harassing her. As Jennifer is about to kill him, she is shot and arrested by McDylan, who had been trailing her the whole time.\n\nIt is now revealed Jennifer's personal therapy sessions were part of her mandatory treatment following a two-year sentence for attempted murder, lacking evidence of the murders she actually committed. After completing the final session before her release, Jennifer leaves the doctor's office and switches the \"therapist\" sign on the door to read \"the rapist\". She then imagines being attacked by two inmates, who she kills, before killing her therapist who had left the room to stop it, revealing that her fantasies of killing are not over. The film ends as she walks down the hallway smiling.\n\n\nThe film opened in Russia and Ukraine on October 1, 2015. Russia debuted the movie at the number 11 with a total of $44,021 from 81 screens. Ukraine fared better with a fifth place opening and a weekend total of $18,603 from 48 screens. After a three-week run in Russia and Ukraine, the cumulative totals are $111,089 and $33,331 respectively\n\n"}

{"id": "28038104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28038104", "title": "Kerman carpet", "text": "Kerman carpet\n\nKerman carpets (sometimes \"Kirman\") are one of the traditional classifications of Persian carpets. Kerman is both a city and a province located in south central Iran, though the term sometimes describes a type which may have been made elsewhere.\nKerman rugs are prized for a wide range of designs, a broad palette, use of natural dyes and fibers, great tensile strength and abrasion resistance, and expert color combinations. Typical manufacturing used an asymmetrical knot on cotton foundation, but rare examples include silk or part silk piles, or silk foundations with wool pile.\n\nBecause of the tremendous demand for rugs produced in Kerman and the complex demographics of this demand, a surprising variety of styles and designs were produced. Some Kerman rugs were woven explicitly for monied buyers from the West, some for local consumers with very different tastes.\n\nDamask Rose is the most popular motif in Kerman rug designs, particularly in \"Sabzikar Ravar\" and \"Gol Sorkhi\" (Red Rose) rugs. \nOther well-known motifs are \"Ghab Ghora'ani\", \"Setooni\", \"Ghabi\", \"Kheshti\", \"Saraam Atiyeh\", \"Jangali\", \"Shekargah\" and \"Lachak-Toranj\". Kerman antique carpets often use the Toranj motif border of margins and narrow lines. Floral patterns woven into Kerman carpets in the 19th century are derived from the patterns of Kerman shawls, also made in Kerman at this time. \n\nA distinct variation of Kerman carpets is the Lavar or Ravar Kerman. These carpets were produced in Ravar village next to Kerman city in the northern region and are known particularly for their fine weave and elegant, classically derived design of allover and central medallion formats. Most Ravar or Lavar Kerman carpets include a signature, either that of the weaver or the person for whom the carpet was woven. \n\nVase carpets, a type of Kerman rug distinctive of the 16th and 17th centuries, are characterized by an allover pattern of stylized flowers and oversized palmettes with vases placed throughout the field.\n\nKerman carpets of the 18th century and later very often use \"lattice\" patterns, with the central field divided by a lattice design giving many small compartments. A notable illustration is a carpet having belonged to William Morris, now on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Later all sorts of designs were made in Kerman, including large figurative ones. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London has a carpet of 1909 with a design copying a painting by the 18th century French artist Antoine Watteau. \n\nModern Kerman rugs, made for western markets, are often woven in gentle and light colors such as amber, pink, and blue-gray. They may employ western patterns, such as stripes and various repetitive motifs, as well as more traditional vase and garden themes, animal shapes, and pictorial designs. \n\nMay Beattie has defined seven classes of Kerman carpets and identified a unique structure she called the \"Vase technique\" characterised by three shoots of weft between rows of knots. The first and third are typically woolen and at high tension, while the second one, at low tension, is normally made of silk or cotton. Warps are markedly displaced and the Persian knot is open to the left. This technique distinguishes Kerman carpets from both the Safavid (1501-1722) and subsequent (1722-1834) periods. Most Persian carpets, in contrast, used the \"Turkish knot\". \nThe dye process for Kerman carpets took place while the wool was still in flock and before spinning, allowing for uniform color. The palette for Kerman carpets is as brilliant as it is varied. Tones can range from ivory, blue and magenta to a more golden and saffron cast.\n\nKerman has been a major center for the production of high quality carpets since at least the 15th century. \n\nBy the 17th century Kerman's designers were at their most inventive and their weaving techniques of a sophistication not seen in other parts of the Persian empire. For instance, the weavers had learned to set their looms so that the cotton warps were on two different levels. They then threaded the wool wefts, leaving some tight and others sinuous, giving an immediately recognisable wavy finish to the surface of the carpet\n\nIn the 18th century some authors considered the carpets from the province, especially at Siftan, to be the finest of all Persian carpets, partly because of the high quality of the wool from the region, known as Carmania wool. \nNader Shah, Naser al-Din Shah commissioned carpets from Kerman. in the 18th century.\n\nBy the 19th century, the city of Kerman had a long history of urban workshops, very fine wool, master weavers and a reputation for the artistic superiority of its designs. \n\nPersian carpet\n\n"}

Previously located at 465 Bd. Preah Monawang, it is currently located at Oknha Suor Srun (St. 7), Wat Botum, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. \n\nThe organization encourages and promotes writing while offering training programs and competitions. Its authors try to promote a new direction to literature, introducing new themes, such as the abandonment of morality incompatible with modern life; developing new genres, such as \"theatre nouveau\"; and providing translations, such as \"The Arabian Nights\", as part of a \"didactic and diverse\" genre. According to Smyth, the establishment of the KWA helped complete the \"institutionalization of Khmer literature\" as, through the 1960s, it became the vehicle for writing and publishing textbooks on Khmer literature and literary criticism. In the 2000s, the organization's focus has shifted; it provides training programs for writing poetry and film screenplays.\n\nRim Kin (1911–1959), the author of the first modern prose published novel in Cambodia, was president from 1955 until 1957. Only one of the organization's ten founding members was a woman, Suy Hieng. Sam Thang and Hell Sumphea served as subsequent presidents. In the late 1950s, Ly Theam Teng, the association's secretary, established an agreement to send their bi-monthly publication, \"Ecrivains Khmers\" (\"Khmer Writers\") to the Library of Congress. \n\nIn 1970, according to its president Trinh Hoanh, there were 178 members representing most of the Cambodian writers. Hoanh was still president in the mid-1970s. Destroyed under Democratic Kampuchea, the association was re-established in 1993 by two former members, You Bo and Sou Chamran, with King Norodom Sihanouk serving as honorary president. Bo served as president from 1994–96, Chey Chap succeeded him, and Bo became president again in 1998.\n\nStarting in 1995, the KWA organised the annual Khmer Literature Festival. It also staged competitions for novel and poetry writing, and gave out two awards: the Preah Sihanouk Reach Award and the 7 January Award. The topic of the PSRA competition was national unification and peace, while the topic of the January competition was national development. Lacking funds, the festival and awards did not continue after 2000.\n\nAs of 2002, there were 192 members with approximately half being professional writers.\n\nPal Vannariraks, a female Cambodian writer of social and sentimental novels, won first prize in the 1989 Seven January literary competition. At a 2009 University of Cambodia interview with 18-year-old Noun Pichsoudeny, the youngest student writer in the Kingdom of Cambodia and the author of four published novels, she stated she was a current member of KWA. \n\nMembership is not limited to residents of Cambodia. Nada Marinković (1921–1998), a Yugoslavian journalist and author, was a past member. Pech Sangwawann, the short story writer who fled to France and founded the Association des Ecrivains Khmers a l'Etranger (\"Association of Khmer Writers Abroad\"), was a long-time member of KWA before 1975.\n\nA 1966 catalog of KWA works includes the Buddhism genres of Pali and Dhamma. Some of the works, characterized as being interpretations by \"modernist intellectuals\", may not represent the view of all Khmer Buddhists.\n"}

It is traditionally considered to characterise the first period of New Persian poetry, running from the ninth century CE into the second half of the twelfth. It is characterized by its plain poetic technique, concrete images and metaphors, and some archaic linguistic features. While showing limited use of Arabic loan-words, poetry in this style was influenced by Arabic verse, particularly in terms of its prosody, and the dominant genre was the praise-poem.\n\nThe Khurāsānī period was succeeded by the \"sabk-i ‘Irāqī\" ('style of Iraq'), with its greater use of Arabisms, more elaborate metaphors and imagery, and turn towards spiritualism. However, the transition between the periods was not a sharp one. The style saw a return to popularity with the so-called literary revival (\"bazgasht-e abadi\") of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries.\n\nThe pre-eminent study of the style was by Muḥammad Jaʻfar Maḥjūb in 1971. The chief representatives of this lyricism are Asjadi, Farrukhi Sistani, Unsuri, and Manuchehri. Panegyric masters such as Rudaki were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions.\n\nA. A. Seyed-Gohrab contrasts the following passages to illustrate the Khorāsānī style. The first is a description of a palace from \"Qaṣīda 31\" by Farrukhī Sistānī, writing in the earlier eleventh century. It is plain and concrete in its description:\n\nThe second is from the end of the \"sabk-i Khurāsānī\" period, near to the \"sabk-i ‘Irāqī\" period: a description of a palace built by Arslān Shah of Ghazna, composed by ‘Uthmān Mukhtārī in the vicinity of 1100.

She graduated from the college of art (Střední uměleckoprůmyslová škola) in Uherské Hradiště. She worked as her father's assistant for his final films, and married Eugen Spálený, the chief animator at his studio. They had two children, Linda and Malvinia. She launched a career in story books and animation for children.\n\nIn 1983, Zeman and her husband were invited to teach film technique at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver. When the couple attempted to emigrate, the Czechoslovakian communist government refused them permission, accusing them of pro-Western leanings. Zeman was told to leave the animation studio, and Spálený was drafted into menial construction work. In the summer of 1984, the family escaped through Yugoslavia to a refugee camp in Austria, finally arriving in Canada to accept the teaching posts.\n\n\"The Cedar Tree of Life\", a thirty-second animated segment the couple produced for the Canadian edition of \"Sesame Street\", attracted the attention of the National Film Board of Canada, which invited the couple to make a short film on a topic of their choice. Zeman's production was \"Lord of the Sky\", based on myths of the Canadian north Pacific First Nations and produced using paper cutouts. The film was a success, winning eleven international awards, including a blue ribbon at the American Film Festival in 1993; it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival the following year and was shortlisted for an Academy Award nomination.\n\nFollowing \"Lord of the Sky\", Zeman and Spálený planned a feature-length animated film based on the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\". Karel Zeman had introduced the epic, which was among his favorite books, to Ludmila when she was eleven. The concept was eventually developed into a trilogy of children's books written and illustrated by Zeman: \"Gilgamesh the King\" (1991), \"The Revenge of Ishtar\" (1993), and \"The Last Quest of Gilgamesh\" (1995). The final book in the trilogy won the 1995 Governor General's Award for Children's Illustration. The Embassy of Canada in Japan presented an exhibition of Ludmila Zeman's work in Tokyo in 2011.\n\n"}

Brown as a pair of African students studying under Hawkins.\n\nIn the series, the supporting cast was changed to John Stonebrake, Taylor Savage and Lt. Maxwell, with the plot being completely rebooted.\n\nThe bulk of the series' run depicted the M.A.N.T.I.S. operating in a vigilante role, frequently pursued by police, and battling industrialist Solomon Box (Brion James / Andrew J. Robinson).\n\nIn the series' final installment, Miles Hawkins and Lt. Maxwell are killed disposing of an invisible prehistoric dinosaur. John Stonebrake seals off the records and technology that had created the M.A.N.T.I.S., thus averting an apocalyptic future. While the title character's death was given a sense of finality, the story was left open in one respect: when Miles Hawkins returned to 1994 from the year 2026 (a 32-year difference), he did so precisely 32 seconds after his vehicle sent him forward in time, thus altering the computer-controlled future that his disappearance had led to. As such, Miles Hawkins, while dying in the reality that he returned to, was also sent forward in time to an unknown future, leaving his actual fate ambiguous.\n\n\nThe series was produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Many Vancouver landmarks, such as the dome of Science World, appear. It took three years to film due to Carl Lumbly being busy filming \"Nightjohn\". There were a number of differences between the pilot and the series. For example, in the pilot, Hawkins wore a suit over the exo-skeleton, it lacked a skullcap, and the headpiece was larger. The setting was changed from Oceania City to Port Columbia, and all of the characters, with Hawkins being an exception, were changed.\n\nPoor ratings led to an extensive retooling of the concept. Midway through the show's run, minor characters were jettisoned, and more fantasy adventure elements were incorporated into the premise, including parallel universes, time travel, super-villains, and monsters. In one particular episode, the M.A.N.T.I.S. is accidentally thrown 32 years into the future, where he finds that his own technology has been exploited to create a supercomputer that is being used to enslave the Port Columbia population. He destroys it and sets the human population free before returning to his own time.\nThe series was released on Amazon's Digital Download service Unbox on April 2, 2008.

The most common forms of these are in doctor–patient confidentiality (physician–patient privilege), attorney–client privilege, priest–penitent privilege, and bank–client confidentiality agreements. \n\nIt is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement.

In legal disputes resolved by settlement, the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement. \n\nA non-disclosure agreement (NDA) may be classified as unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral:\n\nA unilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a one-way NDA) involves two parties where only one party (i.e., the disclosing party) anticipates disclosing certain information to the other party (i.e., the receiving party) and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure for some reason (e.g., maintaining the secrecy necessary to satisfy patent laws or legal protection for trade secrets, limiting disclosure of information prior to issuing a press release for a major announcement, or simply ensuring that a receiving party does not use or disclose information without compensating the disclosing party).\n\nA bilateral NDA (sometimes referred to as a mutual NDA or a two-way NDA) involves two parties where both parties anticipate disclosing information to one another that each intends to protect from further disclosure. This type of NDA is common when businesses are considering some kind of joint venture or merger.\n\nWhen presented with a unilateral NDA, some parties may insist upon a bilateral NDA, even though they anticipate that only one of the parties will disclose information under the NDA. This approach is intended to incentivize the drafter to make the provisions in the NDA more \"fair and balanced\" by introducing the possibility that a receiving party could later become a disclosing party or vice versa, which is not an entirely uncommon occurrence.\n\nA multilateral NDA involves three or more parties where at least one of the parties anticipates disclosing information to the other parties and requires that the information be protected from further disclosure. This type of NDA eliminates the need for separate unilateral or bilateral NDAs between only two parties. E.g., a single multiparty NDA entered into by three parties who each intend to disclose information to the other two parties could be used in place of three separate bilateral NDAs between the first and second parties, second and third parties, and third and first parties.\n\nA multilateral NDA can be advantageous because the parties involved review, execute, and implement just one agreement. However, this advantage can be offset by more complex negotiations that may be required for the parties involved to reach a unanimous consensus on a multilateral agreement.\n\nA non-disclosure agreement can protect any type of information that is not generally known. However, nondisclosure agreements may also contain clauses that will protect the person receiving the information so that if they lawfully obtained the information through other sources they would not be obligated to keep the information secret. In other words, the nondisclosure agreement typically only requires the receiving party to maintain information in confidence when that information has been directly supplied by the disclosing party. However, it is sometimes easier to get a receiving party to sign a simple agreement that is shorter, less complex and does not contain safety provisions protecting the receiver.\n\nSome common issues addressed in an NDA include:\n\n\nDeeds of confidentiality and fidelity (also referred to as deeds of confidentiality or confidentiality deeds) are commonly used in Australia. These documents generally serve the same purpose as and contain provisions similar to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) used elsewhere. However, these documents are legally treated as deeds and are thus binding, unlike contracts, without consideration.\n\nIn California, (and some other states), there are some special circumstances relating to non-disclosure agreements and non-compete clauses. California's courts and legislature have signaled that they generally value an employee's mobility and entrepreneurship more highly than they do protectionist doctrine.\n\nUse of non-disclosure agreements are on the rise in India and is governed by the Indian Contract Act 1872. Use of an NDA is crucial in many circumstances, such as to tie in employees who are developing patentable technology if the employer intends to apply for a patent. Non-disclosure agreements have become very important in light of India's burgeoning outsourcing industry. In India, an NDA must be stamped to be a valid enforceable document.\n\n\n1.

The threshold of a chemical compound is determined in part by its shape, polarity, partial charges, and molecular mass. The olfactory mechanisms responsible for a compound's different detection threshold is not well understood. As such, odor thresholds cannot be accurately predicted. Rather, they must be measured through extensive tests using human subjects in laboratory settings.\n\nOptical isomers can have different detection thresholds because their conformations may cause them to be less perceivable for the human nose. It is only in recent years that such compounds were separated on gas chromatographs.\n\n\n\"Odor threshold value (OTV)\" (also \"aroma threshold value (ATV)\", \"Flavor threshold\") is defined as the most minimal concentration of a substance that can be detected by a human nose. Some substances can be detected when their concentration is only few milligrams per 1000 tonnes, which is less than a drop in an Olympic swimming pool. Odor threshold value can be expressed as a concentration in water or concentration in air.\n\nTwo major types of flavor thresholds can be distinguished: the absolute and the difference threshold. The odor detection threshold and the odor recognition threshold are absolute thresholds; the first is the minimum concentration at which an odor can be detected without any requirements to identify or recognize the stimulus, while the second is the minimum concentration at which a stimulus can be identified or recognized.\n\nThe odor threshold value of an odorant is influenced by the medium.\n\nExamples of substances with strong odors:\n\n\nThreshold in a food is dependent upon:\n\nThe concentration of an odor above a food is dependent on its solubility in that food and its vapor pressure and concentration in that food.\n\n"}

{"id": "23761626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23761626", "title": "Religious views on euthanasia", "text": "Religious views on euthanasia\n\nThere are many religious views on euthanasia, although many moral theologians are critical of the procedure.\n\nThere are many views among Buddhists on the issue of euthanasia, but many are critical of the procedure.\n\nAn important value of Buddhism teaching is compassion. Compassion is used by some Buddhists as a justification for euthanasia because the person suffering is relieved of pain. However, it is still immoral \"to embark on any course of action whose aim is to destroy human life, irrespective of the quality of the individual's motive.\" \n\nIn Theravada Buddhism a lay person daily recites the simple formula: \"I undertake the precept to abstain from destroying living beings.\" For Buddhist monastics (\"bhikkhu\") however the rules are more explicitly spelled out. For example, in the monastic code (\"Patimokkha\"), it states:\n\nThe Declaration on Euthanasia is the Church's official document on the topic of euthanasia, a statement that was issued by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1980.\n\nCatholic teaching condemns euthanasia as a \"crime against life\" and a \"crime against God\". The teaching of the Catholic Church on euthanasia rests on several core principles of Catholic ethics, including the sanctity of human life, the dignity of the human person, concomitant human rights, due proportionality in casuistic remedies, the inevitability of death, and the importance of charity. It has been argued that these are relatively recent positions, but whatever the position of individual Catholics, the Roman Catholic Church's viewpoint is unequivocal.\n\nProtestant denominations vary widely on their approach to euthanasia and physician assisted death. Since the 1970s, Evangelical churches have worked with Roman Catholics on a sanctity of life approach, though some Evangelicals may be adopting a more exceptionless opposition. While liberal Protestant denominations have largely eschewed euthanasia, many individual advocates (such as Joseph Fletcher) and euthanasia society activists have been Protestant clergy and laity. As physician assisted dying has obtained greater legal support, some liberal Protestant denominations have offered religious arguments and support for limited forms of euthanasia. However, they are more lenient than the Roman Catholic Church\n\nGroups claiming to speak for Christians rather than the official viewpoints of the Christian clergy have sprung up in a number of countries.\n\nThere are two Hindu points of view on euthanasia. By helping to end a painful life a person is performing a good deed and so fulfilling their moral obligations.Euthanasia may also be acceptable if it is used for selfless motives. On the other hand, by helping to end a life, even one filled with suffering, a person is disturbing the timing of the cycle of death and rebirth. This is a bad thing to do, and those involved in the euthanasia will take on the remaining karma of the patient\nDeath is a natural process, and will come in time.\n\nIt is clearly stated in the Vedas that man has only two trustworthy friends in life, the first is called Vidya (knowledge), and the 2nd is called Mrityu (Death). The former is something that is beneficial and a requirement in life, and the latter is something that is inevitable sometimes even unexpected. It is not the euthanasia that is the act of sin, but worldly attachment which causes euthanasia to be looked upon as an act of sin. Even a Sannyasin or Sannyasini if they decide to, are permitted to end his or her life with the hope of reaching moksha i.e. emancipation of the soul.\n\nMuslims are against euthanasia. They believe that all humans life is sacred because it is given by God, and that God chooses how long each person lives. Human beings should not interfere in this.\n\nJainism is based on the principle of non-violence (\"ahinsa\") and is best known for it. Jainism recommends voluntary death or \"sallekhana\" for both ascetics and srāvaka (householders) at the end of their life. \"Sallekhana\" (also known as \"Santhara\", \"Samadhi-marana\") is made up of two words \"sal\" (meaning 'properly') and \"lekhana\", which means to thin out. Properly thinning out of the passions and the body is \"sallekhana.\" A person is allowed to fast unto death or take the vow of \"sallekhana\" only when certain requirements are fulfilled. It is not considered suicide as the person observing it, must be in a state of full consciousness. When observing \"sallekhana\", one must not have the desire to live or desire to die. Practitioner shouldn't recollect the pleasures enjoyed or, long for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future. The process is still controversial in parts of India. Estimates for death by this means range from 100 to 240 a year. Preventing santhara invites social ostracism.\n\nLike the trend among Protestants, Jewish medical ethics have become divided, partly on denominational lines, over euthanasia and end of life treatment since the 1970s. Generally, Jewish thinkers oppose voluntary euthanasia, often vigorously, though there is some backing for voluntary passive euthanasia in limited circumstances. Likewise, within the Conservative Judaism movement, there has been increasing support for passive euthanasia (PAD) In Reform Judaism responsa, the preponderance of anti-euthanasia sentiment has shifted in recent years to increasing support for certain passive euthanasia options. Secular Judaism is a separate category with increasing support for euthanasia. A popular sympathiser for euthanasia is Rabbi Miriam Jerris.\n\nA study performed in 2010 investigated elderly Jewish women who identified themselves as either Hasidic Orthodox, non-Hasidic Orthodox, or secularized Orthodox in their faith. The study found that all of the Hasidic Orthodox responders disapproved of voluntary euthanasia whereas a majority of the secularized Orthodox responders approved of it.\n\nIn Japan, where the dominant religion is Shinto, 69% of the religious organisations agree with the act of voluntary passive euthanasia. The corresponding figure was 75% when the family asked for it. In Shinto, the prolongation of life using artificial means is a disgraceful act against life. Views on active euthanasia are mixed, with 25% Shinto and Buddhist organisations in Japan supporting voluntary active euthanasia.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) recommends observing the ethics and culture of the resident country when determining euthanasia. In 1988 the UUA gathered to share a commitment to The Right to Die with Dignity document which included a resolution supporting self-determination in dying.\n\nReligious views on euthanasia are both varied and complicated. While one's view on the matter doesn't necessarily connect directly to their religion, it often impacts a person's opinion. While the influence of religion on one's views toward palliative care do make a difference, they often play a smaller role than one may think. An analysis of the connection between the religion of US adults and their view on euthanasia was done in order to see how they combine. The findings concluded that the religious affiliation one associates with does not necessarily connect with their stance on euthanasia. Research shows that while many belong to a specific religion, they may not always see every aspect as relevant to them.\n\nSome metadata analysis has supported the hypothesis that nurses’ attitudes towards euthanasia and physician assisted suicide are influenced by religion and world view. Attributing more importance to religion also seems to make agreement with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide less likely. A 1995 study of public opinion found that the tendency to see a distinction between active euthanasia and suicide was clearly affected by religious affiliation and education. In Australia, more doctors without formal religious affiliation were sympathetic to active voluntary euthanasia, and acknowledged that they had practised it, than were doctors who gave any religious affiliation. Of those identifying with a religion, those who reported a Protestant affiliation were intermediate in their attitudes and practices between the agnostic/atheist and the Catholic groups. Catholics recorded attitudes most opposed, but even so, 18 per cent of Catholic medical respondents who had been so requested, recorded that they had taken active steps to bring about the death of patients.\n\n\n"}

Early in her career Wainwright worked as a playwright, and as a scriptwriter on the long-running radio serial drama \"The Archers\". In the 1990s Wainwright began her television career and in 2000 created her first original drama series \"At Home with the Braithwaites\" (2000–2003).\n\nShe won the Royal Television Society's Writer of the Year Award for the 2009 mini-series \"Unforgiven\". Wainwright is known for her creation of the ITV drama series \"Scott & Bailey\" (2011–2016\"), Last Tango in Halifax\" (2012–2016), and \"Happy Valley\" (2014–present). \"Last Tango in Halifax\" won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series in 2013, whilst \"Happy Valley\" won the same award in both 2015 and 2017.\n\nWainwright was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, to Harry Wainwright and Dorothy Wainwright (née Crowther). Wainwright was brought up in Sowerby Bridge where she attended Triangle C of E Primary School and Sowerby Bridge High School. She attended the University of York, reading English and Related Literature. She has an older sister Diane Hilton, a housing professional with The Guinness Partnership.\n\nWainwright said that she had always wanted to write, and had started writing when she was young, from the time she was 9 years old, and wanted to write for \"Coronation Street.\" She said that when she was 16 years old in 1980 she saw a play called \"Bastard Angel\" by playwright Barrie Keeffe at Royal Shakespeare Company and was deeply interested in the short sentences and naturalistic approach to dialogue.\n\nWhile at University of York, Wainwright took an original play called \"Hanging On\" to the Edinburgh Festival and found an agent, Meg Davis, for her writing in the process. Meanwhile, she worked as a bus driver. When she was 24, she left the driving job after she started writing for the Radio 4 series \"The Archers.\" One of her contributions was to write an atypical story for the long running radio soap in which the village shop was robbed. After that she wrote for \"Coronation Street\", developing her writing skills, from 1994 to 1999. She has since said that working on continuing drama was a great education in discipline and a lesson that great stories are hard work. She was mentored by Kay Mellor who encouraged her to stop writing for soaps and to concentrate instead on original work. She created the TV series \"At Home with the Braithwaites\" about a woman who had secretly won the lottery. The programme was nominated for many awards. In 2006 she wrote the drama series Jane Hall, which depicts the life of a female bus driver in London. Wainwright drew on her own experiences in scripting the series.\n\nShe won the 2009 Writer of the Year Award given by the RTS in 2009 for \"Unforgiven\" which took several awards including best TV series.\n\nWainwright says that her strong female flawed characters are almost real to her and arrive fully formed in her imagination. She likes to control the television that is created and has done some directing and production of her own work partly to ensure the scenery and dialogue reflects Yorkshire.\n\nIn 2011 she wrote \"Scott & Bailey\", a series about two female police officers. The idea for the series came from the leading actresses and former Detective Inspector Diane Taylor, who assisted with bringing the series to the air.\n\nWainwright based the plot of her series \"Last Tango in Halifax\" on the story of her mother who was widowed in 2001. Her mother, Dorothy, moved to Oxfordshire to live with her daughter and rediscovered a lost love, Alec Walker, via Friends Reunited. With her mother's permission, Wainwright developed the story of how she remarried so rapidly, publishing series extracts to her mother before broadcast.\n\nWhen she told the story to Nicola Shindler, she suggested she turn her mother's experience into a television series. Shindler became the series' executive producer. Both \"Last Tango in Halifax\" and her crime series \"Scott & Bailey\" were turned down by both the BBC and ITV before both were accepted respectively. The former was voted by BAFTA to be best series in 2012 and Wainwright was given the award for best writer.\n\n\"Happy Valley,\" which was shot in Yorkshire's picturesque upper Upper Calder Valley and Hebden Bridge, stars Sarah Lancashire, whom Wainwright had in mind as she wrote the role. Wainwright made her directorial debut with episode 4 of the first series. Wainwright has said that she is willing to write a third series of Happy Valley, but she has previous commitments to work on other projects. Producer Nicola Shindler has indicated that the third series would not air until 2018 at the earliest.\n\nIn May 2015, it was announced that Wainwright would be writing and directing a two-hour drama special for BBC One entitled \"To Walk Invisible: The Bronte Sisters\". Its subject is the Brontë family, particularly the relationship the three sisters, Anne, Emily and Charlotte, had with their brother, Branwell. On the drama, Wainwright said that \"I am thrilled beyond measure that I've been asked by the BBC to bring to life these three fascinating, talented, ingenious Yorkshire women.\"\n\nWainwright was made a Fellow of the Royal Television Society in 2016.\n\nIn November 2016, Wainwright told \"The Guardian\" that her next project (for the BBC) is about Anne Lister, a Yorkshire diarist with an openly lesbian lifestyle in the 1800s.\n\nIn 1990, Wainwright married Ralph \"Austin\" Sherlaw-Johnson, an antiquarian sheet music dealer. They have two sons and own two Maine Coon cats.\n\nWainwright lives in Oxfordshire.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "436407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=436407", "title": "Sound poetry", "text": "Sound poetry\n\nSound poetry is an artistic form bridging literary and musical composition, in which the phonetic aspects of human speech are foregrounded instead of more conventional semantic and syntactic values; \"verse without words\". By definition, sound poetry is intended primarily for performance.\n\nWhile it is sometimes argued that the roots of sound poetry are to be found in oral poetry traditions, the writing of pure sound texts that downplay the roles of meaning and structure is a 20th-century phenomenon. The Futurist and Dadaist Vanguards of the beginning of this century were the pioneers in creating the first sound poetry forms. Filippo Tommaso Marinetti discovered that onomatopoeias were useful to describe a battle in Tripoli where he was a soldier, creating a sound text that became a sort of a spoken photograph of the battle. Dadaists were more involved in sound poetry and they invented different categories:\n\nSound poetry evolved into visual poetry and concrete poetry, two forms based in visual arts issues although the sound images are always very compelling in them. Later on, with the development of the magnetic tape recorder, sound poetry evolved thanks to the upcoming of the concrete music movement at the end of the 1940s. Some sound poetics were used by later poetry movements like the beat generation in the fifties or the spoken word movement in the 80's, and by other art and music movements that brought up new forms such as text sound art that may be used for sound poems which more closely resemble \"fiction or even essays, as traditionally defined, than poetry\".\n\n\"Das Große Lalulá\" (1905) by Christian Morgenstern, in the collection \"Galgenlieder\".\n\n\"Zang Tumb Tumb\" (1914) is a sound poem and concrete poem by Italian futurist F. T. Marinetti.\n\nHugo Ball performed a piece of sound poetry in a reading at Cabaret Voltaire in 1916:\n\nKurt Schwitters' \"Ursonate\" (1922–32, \"Primal Sonata\") is a particularly well known early example:\n\nThe first movement rondo's principal theme being a word, \"fmsbwtözäu\" pronounced \"Fümms bö wö tää zää Uu\", from a 1918 poem by Raoul Hausmann, apparently also a sound poem. Schwitters also wrote a less well-known sound poem consisting of the sound of the letter W. (Albright, 2004)\n\nChilean Vicente Huidobro's explores phonetic mutations of words in his book \"Altazor\" (1931).\n\nIn his story \"The Poet at Home\", William Saroyan refers to a character who practices a form of pure poetry, composing verse of her own made-up words.\n\nIt has been argued that \"there is a paucity of information on women's involvement in sound poetry, whether as practitioners, theorists, or even simply as listeners\". Among the earliest female practitioners are Berlin poet Else Lasker-Schüler, who experimented in what she called \"Ursprache\" (Ur-language), and the New York Dada poet and performer Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. The Baroness’s poem \"Klink-Hratzvenga (Death-wail)\" was published in \"The Little Review\" in March 1920 to great controversy. Written in response to her husband Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven’s suicide, the sound poem was \"a mourning song in nonsense sounds that transcended national boundaries\". The Baroness was also known for her sexually charged sound poetry, as seen in \"Teke Heart (Beating of Heart)\", only recently published.\n\nEurope has produced at least 2 accomplished sound poets in the persons of Greta Monach (Netherlands) & Katlin Ladik (Hungary), who released an EP of her work, \"Phonopoetica\", in 1976. In England, Paula Claire has been working with improvisational sound since the 1960s.\n\nThe United States has produced at least one accomplished sound poet, Tracie Morris, from Brooklyn, New York. She began presenting sound poetry in the mid-1990s. Her live and installation sound poetry has been featured in numerous venues including the Whitney Biennial in 2002.\n\nLater prominent sound poets include Henri Chopin, Bob Cobbing, Ada Verdun Howell, bpNichol, Bill Bissett, William S. Burroughs, Giovanni Fontana, Bernard Heidsieck, Enzo Minarelli, François Dufrene, Mathias Goeritz, Maurizio Nannucci, Andras Petocz, Joan La Barbara, Paul Dutton, multidisciplinary artists Jeremy Adler, Jean-Jacques Lebel, John Giorno, Henrik Aeshna, a Paris-based poet, artist and performer who experiments with Noise, shamanism and visual poetry, New York City jazz poet Steve Dalachinsky, Yoko Ono, Young Thug, and Jaap Blonk, a Dutch sound poet who often works with improvising musicians.\n\nThe poet Edith Sitwell coined the term abstract poetry to describe some of her own poems which possessed more aural than literary qualities, rendering them essentially meaningless: \"The poems in \"Façade\" are \"abstract\" poems—that is, they are patterns of sound. They are...virtuoso exercises in technique of extreme difficulty, in the same sense as that in which certain studies by Liszt are studies in transcendental technique in music.\" (Sitwell, 1949)\n\nAn early Dutch artist, Theo van Doesburg, was another prominent sound poet in the early 1900s.\n\nIn their essay \"Harpsichords Metallic Howl—\", Irene Gammel and Suzanne Zelazo review the theories of sound by Charles Bernstein, Gerald Bruns, Min-Quian Ma, Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Jeffrey McCaffery and others to argue that sonic poetry foregrounds its own corporality. Thus \"the Baroness's sound poems let her body speak[;] through her expansive use of sound, the Baroness conveys the fluidity of gender as a constantly changing, polysemous signifier.\" In this way, somatic art becomes the poet's own \"space-sound.\"\n\nOf course, for many dadaists, such as Hugo Ball, sound poetry also presented a language of trauma, a cacophony used to protest the sound of the cannons of World War I. It was as T. J. Demos writes, \"a telling stutter, a nervous echolalia.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was attributed to Hals for centuries until Claus Grimm called it a product of his circle. According to Hofrichter, the positioning of a figure sitting behind a table is a typical Leyster theme, and the upward glance is reminiscent of her \"Violin player\", while the application of paint is similar to her \"Two children with a cat\".\n\nIn the 17th-century, the gesture of tipping the glass down to see if a drop of wine appears on a fingernail was a method to show one wanted a refill. The scene is often shown with figures in theatrical costumes.\n\nIn his 1910 catalog of Frans Hals works Hofstede de Groot noted this painting may be the same one as a painting sold in Rotterdam in 1825 and wrote: \"86.

It stars Ruth Reynolds and Madeline Merritt as two women who fall in love over a weekend at a Los Angeles guest house. The film has received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nRachel is a rebellious 18-year-old musician who lives with her father, Frank, at their Los Angeles home. Before leaving on a business trip one morning, her father informs her that his new employee, a recent college graduate named Amy, will be coming to stay in their guest house for a few days while she gets settled. Amy arrives and Rachel, lonely and still affected by the death of her mother, feels drawn to Amy. Over the course of the weekend, the two women spend much time together and become close. Eventually they become lovers. When Frank returns, he is shocked to find them in bed together and lashes out at both of them. To Rachel's shock, it is revealed that her father and Amy slept with each other. Disgusted and feeling betrayed, Rachel breaks off their relationship.\n\nSome time later, Rachel performs a show at a small club in San Francisco. Afterwards, she exits and finds Amy waiting outside. The two reconcile and decide to pursue their relationship further.\n\n\nMadeline Merritt originally read for the role of Rachel before being cast as Amy. Neither she nor Reynolds had portrayed a lesbian character on screen prior to this film, though Merritt had previously starred in a stage production of \"Boston Marriage\" while at university. Reynolds found that their experience on-set mirrored that of their characters, saying, \"It was a challenge because we are considered straight, so it was kind of cool to find out how comfortable it was to be with someone of the same gender...even though its something that’s completely new. So aside from our characters, we discovered it in real life as well\". The two women became friends during filming. Merritt recalled, \"When Ruth and I had callbacks, we read together and we just clicked. The chemistry and connection were just there: it wasn't something we had to work at, we really played well off of each other from the start.\" Reynolds also relished the opportunity to play a musician.\n\n\"The Guest House\" received mixed reviews from critics. Writing for \"AfterEllen\", Danielle Riendeau summed up her review by saying: \"\"Guest House\" is largely a fun piece of fluff, with attractive leads and a fun premise, but the film is far, far too chatty for its own good. The writing is spotty, with a few clunky lines, and the final third dives far into melodramatic territory.\" However, she also noted the \"fantastic chemistry between Reynolds and Merritt\" and found the love scenes \"decidedly hot\". Dora Mortimer gave the film a negative review for \"Diva\" magazine and found that it lacked authenticity, saying: \"If you're looking for a lesbian film – hunt elsewhere. This film's only claim to LGBT issues is having two very femmey members of the same sex feign interest in each other. It is written and directed by a man and it shows.\" Lauren Shiro of \"Curve\" magazine was much more positive, saying: \"\"The Guest House\" is a cute, fun, and highly enjoyable movie. This is a perfect light-hearted, feel good movie for fun weekend entertainment.\"\n\nRuth Reynolds won the Rising Star Award at the Melbourne Independent Film Festival for her role in the film.\n\n\"The Guest House\" is distributed by Wolfe Releasing in the United States, and by Peccadillo Pictures in the United Kingdom.\n"}

Sometimes subtitled \"Short Stories\", this work is actually a collection of one novella of 80-odd pages (\"House of Hunger\") and nine satellite short stories. The small group of texts in its entirety reflects the author’s vision of (mainly township) life in Rhodesia (specifically, the period of Ian Smith’s rule of the country that at independence became Zimbabwe) — with a minority of the shorter pieces in the book depicting an African exile's experience of life in Britain (mainly at Oxford University, where Marechera had studied).\n\nCommenting on the semi-autobiographical nature of the book, April McCallum has said: \"Marechera’s debut \"The House of Hunger\" is as much a product of being down and out in Oxford, sleeping rough, being beaten up by thugs and policeman alike and struggling with alcoholism, as it is of the Rhodesia it describes... The 'hunger' of the book’s title does not refer only to the literal starvation which was ravaging post-independent Zimbabwe at the time. Rather it implies a more far reaching and metaphorical hunger of the soul – the vacuous yearning and emptiness within the national consciousness, aspiring for more but held back by poverty and corruption.\"\n\nFirst published to critical acclaim in 1978 (Heinemann African Writers Series, no. 207), \"The House of Hunger\" the following year was joint winner — alongside Neil Jordan's \"Night In Tunisia\" — of the Guardian Fiction Prize. At the award ceremony, with typically unconventional and disruptive behaviour, Marechera threw plates at his fellow guests. Doris Lessing wrote that reading Marechera's work was \"like overhearing a scream\". Because it was so vivid about the experience of growing up in slum conditions in Harare, James Currey (his former publisher as editorial director of Heinemann Educational Books) has described it as \"a shocking book\".\n\nHelon Habila has called the book's opening line (\"I got my things and left\") \"the coolest opening line in African fiction\" as well as being \"a fair summary of the writer's life.\"\n\nNovelist Drew Johnson said in 2009: \"Marechera’s knack for surprise and ambush would be the envy of any airport thriller writer, yet here it’s entirely divorced from plot. Surprise is managed in a way that I don’t know how to explain or what exactly to compare it to—it’s just genuinely unexpected. \"The House of Hunger\" shocked me, not because it brought me the news about some bit of brutality or another—literature from every continent and era has made that more or less routine—but because I was shocked by the words on the page, the book in my hands. Marechera seemed to be coming at me with everything, yet with an enormous artistry. His life seemed to be at stake in his words and, while I was reading, so did mine.\"\n\nA Channel Four film adaptation of the book as a drama-documentary, with which Marechera was initially involved, and for which he returned to Zimbabwe in 1982 ostensibly for five weeks, soon ran into trouble when the author fell out with the producer. Marechera withdrew from the film, and he never again left the country, dying there five years later.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10367608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10367608", "title": "The Scapegoat (painting)", "text": "The Scapegoat (painting)\n\nThe Scapegoat (1854–56) is a painting by William Holman Hunt which depicts the \"scapegoat\" described in the Book of Leviticus. On the Day of Atonement, a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth – representing the sins of the community – and be driven off.\n\nHunt started painting on the shore of the Dead Sea, and continued it in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in Manchester Art Gallery, and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight. Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as \"preliminary\" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited.\n\nIn the Royal Academy exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that \"the scene was painted at Oosdoom, on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the Dead Sea. The mountains beyond are those of Edom.\" He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before it was exhibited at the academy in that year.\n\nThe painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in Jerusalem, Hunt had met Henry Wentworth Monk, a millenarian prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the Last Judgement. Monk was particularly preoccupied with Christian Zionism.\n\nHunt chose a subject derived from the Torah as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend Millais, \"I am sanguine that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King.\"\n\nThe Book of Leviticus describes a \"scapegoat\" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the Messiah described in Isaiah as a \"suffering servant\" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations \"Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted.\" (Isaiah 53:4) and \"And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited.\" (Leviticus 16:22)\n\nThe reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography \"Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood\", Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer Ernest Gambart:\n\nDante Gabriel Rossetti, in a letter to William Allingham in 1856, called the painting \"a grand thing, but not for the public\". Ford Madox Brown wrote in his diary: \"Hunt's \"Scapegoat\" requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.\". Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: \"I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat.\" \"The Art Journal\" in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work \"The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple\", was to characterise the painting as \"having disappointed even his warmest admirers\".\n\nAt the time of the exhibition of \"The Scapegoat\" itself, in 1856, \"The Art Journal\" questioned Hunt's eye for colour in the painting, casting doubt that the mountains of Edom, seen in the background, really were in actual appearance as painted – which Matthew Dennison, writing in \"The Spectator\" in 2008 described the Manchester version as \"Day-Glo striations of lilac, crimson and egg-yolk yellow\". Dennison suggests the possibility that Hunt was painting the scene from memory, when he was finishing the painting in London after he had returned from his trip to the Dead Sea, and mis-remembered it. Hunt's own description of the landscape that he painted is that \"never was so extraordinary a scene of beautifully arranged horrible wilderness. It is black, full of asphalte scum and in the hand slimy, and smarting as a sting – No one can stand and say that it is not accursed of God.\" Art critic Peter Fuller, in 1989, described the landscape of the painting as \"a terrible image […] of the world as a god-forsaken wasteland, a heap of broken images where the sun beats\".\n\n\n"}

In general, road managers handle small to medium-sized tours, and tour managers are used on large-scale tours.\n\nThe performances on a concert tour are booked by the act’s booking agent, who works with concert promoters to place the act in suitable venues and festivals in a time frame and territory agreed with the act’s management. Individual concert promoters negotiate the financial, technical and hospitality requirements of the artist and make an offer to the booking agent for the show. The tour is announced and tickets put on sale when agreement is reached on the tour dates. As modern concert touring involves complex financial, legal and technical arrangements, the booking agent or artist manager hire a concert tour manager to organize the logistics. Concert tour managers are usually freelancers working on a tour-by-tour basis.\n\nThe tour manager is given the itinerary for the tour by the booking agent. Working from this itinerary, the tour manager handles the following activities.\n\nThe itinerary includes information about the potential ticket income (fees) for each show. Using this information the tour manager can produce a budget for the tour, calculating costs for crew wages, per diems, accommodation, transport, sound, lighting and video equipment, visas and work permits, rehearsals and other expenses such as booking agent commissions.

{"id": "24771025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24771025", "title": "Venetian school (art)", "text": "Venetian school (art)\n\nFrom the latter part of the 15th century, Venice had a distinctive, thriving, and influential artistic environment. Beginning with the work of Giovanni Bellini (c. 1430–1516) and his brother Gentile Bellini (c. 1429–1507) and their workshops, the major artists of the Venetian school included Giorgione (c. 1477–1510), Titian (c. 1489–1576), Tintoretto (1518–1594), Paolo Veronese (1528–1588) and Jacopo Bassano (1510–1592) and his brothers. Considered to give primacy of colour over line, the tradition of the Venetian school contrasted with the Mannerism prevalent in the rest of Italy. The Venetian style exerted great influence upon the subsequent development of Western painting.\n\nDuring the early-15th century, Venetian art was dominated by the earlier styles arising from its Byzantine links, as exemplified by the work of the Vivarini family. From the late-15th century, Venetian painting developed through links with Andrea Mantegna (1431–1506) (from nearby Padua) and of a visit by Antonello da Messina (c. 1430–1479), who introduced the oil painting technique of Early Netherlandish painting, probably acquired through his training in Naples. Another external factor was the visit by Leonardo da Vinci, who was particularly influential on Giorgione.\n\nDuring his long career, Bellini has been credited with creating the Venetian style. From his earlier works, such as his \"Madonna of the Small Trees\" (c. 1487) which largely reflect the linear approach of Mantegna, he later developed a softer style, where glowing colours are used to represent form and suggest an atmospheric haze. Applying this approach in his \"San Zaccaria Altarpiece\" (1505), the high viewpoint, the uncluttered and interconnected figures arranged in space, and the subtle gestures all combine to form a tranquil yet majestic image. With such works he has been described as reaching the High Renaissance ideals, and certainly expresses the key distinctive factors of the Venetian school.\n\nGiorgione and Titian were both apprentices at Bellini's workshop. They collaborated on numerous paintings, and their styles could be so similar that it is difficult to conclusively assign authorship. A speciality of Giorgione's were idyllic Arcadian scenes, with an example being his \"Three Philosophers\", and this element was adopted by his master Bellini, who increased the landscape in his many Madonnas, and by Titian in work like \"Pastoral Concert\" (1508) and \"Sacred and Profane Love\" (1515). This emphasis on nature as a setting was a major contribution of the Venetian School.\n\nTitian, through his long and productive life, with a wide variety of themes and subjects was the most influential and greatest of all the Venetian School painters. His early \"Pesaro Madonna\" (1519–1528) shows a bold new composition for such a traditional religious subject, putting the focal point of the Madonna off from the centre and on a steep diagonal. Colours are used to enliven the painting, but also to unify the composition, such as by the large red flag on the left counterbalancing the red in the Madonna and such skilful and sumptuous use of colour became a hallmark of the Venetian style.\nAlthough pre-figured by the \"Sleeping Venus\" (completed by Titian after Giorgione's death in 1510) Titian is credited with establishing the reclining female nude as an important subgenre in art. Using mythological subjects, works such as the \"Venus of Urbino\" (1538) richly depict the fabrics and other textures, and use a composition that is carefully controlled by organising colours. As an example, in this painting the diagonal of the nude is matched by the opposite diagonal between the red of the cushions in the front with the red skirts of the woman in the background.\nWith such paintings, readily transported by virtue of being oils on canvas, Titian became famous, and helped establish a reputation for Venetian art. Possession of such paintings symbolised luxurious wealth, and for his skills in portraiture he was sought by powerful, rich individuals, such as in his long relationship working for Emperor Charles V and Philip II of Spain.\n\nAlthough Tintoretto is sometimes classified as a Mannerist artist, he also incorporates Venetian and individualistic aspects. \nIn his \"Miracle of the Slave\" (1548), the Mannerist features include the crowded scene, the twisting linking of figures (as in the central figures, from the foreshortened slave on the ground to the miraculous figure of St. Mark in the sky, through the turbaned, grey-robed figure), and the drama in the gestures and poses. But the colouring maintains the warm reds, golds and greens of the Venetian school, and the figures are arranged in real three-dimensional space, in contrast to the more compressed compositions of many Mannerist works, and with its intensely theatrical, stage-like display his painting is a forerunner of the Baroque.\n\nFollowing Tintoretto came Paolo Veronese and the Bassano. These are a few of the most outstanding in the great number of artists in the Venetian tradition, many originally from outside the Republic's territory.\n\nThe Venetian school had a great influence of subsequent painting, and the history of later Western art has been described as a dialogue between the more intellectual and sculptural/linear approach of the Florentine and Roman traditions, and the more sensual, poetic, and pleasure-seeking of the colourful Venetian school. Specifically through the presence of Titian in Spain, the Venetian style influenced later Spanish art, including that of Velázquez, and through Rubens was more broadly transmitted through the rest of Europe.\n\nIn the 18th century Venetian painting had a final flowering in Tiepolo's decorative painting and Canaletto's and Guardi's \"veduta\" or panoramic views, mostly of the city itself. The extinction of the Republic by French Revolutionary armies in 1797 effectively brought the distinctive Venetian style to an end; it had at least arguably outlasted its rival Florence in that respect.\n\n\n\n"}

At one time it had almost 1,000 members. Although smaller today, it still plays an active role in fundraising and providing scholarships for young artists.\n\nIn 1886 the young Canadian artist Mary Dignam (1857–1938) returned from six years in Europe, where she had supported herself by organizing art tours for young ladies in Italy and the Netherlands.\nShe joined the staff of Miss E.K. Westmacott's Associated Artists' School of Art and Design, founded in Toronto in 1884, which taught handicrafts to women. She began to teach classes in drawing, painting and modelling in the school's studio on the 2nd floor of the Arcade building. \nIn 1887 Dignam created a young women's artists organization which shared the premises of the handicrafts school.\nThe organization was part of the Lyceum Club.\nAfter two years, Dignam replaced Miss Westmacott as president of the school.\n\nIn 1890 Dignam incorporated the artist's organization as the Women's Art Club. It was renamed the Women's art Association of Canada in 1892.\nDignam wrote later, \"We had a Royal Academy branch in Toronto but I found I had to do something to open the door for women and the only way seemed to be the organization of the Women's Art Association.\"\nThe association adopted the motto of the Plantin Press of Antwerp, \"Labore et Constantia\" (Labour and Constancy), the colours of red and white and the wild rose as emblem.\n\nThe goal of the association was to encourage and support Canadian women artists, including those involved in branches of fine art, applied and performance arts.\nAccording to the 1907 \"Bill No.30 An Act To Incorporate The Women's Art Association of Canada\", \"The objects of the Association shall be the creating of a general interest in art and the encouragement of women's work for the purpose of mutual help and co-operation of its members, the establishment of art lectures and reading clubs, the holding of exhibitions of painting, designs, sculpture, engraving and the industrial arts, and the encouragement and development of the art handicrafts and home industries of Canada.\"\n\nIn a 1917 article in \"Woman's Century\" the WAAC stated, \"Service is the keynote to happiness. Every part of the Art Association's activities is based on service to the individual, to the community, and to the nation.\"\nThe 1919 \"National Council of Women of Canada Yearbook\" defined the purpose of the WAAC as \"to create a general interest in art, to encourage art handicrafts and home industries, and to establish art lectures and exhibitions of painting, sculpture and design.\" The yearbook added that \"In this way it hopes to supply in some measure that great need of the artist: a public able to understand and trained to appreciate the best in art.\"\nThe WAAC appreciated and promoted the different cultural heritages of native Canadians, French Canadians and immigrants from different countries.\n\nThe first branches after the 1992 incorporation in Toronto were founded in Winnipeg, London, Ontario, and Montreal.\nThe Hamilton, branch was established in 1894.\nLate in 1893 the WAAC became the first women's organization to affiliate with the National Council of Women of Canada, which had been founded on the initiative of Lady Aberdeen, wife of the Governor General of Canada from 1893 to 1898. \nThe WAAC elected Lady Aberdeen as patron.\nThis established a tradition that has been followed since then by all the wives of Governors General.\nFlorence Deeks, who in 1912 prepared a \"historical sketch\" of the early years of the association, seems likely to have joined in the mid-1890s.\n\nThe group held thirteen annual exhibitions from 1889 to 1901, and occasional loan exhibitions after that.\nThe catalogues for the early exhibitions include paintings and sketches by members, and works on loan from private collections. Often there were also handicrafts made by members. In the 1900 exhibition there were oil and watercolour paintings, pastel drawings, designs, miniatures and 112 handicraft items. There was also a loan exhibit that showed decorative art from many different places and ages. The catalogue said these specimens were intended to show \"the possibilities open to women of artistic bent\".\nIn 1896 the WAAC proposed that a State Dinner Service of painted china be made by Alice Mary Egan of Halifax, Nova Scotia and twelve other artists from Ontario and Quebec. The service was made and was a success.\n\nThe WAAC opened branches across Canada, eventually reaching Alberta in the west and New Brunswick in the east.\nBy 1898 there were almost 1,000 members.\nThe Montreal branch of the Women\"s Art Association was founded in 1894 by Mary Martha Phillips and Mary Alice Peck.\nIn 1907 it broke away from the WAAC and formed the independent Women's Art Society of Montreal. \nThis was extremely successful, and in 1911 had to impose a cap of 350 members.\nDespite taking the name \"l'Association culturelle des femmes de Montréal\" in 1981, it remained essentially Anglophone.\nThe Montreal society remains active today.\n\nThe Winnipeg Branch of the WAAC was established in February 1894.\nIt separated its members into \"active\" and \"honorary\", the first group being professional artists or serious students of art, and the second being women who were interested in the arts.\nMembership rose from about 20 in 1894 to 188 in 1907. \nMost of the members grew impatient with the degree of control exerted by Mary Dignam, and broke away in 1908 to form the Western Art Association.\nThe last groups associated with the WAAC in Winnipeg disbanded in 1909.\n\nIn 1912 the Toronto-based association was formally incorporated under federal legislation as the Women's Art Association of Canada.\nMary Dignam was president until 1913, and remained in an advisory role for many years after.\nIn 1936 she returned as president for the 50th anniversary of the WAAC.\nMatilda Ridout Edgar (1844–1910), historian, feminist and wife of the politician and businessman James David Edgar, was also associated with the WAAC in its early years.\n\nHoward and Lorrie Dunington-Grubb, well-known landscape gardeners, moved to Toronto in 1911 and soon after founded Sheridan Nurseries.\nHoward became a member of the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto, but Lorrie was unable to join since she was a woman.\nLorrie became involved with the Women's Art Association around 1915 and was president of the WAAC from 1925 to 1930.\nLorrie was also an active member of the Lyceum Club of Toronto and the Heliconian Club, both devoted to women's involvement in the arts.\nIn April 1930 the WAAC became affiliated with the Lyceum Club of London, England, and changed its name to the Lyceum Club and Women's Art Association of Canada.\n\nThe branch in St. Thomas, Ontario illustrates the evolution of one local branch.\nIt was founded by eleven members at a meeting at the St. Thomas Business College on 26 March 1895, with the painter and teacher Miss Susan Paul as first president. \nThe branch met at different locations, including the YWCA, the St. Thomas-Elgin Art Gallery and Sifton House at Alma College. \nMembership fees were the main source of funding, but the branch also held exhibitions, lectures, teas and other events.\nThe branch arranged tours of studios and museums, and sponsored display of artwork in schools.\nIt was most active from the late 1940s to the mid 1950s, when it usually had more than 100 paid members.\nAfter this the branch slowly declined in activity and membership, and closed around 1990.\n\nThe sculptor Frances Loring was president of the WAAC from 1938 to 1940.\nThe name was changed back to the Women's Art Association of Canada after World War II (1939–45).\nThe WAAC remains active, and as of 2014 had 200 members, including women and men. \nIt is based in a Victorian-era house in downtown Toronto.\nThe building at 23 Prince Arthur Avenue was purchased in 1916 for $13,000.

Many of the theorists were affiliated with Yale University in the late 1970s, although a number of the theorists — including Derrida himself — subsequently moved to or became affiliated with the University of California at Irvine.\n\nAs a school of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the post-structuralist dimensions of deconstruction as opposed to its phenomenological dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is more similar to the 1970s version of deconstruction that John D. Caputo has described as a \"Nietzschean free play of signifiers\" and not the 1990s version of deconstruction that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.\n\nDuring the period between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, Yale University was the home of a variety of thinkers who were indebted to deconstruction. The group included high-profile literary scholars such as Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartman, J. Hillis Miller, and Harold Bloom. This group came to be known as the \"Yale School\" and was especially influential in literary criticism because de Man, Miller, Hartman and Bloom are all considered to be prominent literary critics. The four critics listed above, along with Derrida, contributed to an influential anthology, \"Deconstruction and Criticism\". However, Harold Bloom's position was always somewhat different from that of the rest of the group, and he later distanced himself from deconstruction.\n\nIn his introduction to \"Deconstruction and Criticism\", Hartman draws a distinction between Derrida, Miller, and de Man on the one hand, and himself and Bloom on the other. The former category he refers to as \"boa-deconstructors\" who pursue deconstruction to its utmost conclusions and who are more philosophically rigorous in their writings. \n\nHartman claims that both himself and Bloom are \"barely deconstructionists\" and that they \"even write against it on occasion.\" Hartman claims that his writing style in particular is more reliant on the traditional role of pathos as a fundamental impetus for literary language. In contrast, deconstruction as advocated by Derrida seeks to reveal that the very notion of pathos is caught up in the rhetorical play which is endemic to language.\n\n\nAfter teaching at Yale from 1972 to 1986, J. Hillis Miller left for the University of California, Irvine, where he is today Distinguished Research Professor of English and Comparative Literature.\n\nShortly after J. Hillis Miller's arrival at UC Irvine in 1986, Derrida himself became Professor of the Humanities at UCI. Derrida remained at UCI until 2003, one year before his death. Until his death, Derrida had slowly been turning over lecture manuscripts, journals and other materials to UCI’s special collections library under an agreement he signed in 1990. After Derrida’s death, his widow and sons said they wanted copies of UCI’s archives shared with the Institute of Contemporary Publishing Archives in France. The university had sued in an attempt to get manuscripts and correspondence from Derrida’s widow and children that it believed the philosopher had promised to UC Irvine’s collection, although the suit was dropped in 2007.\n\nThe Irvine Langson Library Special Collections also houses the Paul de Man Papers, a collection of personal and professional papers documenting de Man's work in comparative literature.\n"}
{"id": "54387099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54387099", "title": "Yiddish cinema", "text": "Yiddish cinema\n\nYiddish cinema (; trans. \"Idish-Sprakhige Kino\", \"Idishe Kino\") refers to the film industry in the Yiddish language. Some 130 full-length motion pictures and 30 short ones were produced during its heyday, between 1911 and 1940. Yiddish film almost disappeared after World War II, due to the Holocaust and the linguistic acculturation of Jewish immigrants, though new pictures are still made sporadically.\n\nIn September 1911, at the Minsk Electric Theatre, a Jewish troupe led by one A.M. Smolarsky accompanied a short projection of silent motion pictures with the Yiddish song \"A Brivele der Mamen\" (Letter to Mother). This was the first documented instance that may be considered as Yiddish cinema. At the very same time, short silent films with Yiddish intertitles were already spontaneously being directed for the Jewish public in the Pale of Settlement and Congress Poland. The most notable producer was the Warsaw-based Mordka Towbin, whose studio Siła released four short features adapted from the plays of Jacob Gordin within the year: \"Der Vilder Foter\" (\"Cruel Father\"), with Zina Goldstein and Ester Rachel Kaminska, directed by Marek Arnstein; \"der Metoiref\" (\"The Madman\"); \"Got, mentsh un tayvl\" (\"God, Man and Satan\"); and \"Mirele Efros\". Another series of similar shorts based on plays were directed by a further Warsaw studio, Kosmofilm, founded by Shmuel Ginzberg and Henryk Finkelstein. Both companies employed the prominent actors of the city's Yiddish theater scene. In total, including several ones meted out in Russia, some 20 silent court métrage pictures with Yiddish titles were made before the end of World War I.\n\nThe postwar years saw the production of full-length features. Sidney M. Goldin, born in Odessa as Shmuel Goldstein, directed several films in America before moving to Vienna in the early 1920s and trying his luck with Yiddish. He produced two films: the 1923 \"Mazel Tov\", starring Molly Picon in a comedy of errors about a young American visiting her traditional family in Galicia; and the 1924 \"Yizkor\", with Maurice Schwartz as a Jewish guardsman who rebuffs a Christian noblewoman. In the Soviet Union, two silent Yiddish films were released during the decade. These were Alexander Granovsky's 1925 \"Idishe Glikn\" (\"Jewish Luck\"), based on Sholem Aleichem's wheeler-dealer character Menachem Mendel, starring Solomon Mikhoels, and the 1928 \"Durkh Trennen\" (\"Through Tears\"), which likewise adapted Sholem Aleichem's \"Motl, Peysi the Cantor's Son\" and was directed by Grigori Gritscher-Tscherikower.\n\nIn independent Poland, executive Leo Forbert was responsible for three silent Yiddish features which did well at the box office: \"Tkies Khaf\" (1924), based on S. Ansky's play \"The Dybbuk\", \"Der Lamed-Wownik\" (1925), set in the 1863 January Uprising, and \"In di Poylishe Velder\" (1927). These films were even exported to Romania and other countries for local Jewish audiences. Forbert's productions represented the pinnacle of Yiddish cinema up to that time, and were of relatively high artistic quality. However, they were the last for several years. New York had a thriving Yiddish cultural scene, and in 1926 Maurice Schwartz directed the first American picture in the language, \"Tsebrokhene Hertser\" (\"Broken Hearts\"), based on the play by Jacob Adler and starring Schwartz and Lila Lee.\n\nIn 1929, Sydney M. Goldin returned from Vienna to the Lower East Side, where he formed a partnership with producer Max Cohen. They decided to commence using the already popularized sound technology. In May 1929 they completed \"East Side Sadie\", which had a few scenes with synchronized dialogue: J. Hoberman noted that in fact, it \"contained scarcely more Yiddish than the few words heard in \"The Younger Generation\"\". Then, on 25 October, they released \"Ad Mosay\" (\"Until When\"; English title: \"The Eternal Prayer\"). With a budget of $3,000, this 36-minute musical revue loosely inspired by the 1929 Hebron massacre was the first real Yiddish talkie. Goldin then allied with executive Joseph Seiden, who established the studio Judea Film and was keen on reaching the large Yiddish-speaking immigrant public. The pair produced eight rather short sound pictures within just a year, each within a $3,000 budget and a single day of principal photography. The artistic quality of these films was deemed so low that the Yiddish Actors' Union prohibited its members from appearing in them, lest they damage the union's reputation.\n\nGoldin chose to attempt a more serious – and expensive – approach. He found new investors and, in 1931, spent $20,000 on making the musical \"Zayn Vayb's Liubovnik\" (\"His Own Wife's Lover\"), the first full-length sound feature film in the language. Goldin continued to direct, and though leading as the most prolific Yiddish film director in history with 29 titles, he was joined by a few others in the field. George Roland, for one, created eight Yiddish films in America during the 1930s. New York, with its bustling ethnic cinema industry which aimed to satisfy the immigrants' demand for films in their native languages (from Spanish to Ukrainian), now surpassed Eastern Europe in producing Yiddish-language films.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, while Jewish-themed film was not uncommon, only a single Yiddish sound motion picture was ever produced. This was Boris Shpis' 1932 \"Nosn Beker fort Aheym\" (\"Return of Nathan Beker\"), about a Soviet-Jewish worker who travels to America only to be disillusioned with capitalism. In Poland, Alexander Marten's 1935 \"Al Khet\" (\"For the Sin\") had synchronized sound and was also the country's first Yiddish film after an eight-year hiatus.\n\nThe move to sound was also accompanied by an attempt to reach the market in Mandatory Palestine. However, Yiddish raised the bitter ire of Hebrew-only proponents, who led a vigorous campaign to suppress the language in the country. On 27 September 1930, Goldin's \"A Idishe Mame\" (\"A Jewish Mother\") opened in Tel Aviv. A violent disturbance erupted and the screen was pelted with ink-filled eggs. The distributors backed down and agreed to release the film in a silent format. Ya'akov Davidon dubbed Yiddish films into Hebrew for the next few years, the only way they could be allowed under what Ella Shohat termed \"the unofficial banning of Yiddish in the Yishuv\".\n\nProducer Joseph Green was dissatisfied with the low artistic merit of American Yiddish film. He concluded that in Poland he would be able to minimize production costs and yet have access to first-rate actors and equipment. After enlisting Molly Picon at a relatively astronomical fee of $10,000, he travelled to Warsaw and directed \"Yiddle with His Fiddle\" in 1936. At a total budget of $50,000, the story of a young woman who dresses as a man and joins her father's klezmer band became a worldwide hit among Jewish audiences. Expenses were covered even before its American premiere. The film was exported to Australia, South Africa, and Western Europe, where it was greeted by local Jewish immigrants. While no detailed records were kept, hundreds of thousands of tickets were sold. It was even sent to Nazi Germany, where Jews were banned from Aryan movie theaters and had to hold their own screenings.\n\n\"Yiddle\" commercial success inaugurated a short boom of Yiddish cinema. Convinced there was a large enough market, producer Roman Rebush hired director Edgar G. Ulmer to adapt Peretz Hirschbein's play \"Green Fields\". Hirschbein's piece depicted a scholarly, melancholic \"yeshiva bokhr\" (student) who leaves the study hall to meet \"real Jews\" and falls in love with a peasant's daughter whom he secretly tutors in Hebrew. Ulmer's \"Green Fields\" had an international acclaim rivaling \"Yiddle with his Fiddle\", again with hundreds of thousands (even a million, according to one reporter) of viewers.\n\nGreen and Ulmer both remained in the Yiddish cinema and each directed several other films until the end of the decade. In 1937, Michał Waszyński directed \"The Dybbuk\" in Warsaw. Investors were impressed with the success of \"Le Golem\" and \"The Dybbuk\" was targeted also at non-Jewish viewers, the only Yiddish film conceived so. While not paralleling the sales of \"Yiddle\" or \"Green Fields\", it is considered by most critics as the highest quality and most artistically accomplished production in the history of Yiddish cinema.\n\nThe fourth great Yiddish film of the era was directed by Maurice Schwartz in 1939. \"Tevya\", starring Schwartz as Sholem Aleichem's milkman, had a particularly high budget of $70,000 and a dark, contemplative plot, unlike most Yiddish productions which were popular melodramas. Photographed in Long Island, it became the first non-English production to be selected for preservation by the American National Film Registry in 1991.\n\nIn addition to these four major pieces, more than 20 Yiddish motion pictures were directed in the United States and Poland until 1940. Most were lighthearted comedies or emotional family dramas, like Shimon Dzigan's and Israel Shumacher's 1937 \"Freylikhe Kabtzonim\".\n\nAt the very moment the industry seemed to be gaining momentum, the outbreak of World War II brought it to a complete halt. Six months before the war, Poland's last Yiddish film \"On a Heym\" (\"Homeless\") was released on 21 February 1939. 1940 still saw the completion of six pictures in the United States, including Ulmer's \"Amerikaner Shadkhn\" (\"American Matchmaker\") and \"Der Vilner Balabesl\" (\"Overture to Glory\") starring Moishe Oysher. Joseph Seiden's low-quality \"Mazel Tov, Iden\", an edited compilation of musical numbers, was the last, distributed in 1941.\n\nWith the extermination of Eastern Europe's Jews, Yiddish culture lost the bulk of its audience. In the US, the Americanization of the immigrants' children and their exodus from the East Coast's crowded neighbourhoods to suburbia signaled its demise, as well. In the Soviet Union, most Jews voluntarily eschewed Yiddishist efforts in favour of cultural and linguistic Russification already in the 1930s; their children were raised speaking Russian, and state-led purges destroyed the remaining Yiddishist institutions.\n\nIn 1946, Saul Goskind founded the \"Kinor\" cooperative in Poland, producing newsreels and documentaries in Yiddish. In 1947 and 1948 \"Kinor\" released two full-length films, \"Mir Leben Geblibene\" (\"We Who Remained Alive\") and \"Unzere Kinder\" (\"Our Children\"), directed by Nathan Gross. \"Long Is the Road\" from 1948, the only Yiddish film to be made in Germany, was screened for the audiences at the displaced persons camps. Meanwhile, Yiddish cinema disappeared in the United States along with the other ethnic film industries. The two last commercially distributed American films, \"Got, Mentsh un Tayvl\" (again an adaptation of Gordin's namesake play), and \"Honeymoon in the Catskills\", were released just a week apart on 21 and 27 January 1950. In 1957, a short documentary about the Warsaw Jewish Theatre was the last Yiddish production in Poland.\n\nJoseph Seiden recalled that the few remaining filmmakers had high hopes about a market in the newly independent Israel, but the state, and more so society, enforced a Hebrew-only approach. While official censorship was mild, Yiddish culture was still severely frowned upon and sometimes even legally persecuted; Dzigan and Shumacher had to introduce Hebrew parts into their shows to avoid complications. Ironically, at the very same time, the Israeli government produced two Yiddish short films, though not for internal consumption. \"Dos Getzelt\" (1950) and \"Di Toyer iz Ofen\" (1957) were both produced for the purposes of propaganda and fund-raising among American Jews. Only in the 1960s did the anti-Yiddish cultural climate sufficiently relax to allow the projection of Yiddish films with their original dialogue.\n\nThe language did not disappear from the screen. Apart from select lines in many Jewishly-themed pictures, the 1975 film \"Hester Street\" was mostly in Yiddish as was the 1982 Belgian feature \"Bruxelles-transit\". In 1983 the first Israeli full-length Yiddish film was released, \"Az Men Gibt – Nemt Men\" (\"When They Give – Take\"), directed by Alfred Steinhardt. A second, \"The Last Love of Laura Adler\", about an elderly Yiddish actress dying from cancer, was distributed in 1990. In 2005, the emerging home video industry in Ultra-Orthodox circles also meted out an edutainment Yiddish piece, \"A Gesheft\". In 2008, the student film \"My Father's House\", about two Holocaust survivors during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, was made in Israel. The 2010 \"Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish\" was an independent production which employed formerly ultra-Orthodox nonprofessional actors. The 2014 \"Felix and Meira\" and 2017 \"Menashe\" depicted scenes from the life of Hasidim.\n\n\n"}
