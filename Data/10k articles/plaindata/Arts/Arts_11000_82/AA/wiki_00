Heavily influenced by Marc Chagall, Mike Kelley, Al Feldstein and James Ensor, Vas's work heavily consists of depictions of aggressive and well-hung roosters that represent the masculine element of the American cowboy-culture. Therefore, his pictures are full of references to the American baseball team Cincinnati Reds, MLB, Malcolm Young, the Rolling Stones, Slayer, Metallica, the Black Crowes, Muddy Waters, SUVs, rock and roll and the symbols of the North American imperialist power: the Navistar trucks. Another common theme in his work is the Australian rock group AC/DC, particularly lead singer Brian Johnson. Many of his other artworks are named after AC/DC songs or albums.\n\n"}

{"id": "322740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322740", "title": "Celtic cross", "text": "Celtic cross\n\nThe Celtic cross is a form of Christian cross featuring a nimbus or ring that emerged in Ireland and Britain in the Early Middle Ages. A type of ringed cross, it became widespread through its use in the stone high crosses erected across the islands, especially in regions evangelized by Irish missionaries, from the 9th through the 12th centuries.\n\nA staple of Insular art, the Celtic cross is essentially a Latin cross with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem. Scholars have debated its exact origins, but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings. The form gained new popularity during the Celtic Revival of the 19th century; the name \"Celtic cross\" is a convention dating from that time. The shape, usually decorated with interlace and other motifs from Insular art, became popular for funerary monuments and other uses, and has remained so, spreading well beyond Ireland.\n\nRinged crosses similar to older Continental forms appeared in Ireland and Scotland in incised stone slab artwork and artifacts like the Ardagh chalice. However, the shape achieved its greatest popularity by its use in the monumental stone high crosses, a distinctive and widespread form of Insular art. These monuments, which first appeared in the 9th century, usually (though not always) take the form of a ringed cross on a stepped or pyramidal base. The form has obvious structural advantages, reducing the length of unsupported side arms. There are a number of theories as to its origin in Ireland and Britain. Some scholars consider the ring a holdover from earlier wooden crosses, which may have required struts to support the crossarm. Others have seen it as deriving from indigenous Bronze Age art featuring a wheel or disc around a head, or from early Coptic crosses based on the ankh. However, Michael W. Herren, Shirley Ann Brown, and others believe it originates in earlier ringed crosses in Christian art. Crosses with a ring representing the celestial sphere developed from the writings of the Church Fathers. The \"cosmological cross\" is an important motif in Coelius Sedulius's poem \"Carmen Paschale\", known in Ireland by the 7th century.\n\nIt is not clear where the first high crosses originated. The first examples date to about the 9th century and occur in two groups: at Ahenny in Ireland, and at Iona, an Irish monastery off the Scottish coast. The Ahenny group is generally earlier. However, it is possible that St. Johns Cross at Iona was the first high cross; Iona's influence as a center of pilgrimage may have led this cross to inspire the Ahenny group as well as other ringed crosses in Pictish stones.\n\nA variety of crosses bear inscriptions in ogham: an early medieval Irish alphabet. Standing crosses in Ireland and areas under Irish influence tend to be shorter and more massive than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents, which have mostly lost their headpieces. Irish examples with a head in cross form include the Cross of Kells, Ardboe High Cross, the crosses at Monasterboice, the Cross of the Scriptures, Clonmacnoise and those in Scotland at Iona and the Kildalton Cross, which may be the earliest to survive in good condition. Surviving, free-standing crosses are in Cornwall, including St Piran's cross at Perranporth, and Wales. Other stone crosses are found in the former Northumbria and Scotland, and further south in England, where they merge with the similar Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition, in the Ruthwell Cross for example. Most examples in Britain were destroyed during the Protestant Reformation. By about A.D. 1200 the initial wave of cross building came to an end in Ireland.\n\nPopular legend in Ireland says that the Christian cross was introduced by Saint Patrick or possibly Saint Declan, though there are no examples from this early period. It has often been claimed that Patrick combined the symbol of Christianity with the sun cross to give pagan followers an idea of the importance of the cross. By linking it with the idea of the life-giving properties of the sun, these two ideas were linked to appeal to pagans. Other interpretations claim that placing the cross on top of the circle represents Christ's supremacy over the pagan sun.\n\n\n\nThe Celtic Revival of the mid-19th century led to an increased use and creation of Celtic crosses in Ireland. In 1853, casts of several historical high crosses were exhibited at the Dublin Industrial Exhibition. In 1857, Henry O'Neill published \"Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland\". These two events stimulated interest in the Celtic cross as a symbol for a renewed sense of heritage within Ireland.\n\nNew versions of the high cross were designed for fashionable cemetery monuments in Victorian Dublin in the 1860s. From Dublin, the revival spread to the rest of the country and beyond. Since the Celtic Revival, the ringed cross became an emblem of Celtic identity, in addition to its more traditional religious symbolism.\n\nModern interest in the symbol increased because of Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie. The two worked on the Isle of Iona in Scotland from 1899 to 1940 and popularised use of the Celtic cross in jewelry. Using the Celtic cross in fashion is still popular today.\n\nSince its revival in the 1850s, the Celtic cross has been used extensively as grave markers. Straying from medieval usage, when the symbol was typically used for a public monument. The Celtic cross now appears in various retail items. Both the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Northern Ireland national football team have used versions of the Celtic cross in their logos and advertising. The Church in Wales since 1954 have used a flag with a Celtic cross in the centre.\n\n"}

The piece describes a lone cello player playing a forgotten Christmas carol in war-torn Sarajevo.\n\n\"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\" consists of four sections, alternating between soft and loud, as well as between the two component pieces in the medley. Part one consists of \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" performed on a cello, accompanied only by a picked electric guitar and a flute in round. After a short ritard, part two abruptly begins, with \"Shchedryk\" (recognizable in the English-speaking world as the melody from \"Carol of the Bells\") being played at full volume, full orchestration and the synthesizers and electric guitars taking lead melody. The time signature also abruptly shifts from cut time to a driving triple meter, which persists through the rest of the piece.\n\nAfter a short transition, the third section consists of a piano solo, featuring motifs from both melodies being played simultaneously, with light string backing that builds through the section. The transition to the fourth and final section is again abrupt; the final section closely resembles the second, with \"Shchedryk\" being the central melody, again led by guitar and synthesizer with piano added. The coda consists of backing strings continuing softly after the fourth section ends, fading to a close.\n\nBoth of the tunes used in \"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\" were in the public domain in 1995: \"Shchedryk\" was released in 1918 (although the English lyrics to \"Carol of the Bells,\" dating to 1936, were still under copyright and were not included in the recording), while \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\" dated back several centuries.\n\nPaul O'Neill explained the story behind Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24 in an interview published on ChristianityToday.com:\n\nOn the week ending January 6, 1996, \"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24)\" (with the artist listed as \"Savatage\") both debuted and peaked at No. 34 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Adult Contemporary Track Chart. With the artist name changed to Trans-Siberian Orchestra, the song charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 again in the first weeks of January 1997 and January 1998, peaking at No. 49 both times. The song also charted on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart on the week ending January 3, 1998, peaking at No. 29.\n\nAs of November 25, 2016, total sales of the digital track stand at 1,300,000 downloads according to Nielsen SoundScan, placing it third on the list of all-time best-selling Christmas/holiday digital singles in SoundScan history.\n\n"}

It cannot be determined with certainty when was it constructed. According to some, it was built in the 9th century. However, the information board near the church says that it was built in the 12th century.\n\nChurch has a four-leafed cruciform layout, square entrance and base with a dome covering it. Present-day appearance is undoubtedly significantly different from the previous, when it was covered with carved stone from the outside, which can still be seen only at the bottom. It was probably decorated with mosaics and frescoes from the inside. It seems as if the unskilled master built it entirely spontaneously with no accurate measures and models.\n\nChurch was first mentioned in year 1565 when the Bishop Petar Bembo visited the area, and had examined witnesses which stated that the church was donated by bishop Donat a Turre (1484-1515) to the owners of terrains around Kornić. After his death, they have sold terrains which was followed by the period of edifices deterioration. During the visit of bishop Donat, a poor condition of church was determined. It was mentioned that it didn't have floor nor the door, while only preserved was altar.\n\nChurch is dedicated to St. Dunat (not to be mistaken with Donatus of Zadar), an early Christian saint who was martyred during the persecution of emperor Julian the Apostate in the second half of the 4th century. It is not known whom it was originally dedicated to.\n\nIn addition to previously mentioned churches poor state, there is no other information about it so it can be assumed that it wasn't used for holding Holy Mass but was in the process of deterioration over the years. Church was restored in 1914 thanks to the Austrian conservator Anton Gnirs from Pula. However, immediately after World War II it was again damaged. Namely, in the immediate vicinity of the church was an inn of Maračić family where Yugoslav Partisans stored their weapons and ammunition during the war. On 3 October 1945 the explosion that badly damaged church, namely its dome, occurred. The explosion was so strong that it was heard all over the island. 15 islanders who have sought refuge in the surrounding fields and along the coast were killed while the area of the inn turned into a crater. Three years later, the church was restored to its present-day appearance. The renovation was led by the architect . At the site of the former inn was built anotherone while a small harbor was built nearby.\n\n"}
{"id": "7604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7604", "title": "Code of Hammurabi", "text": "Code of Hammurabi\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian code of law of ancient Mesopotamia, dated back to about 1754 BC (Middle Chronology). It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code. A partial copy exists on a 2.25 metre (7.5 ft) stone stele. It consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" (\"lex talionis\") as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free, man or woman.\n\nNearly half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon for example. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and reproductive behaviour. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A few provisions address issues related to military service.\n\nThe code was discovered by modern archaeologists in 1901, and its \"editio princeps\" translation published in 1902 by Jean-Vincent Scheil. This nearly complete example of the code is carved into a basalt stele in the shape of a huge index finger, tall. The code is inscribed in the Akkadian language, using cuneiform script carved into the stele. \n\nIt is currently on display in the Louvre, with replicas in numerous institutions, including the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, the Clendening History of Medicine Library & Museum at the University of Kansas Medical Center, the library of the Theological University of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, the Pergamon Museum of Berlin, the Arts Faculty of the University of Leuven in Belgium, the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, and the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania, and Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.\n\nHammurabi ruled for nearly 42 years, from about 1792 to 1749 BC according to the Middle chronology. In the preface to the law, he states, \"Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I should rule over the black-headed people like Shamash, and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind.\" On the stone slab are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws. Some of these laws follow along the rules of \"an eye for an eye\".\n\nIt had been taken as plunder by the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte in the 12th century BC and was taken to Susa in Elam (located in the present-day Khuzestan Province of Iran) where it was no longer available to the Babylonian people. However, when Cyrus the Great brought both Babylon and Susa under the rule of his Persian Empire, and placed copies of the document in the Library of Sippar, the text became available for all the peoples of the vast Persian Empire to view.\n\nIn 1901, Egyptologist Gustave Jéquier, a member of an expedition headed by Jacques de Morgan, found the stele containing the Code of Hammurabi during archaeological excavations at the ancient site of Susa in Khuzestan.\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi was one of the only sets of laws in the ancient Near East and also one of the first forms of law. The code of laws was arranged in orderly groups, so that all who read the laws would know what was required of them. Earlier collections of laws include the Code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (c. 2050 BC), the Laws of Eshnunna (c. 1930 BC) and the codex of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c. 1870 BC), while later ones include the Hittite laws, the Assyrian laws, and Mosaic Law.\nThese codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.\nThe Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period. The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government – i.e., a primitive constitution. The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.\n\nWhile the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves.\n\nPunishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status. For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required. Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.\n\nVarious copies of portions of the Code of Hammurabi have been found on baked clay tablets, some possibly older than the celebrated basalt stele now in the Louvre. The Prologue of the Code of Hammurabi (the first 305 inscribed squares on the stele) is on such a tablet, also at the Louvre (Inv #AO 10237). Some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by Hammurabi may imply that it is older than the famous stele (currently dated to the early 18th century BC). Likewise, the Museum of the Ancient Orient, part of the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, also has a \"Code of Hammurabi\" clay tablet, dated to 1790 BC, in (Room 5, Inv # Ni 2358).\n\nIn July 2010, archaeologists reported that a fragmentary Akkadian cuneiform tablet was discovered at Tel Hazor, Israel, containing a c. 1700 BC text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the Hammurabi code. The Hazor law code fragments are currently being prepared for publication by a team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nThe laws covered such subjects as:\n\nOne of the best known laws from Hammurabi's code was:\n\nHammurabi had many other punishments, as well. If a son strikes his father, his hands shall be hewn off. Translations vary.\n\nAdultery\n\nEx. Law # 129: \"If the wife of a man has been caught lying with another man, they shall bind them and throw them into the waters. If the owner of the wife would save his wife then in turn the king could save his servant.\"\n\n"}

These costumes show their social status and background.\n\nPantalone typically wore tight red pants and a matching shirt, a long black cape, black or red pointed shoes, and a belt that had a purse attached. Pantalone also carried a knife and handkerchief, and wore glasses. His hat sat very close to his head, and did not have a brim – very much like a skullcap. He might also wear a codpiece.\n\nIl Dottore was dressed almost entirely in black – shoes, pants, shirt, robe, belt, and hat – broken only by a white handkerchief, white ruffled collar, white cuffs on his sleeves, or maybe white socks. The pants came to his knees, as did the full cloak that stood out, like a dress with a petticoat. His hat could either be small and look like a skullcap, or larger and floppy with a wide brim.\n\nIl Capitano did not have a consistent dress code, but he did have a consistent costume theme. He wore the current soldiers' outfit from a foreign country. Sometimes his clothes were slashed to show that he had been in battle. His hat was overdone and typically had large feathers sticking out of it. Ribbons and shiny buttons often cluttered his clothes. He always carried a sword, and in the seventeenth century the sword upgraded to a gun. Every Il Capitano costume also included a coat or cloak, that he could fling off in a moment of rage or passion.\n\nThe Lovers wore whatever was the latest fashion. They wore a lot of makeup, but tastefully done to match the elaborate outfits. They never wore masks.\n\nPulcinella always had white baggy pants and shirt, large buttons on the shirt, and a piece under his garments that made his belly appear very large. His clothes were held on by a rope belt, where a dagger and purse would hang. A humpback piece was sometimes used. He also wore a mask that depicted a large, sometimes broken nose. His hat was short and fluffy.\n\nHarlequin's costume has varied over time. At first, in the mid sixteen century, his clothes were light colored and baggy, with red, yellow, and green patches with no particular pattern. His facial hair suggested a younger man for a few years, but then a fuller beard was worn later. He had a black mask and a feathered white hat. About a hundred years later, his signature outfit changed to include white stripes and colored diamonds, or triangles instead of patches. For the next 200 years, the suit got tighter, and a black belt was added. He wore a hat with two points, and his clothes had lots of sparkles. By the twentieth century, all the sparkles, collar ruffles, and large fancy hats were gone. Arlecchino wore a very small hat, the mask was sometimes swapped out for a face-painted diamond, and the costume pattern became entirely made up of diamonds with a small bow or collar.\n\nBrighella wore a servant's suit of rough off-white fabric, trimmed with green on the sides of his pants and down the front of his long shirt. His mask had a hooked nose, beard, and mustache. His dagger was worn at his belt.\n\nCoviello had a lighter beige mask with a large nose, and his white costume had bells attached.\n\nMezzettino wore servant's clothes with red stripes, but without the common servant's mask.\n\nZanni was the main servant, who wore large loose pants and a shirt that had a hood.\n\nScapino wore outfits with white and green stripes, and his mask had a hooked nose and pointed beard.\n\nPierrot had loose white clothing, with a large matching collar. He painted his face white instead of wearing a mask.\n\nPedrolino's costume was essentially like Pierrot's – white, big buttons, short hat, and white face – but it was way too big for him, and the sleeves covered his hands, to emphasize that Pedrolino was a little person in hand-me-downs.\n\nColumbina's costume reflected her current master's, but included an apron. She wore no mask, but instead a bonnet, and her skirts were of different colors.\n\nScaramouche wore black clothes without a mask. Defiant eyebrows and a powdered face accompanied the large black mustache. He had a white collar, and a large loose hat that hung down over his neck.\n\nTartaglia wore a black hat and very thick glasses.\n\nRosetta was Pulcinella's maid or wife, who wore a dress with patches, like the early Arrlechino.\n\nTrivelino was a Zanni who dressed in the Arlecchino fashion.\n"}

First performed in honor of the quincentenary anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival to the Americas, the work sought to make visible the history of abuse, captivity and exploitation of indigenous peoples. Their inspiration drew heavily upon the history of othering, the human zoo, and life stories of historical figures such as Ota Benga and Sarah Baartman—beginning with the kidnapping of Arawak Indian by Columbus and his men to be displayed in the Spanish Court.\n\nPresenting themselves as previously undiscovered Amerindians from the fictional uncolonized island of Guatinau, Fusco and Gómez-Peña presented a fabricated Encyclopædia Britannica entry on \"Amerindians\" and a corresponding map of the Gulf of Mexico island of Guatinau as part of the staging of their performance. This information was further supplemented both by plaques or pedestals alluding to the history of peoples placed on exhibit over the last 500 years. Other texts provided also narrated their role as volunteer representatives of Guatinau, detailing the daily life activities of the Amerindians, and validating the habitat of the cage and its contents as their natural habitat.\n\nAided by the students of the University of California-Irvine, the artists erected a cage and filled it with a ghetto blaster, candles, Polaroid camera and film, bed pans, ritual artifacts, spray paint, body paint, a television and hammock. Students and institutional staff members served as guards and assistants to the caged couple: feeding them, educating the audience about their origins, and assisting audience members in taking commemorative Polaroids with the caged performers. Those acting as docents or guards also were responsible for the daily disposal of cage waste, feeding the performers, and escorting them to the bathroom on a leash.\n\nGómez-Peña and Fusco were outfitted in primitive costumes: designer sunglasses, a cheetah luchador mask, banda boots, face paint, long wigs, grass skirt, necklaces, a leopard bikini top and Converse low sneakers.\n\nThe caged artists performed \"traditional\" Guatinau tasks: watching television, sewing voodoo dolls, using a laptop computer, pacing back and forth, eating or being fed fruit, and drinking bottled water and Coca-Cola Classic.\n\nIn stark contrast to works from their own practices and from other collaborations, the artists remained silent during the performances, apart from Gómez-Peña, who would recite traditional stories in a fictitious nonsensical language in return for donations. By the last performance, these \"traditional stories\" chronicled the Guatinaui tour of the West, with the nonsensical outpouring peppered with recognizable words like \"Chicago\", \"Mexico\", \"Minnesota\" and \"America\".\n\nAs \"Take One\" of \"The Year of the White Bear,\" held at the Fine Arts Gallery of UC-Irvine from February 24 - March 4, 1992, with performances held all day March 1, 2, 3 with \"ritual events\" at 7:30 on the 3rd and 4th Before the performance the artists were contacted by the Health Department of UC-Irvine due to the misunderstanding that they were anthropologists bringing in \"real aborigines\" whose excrement could be hazardous. One woman went so far as to ask for a rubber glove in order to fondle Gómez-Peña in a sexual manner. Approximately 1,000 individuals saw these performances.\n\nSelected for the Edge Biennial, the artists took their performance to a much more public context in Columbus Plaza of May 1992. Edge '92, taking place in both London and Madrid, was planned as a quincentennial celebration of Madrid as a hub of European culture. Spanish businessmen reverted to childhood, mocking the performers with ape noises, while school children compared the performers to the wax Arawak figures housed in the museum across the street. Teenagers also attempted to burn Gómez-Peña while handing him a beer bottle filled with urine. Men donated to see Fusco dance, explaining that they wanted to see her breasts. More than half of the people believed the performance to be a real display of Amerindians.\n\nThree days after Madrid, the pair performed in Covent Gardens. Covent Gardens as a venue has a history as a location where people of color have been exhibited, starting from the 17th century through to the 18th century. It was even the venue for the play \"Omai\", inspired by the Omai, a Tahitian native who embodied the idea of the noble savage. During the performance a group of neo-nazis attempted to rattle the cage.\n\nExhibited as part of their show \"The Year of the White Bear\", the performance took place outside in the Sculpture Garden of the Walker Art Center in September 1992. 15,000 visitors saw the performance and exhibition. Many audience members believed the performance to be real. This is the first of two instances in which the work was clearly presented in an art context.\n\nOn view from October 17-18th, 1992, the performance reached approximately 120,000 visitors over a two-day period. The performance confused many museum goers who questioned the authenticity, and who were even more perplexed when docents continued to keep up the performance. One alarmed attendee even called the Humane Society to seek assistance in freeing the caged couple.\n\nIn December 1992 the artists performed at the Australian Museum of Natural History, with approximately 5,000 visitors; staff members here became uneasy after Japanese tourists left the museum deeply disturbed, fearing this would result in negative press for the museum. One woman sat down with her young child to loudly apologize to the performers for having \"taken [their] land away\".\n\nFrom January 16–17, 1993 Gómez-Peña and Fusco performed at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, aided by Field Museum \"docents\" played by Paula Killen, Claire DeCoster and Pablo Helguera. Following a script written by the artists, DeCoster and Helguera encouraged the audience's questions and analysis while members of the museum's education department surveyed visitors. This was a devastating experience for the docents, as they witnessed the large majority of the audience persistently ignore the plaques on either side of the cage and believe the Amerindians to be real. Approximately 5,000 people attended, with the Field Museum receiving 48 phone calls regarding the misinformation the public believed was due to the Field Museum.\n\n\"The Couple in the Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West\" ended its tour as a selection of the 1993 Whitney Biennial, an exhibition noted to be one of the most consciousness-raising in the history of the Biennial. In addition to the traditional Guatinaui tasks Gómez-Peña and Fusco consistently performed, the artists offered views of Gómez-Peña's genitals for donations of five dollars a view, and a native dance to hip hop music for fifty cents. This was the one of the two instances in which the work was clearly presented and contextualized as artwork during the entirety of its tour. Despite this, some attendees assumed the artists were actors performing in a work by an artist.\n\nCriticism for \"The Couple in a Cage\" varied upon the location of the presentation, though what alarmed the artists most was the substantial public belief that their performances were reality and the substantial number of critics who critiqued their work as unethical due to its misrepresentation, rather than to fully discuss its cultural and institutional critique.\n\nDespite a substantial number of intellectuals remaining critical towards the misinformation of the performances, performative scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett points out that Gómez-Peña's and Fusco's were not the first to fictionalize ethnography, but rather participate inside a previously established history.\n\nThe performance gained further recognition and criticism through its participation in the 1993 Whitney Biennial; despite reflecting the political times, art critic Roberta Smith disparaged that the exhibition lost sight of art as a visual experience in its motivations to further a cause.\n\nIn stark contrast to the Western response, people of color responded either in distaste due to the inauthenticity of the performance, discomfort in identifying with the experience, or solidarity in its symbolism: \"One Pueblo elder from Arizona who saw us in the Smithsonian went so far as to say that our display was more \"real\" than any other statement about the condition of Native peoples in the Museum.\" -Coco Fusco, \"The Other History of Intercultural Performance\"\n"}

Housed in the Dumbarton Oaks collection, United States, the figurine is considered by several scholars to be a pre-Columbian artwork, while others believe it was made in modern times, possibly in the 19th century. The figurine measures 20.2 cm in height.\n\nBirthing figures, while common in Colonial Mexican manuscripts, are rare in Aztec three-dimensional art. Women, however, occupied a prominent position in the Aztec mythology.\n\nEarly mentions of the figurine come from Ernest-Théodore Hamy, who first saw it in a Paris antique store. The figurine was later bought by French obstetrician and collector Alban Ribemont-Dessaignes. In 1947, the figure was acquired by Robert Woods Bliss, the founder of Dumbarton Oaks.\n\nThe first scholarly article about the figurine was written by Ernest-Théodore Hamy in 1899 and called it \"absolutely unique in the history of Mexican art\". In 1906, Hamy published an article in the \"Journal de la Société des Américanistes\" writing that the figurine is of pre-Columbian Mexican origin and represents the Aztec goddess Ixcuina, also known as Tlazolteotl. Scholars such as Pal Kelemen, Miguel Covarrubias, John Alden Mason, Michael D. Coe and Jeffrey Quilter also considered the figurine to be authentic. Others, such as Claude-François Baudez and Esther Pasztory, question the figurine's stylistic features. The authenticity was also questioned on the basis of technical virtuosity compared to the technical limitations of pre-Columbian artisans. According to Jane MacLaren Walsh, \"the essential nature of the sculpture is almost completely anomalous with regard to the accepted canon of Mexica art, and does not in fact resemble any other Mesoamerican art form\" and \"the choice of stone, the complicated carving in the round, the birthing position, the facial expression of the mother, the somewhat grotesque realism, the lack of iconographic detail all point to a highly idiosyncratic work\".\n\n"}

Quickly designed and programmed in Applesoft BASIC primarily by co-founder Sherwin Steffin, most of these text-based programs were dropped from Edu-Ware's catalog when the company began developing products featuring high-resolution graphics in 1981.\n\n\"E.S.P.\" is a game giving players the opportunity to find out whether they possess extrasensory perception. While displaying a constantly changing graphic design on the screen, the program briefly flashes emotionally charged words, randomly chosen from a word list, on the screen. The program then asks a series of questions to determine if the player's attitudes have been influenced by the subliminal messages. A file-builder is included to allow players to insert new words in the data base.\n\nThe program was offered in both a stand-alone disk version and a compendium, along with \"E.S.P.\" and \"Zintar\", called Party-Pak I. However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.\n\"Metri-Vert\" is an analytical program performing metric conversion calculations for length/distance, area, volume weight and temperature. The program features a display page storing up to twenty conversions for easy reading and recall.\n\"Perception\" is a puzzle game consisting of three games designed to challenge and improve players' visual skills. The first involves using game paddles to draw lines matching those drawn by the computer. The second, based on a World War II test for spy candidates, tests players' power of observation by showing them only small glimpses of an abstract object as a narrow mask travels over it and then asking them to choose from among several objects what they had just seen. The third modules tests player's visual memory by requiring them to distinguish sizes of identical shapes. Players have control over the shape, display time, and presentation format.\n\nOriginally developed by Steffin before founding Edu-Ware, he wrote a second version of the program soon after establishing the publishing company. The program was offered as both a stand-alone versions, and in a compendium, along with \"Statistics\" and \"Compu-Read\", called Edu-Pak I. Edu-Ware upgraded the program to high respolution graphics using its EWS3 graphics engine in 1982, renaming it \"Perception 3.0\", which was featured in the company's catalogs until 1984.\n\"Rescue\" is a low-resolution graphics action game in which the player uses game paddles move his spaceship to intercept with a damaged ship randomly floating around the screen.

Edu-Ware described it as being \"more than just a mad-libs game\" because it described and made use of all parts of speech.\n\"Subliminal\" is a game testing whether players are influenced by subliminal messages. While the player is watching a constantly changing graphic design, the program quickly flashes an emotionally changed word on the screen. The player then answers a series of questions to determine whether his attitudes has been affected by the subliminal message. The program includes a file builder for modifying the data base from which the program randomly chooses the words to display.\n\nThe program was offered in both disk and cassette stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with \"Zintar\", called Party-Pak I.

In each round, the program would display a number on the screen and allow the player to type another number in response. The program would then use both numbers in a formula to determine the winner for that round, and the side that won the most number of rounds would win the game. The challenge for the player was to determine the formula the program was using to determine the winner in each round.\n\nThe program was offered in both disk and cassette stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with \"Rescue\", called Rescue/War, but was dropped from Edu-Ware's product line by the time its March 1, 1980 catalog was issued.\n\"Zintar\" is a drinking game in which players are instructed by the computer (randomly) to \"take hits\" while watching a series of color and black & white graphics. A scoreboard kept track and designated the player who had been assigned the most hits as \"The Mayor\". It was Pederson's first Apple II program written strictly for fun; Sherwin Steffin supplied the graphics. Edu-Ware offered it for sale after being encouraged by an early mail order distributor.

{"id": "1241914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1241914", "title": "Erin Brockovich (film)", "text": "Erin Brockovich (film)\n\nErin Brockovich is a 2000 American biographical film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Susannah Grant. The film is a dramatization of the true story of Erin Brockovich, portrayed by Julia Roberts, who fought against the energy corporation Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). The film was a box office success, and critical reaction was positive.\n\nRoberts won the Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and various critics awards for Best Actress. The film itself was also nominated for Best Picture and Best Director for Steven Soderbergh at the 73rd Academy Awards. He won that year, but for directing the film \"Traffic\". Early in the film the real Erin Brockovich has a cameo appearance as a waitress named Julia.\n\nIn 1993, Erin Brockovich is an unemployed single mother of three children who has recently been injured in a traffic accident with a doctor and is suing him. Her lawyer, Ed Masry, expects to win, but Erin's explosive courtroom behavior under cross-examination loses her the case, and Ed will not return her phone calls afterwards. One day, he arrives at work to find her in the office, apparently working. She says that he told her things would work out and they did not, and that she needed a job. Smart and hardworking she asks Ed for a job, which he reluctantly gives her. \n\nErin is given files for a real estate case where the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is offering to purchase the home of Donna Jensen, a resident of Hinkley, California. Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&E correspondence together. Donna appreciates PG&E's help: she has had several tumors and her husband has Hodgkin's lymphoma, but PG&E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense. Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, \"because of the chromium\". Erin begins digging into the case and finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is seriously contaminated with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, but PG&E has been telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium. After several days away from the office investigating, she finds her possessions missing from her desk. She is then informed by Brenda, Mr. Masry's secretary, that she has been fired. \n\nRehired, she continues her research, and over time, visits many Hinkley residents and wins their trust. She finds many cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley. Everyone has been treated by PG&E's doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the \"safe\" chromium. The Jensens' claim for compensation grows into a major class action lawsuit, but the direct evidence only relates to PG&E's Hinkley plant, not to the senior management.\n\nKnowing that PG&E could slow any settlement for years through delays and appeals, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for disposition by binding arbitration, but a large majority of the plaintiffs must agree to this. Erin returns to Hinkley and persuades all 634 plaintiffs to go along. While she is there, a man named Charles Embry approaches her to say that he and his cousin were PG&E employees, but his cousin recently died from the poison. The man says he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&E, but, \"as it turns out,\" he \"wasn't a very good employee\".\n\nEmbry gives Erin the documents, which include a 1966 memo proving corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley operation to keep this secret. The judge orders PG&E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million to be distributed among the plaintiffs.\n\nIn the aftermath, Ed hands Erin her bonus payment for the case but warns her he has changed the amount. She explodes into a complaint that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to find that he has increased it—to $2 million.\n\n\nThe film was shot during eleven weeks with five weeks taking place in Ventura, California.\n\n\"Erin Brockovich\" performed well with test audiences but executives at Universal Studios were worried that audiences would be turned off by the title character's use of profane language.\n\n\"Erin Brockovich\" was released on March 17, 2000, in 2,848 theaters and grossed $28.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $126.6 million in North America and $130.7 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $257.3 million.\n\nThe majority of critics responded favorably towards the film, with Roberts's performance receiving positive reviews. It holds a certified \"Fresh\" rating of 84% on film review website Rotten Tomatoes and 73 metascore on Metacritic. In his review for \"The New York Observer\", Andrew Sarris wrote, \"We get the best of independent cinema and the best of mainstream cinema all in one package. \"Erin Brockovich\", like \"Wonder Boys\" right before it, makes the year 2000 seem increasingly promising for movies\". \"Newsweek\" magazine's David Ansen began his review with, \"Julia Roberts is flat-out terrific in \"Erin Brockovich\".\" Furthermore, he wrote, \"Roberts has wasted her effervescence on many paltry projects, but she hits the jackpot this time. Erin, single mother of three, a former Miss Wichita who improbably rallies a community to take on a multi-billion-dollar corporation, is the richest role of her career, simultaneously showing off her comic, dramatic and romantic chops\". \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's Peter Travers wrote, \"Roberts shows the emotional toll on Erin as she tries to stay responsible to her children and to a job that has provided her with a first taste of self-esteem\". In his review for \"Entertainment Weekly\", Owen Gleiberman gave the film a \"B+\" rating and wrote, \"It's a delight to watch Roberts, with her flirtatious sparkle and undertow of melancholy, ricochet off Finney's wonderfully jaded, dry-as-beef-jerky performance as the beleaguered career attorney who knows too much about the loopholes of his profession to have much faith left in it\". \"Sight & Sound\" magazine's Andrew O'Hehir wrote, \"Perhaps the best thing about this relaxed and supremely engaging film (for my money the best work either the director or his star has ever done) is that even its near-fairytale resolution doesn't offer a magical transformation\". In her review for \"The Village Voice\", Amy Taubin wrote, \"What's pretty original about the picture is that it focuses an investigative drama based on a true story around a comic performance\".\n\nHowever, film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a two-star review, writing, \"There is obviously a story here, but \"Erin Brockovich\" doesn't make it compelling. The film lacks focus and energy, the character development is facile and thin\". In his review for \"The New York Times\", A.O. Scott wrote, \"After proving, for about 40 minutes, what a marvelous actress she can be, Ms. Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and phony populism\". \"Time\" magazine's Richard Corliss found the film to be \"slick, grating and false. We bet it makes a bundle\".\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on August 15, 2000.\n\n\"Erin Brockovich\" received numerous awards. The Broadcast Film Critics Association, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and National Board of Review voted Julia Roberts Best Actress of the year. The National Society of Film Critics voted Steven Soderbergh Best Director for his work on both \"Traffic\" and \"Erin Brockovich\".\n\n\"Erin Brockovich\" received four Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director (Soderbergh), Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Roberts), and Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture (Albert Finney). Julia Roberts went on to win the only award for the film for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. The film received five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Soderbergh), Best Actress (Roberts), Best Supporting Actor (Finney), and Best Original Screenplay (Susannah Grant). Roberts won Best Actress, the only Academy Award the film received. However, Soderbergh lost out to himself for his work on the film \"Traffic\".\n\nFor her portrayal, Roberts became the first actress to win an Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe Award, National Board of Review, Screen Actors Guild Award, and awards for a single performance.\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\n\nOn her website, Brockovich says the film is \"probably 98% accurate\". While the general facts of the story are accurate, there are some minor discrepancies between actual events and the movie, as well as a number of controversial and disputed issues more fundamental to the case. In the film, Erin Brockovich appears to deliberately use her cleavage to seduce the water board attendant to allow her to access the documents. Brockovich has acknowledged that her cleavage may have had an influence, but denies consciously trying to influence individuals in this way. In the film, Ed Masry represents Erin Brockovich in the car crash case. In reality, it was his law partner, Jim Vititoe. Brockovich had never been Miss Wichita; she had been Miss Pacific Coast. According to Brockovich, this detail was deliberately changed by Soderbergh as he thought it was \"cute\" to have her be beauty queen of the region from which she came. The \"not so good employee\" that met Brockovich in the bar was Chuck Ebersohl. He told Erin about the documents that he and Lillian Melendez had been tasked by PG&E to destroy.\n\nThe scientific accuracy of the film has been questioned. According to \"The New York Times\", scientists have suggested that their profession would have more rationally and scientifically evaluated the medical evidence that inspired Brockovich. One scientist who spoke to the paper urged audiences to ask themselves if the science supports the film's assertions.\n\n"}
{"id": "369910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=369910", "title": "Erotic art", "text": "Erotic art\n\nErotic art covers any artistic work that is intended to evoke erotic arousal or that depicts scenes of sexual activity. It is a type of erotica and includes drawings, engravings, films, paintings, photographs, and sculptures, and writing.\n\nThe definition of erotic art is somewhat subjective, and dependent on context, since perceptions of both what is \"erotic\" and what is \"art\" vary. For example, a sculpture of a phallus in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate sex education may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic.\n\nA distinction is often made between erotic art and pornography, which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal, but is not usually considered fine art. Some draw a distinction based on the work's intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously wrote that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, \"I know it when I see it\"\n\nAmong the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are Paleolithic cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plaques from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar. Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.\n\nDepictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The Turin Erotic Papyrus (Papyrus 55001) is a by Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at Deir el-Medina, the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The men in the illustrations are \"scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy\" with exaggeratedly large genitalia and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness, but the women are nubile and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic iconography, such as convolvulus leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with Hathor, the goddess of love, such as lotus flowers, monkeys, and sistra. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC) and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.\n\nThe ancient Greeks painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are numerous sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in Pompeii. The Moche of Peru in South America are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery. There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics (Moche culture) in Lima at the Larco Museum.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a long tradition of erotic painting in Eastern cultures. In Japan, for example, shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented. Similarly, the erotic art of China reached its popular peak during the latter part of the Ming Dynasty. In India, the famous Kama Sutra is an ancient sex manual that is still popularly read throughout the world.\n\nIn Europe, starting with the Renaissance, there was a tradition of producing erotica for the amusement of the aristocracy. In the early 16th century, the text \"I Modi\" was a woodcut album created by the designer Giulio Romano, the engraver Marcantonio Raimondi and the poet Pietro Aretino. In 1601 Caravaggio painted the \"Amor Vincit Omnia,\" for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.\n\nAn erotic cabinet, ordered by Catherine the Great, seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the Gatchina Palace. The furniture was highly eccentric with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture. The walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then. A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the Peterhof Palace and not in Gatchina.\n\nThe tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as Fragonard, Courbet, Millet, Balthus, Picasso, Edgar Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec and Egon Schiele. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.\n\nBy the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like Taschen mass-produced erotic illustrations and erotic photography.\n\nToday, erotic artists thrive, although in some circles, much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. During the last few centuries, society has broadened its view of what can be considered as art and several new styles developed during the 19th century such as Impressionism and Realism. This has given today's artists a broad variety of genres from which to choose, including; fantasy, pinup, horror, fetish, comics, anime, hentai, and many other niche genres all with erotic elements.\n\nClassic \"war-era\" pin-ups like the works of Alberto Vargas, Gil Elvgren and Baron Von Lind, are still as popular as their contemporaries: Bunny Yeager, Greg Hildebrandt, Olivia De Berardinis, Hajime Sorayama, Alain Aslan, and others.\n\nThe acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. Frank Frazetta, Luis Royo, Boris Vallejo, Chris Achilleos, and Clyde Caldwell are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed. The Guild of Erotic Artists were formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015 sexologist and gallerist Laura Henkel, curator of the Erotic Heritage Museum and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art. In 2015 Henkel collaborated with former MoMA curator and art historian Rosa JH Berland to create the Modern Provocateur Manifesto, that describes artwork that is about human sexuality.\n\nWhether or not an instance of erotic art is obscene depends on the standards of the jurisdisction and community in which it is displayed.\n\nIn the United States, the 1973 ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Miller v. California\" established a three-tiered test to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the First Amendment.\n\nDelivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote, \nThe basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\nAs this is still much more vague than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the \"contemporary community standards\" are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.\n\n"}
{"id": "41428412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41428412", "title": "Esquiline Treasure", "text": "Esquiline Treasure\n\nThe Esquiline Treasure is an ancient Roman silver treasure that was found in 1793 on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. The hoard is considered an important example of late antique silver work from the 4th century AD, probably about 380 for the major pieces. Since 1866, 57 objects, representing the great majority of the treasure, have been in the British Museum.\n\nTwo of the most important objects in the treasure are the ornate silver-gilt engraved boxes known as the \"Projecta Casket\" and the \"Muse Casket\". The treasure was part of the belongings of a wealthy Roman household of high social status, which can probably be identified. The collection includes 8 plates (4 circular and 4 rectangular), a fluted dish, a ewer inscribed for \"Pelegrina\", a flask with embossed scenes, an amphora, 6 sets of horse trappings, with furniture fittings including 4 tyche figures representing the 4 main cities of the Roman Empire: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch and Alexandria, two hands clenching bannisters, and an assortment of jewellery.\n\nAlthough a number of large late Roman hoards have been discovered, most are from the fringes of the empire (such as Roman Britain), and very few objects from the period can be presumed to have been made by silversmiths in Rome itself, giving the Esquiline Treasure a \"special significance\". This major hoard is displayed in room 41 of the British Museum alongside the Carthage Treasure and near the British finds of the Mildenhall Treasure, Hoxne Hoard, Water Newton Treasure and the Corbridge Lanx. It has been observed that the majority of the major surviving late Roman silver hoards are in the British Museum.\n\nIn the summer of 1793 workers encountered a large collection of silver objects during excavation work at the foot of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, which had been the area favoured by the Roman aristocracy for their houses throughout the Roman period. These items were found in the ruins of a Roman building, which was at that time in the premises of the monastery of San Francesco di Paola in Rome. The first official record of the finds was made one year after their discovery by the famous Italian classical archaeologist and later head of the Capitoline Museum Ennio Quirino Visconti.\n\nThe treasure passed through many hands before eventually being acquired by the French collector and one-time ambassador to Rome the Duc de Blacas. In 1866 his collection was sold in its entirety to the British Museum. However, two other items in the treasure can be found in the Musee du Petit Palais in Paris (a highly decorated \"trulla\" or saucepan), and the Museo Nazionale in Naples (a jug in the form of a women's head).\n\nThe so-called Projecta Casket (M&ME 1866,12-29,1) is one of the most famous and magnificent examples of silver craftsmanship from late antiquity in Rome. It is partially gilded to highlight some areas, and was made by the repoussé technique - that is the ornamented relief was achieved by means of pressing or pushing back the metal surface. The box is 55.9 cm long, 28.6 cm high and 43.2 cm wide and has a weight of 8.2 kg. The base of the box has swinging handles at each end.\n\nThe five panels on the lid of the box represent three mythological scenes, a double portrait and a bathing scene. On the top panel of the lid are half-length figures of a man and woman within a wreath held by standing erotes (or putti in modern terms) and an inscription which reads: \"SECVNDE ET PROIECTA VIVATIS IN CHRI[STO] ('Secundus and Projecta, may you live in Christ'). The attire of the two figures is clearly that of an affluent couple from late antiquity. The woman is wearing a long-sleeved tunic with a large necklace. In her hands she holds a papyrus roll. The man is in a long-sleeved tunic that he wears under a chlamys.\n\nThe four panels of the box itself depict bathing and dressing scenes, representing the preparations for a grand Roman wedding. These are placed between columns joined by alternating arches and bottomless pediments, all under a frieze with scrolling vines. In one scene, Projecta is shown sitting on an ornate chair holding a decorated box similar in shape to the Muse Casket. She wears a long-sleeved tunic under a colobium or short-sleeved tunic. A smaller inscription on the front rim of the lid gives the weight as \"XXII-III\", meaning \"[Pondo] XXII,III [Unciae],S[emuncia]\" or \"Twenty-two pounds, three and one-half ounces\" in Roman units.\n\nThe casket has travelled abroad to several international exhibitions: New York in 1977-1978, Rimini in 1996, New Dehli in 1997, Mumbai in 1998, Trier in 2007, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.\n\nAnother ornate object in the treasure is the Muse Casket (M&ME 1866,12-29,2), which is a domed silver box, suspended on three chains. It is 25.4 cm high and 33 cm across. The outside of the box is decorated with relief panels showing eight of the Nine Muses alternating with decorative motifs. Inside the casket were found a set of five silver lidded bottles, or \"four identical silver canisters and one silver flask\" in the centre. These were presumably to hold perfumed oils for toiletries. An apparently identical casket is carried by a female servant on the back panel of the Projecta Casket, suggesting that both were commissioned for the same wedding.\n\nThis casket is also well-travelled, exhibited in New York in 1977-1978, Rome in 2000, Milan in 2003, Paris in 2009 and most recently Chicago in 2012-13.\n\nThe British Museum follows Kathleen J. Shelton in dating the treasure as a whole to the period 330-370; Shelton favours a period of some 20 to 25 years within that range, with the major objects from the same workshop, and probably for more than one generation within a family. \nCurrent research suggests that the Projecta Casket and some other items in the treasure (but probably not all of them) were a wedding gift to the newly married couple Projecta and Secundus. Projecta has been associated with an epitaph for a woman of that name who died in 383, shortly before her 17th birthday, written by Pope Damasus I (r. 366-84) that was once displayed in the church of San Martino ai Monti, close to where the find was made. Though only nine lines long, and described by Alan Cameron as \"typically lame and frigid\" (for a composition by Damasus) and \"a tissue of tags and clichés shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter\", the epitaph creates a number of puzzles and has generated much scholarly discussion. The epitaph reads:\n\nQVID LOQVAR AVT SILEAM PROHIBET DOLOR IPSE FATERI | HIC TVMVLVS LACRIMAS RETINET COGNOSCE PARENTVM | PROIECTAE FVERAT PRIMO QVAE IVNCTA MARITO | PVLCRA DECORE SVO SOLO CONTENTA PVDORE | HEV DILECTA SATIS MISERAE GENITRICIS AMORE | ACCIPE QVID MVLTIS THALAMI POST FOEDERA PRIMA | EREPTA EX OCVLIS FLORI GENITORIS ABIIT | AETHERIAM CVPIENS COELI CONSCENDERE LVCEM | HAEC DAMASVS PRAESTAT CVNCTIS SOLACIA FLETVS | VIXIT ANN·XVI·M·IX·DIES·XXV·DEP·III·KAL·IAN·FL·MEROBAVDE·ET·FL·SATVRNIN·CONSS.\n\nThe translation here of \"PROIECTAE FVERAT PRIMO QVAE IVNCTA MARITO\" as \"Projecta, who had been the wife of Primus\" continues to be hotly discussed; \"primus\", meaning \"first\" was a Roman male name, but other possibilities are that Projecta had a \"first\" husband, or that her unnamed husband was \"primus\" or \"first\" in the complimentary sense of being \"the tops\". Alan Cameron, who supports the Projecta of the epitaph being the wife of L. Turcius Secundus and the owner of the casket, sees \"primo\" as punning wordplay by Damasus - \"second\" was actually \"first\" in quality; he says this would be typical of Damasus's style. Kathleen Shelton disagrees, seeing no connection between two different women called Projecta, one of the epitaph and the other of the casket, and supporting \"Primus\" as the name of the husband in the epitaph.\n\nThe epitaph for Projecta gives her father's name as Florus, who may be the important and pious Iberian official of that name who was close to Theodosius I (himself Iberian), and given great appointments at just this period. He was part of a coterie of Iberian Christians close to the emperor, most seemingly related, which included Pope Damasus. Florus may be the figure of that name depicted with Damasus and a Simon and Peter in a gold glass cup in the Vatican Museums and in another with Simon (Simon appears in a further glass with Damasus), suggesting \"a circle of friends, or at least associates\".\n\nTwo pieces of silver plate, a rectangular dish and a circular one were inscribed with a monogram that has been translated as standing for Projecta Turci. Based on this evidence, some scholars have suggested that Projecta was married to L. Turcius Secundus, and given her age this must have been not long before 383. However, not all the monograms seem to relate to this couple, and it may well be that the treasure represented the family silver accumulated over more than one generation. A ewer in the treasure is inscribed with the female name Pelegrina, but her identity has not been the subject of equal speculation, as there is no other evidence to go on. Another couple of a Turcius and Pelegrina has been tentatively suggested, though how their dates would relate to Projecta and Secundus is unclear.\n\nWhile Projecta was evidently Christian, her husband, if he was L. Turcius Secundus, was a member of a prominent family many of whom remained pagans until the end of the century. The ivory Symmachi–Nicomachi diptych from the same period and milieu in Rome shows pagan iconography; some 70 years after the conversion of Constantine the old religion still had supporters in the Roman elite. The four \"tyche\" of the main cities of the empire suggest they were made for the posts of a great official's chair or litter; members of the Turcii held several such positions. Cameron claims that the helmet of Constantinople is a form not found on \"tyche\" figures of that city before 380, when the see of Constantinople was suddenly raised to be second to Rome, above older ones such as Alexandria.\n\nIt has been suggested that the treasure was buried at the Turcii house on the Esquiline Hill just before the Visigothic attack on Rome by Alaric I in 410 AD.\n\nIn spite of the Christian inscription on the Projecta Casket, the iconography of the figurative decoration of the treasure is purely pagan, a common mixture in Roman metalwork from the period to about 350, when Early Christian art had not yet devised iconography for essentially secular decoration. Three sides of the Projecta Casket's lid are decorated with pagan mythological motifs - these include the deity Venus on a cockleshell, nereids (sea-nymphs) riding a ketos (a dragon-like sea monster) and a hippocamp (a monster with the front quarters of a horse and the tail of a fish). The mixture of Christian and pagan inscriptions and symbols may have been a compromise reflecting the affiliations of the bride and groom's families, described in the previous section.\n\n\n\n"}

Her other work with the show included \"Snakedance\" in January 1983 and \"Enlightenment\" in March 1983 for season 20. Cumming shot much of the 1984 serial, \"Planet of Fire\", on location in Lanzarote, Canary Islands.\n\nCumming was raised in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland. She began her career as an actress at the Royal Scottish Academy. She appeared in both film and television. Her early roles included an episode of the BBC television series, \"Dr. Finlay's Casebook\", in 1963. She also worked as an announcer on Border Television (present-day ITV Border).\n\nShe transitioned from acting to television production in 1964. She had initially applied to the BBC and taught school in Scotland before breaking into production. She recalled her entry into the industry in a 2014 interview, telling Scotland Now, \"I had applied to the BBC in 1964 when they were getting ready for BBC2, and I had been accepted - but they lost my file and because I had a teaching degree, I came back up to Glasgow and started teaching at Bellahouston Academy. I can remember in 1963 when the kids came in, talking about this brilliant TV show they had seen the Saturday night before, and I said, 'What do you mean, it's set in a police box?'...Then in 1964 I went to the BBC as a relief assistant floor manager, where you were slotted into various programmes. I was doing the twice-weekly soaps Compact and Swizzlewick, and the first time I was moved on to something different it was \"Doctor Who\".\"\n\nIn 1965, she was hired as an assistant floor manager on the set of \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\". \"I was put onto The Massacre in 1965 - so it's now 48 years since I first worked on \"Doctor Who\".

Cumming later worked as a production assistant for several episodes of \"Doctor Who\" during the 1960s and 1970s, including \"The Highlanders\", \"The Seeds of Death\", and \"The Mutants\".\n\nIn 1974, Cumming was hired as a staff television director for the BBC. She directed episode's for some of the BBC leading dramatic series during the 1970s, including \"Angels\", \"Play for Today\", \"Z-Cars\", and \"The Omega Factor\", a short-lived series which aired in 1979. In 1980, Cumming directed two episodes of \"Blake's 7\" during the show's third season, \"Sarcophagus\" and \"Rumours of Death\".\n\nCumming was booked to direct \"The Ultimate Evil\" during \"Doctor Who\"'s 23rd season in 1986, but the production was cancelled when the show was put on hiatus. While she did not direct additional episodes on \"Doctor Who\", she maintained a working relationship with the show 's producer, John Nathan-Turner, and collaborated with him at Teynham Productions.\n\nIn 1988, Cumming made a cameo appearance as a tourist at Windsor Castle in \"Silver Nemesis\" for Doctor Who's 25th season. She also oversaw the re-edit of her 1983 serial, \"Enlightenment\", for its re-release as part of the Black Guardian Trilogy DVD box set in 2009 as well as the re-edit of her 1984 serial, \"Planet of Fire\" for its re-release as part of the Kamelion Tales DVD box set in 2010.\n\nFiona Cumming, who resided in Dumfries and Galloway, died on 1 January 2015, at the age of 77.

The show featured the work of Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, and John McLaughlin. The term “abstract classicists” was coined in 1959 by Langsner to define these four southern California painters.\n\nThe exhibition opened at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art), and then travelled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Exposition Park (prior to LACMA’s existence as an independent art museum). Renamed “West Coast Hard-edge,” the revised version later traveled to the institute of Contemporary Art in London and Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the exhibition catalog, Langsner described Abstract Classicist painting as \"Hard-edge painting\" in which \"color and shape are one and the same entity. Form gains its existence through color and color its being through form.\"\n\n\"Four Abstract Classicists reveals, in retrospect, not merely four senior moderns who reduced their painting to precise, flat profundities, but a current of sensibility in the esthetic climate of Los Angeles,\" critic Peter Plagens wrote in 1974.

{"id": "9519109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9519109", "title": "French Colonial", "text": "French Colonial\n\nFrench Colonial is a style of architecture used by the French during colonization. Many former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat \"embraced\" the architecture and advertise it. French Colonial architecture has a long history, beginning in North America in 1604 and being most active in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Guiana, Canada, Louisiana) until the 19th century, when the French turned their attention more to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.\n\nFrench settlements in Canada date back to the mid-16th century and until the annexion of Quebec by the British Crown after the Treaty of Paris (1763), French Canada alongside with Louisiana, was immensely prosperous. Hence the abundant architectural legacy from that period particularly in Quebec City but also in Montreal. Most buildings constructed during the French colonial period utilized a heavy timber frame of logs installed vertically on a sill, \"poteaux-sur-sol\", or into the earth, \"poteaux-en-terre\". An infill of lime mortar or clay mixed with small stones (pierrotage) or a mixture of mud, moss, and animal hair (bousillage) was used to pack between the logs. Many times the infill would later be replaced with brick. This method of construction was used in the Illinois Country as well as Louisiana. General characteristics of a French Colonial dwelling included a raised basement which would support the floor of the home's primary living quarters. Exterior stairs were another common element; the stairs would often climb up to a distinctive, full-length veranda or \"gallery,\" on a home's façade. The roof over the veranda was normally part of the overall roof. French Colonial roofs were either a steep hipped roof, with a dormer or dormers, or a side-gabled roof. The veranda or gallery was often accessed via French doors. French Colonial homes in the American South commonly had stuccoed exterior walls.\n\nFrench Colonial was one of four domestic architectural styles that developed during the colonial period in what would become the United States. The other styles were Colonial Georgian, Dutch Colonial, and Spanish Colonial. French Colonial developed in the settlements of the Illinois Country and French Louisiana. It is believed to have been primarily influenced by the building styles of French Canada and the Caribbean. It had its beginnings in 1699 with the establishment of French Louisiana but continued to be built after Spain assumed control of the colonial territory in 1763. Styles of building that evolved during the French colonial period include the Creole cottage, Creole townhouse, and French Creole plantation house.\n\nThere are some colonial buildings as France's legacy in the area, dating back to the 19th and 20th French Indochina colony. Most of them are located in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh. Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi, as the capitals of Indochina, respectively, in 1887–1902 and 1902-1945, present the most exceptional and among the best-preserved French Colonial buildings in the region, including:\n\n\n\n"}

This generous sum enabled him to start a business, which at that time was called The International Card Co. Trading from offices in Aldersgate Street, he supplied retailers with a range of products including card games and postcards; an unlikely combination these days, but back then, most towns would have a number of stationers in the High Street and they became Harry Percy’s first customers.\nThe International Card business was sold to the De La Rue Company and H.

A disciple of Martin Heidegger and Ernst Cassirer, he obtained his doctorate with a dissertation on Nicolas of Cusa in 1925. Ritter was Cassirer's assistant and a lecturer at the University of Hamburg. A Marxist in the late 1920s and early 1930s, he became a member of the Nazi Party in 1937 and an officer of the German Wehrmacht in 1940. After World War II, Ritter was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Münster.\n\nRitter's philosophical work focuses on a theory of modernity. In a liberal interpretation of Hegel's \"Philosophy of Right\", he developed the view that \"bifurcation\" is the constitutive structure of the modern world and a necessary precondition for the universal realization of individual freedom. According to Ritter's theory of culture as compensation, arts and humanities have the function of balancing the disenchanted, ahistorical condition of modern society. Alongside Hans-Georg Gadamer, his work on Aristotle's ethics and political theory initiated the renewal of practical philosophy in Germany.\n\nHe died in Münster.\n\nRitter is considered one of the most influential philosophers in postwar West Germany. Among his disciples were scholars and public intellectuals like Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde, Max Imdahl, Hermann Lübbe, Odo Marquard, and Robert Spaemann. Together with them, Ritter started the „Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie“ and contributed to development of conceptual history in the field of philosophy. In the 1980s, Jürgen Habermas opposed the Ritter School for being leading representatives of German neo-conservatism. More recent scholarship in intellectual history points out Ritter's seminal role for the modernization of German political thought and the development of a modern liberal republicanism.\n\n\n"}

American designers Raymond H. Dietrich and Thomas L. Hibbard had met while working for Brewster. LeBaron was founded in New York City in 1920 by Raymond H. Dietrich and Thomas L. Hibbard. The company originally was called LeBaron, Carrossiers Inc., and served as design consultants. Dietrich and Hibbard were unknown outside of Brewster, so a clever new name - LeBaron, Carrossiers - was arrived at by the two partners using a list of French words that had the ring of prestige and could be easily pronounced through a telephone. \n\nBusiness progressed in 1920 that Thomas Hibbard offered his friend, Ralph Roberts, who had just gotten his Bachelor of Science degree from Dartmouth College, a job. Tom Hibbard met fellow designer, Howard A. \"Dutch\" Darrin in 1923. Hibbard and Darrin decided to go to Paris, initially to try to sell LeBaron designs but instead decided to set up their own company and founded Hibbard & Darrin. Hibbard resigned from LeBaron in 1923. Dietrich and Roberts continued operating LeBaron with a new illustrator, veteran Roland L. Stickney.Tiring of the corporate environment they started freelance work in their spare time and when William H. Brewster discovered this he fired Dietrich and Hibbard left.\n\nIn 1924, LeBaron merged with the Blue Ribbon and Bridgeport Body companies and changed their name to LeBaron Inc., becoming body builders as well as designers.\nLeBaron became one of the many prominent coachbuilders in the 1920s to provide bodies for luxury cars. Until the late 1930s, most of the great prestige automakers - Rolls-Royce, Hispano-Suiza, Duesenberg, Packard - often supplied only a running chassis, which wealthy buyers would outfit with custom bodywork at substantial extra cost.\n\nDietrich received a lucrative offer from Murray Corporation, one of Ford's and Lincoln's main body builders, in 1925 and resigned from LeBaron to start Dietrich, Inc.. With both founders gone, LeBaron could have been in trouble. But Roberts continued to run the company and orders kept coming in.\nWalter O. Briggs began talks with Roberts in 1926 to buy LeBaron and move it to Detroit, setting up operations at Mack Avenue Stamping (Old Mack Factory).\n\nLeBaron was purchased by Briggs Manufacturing Company of Detroit in 1926 and operated as a subsidiary. Briggs was already supplying bodies to nearby Chrysler, Essex, Ford, Hudson, and Overland. As a Briggs subsidiary, LeBaron handled special custom work, provided design ideas for the main business, and supplied exquisite custom bodies for various car companies such as Chrysler's luxury Imperial line, Duesenberg, Packard, and Cadillac. In 1932, for example, they built 28 beautiful Imperial Custom Convertible Coupes, Chrysler's top model, which rode a 146-inch wheelbase and used a 384.8 cubic-inch straight-8 engine.\n\nThomas L. Hibbard became design director at Ford in 1947. Raymond H. Dietrich was hired by Chrysler in 1932 to become the first official Chrysler stylist.\n\n"}

These types of attacks often lead to the hunting and killing of the lions, which are endangered.\n\nWhen Richard Turere was 9 he tried kerosene lamps and scarecrows but these proved not to work, but he noticed that the lions did not attack when people were present, and he theorised that they were deterred by moving torchlight. Therefore, Turere placed LED lights around the perimeter of his family's cow shed, connected them to vehicle indicator flashers, and powered the system from car batteries charged by a solar panel.\n\nThe lion attacks ceased and soon neighbours were asking for him to set up similar systems around their farms. The cattle were also calmer because the lights meant that they could see the land around was safe.\n\nBased on this invention, Turere won a scholarship to Brookhouse School.\n\nAlthough originally intended for lions, lion lights may also work for other predators such as leopards and cheetahs.\n"}
{"id": "3035823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3035823", "title": "Madonna of Foligno", "text": "Madonna of Foligno\n\nThe Madonna of Foligno is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael. First painted on wood panel, it was later transferred to canvas.\n\nThe painting was executed for Sigismondo de' Conti, chamberlain to Pope Julius II, in 1511. It was placed on a high altar of the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli on Capitoline Hill (Italian: Campidoglio) in Rome, where Sigismondo was buried in 1512.\n\nIt was moved by Anna Conti, a descendant of Sigismondi Conti, to the monastery of St. Anne in Foligno in 1565 and remained there for more than two centuries, hence the name.\n\nIn 1799 it was carried to Paris, France by Napoleon. There, in 1802, the painting was transferred from panel to canvas by Hacquin and restored by Roser of Heidelberg. A note was made by the restorer: \"Rapporto dei cittadini Guijon Vincent Tannay e Berthollet sul ristauro dei quadri di Raffaello conosciuto sotto il nome di Madonna di Foligno.\" \n\nIn 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, it was returned to Italy, where it was placed in the room with the Transfiguration in the Pinacoteca Vaticana of the Vatican Museum in the Vatican City.\n\nThe painting is a \"sacra conversazione,\" where holy figures seem to be in conversation and draw the audience into their discussion. Rather than sitting under a canopy, of the Umbrian or Florentine style, the Virgin is seated on clouds, embracing Jesus, while surrounded by angels. They look down upon Sigismonde de' Conti, kneeling in a red, fur lined cape. Conti is presented by St. Jerome on the right with his lion, appealing for the Virgin's protection. On the left are the kneeling St. Francis of Assisi and St. John the Baptist, who is standing and wearing a tunic of skins. As St. John points to Jesus, he clearly looks out to us, pulling us in, while St. Francis points to us and looks at the Christ Child. Between the men is an angel, linking the saints of earth to the seraph host of heaven. Behind them are the towers of Foligno.\n\nPainted during Raphael's Roman period, it is a testament to his artistic maturity, evidenced in the paintings composition, coloring and form.\nConti commissioned the painting to commemorate his survival of a shell that exploded near him during the Siege of Foligno, his hometown. He credited his safety to heavenly intervention. According to historian Massimo Polidoro this painting has been used by UFO websites as evidence of a flying saucer crash. What Polidoro says you are actually seeing is the house of Sigismondo Conti and a fireball. Painters at this time used \"symbolic meanings that were anything but random.\" The angel is holding a sign with nothing written on it. According to Polidoro this was because Sigismondo died before he could tell Raphael what \"thank you\" to the Virgin he wanted written on the sign. Polidoro calls the UFO explanation, \"reinterpreting with the eyes of twenty-first-century Europeans the product of other cultures\". \n"}
{"id": "206829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=206829", "title": "Mogao Caves", "text": "Mogao Caves\n\nThe Mogao Caves, also known as the Thousand Buddha Grottoes or Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, form a system of 492 temples southeast of the center of Dunhuang, an oasis strategically located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the Silk Road, in Gansu province, China. The caves may also be known as the Dunhuang Caves, however, this term is also used as a collective term to include other Buddhist cave sites in and around the Dunhuang area, such as the Western Thousand Buddha Caves, Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves, Yulin Caves, and Five Temple Caves. The caves contain some of the finest examples of Buddhist art spanning a period of 1,000 years. The first caves were dug out in 366 AD as places of Buddhist meditation and worship. The Mogao Caves are the best known of the Chinese Buddhist grottoes and, along with Longmen Grottoes and Yungang Grottoes, are one of the three famous ancient Buddhist sculptural sites of China.\n\nAn important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called \"Library Cave\", which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The contents of the library were subsequently dispersed around the world, and the largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the International Dunhuang Project exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the Dunhuang manuscripts and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, with a number open for visiting.\n\nThe caves are commonly referred to in Chinese as the Thousand Buddha Caves (), a name that some scholars have speculated to have come from the legend of its founding, when a monk Yuezun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas at the site. This name however may have come from the large number of Buddha figures at the site, or the miniatures figures painted on the walls of these caves as these figures are called \"thousand Buddhas\" colloquially. The name Mogao Caves () was used in the Tang dynasty, where 'Mogao' refers to an administrative district at the site during the Tang dynasty. Mogao may mean \"peerless\" (literally \"none higher\", where \"mo\" means \"none\", and \"gao\" means \"high\"); an alternative reading may be \"high in the desert\" if \"mo\" is read as a variant of the Chinese term for \"desert\". Mogao is also used as the name of a modern town that is administered by Dunhuang city: Mogao Town (). The Mogao Caves are also often referred to as the Dunhuang Caves after the nearest city Dunhuang, which means \"blazing beacon\" as beacons were used at the frontier outpost to warn of attacks by nomadic tribes. The term Dunhuang Caves however is also used in a broader sense as a collective term for all the caves found in or around the Dunhuang area.\n\nDunhuang was established as a frontier garrison outpost by the Han Dynasty Emperor Wudi to protect against the Xiongnu in 111 BC. It also became an important gateway to the West, a centre of commerce along the Silk Road, as well as a meeting place of various people and religions such as Buddhism.\n\nThe construction of the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang is generally taken to have begun sometime in the fourth century AD. According to a book written during the reign of Tang Empress Wu, \"Fokan Ji\" (, \"An Account of Buddhist Shrines\") by Li Junxiu (), a Buddhist monk named Lè Zūn (, which may also be pronounced Yuezun) had a vision of a thousand Buddhas bathed in golden light at the site in 366 AD, inspiring him to build a cave here. The story is also found in other sources, such as in inscriptions on a stele in cave 332; an earlier date of 353 however was given in another document, \"Shazhou Tujing\" (, \"Geography of Shazhou\"). He was later joined by a second monk Faliang (), and the site gradually grew, by the time of the Northern Liang a small community of monks had formed at the site. The caves initially served only as a place of meditation for hermit monks, but developed to serve the monasteries that sprang up nearby. Members of the ruling family of Northern Wei and Northern Zhou constructed many caves here, and it flourished in the short-lived Sui Dynasty. By the Tang Dynasty, the number of caves had reached over a thousand.\n\nBy the Sui and Tang dynasties, Mogao Caves had become a place of worship and pilgrimage for the public. From the 4th until the 14th century, caves were constructed by monks to serve as shrines with funds from donors. These caves were elaborately painted, the cave paintings and architecture serving as aids to meditation, as visual representations of the quest for enlightenment, as mnemonic devices, and as teaching tools to inform those illiterate about Buddhist beliefs and stories. The major caves were sponsored by patrons such as important clergy, local ruling elite, foreign dignitaries, as well as Chinese emperors. Other caves may have been funded by merchants, military officers, and other local people such as women's groups.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang became the main hub of commerce of the Silk Road and a major religious centre. A large number of the caves were constructed at Mogao during this era, including the two large statues of Buddha at the site, the largest one constructed in 695 following an edict a year earlier by Tang Empress Wu Zetian to build giant statues across the country. The site escaped the persecution of Buddhists ordered by Emperor Wuzong in 845 as it was then under Tibetan control. As a frontier town, Dunhuang had been occupied at various times by other non-Han Chinese people. After the Tang Dynasty, the site went into a gradual decline, and construction of new caves ceased entirely after the Yuan Dynasty. By then Islam had conquered much of Central Asia, and the Silk Road declined in importance when trading via sea-routes began to dominate Chinese trade with the outside world. During the Ming Dynasty, the Silk Road was finally officially abandoned, and Dunhuang slowly became depopulated and largely forgotten by the outside world. Most of the Mogao caves were abandoned; the site, however, was still a place of pilgrimage and was used as a place of worship by local people at the beginning of the twentieth century when there was renewed interest in the site.\n\nDuring late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Western explorers began to show interest in the ancient Silk Road and the lost cities of Central Asia, and those who passed through Dunhuang noted the murals, sculptures, and artifacts such as the Stele of Sulaiman at Mogao. The biggest discovery, however, came from a Chinese Taoist named Wang Yuanlu who appointed himself guardian of some of these temples around the turn of the century.\n\nSome of the caves had by then been blocked by sand, and Wang set about clearing away the sand and made an attempt at repairing the site. In one such cave, on 25 June 1900, Wang discovered a walled up area behind one side of a corridor leading to a main cave. Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous hoard of manuscripts. In the next few years, Wang took some manuscripts to show to various officials who expressed varying level of interest, but in 1904 Wang re-sealed the cave following an order by the governor of Gansu.\nWords of Wang's discovery drew the attention of a joint British/Indian group led by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist Aurel Stein who was on an archaeological expedition in the area in 1907. Stein negotiated with Wang to allow him to remove a significant number of manuscripts as well as the finest paintings and textiles for a fee. He was followed by a French expedition under Paul Pelliot who acquired many thousands of items in 1908, and then by a Japanese expedition under Otani Kozui in 1911 and a Russian expedition under Sergei F. Oldenburg in 1914. A well-known scholar Luo Zhenyu edited some of the manuscripts Pelliot acquired into a volume which was then published in 1909 as \"Manuscripts of the Dunhuang Caves\" ().\n\nStein and Pelliot provoked much interest in the West about the Dunhuang Caves; however, there was initially little interest in official circles in China. Concerned that the remaining manuscripts might be lost, Luo Zhenyu and others persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the rest of the manuscripts to be sent to Peking (Beijing) in 1910. However, not all the remaining manuscripts were taken to Peking, and of those retrieved, some were then stolen. Some of the caves were damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers when they were used by the local authority in 1921 to house Russian soldiers fleeing the civil war following the Russian Revolution. In 1924, American explorer Langdon Warner removed a number of murals as well as a statue from some of the caves. In 1939 Kuomingtang soldiers stationed at Dunhuang caused some damage to the murals and statues at the site.\n\nThe situation improved in 1941 when, following a visit by Wu Zuoren to the site the previous year, the painter Zhang Daqian arrived at the caves with a small team of assistants and stayed for two and a half years to repair and copy the murals. He exhibited and published the copies of the murals in 1943, which helped to publicize and give much prominence to the art of Dunhuang within China. Historian Xiang Da then persuaded Yu Youren, a prominent member of the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party), to set up an institution, the Research Institute of Dunhuang Art (which later became the Dunhuang Academy), at Mogao in 1944 to look after the site and its contents. In 1956, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, took a personal interest in the caves and sanctioned a grant to repair and protect the site; and in 1961, the Mogao Caves were declared to be a specially protected historical monument by the State Council, and large-scale renovation work at Mogao began soon afterwards. The site escaped the widespread damage caused to many religious sites during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nToday, efforts are continuing to conserve and research the site and its content. The Mogao Caves became one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1987. From 1988 to 1995 a further 248 caves were discovered to the North of the 487 caves known since the early 1900s.\n\nThe cave no. 17 discovered by Wang Yuanlu came to be known as the Library Cave. It is sited off the entrance leading to cave no.16, and was originally used as a memorial cave for a local monk Hongbian on his death in 862. Hongbian, from a wealthy Wu family, was responsible for the construction of cave 16, and the Library Cave may have been used as his retreat in his lifetime. The cave originally contained his statue which was moved to another cave when it was used to keep manuscripts, some of which bear Hongbian's seal. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002 were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts, including a Hebrew penitential prayer (selichah) (see Dunhuang manuscripts). The Library Cave also contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia. According to Stein who was the first to describe the cave in its original state:\nThe Library Cave was walled off sometime early in the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed as the reason for sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the Tripitaka became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away. Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.\nOthers, such as Pelliot, suggested an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents in advance of an attack by invaders, perhaps when Xi Xia invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed in light of the absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist kingdom of Khotan to Karakhanids invaders from Kashgar in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed. The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is generally accepted to be 1002, and although other dates have been suggested, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.\n\nThe manuscripts from the Library Cave date from fifth century until early eleventh century when it was sealed. Up to 50,000 manuscripts may have been kept there, one of the greatest treasure troves of ancient documents found. While most of them are in Chinese, a large number of documents are in various other languages such as Tibetan, Uigur, Sanskrit, and Sogdian, including the then little-known Khotanese. They may be old hemp paper scrolls in Chinese and many other languages, Tibetan pothis, and paintings on hemp, silk or paper. The subject matter of the great majority of the scrolls is Buddhist in nature, but it also covers a diverse material. Along with the expected Buddhist canonical works are original commentaries, apocryphal works, workbooks, books of prayers, Confucian works, Taoist works, Nestorian Christian works, works from the Chinese government, administrative documents, anthologies, glossaries, dictionaries, and calligraphic exercises.\n\nMany of the manuscripts were previously unknown or thought lost, and the manuscripts provide a unique insight into the religious and secular matters of Northern China as well as other Central Asian kingdoms from the early periods up to the Tang and early Song Dynasty. The manuscripts found in the Library Cave include the earliest dated printed book, the Diamond Sutra from 868, which was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the fourth century. These scrolls also include manuscripts that ranged from the Nestorian Jesus Sutras to the Dunhuang Go Manual and ancient music scores, as well as the image of the Chinese astronomy Dunhuang map. These scrolls chronicle the development of Buddhism in China, record the political and cultural life of the time, and provide documentation of mundane secular matters that gives a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of these eras.\n\nThe manuscripts were dispersed all over the world in the aftermath of the discovery. Stein's acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and Lotus Sutras. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained sinologist literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better selection of documents than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men's groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of palimpsest whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the paper. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of International Dunhuang Project.\n\nThe art of Dunhuang covers more than ten major genres, such as architecture, stucco sculpture, wall paintings, silk paintings, calligraphy, woodblock printing, embroidery, literature, music and dance, and popular entertainment.\n\nThe caves are examples of rock-cut architecture, but unlike Longmen Grottoes and Yungang Grottoes, the local rock is a rather soft gravel conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details. Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut \"chaitya\" styles seen in places such as the Ajanta Caves in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the stupa round which worshippers may circumambulate (\"parikrama\") and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian vihara (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.\n\nMany of the caves originally had wooden porches or fore-temples built out from the cliff, but most of these have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses the Great Buddha and was originally 4 storeys high, but it has been repaired at least 5 times and is no longer the original structure. A storey was added between 874-885, then repaired in the Guiyijun period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.\n\nThe murals in the caves date from a period of over a thousand years, from the 5th to the 14th century, and many earlier ones were repainted at later points within the period. The murals are extensive, covering an area of . The most fully painted caves have paintings all over the walls and ceilings, with geometrical or plant decoration filling the spaces not taken by figurative images, which are above all of the Buddha. Sculpture is also brightly painted. The murals are valued for the scale and richness of content as well as their artistry. Buddhist subjects are most common, however some have traditional mythical subjects and portraits of patrons. These murals document the changing styles of Buddhist art in China for nearly a thousand years. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee during the Tang period, and the quality of the work dropped after the tenth century.\n\nEarly murals showed a strong Indian and Central Asian influence in the painting techniques used, the composition and style of the paintings as well as costumes worn by the figures, but a distinct Dunhuang style began to emerge during Northern Wei Dynasty. Motifs of Chinese, Central Asian and Indian origin may be found in a single cave, and Chinese elements increased during the Western Wei period.\n\nA common motif in many caves is the areas entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which this and other \"Thousand Buddhas Caves\" are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using stencils so that identical figures may be replicated. Flying apsaras, or celestial beings may be depicted in the ceiling or above the Buddhas, and figures of donors may be shown along the bottom of the walls. The paintings often depict jataka tales which are stories of the life of Buddha, or avadana which are parables of the doctrine of karma.\n\nBodhisattvas started appearing during the Northern Zhou period, with Avalokitesvara (Guanyin), which was originally male but acquired female characteristics later, the most popular. Most caves show Mahayana and Sravakayana (Theravada or Hinayana) influences, although Mahayana Buddhism became the dominant form during the Sui Dynasty. An innovation of the Sui-Tang period is the visual representation of the sutra – Mahayana Buddhist teachings transformed into large complete and detailed narrative paintings. One of the central features of Tang art in Mogao is the representation of the paradise of the Pure Land, indicating the increasing popularity of this school of Mahayana Buddhism in the Tang era. The iconography of Tantric Buddhism, such as the eleven-headed or thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, also started to appear in Mogao wall paintings during the Tang period. It became popular during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang and the subsequent periods, especially during the Yuan dynasty.\nWhile Buddhist art is stylistically distinct from secular art, the style of paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as we know of this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General Zhang Yichao, who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the Uyghurs (Uyghur Gansu Kingdom and Kingdom of Qocho) and the Saka Kingdom of Khotan and their portraits are featured prominently in some of the caves.\n\nMany of the figures have darkened due to oxidation of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light. Many early figures in the murals in Dunhuang also used painting techniques originated from India where shading was applied to achieve a 3-dimensional or chiaroscuro effect. However, the darkening of the paint used in shading over time resulted in heavy outlines which is not what the painters had originally intended. This shading technique is unique to Dunhuang in East Asia at this period as such shading on human faces was generally not done in Chinese paintings until much later when there were influences from European paintings. Another difference from traditional Chinese painting is the presence of figures that are semi-nude, occasionally fully nude, as figures are generally fully clothed in Chinese paintings. Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.\n\nThere are around 2,400 surviving clay sculptures at Mogao. These were first constructed on a wooden frame, padded with reed, then modelled in clay stucco, and finished with paint. The giant statues however have a stone core. The Buddha is generally shown as the central statue, often attended by boddhisattvas, heavenly kings, devas, and apsaras, along with yaksas and other mythical creatures. \nThe early figures are relatively simple and mainly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Buddhas of Northern Wei may have two attendant Bodhisattvas, and two further disciples were added in Northern Zhou, forming a group of five. Figures from the Sui and Tang periods may be present as larger groups of seven or nine, and some showed large-scale parinirvana scene with groups of mourners. The early sculptures were based on Indian and Central Asian prototypes, with some in the Greco-Indian style of Gandhara. Over time the sculptures showed more Chinese elements and became gradually sinicized.\n\nThe two giant statues represent Maitreya Buddha. The earlier and larger one in cave 96, at 35.5 m high, was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and giant statues in 694. The smaller one is 27 m tall and was constructed in 713-41. The larger northern giant Buddha was damaged in an earthquake and had been repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing, colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its original Early Tang appearance. The southern statue however is largely in its original form apart for its right hand. The larger Buddha is housed in a prominent wooden 9-storey structure.\nOne type of caves constructed during the Tibetan era is the Nirvana Cave, which features a large reclining Buddha that covers the entire length of the hall. Figures of mourners in murals or in sculptural forms are also depicted along the length of the hall behind the Buddha. The Buddha figure in cave 158 measures 15.6 m long.\n\nThe original function of the \"Library Cave\" was as a shrine commemorating Hong Bian, the 9th-century monk. His portrait statue, unusual here and among all surviving works in China, was removed to another spot when the cave was sealed up in the 11th century, but has been returned now the library has been removed. There is also a stone stele describing his life, and the wall behind the statue is painted with attendant figure; such blending of painted sculpture and wall paintings into a single composition is very common at the site.\n\nBefore the discovery in the Library Cave, original paintings on silk and paper from the Tang dynasty, a formative period in Chinese art, were very rare, and most of the surviving examples were copies made in later periods. Over a thousand paintings on silk, banners, and embroideries were found in the Library Cave, none apparently dating before the late 7th century. The great majority of the paintings are anonymous, but many are of high quality, especially from the Tang. Most are sutra paintings, images of Buddha, and narrative paintings. The paintings show something of the contemporary Chinese style of the capital Chang'an, but many also reflect Indian, Tibetan and Uighur painting styles.\n\nThere are brush paintings in ink alone, some in just two colours, as well as many in full colour. Most common are single figures, and most paintings were probably donated by an individual, who is often portrayed on a diminutive scale. The donor figures become notably more elaborate in dress by the 10th century.\n\nThe Library Cave is equally important as a source of rare early images and texts produced by woodblock printing, including the famous Diamond Sutra, the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also printed out at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.\n\nThe textiles found in the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks' apparel (kāṣāya). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth as a sign of humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time. Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered. Valances used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.\n\nThe caves were cut into the side of a cliff which is close to two kilometers long. At its height, during the Tang Dynasty, there were more than a thousands caves, but over time many of the caves were lost, including the earliest caves. 735 caves currently exist in Mogao; the best-known ones are the 487 caves located in the southern section of the cliff which are places of pilgrimage and worship. 248 caves have also been found to the north which were living quarters, meditation chambers, and burial sites for the monks. The caves at the southern section are decorated, while those at the northern section are mostly plain.\n\nThe caves are clustered together according to their era, with new caves from a new dynasty being constructed in different part of the cliff. From the murals, sculptures, and other objects found in the caves, the dates of around five hundred caves have been determined. Following is a list of the caves by era, compiled in the 1980s (more have been identified since):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "593784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=593784", "title": "Monochromacy", "text": "Monochromacy\n\nMonochromacy (from Greek \"mono\", meaning \"one \"and \"chromo\", meaning \"color\") is the ability of organisms or machines to distinguish only one single frequency of the electromagnetic light spectrum. In the physical sense, no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic but can be considered as a gaussian distribution of frequencies shaped around a peak. In the same way, a visual system of an organism or a machine cannot be monochromat but will distinguish a continuous set of frequencies around a peak, depending by the intensity of the light. Organisms with monochromacy are called monochromats.\n\nMany species, such as all marine mammals, the owl monkey and the Australian sea lion (pictured at right) are monochromats under normal conditions. In humans, absence of color discrimination or poor color discrimination is one among several other symptoms of severe inherited or acquired diseases, as for example inherited achromatopsia (OMIM 216900 262300 139340 613093), acquired achromatopsia or inherited blue cone monochromacy (OMIM 303700).\n\nVision in humans is due to a system that starts with rods and cones photoreceptors, passes through retinal ganglion cells and arrives in the brain visual cortex. Color vision is achieved through cone cells, each one able to distinguish between a continuous band of frequencies, retinal ganglion cells and the visual cortex.\n\nRods, which are extremely abundant (about 120 million), are in the periphery of the human retina. Rods respond only to faint levels of light and are very light sensitive, therefore, completely useless in daylight because bright light bleaches them. Cones, which are mostly near the fovea in the eye and are less active in dim light, more useful in bright light, are essential for color vision. There are three types of cones in normal human eyes (short, medium and long wavelength, sometimes called blue, green and red); each detects a different range of wavelengths. Rods outnumber cones by about 20 to 1 in the human retina, but cones provide about 90% of the brain's input. Cones respond faster than rods and have three types of pigments with different color sensitivities, where rods only have one and so are achromatic (colorless). Because of the distribution of rods and cones in the human eye, people have good color vision near the fovea (where cones are) but not in the periphery (where the rods are).\n\nThese types of color blindness can be inherited, resulting from alterations in cone pigments or in other proteins needed for the process of phototransduction:\n\n\nMonochromacy is one of the symptoms of diseases that occur when only one kind of light receptor in the human retina is functional at a particular level of illumination. It is one of the symptoms of either acquired or inherited disease as for example acquired achromatopsia, inherited autosomal recessive achromatopsia and recessive X-linked blue cone monochromacy.\n\nThere are two basic types of monochromacy. \"Animals with monochromatic vision may be either rod monochromats or cone monochromats. These monochromats contain photoreceptors which have a single spectral sensitivity curve.\"\n\n\nIn humans, who have three types of cones, the short (S, or blue) wavelength sensitive, middle (M, or green) wavelength sensitive and long (L, or red) wavelength sensitive cones have three differing forms of cone monochromacy, named according to the single functioning cone class:\n\n\n\nIt used to be confidently claimed that most mammals other than primates were monochromats. In the last half-century, however, evidence of at least dichromatic color vision in a number of mammalian orders has accumulated. While typical mammals are dichromats, with S and L cones, two of the orders of sea mammals, the pinnipeds (which includes the seal, sea lion and walrus) and cetaceans (which includes dolphins and whales) clearly are cone monochromats, since the short-wavelength sensitive cone system is genetically disabled in these animals. The same is true of the owl monkeys, genus \"Aotus\".\n\nResearchers Leo Peichl, Guenther Behrmann and Ronald H. H. Kroeger report that of the many animal species studied, there are three carnivores that are cone monochromats: raccoon, crab-eating raccoon and kinkajou and a few rodents are cone monochromats because they are lacking the S-cone. These researchers also report that the animal's living environment also plays a significant role in the animals' eyesight. They use the example of water depth and the smaller amount of sunlight that is visible as one continues to go down. They explain it as follows, \"Depending on the type of water, the wavelengths penetrating deepest may be short (clear, blue ocean water) or long (turbid, brownish coastal or estuarine water.)\" Therefore, the variety of visible availability in some animals resulted in them losing their S-cone opsins.\n\nAccording to Jay Neitz, a renowned color vision researcher at the University of Washington, each of the three standard color-detecting cones in the retina of trichromats can pick up about 100 gradations of color. The brain can process the combinations of these three values so that the average human can distinguish about one million colors. Therefore, a monochromat would be able to distinguish about 100 colors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42450301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42450301", "title": "Munich Secession", "text": "Munich Secession\n\nThe Munich Secession was an association of visual artists who broke away from the mainstream Munich Artists' Association in 1892, to promote and defend their art in the face of what they considered official paternalism and its conservative policies. They acted as a form of cooperative, using their influence to assure their economic survival and obtain commissions. In 1901, the association split again when some dissatisfied members formed the group Phalanx. Another split occurred in 1913, with the founding of the \"New Munich Secession\".\n\nBy the end of the Nineteenth Century, more artists lived in Munich than lived in Vienna and Berlin put together. However, the art community there was dominated by the conservative attitudes of the Munich Artists' Association and its supporters in the government. These attitudes found expression in the official \"mission statements\", written by the so-called \"Prince of Painters\" (Malerfürst) Franz von Lenbach. Matters came to a head in 1891 when the Prince-Regent Luitpold of Bavaria founded the \"Prinzregent-Luitpold-Stiftung zur Förderung der Kunst, des Kunstgewerbes und des Handwerks in München\", an art foundation devoted to promoting traditional history painting in the service of the state. This foundation created and maintained a high level of artistic quality and brought world attention to the Academy of Fine Arts, but was firmly opposed to impressionism, expressionism, symbolism and other contemporary trends in the art world.\n\nAnother factor was the complete financial failure of an exhibition in 1888 at the Glaspalast, organized by the Artists' Association. This led to a bitter debate about responsibility and the exhibition's content which grew so furious, it attracted the attention of the Ministry of State for Science and Art.\n\nTo address this situation, a group of artists with a progressive outlook gathered together in 1892, announced their separation from the official Artists' Association and established the Munich Secession, with an eye toward exhibiting at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition. They called for a transformation in the ideas of what constitutes art and promoted the idea of an artists' freedom to present works directly to the public.\n\nIn this statement of principles, the artists declared their intentions to move away from outmoded principles and a conservative conception of what art is.\n\nOn April 4, 1892, ninety-six artists who had resigned from the official Association, established the \"Association of Visual Artists of Munich\". Bruno Piglhein was elected the first President and Paul Hoecker became the first Secretary. In a few months the original name gave way to the more popular name: \"Munich Secession\".\n\nFinancial support initially came from three sources: Georg Hirth, a writer and journalist who coined the word \"secession\" to describe the spirit of the various art movements at that time. In 1896, he would establish the Art-Nouveau magazine \"Jugend\" ; Georg von Vollmar, editor of the Democratic Socialist party's official organ ; and Hans Viet, Graf von Toerring-Jettenbach (1862-1929), a member of the liberal opposition to the government's policies.\n\nThat same year saw the creation of another breakaway association, the \"\", composed of more moderate artists who wanted to maintain the high-quality standards of the Academy. The Vienna Secession followed five years later, and the Berlin Secession was established in 1898.\n\nAt first, the Secession had some difficulty finding a building for their exhibitions. The city of Frankfurt offered to provide the necessary space and 500,000 Gold Marks, if the group would move there permanently. Their first exhibition actually took place at Berlin's \"National Exhibition Building\" (now known as \"ULAP\") early in 1893.\n\nBaurat (city construction supervisor) Franz von Brandl provided the Secession with some free land at the corner of Prinzregentenstraße and Pilotystraße. Construction began immediately and their debut exhibition took place on July 16, 1893, in the first portion of the building to be completed. Over 4,000 visitors came to see 876 works by 297 artists.\n\nThe success of this effort eventually allowed them to come to an agreement with Franz von Lenbach and the Artists' Association. As a result, the art exhibition building on the Königsplatz (now the Staatliche Antikensammlungen) was transferred to the Secession in 1897.\n\nIn 1933, the National Socialist party began their crusade to bring all forms of artistic expression under their control: a process known as Gleichschaltung (bringing into line). Artists were eventually required to obtain state endorsement for all of their works. Those who were considered \"degenerate\" were not allowed to paint. In 1938, the Munich Secession was dissolved as part of the \"Kulturellen Säuberung\" (cultural cleansing) process.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1946, the \"\" and the \"Neue Münchner Künstlergenossenschaft\" (New Munich Artists' Association) were founded and led to the establishment of the \"Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler\" (Federal Association of Visual Artists).\n\nIn 1992, the Secession celebrated its centennial and, in March of the following year, the \"Society of Friends and Sponsors of the Munich Secession\" was created to support the Secession's continuing goals, maintain the \"Secessionsgalerie\" and promote exhibitions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "308242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308242", "title": "Music recording certification", "text": "Music recording certification\n\nMusic recording certification is a system of certifying that a music recording has shipped, sold, or streamed a certain number of units. The threshold quantity varies by type (such as album, single, music video) and by nation or territory (see List of music recording certifications).\n\nAlmost all countries follow variations of the RIAA certification categories, which are named after precious materials (gold, platinum and diamond).\n\nThe threshold required for these awards depends upon the population of the territory where the recording is released. Typically, they are awarded only to international releases and are awarded individually for each country where the album is sold. Different sales levels, some perhaps 10 times lower than others, may exist for different music media (for example: videos versus albums, singles, or downloads).\n\nThe original gold and silver record awards were presented to artists by their own record companies to publicize their sales achievements. The first silver disc was awarded by Regal Zonophone to George Formby in December 1937 for sales of 100,000 copies of \"The Window Cleaner\". The first gold disc was awarded by RCA Victor (under division imprint Bluebird Records) to Glenn Miller and His Orchestra in February 1942, celebrating the sale of 1.2 million copies of single \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\". Another example of a company award is the gold record awarded to Elvis Presley in 1956 for one million units sold of his single \"Don't Be Cruel\". The first gold record for an LP was awarded by RCA Victor to Harry Belafonte in 1957 for the album \"Calypso\" (1956), the first album to sell over 1,000,000 copies in RCA's reckoning.\n\nAt the industry level, in 1958 the Recording Industry Association of America introduced its gold record award program for records of any kind, albums or singles, which achieved one million dollars in retail sales. These sales were restricted to U.S.-based record companies and did not include exports to other countries. For albums in 1968, this would mean shipping approximately 250,000 units; for singles the number would be higher due to their lower retail price. The platinum certification was introduced in 1976 for the sale of one million units for albums and two million for singles, with the gold certification redefined to mean sales of 500,000 units for albums and one million for singles. No album was certified platinum prior to this year. For instance, the recording by Van Cliburn of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto from 1958 would eventually be awarded a platinum citation, but this would not happen until two decades after its release. In 1999, the diamond certification was introduced for sales of ten million units. In the late 1980s, the certification thresholds for singles were dropped to match that of albums.\n\nThe first official designation of a \"gold record\" by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) was established for singles in 1958, and the RIAA also trademarked the term \"gold record\" in the United States. On 14 March 1958, the RIAA certified its first gold record, Perry Como's hit single \"Catch a Falling Star\". The \"Oklahoma!\" soundtrack was certified as the first gold album four months later. In 1976, RIAA introduced the platinum certification, first awarded to the Eagles compilation album \"Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)\" on 24 February 1976, and to Johnnie Taylor's single \"Disco Lady\" on 22 April 1976. As music sales increased with the introduction of compact discs, the RIAA created the Multi-Platinum award in 1984. Diamond awards, honoring those artists whose sales of singles or albums reached 10,000,000 copies, were introduced in 1999.\n\nIn the 20th century, and for a part of the first decade of the 21st, it was common for distributors to claim certifications based on their shipments – wholesale to retail outlets – which led to many certifications which outstripped the actual final retail sales figures. This became much less common once the majority of retail sales became paid digital downloads and digital streaming.\n\nIn most countries certifications no longer apply solely to physical media but now also include sales awards recognizing digital downloads (in the U.S. and U.K. since 2004). In June 2006, the RIAA also certified the ringtone downloads of songs. Streaming from on-demand services such as Apple Music,\nSpotify, Tidal and Napster has been included into existing digital certification in the U.S since 2013 and the U.K. and Germany since 2014. In the U.S. and Germany video streaming services like YouTube, VEVO, and Yahoo! Music also began to be counted towards the certification, in both cases using the formula of 100 streams being equivalent to one download. Other countries, such as Denmark and Spain, maintain separate awards for digital download singles and streaming.\n\nThe International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) was founded in 1996, and grants the IFPI Platinum Europe Award for album sales over one million within Europe and (as of October 2009) the Middle East. Multi-platinum Europe Awards are presented for sales in subsequent multiples of one million. Eligibility is unaffected by time (from date of release), and is not restricted to European-based artists.\n\nThe Independent Music Companies Association (IMPALA) was founded in 2000 to grow the independent music sector and promote independent music in the interests of artistic, entrepreneurial and cultural diversity. IMPALA sales awards were launched in 2005 as the first sales awards recognising that success on a pan-European basis begins well before sales reach one million. The award levels are Silver (20,000+), Double Silver (40,000+), Gold (75,000+), Double Gold (150,000+), Diamond (200,000+), Platinum (400,000+) and Double Platinum (800,000+).\n\nBelow are certification thresholds for the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and France. The numbers in the tables are in terms of \"units\", where a unit represents one sale or one shipment of a given medium. Certification is often awarded cumulatively, and it is possible for a single album to be certified silver, gold, and platinum in turn. An album that becomes Platinum twice over, for example, an album which has sold 2,000,000 copies in the United States, is said to be \"Double-Platinum\", or sometimes \"Multi-Platinum\". Since 2013 in the U.S., and 2014 in the U.K. and Germany, streaming of songs counts towards certification of singles with 150 streams being the equivalent of 1 unit sold. Since February 2016, RIAA includes on-demand audio and video streams and a track sale equivalent in Gold and Platinum Album Award. The program will count both sales and streams for single and album certifications.\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFrance\n\nThe plaques themselves contain various items under the glass. Modern awards often use CDs instead of records. Most gold and platinum records are actually vinyl records which have been vacuum metallized and tinted, while trimmed and plated metal \"masters\", \"mothers\", or \"stampers\" (metal parts used for pressing records out of vinyl) were initially used. The music in the grooves on the record may not match the actual recording being awarded. Individual plaque-makers produced their awards according to available materials and techniques employed by their graphic arts departments. The plaques, depending on size and elaborateness of design, cost anywhere between US$135 and $275, most often ordered and purchased by the record label that issued the original recording.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2396052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2396052", "title": "Pomander", "text": "Pomander\n\nA pomander, from French \"pomme d'ambre\", i.e., apple of amber, is a ball made for perfumes, such as ambergris (whence the name), musk, or civet. The pomander was worn or carried in a vase, also known by the same name, as a protection against infection in times of pestilence or merely as a useful article to modify bad smells. The globular cases which contained the pomanders were hung from a neck-chain or belt, or attached to the girdle, and were usually perforated in a variety of openwork techniques, and made of gold or silver. Sometimes they contained several partitions, in each of which was placed a different perfume.\n\nThe term \"pomander\" can refer to the scented material itself or to the container that which contains such material. The container could be made of gold or silver and eventually evolved to be shaped like nuts, skulls, hearts, books and ships. Smaller versions were made to be attached by a chain to a finger ring and held in the hand. Even smaller versions served as cape buttons or rosary beads.\n\nA pomander can be a bag containing fragrant herbs and might be viewed as an early form of aromatherapy. Pomanders can be considered related to censers, in which aromatics are burned or roasted rather than naturally evaporated.\n\nPomanders were first mentioned in literature in the mid-thirteenth century. They were used in the late Middle Ages through the 17th century.\nAlso a version of the pomander with oranges, cloves, oils, and a golden ribbon can be used as a recovery charm in witchcraft.\n\nPomanders were first made for carrying as religious keepsakes.\n\nThe \"Archaeological Journal\", Volume 31 of 1874 describes on page 339 a 1584 formula for making a pomander that was also published by Frederic Madden in his 1831 history book \"Privy purse expenses of the Princess Mary, daughter of King Henry the Eighth, afterwards Queen Mary\" on page 257:\n\nMichel de Nostredame had a similar method and formula using similar ingredients, but a rather different procedure.\n\n\"Rose tablets\" were made by soaking a pound of roses without the flower heads in deer musk water overnight. The water was then thoroughly squeezed out and the roses ground with seven ounces of benzoin, a quarter of ambergris and another of civet musk. This mixture was made into tablets, which were each sandwiched between rose petals and dried in a cool, dark area\n\nTo form the final pomander, two ounces of the purest labdanum, an ounce each of Styrax calamites and benzoin resin, half an ounce of the rose tablets, one ounce of violet powder, and half a dram each ambergris and musk were ground into a powder and kneaded with the rose-musk water from the production of the rose tablets. This produced \"an aromatic ball of the most supreme perfume, and the longest-lasting that can be made anywhere in the world.\"\n\nIn the late 16th century the pouncet box appeared which, whilst retaining the traditional features of the pomander, was designed to hold liquid perfumes, blended with powder and absorbed on a sponge or piece of cotton. It was favoured by the upper classes who appreciated the delicacy of the liquid perfumes. Its name stemmed from the fact that the box was \"pounced\" or pierced to release the scent.\n\nOne modern style of pomander is made by studding an orange or other fruit with whole dried cloves and letting it cure dry, after which it may last several years. This modern pomander serves the functions of perfuming and freshening the air and also of keeping drawers of clothing and linens fresh, pleasant-smelling, and moth-free.\n\nOther ingredients in the process of making pomanders are:\n\n\nA pomander is worn by Rosemary Woodhouse, in Roman Polanski's 1968 film, \"Rosemary's Baby\". It figures as a central part of the plot development.\n\nThe pouncet box is mentioned in Shakespeare's \"Henry IV Part I\" when Hotspur is accused of withholding Scottish nobles captured in a skirmish and in self-defence pleads, in describing the King's messenger:\n\nMedieval pomander paste formulas usually contained ambergris. From this came \"pomme ambre\" (amber apple) and from there the word \"pomander\" was developed.

Preiser and colleagues define POE as: the process of evaluating buildings in a systematic and rigorous manner after they have been built and occupied for some time\" The unique aspect of Post Occupancy Evaluation is that it generates recommendations based on all stakeholder groups' experiences of subject buildings' affects on productivity and wellbeing. \n\nPost Occupancy Evaluations is used to improve the ways that buildings are used to support productivity and wellbeing.\n\nSpecifically it is used to:\n\nThe British Council for Offices (BCO) summarises that a POE provides feedback of how successful the workplace is in supporting the occupying organization and the requirements of individual end-users. The BCO also suggests that POE can be used to assess if a project brief has been met. Furthermore, the BCO recommends that POE is used as part of the Evidence-based design process, where the project usually refers to a building design fit-out or refurbishment, or to inform the project brief where the project is the introduction of a new initiative, system or process. POE usually involves feedback from the building occupants, through questionnaires, interviews and workshops, but may also involve more objective measures such as environmental monitoring, space measurement and cost analysis.\n\nPost Occupancy Evaluations involve all stakeholder groups with interests in the subject buildings. Stakeholders are typically:\n\nThe POE process provides value-neutral prompts to stimulate stakeholders to make testable observations about their experiences of buildings' effect on productivity and wellbeing. These observations are clarified and documented by the evaluator. Stakeholders' testable observations will be specific to building design, use and operating conditions and these may involve \"negotiation\" of all three dimensions of building evaluation to realize the optimum ways of achieving productivity and wellbeing.\n\nRecommendations are based on complete set of stakeholders' observations. Most recommendations are to inform planning and design of future new buildings the operational practices. They also generate some recommendations for modifications to the subject buildings and for changes in the ways that they are used. POE evaluators may recommend monitoring, research, investigation or project management studies.\n\nSome POE include other building studies. POE incorporate may include quantitative and qualitative techniques. Most POEs will involve seeking feedback from the occupants of the place being evaluated; this may be achieved through various survey methodology including questionnaire, interview or focus group. The occupant feedback may be supplemented by environmental monitoring, such as temperature, noise levels, lighting levels and indoor air quality. More recently, POEs tend to include sustainable measures such as energy consumption, waste levels, and water usage. Other commonly used quantitative measures include space metrics, for example occupational density, space utilization and tenant efficiency ratio. Cost, either expressed as the cost of the project per square meter or the total cost of occupancy, is considered a key metric in building evaluation and may be compared with the occupant feedback to provide a better understanding of value.\n\nBoth LEED and WELL consider occupant surveys as part of their certification scheme. \n\nIEQ survey, as a part of POE, is involved in LEED certification scheme v4. For all LEED O+M projects using LEED v4, one point (EQ Credit: Occupant Comfort Survey) can be awarded to those who intents to assess building occupants' comfort.\n\nWELL involves the occupant survey in both preconditions and optimization features in the concept of community. Besides, it has a particular feature related to occupant survey on thermal comfort concept.\n\nOccupant Survey (Feature C03) is one of the precondition features of the community concept, which means it is mandatory for certification. This feature intends to establish minimum standards for the evaluation of experience and self-reported health and well-being of building occupants. The requirements of this feature are the following two parts:\n\n\nEnhanced Occupant Survey (Feature C04) is an optimization feature of community concept, which helps to achieve WELL certification. The purpose of this feature is to evaluate comfort, satisfaction, behavior change, self-reported health and other robust factors related to the well-being of occupants in buildings. A project can have up to 3 points it meets below requirements:\n\n\nEnhanced Thermal Performance (Feature T02) is one of the optimization features of thermal comfort concept. This feature aims to enhance thermal comfort and promote human productivity by ensuring that a substantial majority of building users (above 80%) perceive their environment as thermally acceptable. The maximum points are three, and there are achieved by following parts:\n\n\nThe term \"post occupancy\" can be confusing and simply refers to an occupied building rather than a vacant one. Furthermore, POEs may be conducted at regular intervals to monitor how the building facilities and its operation are currently supporting the occupants. A pre-project POE may be used to:\n\n\nA POE is often carried out six to twelve months after construction work is complete and buildings are occupied. Post Occupancy Evaluations are also undertaken at any time buildings' \"lives\"; particularly to understand stakeholders' experience of them, for briefing alterations and changes.\n\nPOE's have been conducted of facilities for schools, universities, technical institutes, kindergartens, museums, offices, courts, corrections, military, hospitals, landscape/civil works, learning environments, libraries, jails, police stations, housing, health centres and zoos. It would be equally possible to apply POE techniques to ships and \"virtual\" environments. POE has been applied to selected parts of buildings, aspects of buildings and groups of buildings on the same campus and several sites.\n\nPOE is usually carried out by architects or building professionals with a social science or workplace consulting background. POE by independent consultants can offer an impartial evaluation.\n\nPOE can be informed by reference to other building studies and POEs sometimes recommend other studies such as:\n\nPOE has been developed and discussed within these organisations:\n\n"}

It describes what his life is like after suffering a massive stroke that left him with locked-in syndrome. It also details what his life was like before the stroke.\n\nThe French edition of the book was published on March 7, 1997. It received excellent reviews, sold the first 25,000 copies on the day of publication, reaching 150,000 in a week. It went on to become a number one bestseller across Europe. Its total sales are now in the millions. \nOn December 8, 1995, Bauby, the editor-in-chief of French \"Elle\" magazine, suffered a stroke and lapsed into a coma. He awoke 20 days later, mentally aware of his surroundings, but physically paralyzed with what is known as locked-in syndrome, with the only exception of some movement in his head and eyes. His right eye had to be sewn up due to an irrigation problem. The entire book was written by Bauby blinking his left eyelid, which took ten months (four hours a day). Using partner assisted scanning, a transcriber repeatedly recited a French language frequency-ordered alphabet (E, S, A, R, I, N, T, U, L, etc.), until Bauby blinked to choose the next letter. The book took about 200,000 blinks to write and an average word took approximately two minutes. The book also chronicles everyday events for a person with locked-in syndrome.

{"id": "2417765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2417765", "title": "The Honest Woodcutter", "text": "The Honest Woodcutter\n\nThe Honest Woodcutter, also known as Mercury and the Woodman and The Golden Axe, is one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 173 in the Perry Index. It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest.\n\nThe Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god Hermes (also known as Mercury) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. \"Was this what you had lost?\", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.\nThough the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application. The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the proximate cause for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. \n\nA burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in François Rabelais's 16th-century novel \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\". It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in La Fontaine's Fables (V.1) but in more concentrated form. However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.\n\nSome paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. Salvator Rosa's \"Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman\" in the National Gallery, London, dates from about 1650. An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this. Charles-André van Loo gives greater prominence to the figures in his \"Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron\" in the Hôtel de Soubise. In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. \n\nIllustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in Samuel Croxall's edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile. In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. \n\nIn 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.\n\nThe appearance of other tellings of the story, with local variations, from Nigeria, Thailand and Tibet, seems to call in question the purely Greek origin of the story. The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist Jataka tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. \n\nA certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the Jewish Bible. There the prophet Elisha was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. \"Oh master,\" he exclaimed, \"it was a borrowed one.\" \"Where did it fall?\" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float.' (NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6)\n\n"}

Intended as the introduction to the more philosophical poem \"The Recluse,\" which Wordsworth never finished, \"The Prelude\" is an extremely personal work and reveals many details of Wordsworth's life.\n\nWordsworth began \"The Prelude\" in 1798, at the age of 28, and continued to work on it throughout his life. He never gave it a title, but called it the \"Poem (title not yet fixed upon) to Coleridge\" and in his letters to Dorothy Wordsworth referred to it as \"the poem on the growth of my own mind\". The poem was unknown to the general public until the final version was published three months after Wordsworth's death in 1850. Its present title was given to it by his widow Mary. It is widely regarded as Wordsworth's greatest work.\n\nThere are three versions of the poem:\n\n\"The Prelude\" was the product of a lifetime: for the last part of his life Wordsworth had been \"polishing the style and qualifying some of its radical statements about the divine sufficiency of the human mind in its communion with nature\".\n\nThe poem was intended as the prologue to a long three-part epic and philosophical poem, \"The Recluse\". Though Wordsworth planned this project when he was in his late 20s, he went to his grave at 80 years old having written to some completion only \"The Prelude\" and the second part (\"The Excursion\"), and leaving no more than fragments of the rest.\n\nWordsworth initially planned to write this work together with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, their joint intent being to surpass John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (\"Table Talk\" II.70–71; IG3). If \"The Recluse\" had been completed, it would have been about three times longer than \"Paradise Lost\" (33,000 lines versus 10,500). Wordsworth often commented in his letters that he was plagued with agony because he had failed to finish the work. In his introduction to the version of 1850 Wordsworth explains that the original idea, inspired by his \"dear friend\" Coleridge, was \"to compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled the \"Recluse\"; as having for its principal subject, the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement\".\n\nColeridge's inspiration and interest is evident in his letters. For instance, in 1799 he wrote to Wordsworth: \"I am anxiously eager to have you steadily employed on 'The Recluse'... I wish you would write a poem, in blank verse, addressed to those who, in consequence of the complete failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hopes of amelioration of mankind, and are sinking into an almost Epicurean selfishness, disguising the same under the soft titles of domestic attachment and contempt for visionary philosophies. It would do great good, and might form a Part of 'The Recluse'.\" (STC to WW, Sept. 1799).\n\nWordsworth pays tribute to Coleridge in his introduction to the edition of 1850: \"work [is] addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted.\"\n\nAccording to Monique R. Morgan's \"Narrative Means to Lyric Ends in Wordsworth's \"Prelude\",\" \"Much of the poem consists of Wordsworth's interactions with nature that 'assure[d] him of his poetic mission.' The goal of the poem is to demonstrate his fitness to produce great poetry, and \"The Prelude\" itself becomes evidence of that fitness.\" It traces the growth of the poet's mind by stressing the mutual consciousness and spiritual communion between the world of nature and man.\n\n\nThe work is a poetic reflection on Wordsworth's own sense of his poetic vocation as it developed over the course of his life. Its focus and mood present a sharp and fundamental fall away from the neoclassical and into the Romantic. Milton, who is mentioned by name in line 181 of Book One, rewrote God's creation and The Fall of Man in \"Paradise Lost\" in order to \"justify the ways of God to men,\" Wordsworth chooses his own mind and imagination as a subject worthy of epic.\n\nThis spiritual autobiography evolves out of Wordsworth's \"persistent metaphor [that life is] a circular journey whose end is 'to arrive where we started / And know that place for the first time' (T. S. Eliot, \"Little Gidding\", lines 241-42). \"The Prelude\" opens with a literal journey [during his manhood] whose chosen goal [...] is the Vale of Grasmere. \"The Prelude\" narrates a number of later journeys, most notably the crossing of the Alps in Book VI and, in the beginning of the final book, the climactic ascent of Snowdon. In the course of the poem, such literal journeys become the metaphorical vehicle for a spiritual journey—the quest within the poet's memory [...]\".\n\n\n"}

The film is based on Clare Boothe Luce's play of the same name, and was adapted for the screen by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin, who had to make the film acceptable for the Production Code for it to be released.\n\nThe film stars Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, Lucile Watson, Mary Boland, Florence Nash, and Virginia Grey, as well as Marjorie Main and Phyllis Povah, the last two of whom reprised their stage roles from the play. Ruth Hussey, Virginia Weidler, Butterfly McQueen, and Hedda Hopper also appeared in smaller roles. Fontaine was the last surviving actress with a credited role in the film; she died in 2013. \n\nThe film continued the play's all-female tradition—the entire cast of more than 130 speaking roles was female. Set in the glamorous Manhattan apartments of high society evoked by Cedric Gibbons, and in Reno, Nevada, where they obtain their divorces, it presents an acidic commentary on the pampered lives and power struggles of various rich, bored wives and other women they come into contact with.\n\nThroughout \"The Women\", not a single male is seen — although the males are much talked about, and the central theme is the women's relationships with them. Lesbianism is intimated in the portrayal of only one character, Nancy Blake (\"I am an old maid, a frozen asset.\"). The attention to detail was such that even in props such as portraits, only female figures are represented, and several animals which appeared as pets were also female. The only exceptions are a poster-drawing clearly of a bull in the fashion show segment, a framed portrait of Stephen Haines as a boy, a figurine on Mary's night stand, and an ad on the back of the magazine Peggy reads at Mary's house before lunch.\n\nFilmed in black and white, it includes a 6-minute fashion parade filmed in Technicolor, featuring Adrian's most \"outré \"designs; often cut in modern screenings, it has been restored by Turner Classic Movies. On DVD, the original black-and-white fashion show, which is a different take, is available for the first time.\n\n\"The Women\" follows the lives of Manhattan women, focusing in particular on Mary Haines, the cheerful, contented wife of Stephen and mother of Little Mary. After a bit of gossip flies around the salon these wealthy women visit, Mary's cousin Sylvia Fowler goes to a salon to get the newest, exclusive nail color: Jungle Red. She learns from a manicurist that Mary's husband has been having an affair with a predatory perfume counter girl named Crystal Allen. A notorious gossip, Sylvia delights in sharing the news with Mary's friends; she sets up Mary with an appointment with the same manicurist so that she hears the rumor about Stephen's infidelity.\n\nWhile Mary's mother urges her to ignore the gossip, Mary begins to have her own suspicions about her husband's increasingly frequent claims that he needs to work late. She decides to travel to Bermuda with her mother to think about the situation and hope the rumors will fade. Upon her return, Mary heads to a fashion show and learns that Crystal is in attendance, trying on clothes in a dressing room. Mary, at Sylvia's insistence, confronts her about the affair, but Crystal is completely unapologetic and slyly suggests that Mary keep the status quo unless she wants to lose Stephen in a divorce. Heartbroken and humiliated, Mary leaves quickly. The gossip continues, exacerbated by Sylvia and her friend Edith, who turns the affair into a public scandal by recounting Sylvia's version of the story to a notorious gossip columnist. Mary chooses to divorce her husband despite his efforts to convince her to stay. As she is packing to leave for Reno, Mary explains the divorce to Little Mary.\n\nOn the train to Reno, where she will get her divorce, Mary meets several women with the same destination and purpose: the dramatic, extravagant Countess de Lave; Miriam Aarons, a tough-cookie chorus girl; and, to her surprise, her friend Peggy Day, a shy young woman. Mary and her new friends settle in at a Reno ranch, where they get plenty of unsolicited advice from Lucy, the gruffly warm-hearted woman who runs the ranch. The Countess tells tales of her multiple husbands and seems to have found another prospect in Reno, a cowboy named Buck Winston. Miriam reveals she has been having an affair with Sylvia Fowler's husband and plans to marry him. Peggy, who has discovered that she is pregnant, is urged to call her husband, resolve their misunderstanding, and end the divorce proceedings. She succeeds. Sylvia arrives at the ranch, now that her husband has requested a divorce (\"Well, girls: move over\"). When she discovers that Miriam is to become the new Mrs. Fowler, a catfight ensues. Mary succeeds in breaking up the fight. Miriam convinces her that she, too, should forget her pride, get her husband on the phone, and try to patch things up before their divorce becomes legal in a few hours. Before Mary can decide, it rings — the call is from Stephen, who informs Mary that Crystal and he have just been married.\n\nTwo years pass. At the Haines apartment, Crystal, now Mrs. Haines, is taking a bubble bath and talking on the phone to her lover, who turns out to be Buck Winston, now the husband of the Countess and a successful radio star. Little Mary overhears the conversation before being shooed away by Crystal, who, not surprisingly, has no time or patience for the child. Sylvia figures out with whom Crystal has been speaking and is having an affair. Still an unrelenting gossip, Sylvia tucks this information away for later use. Mary hosts a dinner for her Reno friends to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the Countess and Buck, after which the Countess, Miriam, and Peggy go to a nightclub and urge Mary to come along. Mary decides to stay home. She chats with Little Mary, who inadvertently reveals how unhappy Stephen is and mentions Crystal's \"lovey dovey\" talk with Buck on the telephone. This news changes Mary's mind about the party. She gets dressed up, intent on fighting to get her ex back: \"I've had two years to grow claws, Mother -- Jungle Red!\"\n\nAt the nightclub (in the ladies' room), Mary worms the details of the affair out of Sylvia, then makes sure that a gossip columnist (played by a real-life one, Hedda Hopper) is alerted to it. Mary tells the Countess that her husband Buck has been having an affair with Crystal, then informs Crystal that everyone knows what she has been doing. Crystal does not care and tells Mary she can have Stephen back, since she will now have Buck to support her. The Countess reveals that she has been funding Buck's radio career and that with Crystal, he will be penniless and out of a job. Crystal resigns herself to the fact that she will be heading back to the perfume counter, adding: \"And by the way, there's a name for you ladies, but it isn't used in high society -- outside of a kennel.\"\n\nMary, triumphant, heads out the door and up the stairs to win back Stephen, who is waiting for her.\n\nIn January 1937, producers Harry M. Goetz and Max Gordon bought the film rights to the play for $125,000 and planned on turning it into a Claudette Colbert vehicle, with Gregory LaCava as the director. In March 1938, Norma Shearer and Carole Lombard were in negotiations to star. In November 1938, it was announced Jane Murfin was busy writing the film's screenplay at MGM. Virginia Weidler was cast on April 24, 1939. F. Scott Fitzgerald worked on the script early on in the process, but was uncredited. Cast member Florence Nash's sister Mary Nash had starred in a 1911 play called \"The Woman\".\n\"The Women\" has one color sequence by Technicolor, a scene featuring a fashion show. When interviewed by TCM host Robert Osborne, director George Cukor stated that he did not like the sequence and that he wanted to remove it from the film.\n\nThe film was commercially successful and was cited as one of the best of the year. Although it received no Academy Award nominations, many critics now describe it as one of the major films of what was a stellar year in Hollywood film production. On Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Women\" holds a 91% \"Fresh\" rating.\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $1,610,000 in the US and Canada and $660,000 elsewhere but because of its high production cost ultimately incurred a loss of $262,000. However, the film was re-released in 1947 and earned a small profit of $52,000.\n\nIn 2007, \"The Women\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nActress Anna Kendrick considers the film to be her favorite film to watch, calling it “a wildly funny all female cast and a female writer. I revisit it almost every year and my appreciation for the performances and the writing grows.” She later reiterated her love for the film, several years later.\n\nOn his November 5, 1939 radio broadcast, Jack Benny presented a sketch parody of \"The Women\" with all the male cast members in female roles and Mary Livingstone as the announcer.\n\nIt was remade as a 1956 musical comedy titled \"The Opposite Sex\", starring June Allyson, Joan Collins, and Ann Miller.\n\nIn 1960, MGM toyed with the idea of doing an all-male remake of \"The Women\" which would have been entitled, \"Gentlemen's Club\". Like the female version, this would have involved an all masculine cast and the plot would have involved a man (Jeffrey Hunter) who recently discovers among his friends that his wife is having an affair with another man (Earl Holliman) and after going to Reno to file for divorce and begin a new life, he later finds himself doing what he can to rectify matters later on when he discovers that the other man is only interested in money and position and he decides to win his true love back again. Although nothing ever came of this, it would have consisted of the following ensemble: Jeffrey Hunter (Martin Heal), Earl Holliman (Christopher Allen), Tab Hunter (Simon Fowler), Lew Ayres (Count Vancott), Robert Wagner (Mitchell Aarons), James Garner (Peter Day), Jerry Mathers (Little Martin), James Stewart (Mr. Heal), Ronald Reagan (Larry), Troy Donahue (Norman Blake), and Stuart Whitman (Oliver, the bartender who spills the beans about the illicit affair).\n\nIn 1977 it was remade by Rainer Werner Fassbinder for German television as \"Women in New York\".\n\nIn 2008, Diane English wrote and directed a remake of the same title, her feature film directorial debut.

The teenage Charlie Chaplin appeared there in 1904 and the actor James Mason is believed to have made his stage début at the theatre in 1931.\n\nLocated on the corner of Gordon Road and Birchett Road in Aldershot, the Theatre Royal replaced the Apollo Music Hall which had been on the corner of Union Street and Grosvenor Road in Aldershot from 1856 until it was destroyed by a fire in February 1889 during a performance of \"Monte Cristo & Co\". Originally a music hall, the Theatre Royal was regularly visited by touring companies of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. From 1887 this theatre was run by Clarence Sounes. The new theatre was designed by the theatre architects Bertie Crewe and W. G. R. Sprague. \n\nThe singer and comedian Arthur Lloyd appeared at the theatre in a tour of his play \"Ballyvogan\" in 1891. The theatre was extensively rebuilt and remodelled by Sounes and opened on 15 October 1900 as the New Theatre Royal with a production of \"The Private Secretary\". Charlie Chaplin, who had made his first stage appearance in Aldershot in 1894 returned to the town in May 1904 as a professional actor to play Billy the Page Boy in a tour of William Gillette's play \"Sherlock Holmes\", with Harry Arthur Saintsbury in the title role. \n\nThe aviator Samuel Franklin Cody was in a box in the theatre in 1912 when, being observed by the audience he was invited to step to the front of the box to talk about the aeroplanes he was developing. The English Opera Company appeared here in March 1914 in \"The Bohemian Girl\", \"Il Trovatore\", \"Don Giovanni\" and \"Cavalleria Rusticana\", among other works. In 1917 the curtain raiser \"Ida Collaborates\" by Noël Coward and Esmé Wynne-Tyson was performed at the theatre.\n\nThis new theatre was very small on a small site and could only seat 881 in total, with 197 in the stalls, 220 in the pit, 84 in the Dress Circle, and 350 in the gallery at the rear of the dress circle with its own entrance from Gordon Road. There were two boxes which seated 30 in total on each side at Dress Circle level, with elaborate plasterwork on the dress circle and box fronts. The proscenium opening was 24 feet wide and 26 feet deep with the flies 32 feet high. In addition there were eight dressing rooms, a manager's office and a band room with the stalls, pit and circle each having its own licensed bar.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1926 the theatre was owned by local businessman W. A. 'Willie' Rubick (1869-1926) on whose death the theatre transferred to his widow who sold it in 1928. During the 1930s the theatre was owned by Town & Country Theatres who also owned the Duchess Theatre in London. The actor James Mason is believed to have made his stage début here in 1931 in \"The Rascal\". However, some sources claim this was at the nearby Hippodrome Theatre. The Theatre Royal went bankrupt in the 1930s and was reopened as a Variety Theatre by Ben Garcia in 1940 who managed it during World War II. Aldershot being a Garrison Town, much of the audience at this time was male leading to a number of nude revues being held at the theatre. Other acts at this time included Todd Slaughter in the melodrama \"Jack the Ripper\", Billy Reid and his accordion band with Dorothy Squires as his vocalist, and Phyllis Dixey in her revue \"Peek A Boo\".\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948 the Theatre Royal was home to Harry Hanson's Court Players. In the late 1940s, as her film career floundered, Jessie Matthews ran an amateur theatre group at the theatre. In 1948 Garcia leased the theatre to another management who formed the Aldershot Repertory Company who put on plays there including \"Pygmalion\" in 1950 starring Jessie Matthews until their final production, the pantomime \"Aladdin\" in December 1952. Following this there was a short season of repertory theatre by the Arthur Brough Players but the theatre again went bankrupt and finally closed. A backstage fire in 1957 lead to great damage and the Theatre Royal was demolished in 1959. A block of flats, Matinée House, occupies the site today.\n\n"}
{"id": "2246544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2246544", "title": "Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts", "text": "Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts\n\nThe Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts consists of more than 22,000 pamphlets, broadsides, manuscripts, books, and news sheets, most of which were printed and distributed in London from 1640 to 1661. The collection represents a major primary source for the political, religious, military, and social history of England during the final years of the reign of King Charles I, the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the English Restoration of King Charles II. It is now held in the British Library.\n\nBookseller and publisher George Thomason (died 1666), who maintained a shop in the churchyard of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, methodically collected and preserved the works over two decades. The tracts consist of a broad range of writings, including sermons, songs, political speeches, debates, opinions, jokes, gossip, news reports, descriptions of the trial and execution of Charles I, accounts of Civil War battles, reports from Parliament, and several regularly appearing publications that historians consider the forebears of modern newspapers. Thomason's collection represents approximately 80 percent of the published works released in England during this period.\n\nThomason frequently made handwritten annotations on the tracts, providing such information as publication dates and the authorship of anonymous works. During the turbulent years of the Civil War and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell Thomason reputedly moved the collection several times to protect the more controversial works from destruction by government or opposition censors.\n\nThomason appears to have entrusted the collection to the care of Thomas Barlow, provost of The Queen's College and former librarian of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, and a future Bishop of Lincoln. Between 1660 and 1664 Barlow offered the tracts, together with two copies of a manuscript catalogue to the university for £4,000 but the sale was not agreed. Thomason remained hopeful that they would be sold, and in his will dated 1664, he charged his three executors (Barlow, Thomas Lockey, and John Rushworth) with selling the collection to the University on behalf of his children.\n\nAfter Thomason's death in April 1666, the negotiations fell through and the collection remained in Barlow's hands, until they were acquired about 1677–1679 by the bookbinder Samuel Mearne on behalf of the Royal Library at the Palace of Whitehall. Mearne rebound the tract volumes in a uniform manner but was never paid for his work and so retained the collection. Eventually Mearne's widow sought and obtained the permission of the Privy Council in May 1684 to dispose of them on her family's behalf. Over the next four decades various members of the Sisson family (descendants of Samuel Mearne) endeavoured to sell the collection on numerous occasions to Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, the Bodleian Library, Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth, James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos, Frederick, Prince of Wales, the Radcliffe Library in Oxford and the antiquary and book collector \"Honest Tom\" Martin, but in each case the potential purchasers were put off by the high price asked.\n\nIn January 1754 Elizabeth Sisson approached Thomas Birch one of the trustees of the newly established British Museum, loaning him the 12 volume catalogue, but again nothing was to come of the sale during Elizabeth Sisson's lifetime. Finally, in 1762, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute purchased the collection on behalf of King George III for the bargain price of £300 (a fraction of the cost of forming the collection). In that same year King George III donated the collection to the new British Museum at Montagu House, where they were originally known as the \"King's pamphlets\" and added to the Royal Library Collection. In 1973, the museum transferred the Thomason Tracts to the British Library where they continue to be housed.\n\nAccording to Thomas Carlyle, the Thomason Tracts were;\nMany of the publications that comprise the collection are exceedingly rare. In fact, some are not known to exist anywhere else. The tracts are bound into some 2,000 volumes and housed at the British Library's main building at St. Pancras. Because of their rarity and fragile condition, the originals are not available to general researchers. However, the library maintains paper facsimiles in its rare books collection, and in 1977 University Microfilms International released a set of 256 microfilm reels containing the entire collection. The microfilms are available at research libraries around the world.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40532055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40532055", "title": "Yūrei-zu", "text": "Yūrei-zu\n\nYūrei-zu (幽霊図) are a genre of Japanese art consisting of painted or woodblock print images of ghosts, demons and other supernatural beings. They are considered to be a subgenre of \"fūzokuga\", \"pictures of manners and customs.\" These types of art works reached the peak of their popularity in Japan in the mid- to late 19th century.\n\nLiterally translatable as ‘faint (\"yū\" - 幽) spirit (\"rei\" - 霊),’ \"yūrei\" is just one of several Japanese words used to refer to spirit beings. Other terms include: \"obake\" (お化け), \"yōkai\" (妖怪), \"bōrei\" (亡霊), and \"shiryō\" (死霊). There is a long tradition of belief in the supernatural in Japan stemming from a variety of influences. Imported sources include Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folklore. The most notable influence, however, is Shintō, a native Japanese animistic religion which presupposes that our physical world is inhabited by eight million omnipresent spirits.\n\nJapanese ghosts are essentially spirits \"on leave\" from hell in order to complete an outstanding mission. The souls (\"reikon\" - 霊魂) of those who die violently, do not receive proper funerary rites, or die while consumed by a desire for vengeance, do not pass peacefully to join the spirits of their ancestors in the afterlife. Instead, their \"reikon\" souls are transformed into \"ayurei\" souls, which can travel back to the physical world. According to Buddhist belief, the journey from the world of the living (\"konoyo\" - この世) to that of the dead (\"anoyo\" - あの世) takes 49 days, and it is in this limbo-like phase that they can attend to unresolved issues. There is a close relationship between the degree of an individual’s suffering in life and the severity of their actions in the afterlife. While their intentions are not always evil, the results of their actions are almost always damaging for the humans involved. Belief held that a ghost could only receive release through the prayers of a living individual that his/her soul be allowed to pass into the underworld.\n\nImages of supernatural beings, as well as gory and grotesque scenes exist on Japanese painted scrolls going back to the medieval period. This tradition continued through the centuries, providing a foundation for \"yūrei-zu\", as well as for violent \"chimidoro-e\" (“bloody pictures” - 血みどろ絵) and \"muzan-e\" (“cruel pictures” - 無残絵) which were to become popular in Edo Japan. Although there are prior examples, \"yūrei-zu\" reached the pinnacle of their popularity in the mid- through late 19th century, along with ghost themed \"kabuki\" plays and ghost tales (\"kaidan\" - 怪談). Scholars link the \"persistent popularity\" of the occult to the \"unsettled social conditions\" prevailing during the late Edo, which included the oppressive Tokugawa regime, the beginnings of westernization, and a number of natural disasters.\n\nJapan has long had a vibrant folkloric tradition of ghost stories, and in the early eighteenth century these began to be dramatized for the \"nō\" stage and \"bunraku\" puppet theatre. As \"kabuki\" began to flourish throughout the later 1700s, so too did the number of dramas based on ghost stories, particularly those involving vengeful female ghosts returning to punish their wrong-doers. \"Kabuki\", like \"ukiyo-e\", was a populist art form, which aimed to satisfy the dramatic tastes of a “proletarian clientele”: the rising working and middle classes in Edo (present-day Tokyo). \"Kabuki\" and \"ukiyo-e\" shared a close kinship, as woodblock artists attempted to tap into “the public’s ever-increasing appetite for tales of the bizarre and thrilling,” and share the \"kabuki\" audience demographic. As Sarah Fensom notes, \"that prints of the macabre, the supernatural and the grotesque were so frequently designed and distributed is for the most part a greater reflection of 19th century Japanese tastes than of the agenda of the artists.\" Artists produced images of ghosts as well as of actors in ghost roles, effecting a conflation of three prevailing trends in \"ukiyo-e\" of the period: depictions of the female form (\"bijin-ga\"), depictions of supernatural or macabre themes, and depictions of celebrated actors (\"kabuki-e\" or \"shibai-e\").\n\nIn an attempt to return Japan to its feudal, agrarian roots, the Tokugawa regime in 1842 instituted the Tempō Reforms (\"Tempō no kaikaku\" - 天保の改革), a collection of laws governing many aspects of everyday life. In addition to the economy, the military, agriculture and religion, the Reforms reached into the world of art. The intent of the Reforms was essentially to valorize frugality and loyalty, thus ostentatious or morally dubious images such as depictions of \"geisha\", \"oiran\" courtesans and \"kabuki\" actors were banned. According to an 1842 decree aimed at print publishers: “To make woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental to public morals. Henceforth the publication of new works [of this kind] as well as the sale of previously procured stocks is strictly forbidden. In future you are to select designs that are based on loyalty and filial piety and which serve to educate women and children, and you must insure that they are not luxurious.”\n\nGiven this climate of censorship, some artists used the \"yūrei-zu\" genre \"to symbolically and humorously disguise … criticism of the social and political maladies of the day by having fantastic creatures appear as substitutes for real people, especially the ruling elite.\" Such critiques led the government to subsequently ban both \"yūrei-zu\" and ghost plays. The Tempō Reforms were ultimately unsuccessful, and the strict regulation of art works was no longer enforced after 1845, once the shogunal advisor who had initiated the Reforms left the government. As long as the rules remained nominally in effect, some artists invoked clever word- and picture-play to circumvent censorship.\n\nThe ghosts featured in Edo period \"ukiyo-e\" come in various forms. They can appear as animal creatures both real and imagined, such as foxes, cats, dragons and demons. They can also be the discontent spirits of male warriors. Most of the ghosts featured, however, tend to be female, \"specifically,\" as Donald Richie notes, \"dissatisfied females.\"\n\nThe subjects in \"yūrei-zu\" typically correspond to a very specific set of physical characteristics:\n\nBy nature, they:\n\nThe earliest \"yūrei-zu\" is considered to be by Maruyama Ōkyo (円山 応挙), founder of the Maruyama school and one of the most significant artists of the 18th century. \"The Ghost of Oyuki\" (\"Oyuki no maboroshi\" - お雪の幻) is a silk scroll painting dating to the second half of the 18th century In Maruyama’s naturalistic style, it depicts a faintly coloured female ghost whose body tapers into transparency. It has been described as an “image of haunting beauty.” According to a scroll box inscription by a one-time owner, the subject of the painting is Maruyama’s lover, a \"geisha\" who died young. Her ghost is said to have visited the artist in a dream and inspired him to paint her portrait.\n\nAll of the pre-eminent \"ukiyo-e\" artists of the later Edo period produced \"yūrei-zu\", including Kunisada, Hokusai and Utagawa Kuniyoshi, who “designed the largest number of prints portraying ghosts as well as other strange, unusual and fantastic creatures.” \n\nAnother major producer of \"yūrei-zu\" was Tsukioka Yoshitoshi who reputedly had personal encounters with ghosts in 1865 and 1880. In 1865 he produced the series \"One Hundred Ghost Stories of China and Japan\" (\"Wakan hyaku monogatari\"), his first series to feature ghosts. The original series, which was based on a popular game of the period involving ghost stories, included one hundred images; however, only twenty-six were published. His final print series, \"New Forms of 36 Ghosts\" (\"Shinkei sanjūrokuten\"), was \"so freakishly popular,\" according to Sarah Fensom, \"that the blocks from which it was printed wore out.\"\n\nAlthough patently no longer as pervasive as during the late Edo period, \"yūrei-zu\" and contemporary variations continue to be produced by Japanese artists in various media. One prominent example is the \"nihonga\" painter Fuyuko Matsui (b. 1974), whose ghostly images are described as “beautiful and eerie,” “dark [and] Gothic,” and “disturbing and mesmerizing.” Matsui has identified a goal of her works as imparting “a condition that maintains sanity while being close to madness.” Matsui’s colour on silk hanging scroll “Nyctalopia” (2005) is particularly reminiscent of classic \"yūrei-zu\" such as Maruyama’s “The Ghost of Oyuki.”\n\nAnother artist whose works echo \"yūrei-zu\" is Hisashi Tenmyouya (b. 1966). Between 2004 and 2005, Tenmyouya completed a series of acrylic on wood paintings entitled \"New Version of Six Ghost Stories\" (新形六怪撰). The six images are reworkings of famous Japanese ghost stories, such as \"Tokaido Yotsuya\" \"Ghost Story\" and \"Kohata Koheiji Ghost Story\", which were rendered in woodblocks by Edo artists.\n\nAlso creating contemporary \"yūrei-zu\" in a traditional style is American-born, Japanese-resident artist Matthew Meyer. His \"Japanese Yōkai\" series is collected in his illustrated book \"The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons\". According to Meyer, the intention of his paintings is \"to recreate the feeling of old Japanese woodblock prints while adding a contemporary illustrative touch.\"\n\nThe influence of \"yūrei-zu\" is also evident in the manga of Shigeru Mizuki (b. 1922) and Hiroshi Shiibashi (b. 1980), both of whom are renowned for their works dealing with traditional Japanese aspects of the supernatural.\n\n\n\n"}
