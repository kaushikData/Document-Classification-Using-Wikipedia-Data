Especially in Europe, she was often credited as \"Annie Fargue\".\n\nBorn in Belgium as Henriette Goldfarb, she escaped the country with her family before the Nazi occupation. She wanted to become an actress; her mother opposed the idea, but relented when Fargé was accepted at the Conservatoire National.\n\nFargé traveled to New York and later married dancer Dirk Sanders. The couple had a daughter, Leslie (Mrs. Tabuteau, French TV Producer), born shortly before \"Angel\" began filming in April 1960. Broadway producer Joshua Logan is said to have discovered Fargé and had her take English lessons. At the time of casting for the television series, Fargé was an understudy in the Broadway production of \"The World of Suzie Wong\". \n\nShe was signed for the \"Angel\" role by producer Jess Oppenheimer on the basis of CBS executive Robert Lewine's recommendation. Oppenheimer did not elect to do a screen test.\n\nThe \"Angel\" pilot did not impress the network, but when Lewine screened it for sponsors S. C. Johnson and General Foods, both sponsors were sufficiently impressed to tell the network executive to put the show on the air or they would cancel their sponsorship of all CBS programs. Fargé played Angelique \"Angel\" Smith, the scatterbrained French wife of American architect John Smith, played by Marshall Thompson. Doris Singleton was her sympathetic neighbor Susie, and Don Keefer was Susie's husband George. The show was filmed at Desilu Studios. The series ran for thirty-three episodes. After \"Angel\" folded due to low ratings, Fargé appeared as a guest star in a few other series, including \"The Rifleman\" and \"Adventures in Paradise\".\n\nHer last television appearance was in a 1964 episode of \"Perry Mason\", \"The Case of the Betrayed Bride,\" as she played the role of defendant Marie Claudet.\n\nFargé divorced her husband and returned to France in the mid-1960s. Upon her return to France, Fargé became a theatrical producer (\"Hair\", \"Godspell\", \"Oh! Calcutta!\", \"Jesus Christ Superstar\") and was associate producer for the 1981 John Huston film \"Escape to Victory\". She later became the manager of French singer Michel Polnareff.\n\nFargé died of cancer in Neuilly-sur-Seine, aged 76, on 4 March 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9305546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9305546", "title": "Anxiety of influence", "text": "Anxiety of influence\n\nAnxiety of Influence is a type of literary criticism established by Harold Bloom in 1973, in his book, \"\". It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.\n\nThe theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to Thomas Pynchon and Anne Carson in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors. To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:\n\n\"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master.\"\n\nContrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect. He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor. Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative. The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.\n\nIn order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six \"revisionary ratios\", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms. These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.\n\n\n"}

Henrik Hagtvedt and Vanessa Patrick, the two researchers who authored the article, demonstrated a favorable influence of artworks on consumer evaluations of non-art products that were associated with the artworks via, for instance, advertising or product design. The authors suggested that the creation and appreciation of art has evolved through the millennia of human prehistory, and that the universal human impulse to apply skill and creative effort to express oneself artistically is also reflected in the recognition of the objects thus created as belonging to a special category. This special category has several characteristics, including non-utility. This does not imply that artworks cannot have utility, but that creativity and skill are central to the creation and appreciation of the artwork, irrespective of any other functions, or lack thereof, that the artwork may serve. This non-utilitarian quest for excellence, when associated with other objects, leads to more favorable evaluations of those objects.\n\n"}

{"id": "1370627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1370627", "title": "Azadi Tower", "text": "Azadi Tower\n\nThe Azadi Tower (, ; \"Freedom Tower\"), formerly known as the Shahyad Tower (, ; \"Shah's Memorial Tower\"), is a monument located at Azadi Square, in Tehran, Iran. It is one of the landmarks of Tehran, marking the west entrance to the city, and is part of the Azadi Cultural Complex, which also includes a museum underground.\n\nThe tower is about tall and is completely clad in cut marble. It was commissioned by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, to mark the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran.\n\nAfter winning a competition, architect Hossein Amanat was tasked to design the tower, his client being the Council of Celebrations. His ideas were based upon classical and post-classical Iranian architecture, popular influences on art in the 1960s following the White Revolution. Iran's increasing wealth sparked modernisation programmes and sent the art industry into a renaissance-like period.\n\nThe first name associated with this monument was \"Darvāze-ye Kuroš\" (\"the Gate of Cyrus\"), and at the time of the Centenary Celebrations, Asadollah Alam, who chaired the Council of Celebrations, referred to the monument as \"Darvāze-ye Šāhanšāhi\" (\"the Imperial Gate\").\n\nThe monument's official name was decided before the announcement of the competition for the monument's design in September 1966. Bahram Farahvashi, a scholar and professor of ancient Iranian languages who worked with the Council of Celebrations, came up with the officially designated name of the structure, \"Šahyād Āryāmehr\".\n\nBuilt in 1971 in commemoration of the 2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran, this \"gateway into Tehran\" was named the \"Šahyād\" (\"King's Memorial\") in honor of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, but was renamed \"Āzādi\" (\"Freedom\") following the 1979 Revolution.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Iran became a major oil-exporting country, and using the newly-found wealth, the shah launched programs to modernize and industrialize the country. This followed a cultural growth that architect Hossein Amanat describes as \"a mini renaissance\". In 1966, Amanat won a competition to design the building.\n\nDue to governmental concerns, he was required to sign underneath contracts with \"on condition of the approval of the Council of Celebrations\", which would serve as the client. Amanat planned to contract the British company of Arup to assist in the structural design of the tower, as he was impressed by their contributions towards the design and construction of the Sydney Opera House. He initially faced opposition from the head of the council, as well as several conservative and nationalistic Iranian engineers, as he was turning to a foreign engineer for assistance. Despite that, the shah supported Amanat, sending a letter to the council which would leave the decision to the architect. Shahbanu Farah Pahlavi was also supportive of Amanat's decisions.\n\nAmanat told the BBC World News in an interview that \"overall, the building starts from the base and moves up towards the sky.\" He states that he was inspired to design the tower in this way because he felt that Iran \"should be moving towards a higher level.\" According to him, the main vault is a Sassanian arch representing the classical era, while the broken arch above it is a popular medieval form of arch representing the post-classical era. The \"network of ribs\", which connects the arches together, would represent the connection between classical and post-classical Iran.\n\nBuilt with white marble from Isfahan, the monument includes 8,000 blocks of stone. The stones were all located and supplied by Ghanbar Rahimi, who was well known for his extensive knowledge of quarries, often known as the \"Soltān-e Sang-e Irān\" (\"Iran's Sultan of Stone\"). Computers were used to \"define its complex woven surfaces,\" which, at the time, was a new technological technique. The main contractor for the construction of the tower was the MAP Company, supervised by Ghaffar Davarpanah Varnosfaderani, a renowned Iranian stonemason. The project was mainly funded by a group of five hundred Iranian industrialists. According to a report by the MEED, the construction costed about six million dollars.\n\nOn October 16, 1971, the inauguration of the tower took place. However, it was not until January 14, 1972 that the tower was open to the public.\n\nThe iconic Martyrs' Memorial in Algiers, which was built in 1982, shows a strong influence by this monument.\n\nThe Azadi Museum is located on the basement floor. Inside the floor, there are black austere walls and proportions, and a concrete mesh forms the ceiling. Heavy doors open onto a crypt with subdued lighting issuing from showcases, each containing an object. The museum houses a number of gold and enamel pieces, painted pottery, marble and paintings. Approximately fifty pieces have been selected, each representing a particular period in Iran's history.\n\nAmong the earliest items on display were square flagstones, gold sheeting, and terracotta tablets from Susa covered with cuneiform characters. Before the 1979 Revolution, the main display was occupied by a copy of the Cyrus Cylinder, the original being kept at the British Museum. A translation of the cylinder's cuneiform inscription is inscribed in golden letters on the wall of one of the galleries leading to the museum's audio-visual department. A similar plaque facing the cylinder listed the Twelve Points of the White Revolution. Next, to the Cyrus Cylinder, there was a gold plaque commemorating the original presentation of the museum to Mohammad Reza Pahlavi by the Mayor of Tehran. Potteries, ceramics, varnished porcelains (such as a seventh-century blue and gold dish from Gorgan), an illuminated Quran, and miniatures highlighted milestones in the country's history up to the 19th century, which were represented by two painted panels from Empress and the structure was to represent Farah Pahlavi as in is stated in some ancient texts.\n\nThe original show, devised in 1971, was replaced in 1975 by a new one which invited visitors to discover Iran's geographic and natural diversity along with its fundamental historical elements. It exhibited a number of national achievements, technical undertakings, calligraphed poems, and miniature paintings. The project, devised by a Czechoslovak company, required 12,000 metres of film, 20,000 color slides, 20 movie projectors, and 120 slide projectors. The audiovisual programmes were directed by professor Jaroslav Frič (1928–2000). Five computers operated the entire system.\n\nGerman artist Philipp Geist organized a projection mapping installation named \"Gate of Words\" at the Azadi Tower, on the occasion of the German Unity Day. The show was held from October 3 to 5, 2015.\n\nIn this project, the artist visualized the topics of freedom, peace, space and time in a poetical manner. Geist developed a light installation made of colored words and concepts in different languages, and abstract painterly compositions of images. The glowing words were in English, German and Persian, moving in sync with live music on the walls of the tower.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37286134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37286134", "title": "Berlin Biennale", "text": "Berlin Biennale\n\nThe Berlin Biennale (full name: Berlin Biennale für zeitgenössische Kunst, Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art) is a contemporary art exhibition, which has been held at various locations in Berlin, Germany, every two to three years since 1998. The curator or curators choose the artists who will participate. After the event became established, annual themes were introduced. The Biennale is now underwritten by the German government through the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (Federal Culture Foundation), and is the second most important contemporary arts event in the country, after documenta. The Berlin Biennale was co-founded on 26 March 1996 by Klaus Biesenbach and a group of collectors as well as patrons of art. Biesenbach is also the founding director of KW Institute for Contemporary Art and currently serves as Director of MoMA PS1 and Chief Curator at Large at MoMA.\n\nThe first exhibition ran from 30 September to 30 December 1998 and was curated by Klaus Biesenbach, Hans-Ulrich Obrist and Nancy Spector. It took place in the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin-Mitte, at the Akademie der Künste in Pariser Platz and at the postal centre in Oranienburger Straße. More than 70 artists took part, including several unknowns who would later become famous, such as Franz Ackermann, Jonathan Meese, Thomas Demand and Olafur Eliasson. The show was interdisciplinary to reflect the context of contemporary art. During the opening week, the Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija catered a banquet for 1,000 guests in the post office gymnasium, and a three-night combination symposium and festival, \"Congress 3000\", took place in the House of World Cultures.\n\nThe Second Berlin Biennale ran from 20 April to 20 June 2001 and included works by approximately 50 artists (deliberately fewer than at the first) from more than 30 countries, several of them very young. It was curated by Saskia Bos, who adopted the theme of \"connectedness, contribution and commitment\" and sought to reject commercially oriented art while fostering engagement with the public in order to \"exhibit a utopian sociability in art\". Works were again exhibited at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art and the postal centre in Oranienburger Straße as well as under the elevated S-Bahn at Jannowitzbrücke and the Allianz Building, known as the Treptowers.\n\nSince 2004, the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, which was founded by Klaus Biesenbach in the early 1990s, has been responsible for the Berlin Biennale.\n\nThe Third Berlin Biennale took place from 14 February to 18 April 2004 and was directed by Ute Meta Bauer, who chose five themes, or \"hubs,\" titled Migration, Urban Conditions, Sonic Landscapes, Modes and Scenes, and Other Cinema, in order to focus on artistic conversation and on the specific circumstances of post-Cold War Berlin. The Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art was again used as a site; additional sites included the Martin Gropius Bau and, for the exhibition of 35 cinematic works, the cinema Kino Arsenal at Potsdamer Platz. There were several collaborations with various Berlin cultural institutions, a partnership with the Friends of the Deutsche Kinemathek, and a weekly special radio broadcast, reboot.fm. The event ended with a three-day multi-media \"Performance Jam\" on the final weekend. The \"Artforum\" reviewer pointed to the lack of new work and the extra year's delay since the second Berlin Biennale as signs of a need for better funding and referred to some of the collaborations as \"strained aesthetic ententes.\" A 2008 retrospective in \"Berliner Zeitung\" judged Bauer as having been \"unable to decide between aesthetic statement and didacticism.\"\n\nThe Fourth Berlin Biennale ran from 25 March to 5 June 2006, curated by Maurizio Cattelan, Massimiliano Gioni, and Ali Subotnick, known collectively as the Wrong Gallery after a project they did in New York. Titled \"Von Mäusen und Menschen\" (Of Mice and Men) and conceived of as an extended narrative or life cycle, the Fourth Berlin Biennale featured works by Mircea Cantor, Bruce Nauman, Ján Mančuška, and Thomas Schütte, among others. The 2006 Berlin Biennale was recognized as a \"project of peak cultural importance\" and received both federal funding and other assistance. In \"The New York Times\", Roberta Smith called it \"a kind of rebus about the arc and tumult of life.\" The \"Berliner Zeitung\" retrospective contrasted John Steinbeck's theme in his novel of that name, the American dream, with the exhibition's, \"the trauma of the 20th century.\" The organizers opened a special gallery, the Gagosian Gallery, and presented some works there six months in advance. In Berlin itself, the Biennale used 11 or 12 venues, including the Old Garrison Cemetery and the Hall of Mirrors in the Ballhaus Mitte, most of them along Auguststraße. This Biennale was \"a giant success\" and drew 85,000 visitors. However, one critic judged it to have sacrificed the human to economic considerations and preferred the opposition of the Third Biennale.\n\nThe Fifth Berlin Biennale was curated by Adam Szymczyk and Elena Filipovic and took place from 5 April to 15 June 2008. It was titled \"When Things Cast No Shadow\". By day, 50 artists representing four generations showed works, many of them site-specific, at four locations including the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Schinkel pavilion behind the Kronprinzenpalais. A parallel night-time segment titled \"Mes nuits sonts plus belles que vos jours\" (My nights are more beautiful than your days; the title of a 1989 \"erotic thriller\" by Andrzej Żuławski) involved more than 100 artists in 63 presentations all over the city of more extemporaneous and less finished works. This Biennale drew on the history of the city, but was also seen by one critic as the \"coming of age\" of an exhibition which up to then had featured \"trendy trash art\" and been more of a tourist-oriented evocation of the city than it had been at the end of the 1990s.\n\nThe Sixth Berlin Biennale ran from 11 June to 8 August 2010 and was headed by Kathrin Rhomberg. It was preceded by Project Artists Beyond, sponsored by the European Commission, which sought to showcase the process of artistic creation through exhibits in public places. This began in January and involved seven artists in Amsterdam, Istanbul, Pristina, Copenhagen, Vienna, and Paris in addition to Berlin. The title of this Biennale was \"was draußen wartet\" (what is waiting out there) and the guiding question was \"Glauben Sie an die Wirklichkeit?\" (Do you believe in reality?). More than 40 artists were featured. Rhomberg chose sites in parts of the city inhabited by large numbers of migrants and invited the New York art critic Michael Fried to mount an exhibition on the drawings of the 19th-century artist Adolph Menzel in association with the Alte Nationalgalerie and the Museum of Prints and Drawings. During the first week of the exhibition, \"La monnaie vivante / The Living Currency / Die lebende Münze\" was presented by the Theater Hebbel am Ufer and the Centre d’art contemporain de Brétigny, with choreography by Pierre Bal-Blanc. According to \"Der Spiegel\", this Biennale was forgettable and the attendance figures were not even published.\n\nThe Seventh Berlin Biennale took place from 27 April to 1 July 2012 and was curated by Artur Żmijewski with art historian Joanna Warsza and the Voina art collective. The emphasis was on political relevance: 320 trees from the environs of the Auschwitz concentration camp were transplanted to various Berlin locations; the organizers created a newspaper in advance of the opening, \"P/Act for Art: Berlin Biennale Zeitung\", in which they published invited opinions from cultural figures on the state of cultural policy in Berlin; members of the Occupy movement were invited to occupy the Kunst-Werke Institute; and one weekend there was a forum in the round organized by Jonas Staal for representatives of organizations on terrorist watch lists. One exhibit, the \"Peace Wall\" by Nada Prlja of Macedonia, was a black barrier wide by high blocking Friedrichstraße at the point roughly south of Checkpoint Charlie, where tourist attractions and expensive shops give way to a largely immigrant and poor neighborhood of Kreuzberg. It was taken down early after public protest. This Biennale broke the attendance record but was not well received by critics, with some saying that there was not enough art and that there was more relevance in the works on show at commercial venues in Berlin Gallery Weekend, which fell on the Biennale's opening weekend.\n\nThe Eighth Berlin Biennale took place from 29 May to 3 August 2014 and was curated by Juan A. Gaitán. Locations were the Haus am Waldsee, the Dahlem museums of the Berlin State Museums, the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, and Crash Pad c/o Kunstwerke.\n\nThe Ninth Berlin Biennale took place from to 4 June to 18 September 2016 and was curated by the New York art collective DIS. The theme was \"The Present in Drag\" and the locations were the Academy of Arts, the European School of Management and Technology, the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, the Feuerle Collection, and a sightseeing boat. Some reviewers criticized it as \"slick\" and \"shallow\".\n\nThe 9th Berlin Biennale stirred some controversy among critics and audiences. James Farago, of \"The Guardian\", wrote a scathing review, describing the art event as “an ultra-slick, ultra-sarcastic biennial, replete with ads, avatars, custom security guard uniforms, a manic social media presence disposed to hashtags like #BiennaleGlam, and a woman lip syncing to Trap Queen.” \n\nOther critics lauded the Biennale; in the September 2016 Issue of Artforum, British artist Hannah Black wrote that “…They [DIS] have been greeted, just like the modernist avant-gardes were in their time, with accusations of bad politics and even worse taste. Perhaps these critics haven’t noticed: The world is a ruin, but we go on living in it…” \n\nPiero Bisello concluded that “Regardless of what we thought Berlin Biennale 2016 would be, we can now claim it is for us a milestone in art history, whether by that history we mean the last centuries, the last years, the last days, the last hours, the last fashion seasons.”\n\nTess Edmonson wrote For \"Art Agenda\" that “As a whole, the biennial articulates the sense that disengaging from networks of capital and power is neither effective nor interesting nor possible, instead performing its own complicity.”\n\nOne year later art historian commented on the controversial nature of the 9th Biennale: \"Finding myself confronted with such a unified front of fantasies, rhetorics, pretensions and desires for authenticity in 2017, I confess that I revised my reaction to DIS’s 2016 Berlin Biennale 9, ‘The Present in Drag’. That exhibition rigorously, to the point of cynicism, followed the web 2.0 world of digital prosumer reality and the moral ambiguity of its promises and aesthetics. In my view, it catered to a young, white, middle-class audience, but now it strikes me as more realistic than what we are seeing today: an outsourcing to the (post-)colonial other of the political, guilt, spiritual desire and collectivity that plague the Western-Northern self.\"\n\nThe 10th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art will take place from 9 June to 9 September 2018, and is curated by Gabi Ngcobo and her team of Nomaduma Rosa Masilela, Serubiri Moses, Thiago de Paula Souza and Yvette Mutumba. Titled \"We don’t need another hero\", the 10th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art is a conversation with artists and contributors who think and act beyond art as they confront the incessant anxieties perpetuated by a willful disregard for complex subjectivities.\n\nFrom 9 June to 9 September 2018, it presents works by:\n\nAgnieszka Brzeżańska, Ana Mendieta, Basir Mahmood, Belkis Ayón, Cinthia Marcelle, Dineo Seshee Bopape, Elsa M’bala, Emma Wolukau-Wanambwa, Fabiana Faleiros, Firelei Báez, Gabisile Nkosi, Grada Kilomba, Heba Y.

Ooga Booga (Blood Dolls), Ivan Burroughs (Decadent Evil), Gingerdead Man, Jack Attack (Demonic Toys), and Jack Deth (Trancers) are all featured.\n\nFootage from Vampire Journals is used at the beginning of the movie which ties the Subspecies series to the Bongy Westphall Universe.\n\nJack Attack's appearance in Evil Bong brings Demonic Toys into the Bongy Westphall Universe. The Dollman crossover also incorporates Bad Channels due to a small Dollman cameo.\n\nBy crossing over with Demonic Toys, all ten other Puppet Master films are entered into the Bongy Westphall Universe although Puppet Master never crosses over directly with Evil Bong.\n\nZombies Vs. Strippers (2012): The character Hambo (played by Chance A. Rearden) later appears in Ooga Booga and several Gingerdead Man films.\n\nCrash and Burn (1990): The character Quinn (played by Bill Moseley) later appears in Evil Bong (2006).\n\nThe following is the list of films in Bongy Westphall Universe (in order of release):\n\n"}

Written in Middle English, it was most likely authored by a Franciscan friar. It is structured as a dialogue between a wealthy layman (Dives) and a spiritual poor man with many similarities to a friar (Pauper). The work is an example of orthodox Catholic theology, but it engages many questions relevant to Wycliffism, an English movement condemned as heretical by church authorities. \n\nLike John Wycliffe's \"De mandatis divinis\", \"Dives and Pauper\" discusses the Commandments in the context of Church law, as well as the \"laws of civil society\". Patricia Barnum describes it as a discussion about justice in the context of the \"seemingly double standard\" of the Old Testament concept of law (\"ius\") and the New Testament charity (\"caritas\"). The question posed is whether God's laws may be harmonized with man's laws. \"Dives and Pauper\" starts the inquiry with the question of what the Christian scriptures teach about wealth (\"temporalia\").\n"}
{"id": "51848676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51848676", "title": "Djibi, the Kitten", "text": "Djibi, the Kitten\n\nDjibi, the Kitten () is the last novel of Felix Salten, published originally in 1945 and translated into English in 1946. Similarly as in other Salten's late books, the protagonist is an animal, this time a young female cat called Djibi.\n\nIn \"Renni the Rescuer\", the main animal character had been a loyal servant to humans, but Djibi is an independent cat who chooses for herself where to live. The novel begins dramatically with a drowning attempt which the young kitten survives. A boy rescues her from the river and takes to his home where a dog adopts her and feeds along with other puppies. But when the boy rebuffs the cat, she leaves the farm immediately and, for a while, lives in the forest and kills pheasants. After being wounded by a gamekeeper, she decides to take shelter with humans again, and a kind teacher, Salten's alter ego, adopts her. After that, Djibi lives with the teacher and his wife, but her strong hunting instinct finally leads Djibi to her demise.\n\nThe main theme of the book are the reciprocal interactions between men and animals, especially cats and dogs. Unlike in Salten's earlier animal novels, for instance \"Bambi's Children\", there isn't much anthropomorphism in \"Djibi\" — there is only one short dialogue between Djibi and a marten. The human characters, in contrast to the animals in the book, mostly have no personal names, but are referred to as “the teacher,” “the farmer,” etc.\n\nThe first English translation of \"Djibi\" by Raya Levin appeared in the United Kingdom in 1946, illustrated by Walter Linsenmaier as the original Swiss edition, but there is also an anonymous American translation, Jibby the Cat, illustrated by Fritz Kredel, which was published in 1948 by Julian Messner in New York City. This edition differs greatly from Salten's original text. Not only has it a happy ending — Djibi's death is left out — but it also has a happy opening added to it: the novel begins with five pages depicting Djibi's (or Jibby's) sweet life before the attempt on her life. The novel has been largely rewritten, and new incidents have been added to the story. For instance, in the Swiss and the British edition, the boy takes the kitten from the river directly to his home, but in the American edition, he first takes it to the teacher (or “schoolmaster Victor” in this edition). The Americal edition also adds chapter numbers and chapter titles to the book, and most human characters have personal names.\n\nFor example, the episode where Djibi decides to leave the farm is very different in the two English-language editions. The British edition follows very closely Salten's original German-language text, but the American edition has it rewritten:\n\nThe book has also been translated at least into French in 1946 and into Swedish in 1974, both with Linsenmaier's illustrations; the Swedish translation is slightly shortened. A 2016 Finnish translation is unillustrated. In 2016, Raya Levin's translation was published also in the United States, illustrated presumably by Richard Cowdrey.\n"}

His older brother was Giacomo Casanova, the famous adventurer, and his younger brother was Giovanni Casanova; also a well-known painter.\n\nHe was born in London, where his parents, Zanetta Farussi, an actress, and Gaetano Casanova, an actor and dancer, had a theatrical engagement. It was rumoured that his father was actually the Prince of Wales (who shortly after became King George II); whether for scurrilous motives or publicity is unclear. They returned to Venice when he was still young and, after his father's death in 1733, he and his siblings were placed in the care of the Grimani family.\n\nHis career began in the workshops of Giovanni Antonio Guardi, a very unpleasant time for him, according to the memoirs of his brother Giacomo. Later, he moved to the studios of Antonio Joli, who was a set designer for the theatres owned by the Grimanis. This was also, apparently, unsatisfactory and he took up studies with the battle painter, Francesco Simonini. In 1751, upon his brother Giovanni's advice, he went to Paris and became an apprentice of Charles Parrocel. The following year, after Parrocel's death, he went to Dresden and spent a year studying the battle paintings at the \"Gallery of the Electors of Saxony\". In 1758, he returned to Paris and set himself up as a free-lance artist.\n\nSuccess did not come immediately, and his first exhibition was a failure. In 1761, he became a supernumerary member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture and was promoted to full member in 1763. As a result of favourable criticism from Denis Diderot, he began to receive commissions from the aristocracy. Diderot would later express negative opinions about Casanova's work, but his reputation was already made. His fame soon spread eastward and he received commissions from Catherine the Great for the Hermitage, beginning in 1768. Two years later, he produced his four famous \"disaster paintings\", which were purchased by Jean-Benjamin de la Borde on behalf of King Louis XV. In 1771, he exhibited two large canvases depicting scenes from the Thirty Years' War (The Battle of Freiburg and the Battle of Lens) and once again won Diderot's approval.\n\nIn 1762, he had married Jeanne-Marie Jolivet (1734–1773) a ballerina with the theatre of the Comédie-Italienne who was known as \"Mademoiselle d'Alancour\". Her professional connections also supplied him with many clients. In 1775, two years after her death, he married the recently widowed Jeanne Cathérine Delachaux (1748–1818). The marriage turned out to be a disaster, so he abandoned her in 1783, aided and abetted by Giacomo. He took refuge in Vienna, under the protection of Prince Charles Joseph de Ligne, who introduced him to Chancellor Kaunitz. It appears that Francesco was almost as extroverted and entertaining as his brother Giacomo, so he quickly became popular at the Viennese Court.\n\nIn addition to his paintings, he produced designs for tapestries and upholstery which proved very lucrative. From 1770 to 1787, the Royal Beauvais Manufactory used more than seventy of his patterns.\n\nDespite his success and his many aristocratic clients, he squandered his money, was perpetually in debt, and died in poverty at his home near Mödling. The year is generally given as 1803, although some sources have 1805 or 1807.\n\n\n"}

At this time, it was common for such musicians also to play the organ, and all keyboard instruments, and to direct orchestral music while playing continuo on the instrument.\n\nModern harpsichord playing can be roughly divided into three eras, beginning with the career of the influential reviver of the instrument, Wanda Landowska. At this stage of the 'harpsichord revival', players generally used harpsichords of a heavy, piano-influenced type made by makers such as Pleyel; the revival of the instrument also led some composers to write specifically for the instrument, often on the request of Landowska. An influential later group of English players using post-Pleyel instruments by Thomas Goff and the Goble family included George Malcolm and Thurston Dart. Beginning in the 1920s, Gavin Williamson and Philip Manuel also helped popularize the harpsichord through concert tours, and were, in fact, the world's only full-time harpsichord duo, known as Manuel and Williamson, performing throughout North American and Europe. They had studied for many years with Wanda Landowska both in France and in New York. In the 1930s Manual and Williamson made the first recordings of the Bach multiple keyboard concerti with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and the duo also gave the American premiere performance of Bach's Concerto in C major for two harpsichords. In addition, they gave American premieres of many works of Couperin and Rameau, among other composers. \n\nThe next generation of harpsichordists were pioneers of modern performance on instruments built according to the authentic practices of the earlier period, following the research of such scholar-builders as Frank Hubbard and William Dowd. This generation of performers included such players as Isohlde Ahlgrimm, Ralph Kirkpatrick, Igor Kipnis, and Gustav Leonhardt. More recently, many outstanding harpsichordists have appeared, such as Scott Ross, Trevor Pinnock, Kenneth Gilbert, Christopher Hogwood, Jos van Immerseel, Ton Koopman, Gary Cooper and David Schrader, with many of them also directing a baroque orchestra from the instrument.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "227244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227244", "title": "Japanese art", "text": "Japanese art\n\nJapanese art covers a wide range of art styles and media, including ancient pottery, sculpture, ink painting and calligraphy on silk and paper, \"ukiyo-e\" paintings and woodblock prints, ceramics, origami, and more recently manga—modern Japanese cartooning and comics—along with a myriad of other types. It has a long history, ranging from the beginnings of human habitation in Japan, sometime in the 10th millennium BC, to the present.\n\nJapan has been subject to sudden invasions of new ideas followed by long periods of minimal contact with the outside world. Over time the Japanese developed the ability to absorb, imitate, and finally assimilate those elements of foreign culture that complemented their aesthetic preferences. The earliest complex art in Japan was produced in the 7th and 8th centuries in connection with Buddhism. In the 9th century, as the Japanese began to turn away from China and develop indigenous forms of expression, the secular arts became increasingly important; until the late 15th century, both religious and secular arts flourished. After the Ōnin War (1467–1477), Japan entered a period of political, social, and economic disruption that lasted for over a century. In the state that emerged under the leadership of the Tokugawa shogunate, organized religion played a much less important role in people's lives, and the arts that survived were primarily secular.\n\nPainting is the preferred artistic expression in Japan, practiced by amateurs and professionals alike. Until modern times, the Japanese wrote with a brush rather than a pen, and their familiarity with brush techniques has made them particularly sensitive to the values and aesthetics of painting. With the rise of popular culture in the Edo period, a style of woodblock prints became a major form and its techniques were fine tuned to produce colorful prints. The Japanese, in this period, found sculpture a much less sympathetic medium for artistic expression; most Japanese sculpture is associated with religion, and the medium's use declined with the lessening importance of traditional Buddhism.\n\nJapanese ceramics are among the finest in the world and include the earliest known artifacts of their culture. In architecture, Japanese preferences for natural materials and an interaction of interior and exterior space are clearly expressed.\n\nThe first settlers of Japan, the Jōmon people (c. 11000 – c. 300 BC), named for the cord markings that decorated the surfaces of their clay vessels, were nomadic hunter-gatherers who later practiced organized farming and built cities with populations of hundreds if not thousands. They built simple houses of wood and thatch set into shallow earthen pits to provide warmth from the soil. They crafted lavishly decorated pottery storage vessels, clay figurines called \"dogū\", and crystal jewels.\n\nThe next wave of immigrants was the Yayoi people, named for the district in Tokyo where remnants of their settlements first were found. These people, arriving in Japan about 350 BC, brought their knowledge of wetland rice cultivation, the manufacture of copper weapons and bronze bells (\"dōtaku\"), and wheel-thrown, kiln-fired ceramics.\n\nThe third stage in Japanese prehistory, the Kofun period (c. 250 – 552 AD), represents a modification of Yayoi culture, attributable either to internal development or external force. The period is named for the large number of \"kofun\" megalithic tombs created during this period. In this period, diverse groups of people formed political alliances and coalesced into a nation. Typical artifacts are bronze mirrors, symbols of political alliances, and clay sculptures called \"haniwa\" which were erected outside tombs.\n\nDuring the Asuka and Nara periods, so named because the seat of Japanese government was located in the Asuka Valley from 552 to 710 and in the city of Nara until 784, the first significant influx of continental Asian culture took place in Japan.\n\nThe transmission of Buddhism provided the initial impetus for contacts between China, Korea and Japan. The Japanese recognized the facets of Chinese culture that could profitably be incorporated into their own: a system for converting ideas and sounds into writing; historiography; complex theories of government, such as an effective bureaucracy; and, most important for the arts, new technologies, new building techniques, more advanced methods of casting in bronze, and new techniques and media for painting.\n\nThroughout the 7th and 8th centuries, however, the major focus in contacts between Japan and the Asian continent was the development of Buddhism. Not all scholars agree on the significant dates and the appropriate names to apply to various time periods between 552, the official date of the introduction of Buddhism into Japan, and 784, when the Japanese capital was transferred from Nara. The most common designations are the Suiko period, 552–645; the Hakuhō period, 645–710, and the Tenpyō period, 710–784.\n\nThe earliest Japanese sculptures of the Buddha are dated to the 6th and 7th century. They ultimately derive from the 1st- to 3rd-century AD Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering, on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the Chinese Northern Wei buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons were brought to Japan by Various immigrant groups. Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Kōryū-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chūgū-ji Siddhartha statues. Many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism. The Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.\nThey illustrate the terminal point of the Silk Road transmission of art during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese Fūjin Wind God, the Niō guardians, and the near-Classical floral patterns in temple decorations.\n\nThe earliest Buddhist structures still extant in Japan, and the oldest wooden buildings in the Far East are found at the Hōryū-ji to the southwest of Nara. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown Prince Shōtoku, it consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or \"Kondō\" (Golden Hall), and \"Gojū-no-tō\" (Five-story Pagoda), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. The \"Kondō\", in the style of Chinese worship halls, is a two-story structure of post-and-beam construction, capped by an \"irimoya\", or hipped-gabled roof of ceramic tiles.\n\nInside the \"Kondō\", on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period. The central image is a Shaka Trinity (623), the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas, sculpture cast in bronze by the sculptor Tori Busshi (flourished early 7th century) in homage to the recently deceased Prince Shōtoku. At the four corners of the platform are the Guardian Kings of the Four Directions, carved in wood around 650. Also housed at Hōryū-ji is the Tamamushi Shrine, a wooden replica of a \"Kondō\", which is set on a high wooden base that is decorated with figural paintings executed in a medium of mineral pigments mixed with lacquer.\n\nTemple building in the 8th century was focused around the Tōdai-ji in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2-m (53-ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or \"Daibutsuden\", is a Rushana Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the Edo period.\n\nClustered around the Daibutsuden on a gently sloping hillside are a number of secondary halls: the \"Hokke-dō\" (Lotus Sutra Hall), with its principal image, the Fukukenjaku Kannon (不空羂索観音立像, the most popular bodhisattva), crafted of dry lacquer (cloth dipped in lacquer and shaped over a wooden armature); the \"Kaidanin\" (戒壇院, Ordination Hall) with its magnificent clay statues of the Four Guardian Kings; and the storehouse, called the \"Shōsōin\". This last structure is of great importance as an art-historical cache, because in it are stored the utensils that were used in the temple's dedication ceremony in 752, the eye-opening ritual for the Rushana image, as well as government documents and many secular objects owned by the Imperial family.\n\nChoukin (or chōkin), the art of metal engraving or sculpting, is thought to have started in the Nara period.\n\nIn 794 the capital of Japan was officially transferred to Heian-kyō (present-day Kyoto), where it remained until 1868. The term \"Heian period\" refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the Kamakura shogunate was established at the end of the Genpei War. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.\n\nEarly Heian art: In reaction to the growing wealth and power of organized Buddhism in Nara, the priest Kūkai (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) journeyed to China to study Shingon, a form of Vajrayana Buddhism, which he introduced into Japan in 806. At the core of Shingon worship are mandalas, diagrams of the spiritual universe, which then began to influence temple design. Japanese Buddhist architecture also adopted the stupa, originally an Indian architectural form, in its Chinese-style pagoda.\n\nThe temples erected for this new sect were built in the mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary.\n\nThe temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara. The wooden image (also early 9th century) of Shakyamuni, the \"historic\" Buddha, enshrined in a secondary building at the Murō-ji, is typical of the early Heian sculpture, with its ponderous body, covered by thick drapery folds carved in the \"honpa-shiki\" (rolling-wave) style, and its austere, withdrawn facial expression.\n\nFujiwara art: In the Fujiwara period, Pure Land Buddhism, which offered easy salvation through belief in Amida (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the Fujiwara family, then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as regents for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. So secure and beautiful was their world that they could not conceive of Paradise as being much different. They created a new form of Buddha hall, the Amida hall, which blends the secular with the religious, and houses one or more Buddha images within a structure resembling the mansions of the nobility.\nThe \"Hō-ō-dō\" (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by Jōchō, who used a new canon of proportions and a new technique (\"yosegi\"), in which multiple pieces of wood are carved out like shells and joined from the inside. Applied to the walls of the hall are small relief carvings of celestials, the host believed to have accompanied Amida when he descended from the Western Paradise to gather the souls of believers at the moment of death and transport them in lotus blossoms to Paradise. \"Raigō\" paintings on the wooden doors of the Hō-ō-dō, depicting the Descent of the Amida Buddha, are an early example of Yamato-e, Japanese-style painting, and contain representations of the scenery around Kyoto.\nE-maki: In the last century of the Heian period, the horizontal, illustrated narrative handscroll, known as \"e-maki\" (絵巻, lit. \"picture scroll\"), came to the fore. Dating from about 1130, the \"Genji Monogatari Emaki\", a famous illustrated \"Tale of Genji\" represents the earliest surviving yamato-e handscroll, and one of the high points of Japanese painting. Written about the year 1000 by Murasaki Shikibu, a lady-in-waiting to the Empress Akiko, the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death. The 12th-century artists of the \"e-maki\" version devised a system of pictorial conventions that convey visually the emotional content of each scene. In the second half of the century, a different, livelier style of continuous narrative illustration became popular. The \"Ban Dainagon Ekotoba\" (late 12th century), a scroll that deals with an intrigue at court, emphasizes figures in active motion depicted in rapidly executed brush strokes and thin but vibrant colors.\n\n\"E-maki\" also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the \"otoko-e\" (\"men's pictures\") and \"onna-e\" (\"women's pictures\") styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. \"Onna-e\", epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. \"Otoko-e\" often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The Siege of the Sanjō Palace (1160), depicted in the \"Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace\" section of the Heiji Monogatari handscroll is a famous example of this style.\n\nIn 1180 a war broke out between the two most powerful warrior clans, the Taira and the Minamoto; five years later the Minamoto emerged victorious and established a de facto seat of government at the seaside village of Kamakura, where it remained until 1333. With the shift of power from the nobility to the warrior class, the arts had to satisfy a new audience: men devoted to the skills of warfare, priests committed to making Buddhism available to illiterate commoners, and conservatives, the nobility and some members of the priesthood who regretted the declining power of the court. Thus, realism, a popularizing trend, and a classical revival characterize the art of the Kamakura period. In the Kamakura period, Kyoto and Nara remained the centres of artistic production and high culture.\nSculpture: The Kei school of sculptors, particularly Unkei, created a new, more realistic style of sculpture. The two Niō guardian images (1203) in the Great South Gate of the Tōdai-ji in Nara illustrate Unkei's dynamic supra-realistic style. The images, about 8 m (about 26 ft) tall, were carved of multiple blocks in a period of about three months, a feat indicative of a developed studio system of artisans working under the direction of a master sculptor. Unkei's polychromed wood sculptures (1208, Kōfuku-ji, Nara) of two Indian sages, Muchaku and Seshin, the legendary founders of the Hossō sect, are among the most accomplished realistic works of the period; as rendered by Unkei, they are remarkably individualized and believable images. One of the most famous works of this period is an Amitabha Triad (completed in 1195), in Jōdo-ji in Ono, created by Kaikei, Unkei's successor.\n\nCalligraphy and painting: The \"Kegon Engi Emaki\", the illustrated history of the founding of the Kegon sect, is an excellent example of the popularizing trend in Kamakura painting. The Kegon sect, one of the most important in the Nara period, fell on hard times during the ascendancy of the Pure Land sects. After the Genpei War (1180–1185), Priest Myōe of Kōzan-ji sought to revive the sect and also to provide a refuge for women widowed by the war. The wives of samurai had been discouraged from learning more than a syllabary system for transcribing sounds and ideas (see kana), and most were incapable of reading texts that employed Chinese ideographs (kanji).\n\nThus, the \"Kegon Engi Emaki\" combines passages of text, written with a maximum of easily readable syllables, and illustrations that have the dialogue between characters written next to the speakers, a technique comparable to contemporary comic strips. The plot of the \"e-maki\", the lives of the two Korean priests who founded the Kegon sect, is swiftly paced and filled with fantastic feats such as a journey to the palace of the Ocean King, and a poignant mom story.\n\nA work in a more conservative vein is the illustrated version of Murasaki Shikibu's diary. \"E-maki\" versions of her novel continued to be produced, but the nobility, attuned to the new interest in realism yet nostalgic for past days of wealth and power, revived and illustrated the diary in order to recapture the splendor of the author's times. One of the most beautiful passages illustrates the episode in which Murasaki Shikibu is playfully held prisoner in her room by two young courtiers, while, just outside, moonlight gleams on the mossy banks of a rivulet in the imperial garden.\n\nDuring the Muromachi period (1338–1573), also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The Ashikaga clan took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. Zen Buddhism, the Ch'an sect　traditionally thought to have been founded in China in the 6th century, was introduced for a second time into Japan and took root.\n\nPainting: Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of Yamato-e yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner, where paintings generally only have black and white or different tones of a single color.\n\nTypical of early Muromachi painting is the depiction by the priest-painter Kao (active early 15th century) of the legendary monk Kensu (Hsien-tzu in Chinese) at the moment he achieved enlightenment. This type of painting was executed with quick brush strokes and a minimum of detail. \"Catching a Catfish with a Gourd\" (early 15th century, Taizō-in, Myōshin-ji, Kyoto), by the priest-painter Josetsu (active c. 1400), marks a turning point in Muromachi painting. Executed originally for a low-standing screen, it has been remounted as a hanging scroll with inscriptions by contemporary figures above, one of which refers to the painting as being in the \"new style\". In the foreground a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background mountains appear to be far in the distance. It is generally assumed that the \"new style\" of the painting, executed about 1413, refers to a more Chinese sense of deep space within the picture plane.\n\nThe foremost artists of the Muromachi period are the priest-painters Shūbun and Sesshū. Shūbun, a monk at the Kyoto temple of Shōkoku-ji, created in the painting \"Reading in a Bamboo Grove\" (1446) a realistic landscape with deep recession into space. Sesshū, unlike most artists of the period, was able to journey to China and study Chinese painting at its source. \"Landscape of the Four Seasons\" (\"Sansui Chokan\"; c. 1486) is one of Sesshu's most accomplished works, depicting a continuing landscape through the four seasons.\n\nIn the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573–1603), a succession of military leaders, such as Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, attempted to bring peace and political stability to Japan after an era of almost 100 years of warfare. Oda, a minor chieftain, acquired power sufficient to take de facto control of the government in 1568 and, five years later, to oust the last Ashikaga shogun. Hideyoshi took command after Oda's death, but his plans to establish hereditary rule were foiled by Ieyasu, who established the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603.\n\nPainting: The most important school of painting in the Momoyama period was that of the Kanō school, and the greatest innovation of the period was the formula, developed by Kanō Eitoku, for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. The decoration of the main room facing the garden of the Jukō-in, a subtemple of Daitoku-ji (a Zen temple in Kyoto), is perhaps the best extant example of Eitoku's work. A massive \"ume\" tree and twin pines are depicted on pairs of sliding screens in diagonally opposite corners, their trunks repeating the verticals of the corner posts and their branches extending to left and right, unifying the adjoining panels. Eitoku's screen, \"Chinese Lions\", also in Kyoto, reveals the bold, brightly colored style of painting preferred by the samurai.\n\nHasegawa Tōhaku, a contemporary of Eitoku, developed a somewhat different and more decorative style for large-scale screen paintings. In his \"Maple Screen\" (楓図), now in the temple of Chishaku-in (), Kyoto, he placed the trunk of the tree in the center and extended the limbs nearly to the edge of the composition, creating a flatter, less architectonic work than Eitoku, but a visually gorgeous painting. His sixfold screen, \"Pine Wood\" (松林図), is a masterly rendering in monochrome ink of a grove of trees enveloped in mist.\n\nThe Tokugawa shogunate gained undisputed control of the government in 1603 with a commitment to bring peace and economic and political stability to the country; in large measure it was successful. The shogunate survived until 1867, when it was forced to capitulate because of its failure to deal with pressure from Western nations to open the country to foreign trade. One of the dominant themes in the Edo period was the repressive policies of the shogunate and the attempts of artists to escape these strictures. The foremost of these was the closing of the country to foreigners and the accoutrements of their cultures, and the imposition of strict codes of behavior affecting every aspect of life, the clothes one wore, the person one married, and the activities one could or should not pursue.\n\nIn the early years of the Edo period, however, the full impact of Tokugawa policies had not yet been felt, and some of Japan's finest expressions in architecture and painting were produced: Katsura Palace in Kyoto and the paintings of Tawaraya Sōtatsu, pioneer of the Rinpa school.\n\nArchitecture: Katsura Detached Palace, built in imitation of Genji's palace, contains a cluster of shoin buildings that combine elements of classic Japanese architecture with innovative restatements. The whole complex is surrounded by a beautiful garden with paths for walking.\nMany of powerful \"daimyōs\" (feudal lords) built a Circuit style Japanese garden in the territory country, and competed for the beauty.\n\nPainting: Sōtatsu evolved a superb decorative style by re-creating themes from classical literature, using brilliantly colored figures and motifs from the natural world set against gold-leaf backgrounds. One of his finest works is the pair of screens \"The Waves at Matsushima\" in the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. A century later, Kōrin reworked Sōtatsu's style and created visually gorgeous works uniquely his own. Perhaps his finest are the screen paintings of \"Red and White Plum Blossoms\".\n\nSculpture The Buddhist monk Enkū carved 120,000 Buddhist images in a rough, individual style.\n\nUkiyo-e and Bunjinga: The school of art best known in the West is that of the ukiyo-e paintings and woodblock prints of the demimonde, the world of the kabuki theater and the pleasure districts. Ukiyo-e prints began to be produced in the late 17th century; in 1765 Harunobu produced the first polychrome print. Print designers of the next generation, including Torii Kiyonaga and Utamaro, created elegant and sometimes insightful depictions of courtesans.\n\nIn the 19th century the dominant figures were Hokusai and Hiroshige, the latter a creator of romantic and somewhat sentimental landscape prints. The odd angles and shapes through which Hiroshige often viewed landscape, and the work of Kiyonaga and Utamaro, with its emphasis on flat planes and strong linear outlines, had a profound impact on such Western artists as Edgar Degas and Vincent van Gogh. Via artworks held in Western museums, these same printmakers would later exert a powerful influence on the imagery and aesthetic approaches used by early Modernist poets such as Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington and H.D.\n\nA school of painting contemporary with ukiyo-e was Nanga, or Bunjinga, a style based on paintings executed by Chinese scholar-painters. Just as ukiyo-e artists chose to depict figures from life outside the strictures of the Tokugawa shogunate, Bunjin artists turned to Chinese culture. The exemplars of this style are Ike no Taiga, Yosa Buson, Tanomura Chikuden, and Yamamoto Baiitsu ().\n\nCeramics\n\nTraditional, mostly stoneware, styles continued in many parts of Japan, but Japanese ceramics were transformed around the start of the Edo period, by a large influx of Korean potters, captured or persuaded to emigrate in the course of the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s. Many of these were settled on the southern island of Kyushu, and they brought with them experience of versions of the Chinese-style chambered climbing kiln, called \"noborigama\" in Japan, which allowed high temperatures with more precise control. By around 1620 they had discovered deposits of kaolinite, and started to make porcelain for the first time in Japan. The early wares (called \"Early Imari\") were relatively small and imitated the Chinese underglaze blue and white porcelain, which Japan had been importing for some time.\n\nThe porcelain industry greatly expanded in the late 1650s, as the collapse of the Chinese industry from civil war led to very large orders from the Chinese traders and the Dutch East India Company, by then the traders only permitted to do business in Japan. The first great period of Japanese export porcelain lasted until about the 1740s, and the great bulk of Japanese porcelain was made for export, mostly to Europe, but also the Islamic world to the west and south of Japan.\n\nWhen Emperor of Japan regained ruling power in 1868, Japan was once again invaded by new and alien forms of culture. During the Prewar period, The introduction of Western cultural values led to a dichotomy in Japanese art, as well as in nearly every other aspect of culture, between traditional values and attempts to duplicate and assimilate a variety of clashing new ideas. This split remained evident in the late 20th century, although much synthesis had by then already occurred, and created an international cultural atmosphere and stimulated contemporary Japanese arts toward ever more innovative forms.\n\nBy the early 20th century, European art forms were well introduced and their marriage produced notable buildings like the Tokyo Train Station and the National Diet Building that still exist today.\n\nA lot of artistic new Japanese gardens were built with \"Jihei Ogawa\".\n\n\"Manga\" cartoons flourished the Meiji period, influenced greatly by English and French political cartoons. However, some art popular in the Meiji era, such as jōge-e (reversible images), is no longer popular in modern Japan.\n\nArchitecture: Tokyo Station, a building of Giyōfū architecture, full of bricks and pseudo-European style. This style of building was built in urban areas.\n\nPainting: The first response of the Japanese to Western art forms was open-hearted acceptance, and in 1876 the Technological Art School was opened, employing Italian instructors to teach Western methods. The second response was a pendulum swing in the opposite direction spearheaded by Okakura Kakuzō and the American Ernest Fenollosa, who encouraged Japanese artists to retain traditional themes and techniques while creating works more in keeping with contemporary taste. This was a strategy that eventually served to extend the influence of Japanese art as far as Calcutta, London, and Boston in the years leading up to World War I. Out of these two poles of artistic theory—derived from Europe and from East Asia respectively—developed \"yōga\" (\"Western-style painting\") and Nihonga (\"Japanese painting\"), categories that have maintained currency.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, many artists began working art forms derived from the international scene, moving away from local artistic developments into the mainstream of world art. But traditional Japanese conceptions endured, particularly in the use of modular space in architecture, certain spacing intervals in music and dance, a propensity for certain color combinations and characteristic literary forms.\n\nArt from 1603 to 1945 (Edo period and Prewar period) were supported by merchants. Counter to Edo period and Prewar period, art of Postwar period was changed to the art which is supported by people as consumers. The wide variety of art forms available to the Japanese reflect the vigorous state of the arts, widely supported by the Japanese people and promoted by the government. In the 1950s and 1960s, Japan's artistic avant garde include the internationally influential Gutai group, which originated or anticipated various postwar genres such as performance art, installation art, conceptual art, and wearable art. In photography, Kansuke Yamamoto was prominent.\n\nAmerican art and architecture greatly influenced Japan. Though fear of earthquakes severely restricted the building of a skyscraper, technological advances let Japanese build larger and higher buildings with more artistic outlooks.\n\nAs Japan has always made little distinction between 'fine art' and 'decorative art', as the West has done since the Renaissance, it is important to note Japan's significant and unique contributions to the fields of art in entertainment, commercial uses, and graphic design. Cartoons imported from America led to anime that at first were derived exclusively from manga stories. Today, anime abounds, and many artists and studios have risen to great fame as artists; Hayao Miyazaki and the artists and animators of Studio Ghibli are generally regarded to be among the best the anime world has to offer. Japan also flourishes in the fields of graphic design, commercial art (e.g. billboards, magazine advertisements), and in video game graphics and concept art.\n\nJapanese modern art takes as many forms and expresses as many different ideas as modern art in general, worldwide. It ranges from advertisements, anime, video games, and architecture as already mentioned, to sculpture, painting, and drawing in all their myriad forms.\n\nMany artists do continue to paint in the traditional manner, with black ink and color on paper or silk. Some of these depict traditional subject matter in the traditional styles, while others explore new and different motifs and styles, while using the traditional media. Still others eschew native media and styles, embracing Western oil paints or any number of other forms.\n\nIn sculpture, the same holds true; some artists stick to the traditional modes, some doing it with a modern flair, and some choose Western or brand new modes, styles, and media. Yo Akiyama is just one of many modern Japanese sculptors. He works primarily in clay pottery and ceramics, creating works that are very simple and straightforward, looking like they were created out of the earth itself. Another sculptor, using iron and other modern materials, built a large modern art sculpture in the Israeli port city of Haifa, called \"Hanabi\" (Fireworks). Nahoko Kojima is a contemporary Kirie artist who has pioneered the technique of Paper Cut Sculpture which hangs in 3d.\n\nTakashi Murakami is arguably one of the most well-known Japanese modern artists in the Western world. Murakami and the other artists in his studio create pieces in a style, inspired by anime, which he has dubbed \"superflat\". His pieces take a multitude of forms, from painting to sculpture, some truly massive in size. But most if not all show very clearly this anime influence, utilizing bright colors and simplified details.\n\nA remarkable number of the traditional forms of Japanese music, dance, and theater have survived in the contemporary world, enjoying some popularity through reidentification with Japanese cultural values. Traditional music and dance, which trace their origins to ancient religious use—Buddhist, Shintō, and folk—have been preserved in the dramatic performances of Noh, Kabuki, and bunraku theater. Ancient court music and dance forms deriving from continental sources were preserved through Imperial household musicians and temple and shrine troupes. Some of the oldest musical instruments in the world have been in continuous use in Japan from the Jōmon period, as shown by finds of stone and clay flutes and zithers having between two and four strings, to which Yayoi period metal bells and gongs were added to create early musical ensembles. By the early historical period (6th to 7th centuries), there were a variety of large and small drums, gongs, chimes, flutes, and stringed instruments, such as the imported mandolin-like biwa and the flat six-stringed zither, which evolved into the thirteen-stringed koto. These instruments formed the orchestras for the 7th-century continentally derived ceremonial court music (gagaku), which, together with the accompanying bugaku (a type of court dance), are the most ancient of such forms still performed at the Imperial court, ancient temples, and shrines. Buddhism introduced the rhythmic chants, still used, that underpin Shigin, and that were joined with native ideas to underlay the development of vocal music, such as in Noh.\n\nJapanese art is characterized by unique polarities. In the ceramics of the prehistoric periods, for example, exuberance was followed by disciplined and refined artistry. Another instance is provided by two 16th-century structures that are poles apart: the Katsura Detached Palace is an exercise in simplicity, with an emphasis on natural materials, rough and untrimmed, and an affinity for beauty achieved by accident; Nikkō Tōshō-gū is a rigidly symmetrical structure replete with brightly colored relief carvings covering every visible surface. Japanese art, valued not only for its simplicity but also for its colorful exuberance, has considerably influenced 19th-century Western painting and 20th-century Western architecture.\n\nJapan's aesthetic conceptions, deriving from diverse cultural traditions, have been formative in the production of unique art forms. Over the centuries, a wide range of artistic motifs developed and were refined, becoming imbued with symbolic significance. Like a pearl, they acquired many layers of meaning and a high luster. Japanese aesthetics provide a key to understanding artistic works perceivably different from those coming from Western traditions.\n\nWithin the East Asian artistic tradition, China has been the acknowledged teacher and Japan the devoted student. Nevertheless, several Japanese arts developed their own style, which can be differentiated from various Chinese arts. The monumental, symmetrically balanced, rational approach of Chinese art forms became miniaturized, irregular, and subtly suggestive in Japanese hands. Miniature rock gardens, diminutive plants (\"bonsai\"), and \"ikebana\" (flower arrangements), in which the selected few represented a garden, were the favorite pursuits of refined aristocrats for a millennium, and they have remained a part of contemporary cultural life.\n\nThe diagonal, reflecting a natural flow, rather than the fixed triangle, became the favored structural device, whether in painting, architectural or garden design, dance steps, or musical notations. Odd numbers replace even numbers in the regularity of a Chinese master pattern, and a pull to one side allows a motif to turn the corner of a three-dimensional object, thus giving continuity and motion that is lacking in a static frontal design. Japanese painters used the devices of the cutoff, close-up, and fade-out by the 12th century in \"yamato-e\", or Japanese-style, scroll painting, perhaps one reason why modern filmmaking has been such a natural and successful art form in Japan. Suggestion is used rather than direct statement; oblique poetic hints and allusive and inconclusive melodies and thoughts have proved frustrating to the Westerner trying to penetrate the meanings of literature, music, painting, and even everyday language.\n\nThe Japanese began defining such aesthetic ideas in a number of evocative phrases by at least the 10th or 11th century. The courtly refinements of the aristocratic Heian period evolved into the elegant simplicity seen as the essence of good taste in the understated art that is called \"shibui\". Two terms originating from Zen Buddhist meditative practices describe degrees of tranquility: one, the repose found in humble melancholy (\"wabi\"), the other, the serenity accompanying the enjoyment of subdued beauty (\"sabi\"). Zen thought also contributed a penchant for combining the unexpected or startling, used to jolt one's consciousness toward the goal of enlightenment. In art, this approach was expressed in combinations of such unlikely materials as lead inlaid in lacquer and in clashing poetic imagery. Unexpectedly humorous and sometimes grotesque images and motifs also stem from the Zen \"kōan\" (conundrum). Although the arts have been mainly secular since the Edo period, traditional aesthetics and training methods, stemming generally from religious sources, continue to underlie artistic productions.\n\nIn Japan they have a primary mode which images or characters are formed through \"kawaii,\" which to us would be described as cuteness. Kawaii is a whole culture it is associated with the shojo culture. Generally Kawaii is shown through manga, anime, but since it has become very popular it also is found in shopping malls and online. There are many different findings of Kawaii , such as toys, websites, and billboards. The Japanese believe that cuteness have a certain aesthetic to it, which is true in the way they display it. It is said that it has an avant-garde aesthetic..\n\nTraditionally, the artist was a vehicle for expression and was personally reticent, in keeping with the role of an artisan or entertainer of low social status. The calligrapher, a member of the Confucian literati class, or samurai class in Japan, had a higher status, while artists of great genius were often recognized in the Kamakura period by receiving a name from a feudal lord and thus rising socially. The performing arts, however, were generally held in less esteem, and the purported immorality of actresses of the early Kabuki theater caused the Tokugawa government to bar women from the stage; female roles in Kabuki and Noh thereafter were played by men.\n\nAfter World War II, artists typically gathered in arts associations, some of which were long-established professional societies while others reflected the latest arts movement. The Japan Artists League, for example, was responsible for the largest number of major exhibitions, including the prestigious annual Nitten (Japan Art Exhibition). The P.E.N. Club of Japan (P.E.N. stands for prose, essay, and narrative), a branch of an international writers' organization, was the largest of some thirty major authors' associations. Actors, dancers, musicians, and other performing artists boasted their own societies, including the Kabuki Society, organized in 1987 to maintain this art's traditional high standards, which were thought to be endangered by modern innovation. By the 1980s, however, avant-garde painters and sculptors had eschewed all groups and were \"unattached\" artists.\n\nThere are a number of specialized universities for the arts in Japan, led by the national universities. The most important is the Tokyo Arts University, one of the most difficult of all national universities to enter. Another seminal center is Tama Art University, which produced many of Japan's late 20th-century innovative young artists. Traditional training in the arts, derived from Chinese traditional methods, remains; experts teach from their homes or head schools working within a master-pupil relationship. A pupil does not experiment with a personal style until achieving the highest level of training, or graduating from an arts school, or becoming head of a school. Many young artists have criticized this system as stifling creativity and individuality. A new generation of the avant-garde has broken with this tradition, often receiving its training in the West. In the traditional arts, however, the master-pupil system preserves the secrets and skills of the past. Some master-pupil lineages can be traced to the Kamakura period, from which they continue to use a great master's style or theme. Japanese artists consider technical virtuosity as the \"sine qua non\" of their professions, a fact recognized by the rest of the world as one of the hallmarks of Japanese art.\n\nThe national government has actively supported the arts through the Agency for Cultural Affairs, set up in 1968 as a special body of the Ministry of Education. The agency's budget for FY 1989 rose to ￥37.8 billion after five years of budget cuts, but still represented much less than 1 percent of the general budget. The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the Cultural Properties Protection Division (文化財保護部, now 文化財部) protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, arts copyrights, and improvements in the national language. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and filmmaking. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the Japan Art Academy, which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the Emperor, who personally bestows the highest accolade, the Order of Culture.\nTokyo University of the Arts also taking active roles on several art events in previous years. Their other campuses are also involving varied courses.\n\nArts patronage and promotion by the government are broadened to include a new cooperative effort with corporate Japan to provide funding beyond the tight budget of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Many other public and private institutions participate, especially in the burgeoning field of awarding arts prizes. A growing number of large corporations join major newspapers in sponsoring exhibitions and performances and in giving yearly prizes. The most important of the many literary awards given are the venerable Naoki Prize and the Akutagawa Prize, the latter being the equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize in the United States.\n\nIn 1989 an effort to promote cross-cultural exchange led to the establishment of a Japanese \"Nobel Prize\" for the arts, the Premium Imperiale, by the Japan Art Association. This prize of US$100,000 was funded largely by the mass media conglomerate Fujisankei Communications Group and was awarded on a worldwide selection basis.\n\nA number of foundations promoting the arts arose in the 1980s, including the Cultural Properties Foundation set up to preserve historic sites overseas, especially along the Silk Road in Inner Asia and at Dunhuang in China. Another international arrangement was made in 1988 with the United States Smithsonian Institution for cooperative exchange of high-technology studies of Asian artifacts. The government plays a major role by funding the Japan Foundation, which provides both institutional and individual grants, effects scholarly exchanges, awards annual prizes, supported publications and exhibitions, and sends traditional Japanese arts groups to perform abroad. The Arts Festival held for two months each fall for all the performing arts is sponsored by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Major cities also provides substantial support for the arts; a growing number of cities in the 1980s had built large centers for the performing arts and, stimulated by government funding, were offering prizes such as the Lafcadio Hearn Prize initiated by the city of Matsue. A number of new municipal museums were also providing about one-third more facilities in the 1980s than were previously available. In the late 1980s, Tokyo added more than twenty new cultural halls, notably, the large Bunkamura built by Tokyu Group and the reconstruction of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. All these efforts reflect a rising popular enthusiasm for the arts. Japanese art buyers swept the Western art markets in the late 1980s, paying record highs for impressionist paintings and US$51.7 million alone for one blue period Picasso.\n\n\n\n"}

It was made into a 1995 film of the same name. Both the book and the film are about a magical board game that implements real animals and other jungle elements as the game is played; thus the dangers which the players have to overcome in the game also appear in real life. \"Jumanji\" star Robin Williams said \"jumanji\" is a Zulu word meaning \"many effects\", as did Van Allsburg. In 2011, Williams recorded an audiobook for its 30th edition.\n\nFritz, a bull terrier in all of Chris Van Allsburg's books, appears as a toy dog on wheels in the third illustration.\n\nWhile their parents are out for the evening, Judy and Peter Shepherd, after playing with some toys, become bored and decide to go to the park. There they find a jungle adventure game called \"Jumanji\". Taking the game home, they find a warning message; \"Do not begin unless you intend to finish\". Ignoring the warning, they start to play.\n\nThe pair soon discovers that any dangers encountered in the game spring to life somewhere in the house. For example, when Peter rolls on a lion, a real lion appears, which Judy and Peter trap in their mother's bedroom. Continuing on, Judy rolls on a stampede, Peter rolls on a monsoon, and Judy rolls on an explorer—each appears in real life to wreak havoc in the house. Still they continue to play, hoping that by finishing the game everything will go back to normal. The game finally ends when Judy rolls a volcano and yells \"Jumanji!\".\n\nIn an instant everything is back to normal and the siblings quickly return to the park and abandon the game before their parents return. The story ends when Judy and Peter look outside and see their neighbors, Danny and Walter, excitedly returning from the park with \"Jumanji\" in their hands with the knowledge that their mother claims the brothers never bother to finish the games they play nor read the instructions.\n\n\n\"Zathura\" (published in 2002) is a sequel to \"Jumanji\" also written by Van Allsburg. In \"Zathura\", Danny and Walter Budwing from the end of the \"Jumanji\" story, find a science fiction board game that similarly causes the effects of the game to come to life. It has also been in 2005.\n"}

Since 2012, the school also offers degree programmes at the Clonmel campus of LIT. The School can trace its origins back to 1852 and has had a number of guises and locations before consolidating into its current format and campuses in the 1980s and 1990s. LSAD offers courses at Level 8 (Honours Degree) and Level 9 (Master's Degree) across a range of art and design disciplines.\n\nOn 3 July 1852, a public notice appeared in the Limerick Chronicle announcing the opening of the School of Ornamental Art at the Leamy Institute on Hartstonge Street. The school offered instruction to the general public in drawing and modelling. The first prospectus stated the school's objective of \"providing instruction in all those branches of art which are applicable to manufactures and decoration\". The school opened on 2 November 1852 with 28 male and seven female pupils.\n\nAlthough the school thrived in its first year, changes in government departments led to a withdrawal of funding and the school was forced to close in January 1855. Following public pressure, the school reopened in December 1855 under the auspices of the Limerick Athenaeum, a centre of learning that would be open to all, irrespective of class, creed or cultural background. This had opened in February 1855 at No. 2 Upper Cecil Street. The school continued to operate successfully over the coming decades. The trustees of the Athenaeum handed the building over to the Corporation in 1896 in order to administer the property for the advancement of technical education in Limerick. However, by the turn of the century, the building was no longer large enough to cater for the range of courses offered by the Limerick Technical Instruction Committee, and the school began to move sections to new premises, mainly on George's Street (now O'Connell Street).\n\nThe departments were eventually rehoused on one site with the opening of the Municipal Technical Institute on O' Connell Avenue in December 1911. This building has since been known in Limerick as the 'Red Tech'. The work of the Institute was taking place against the background of intense political change in Ireland and was forced to close from 1919 to 1923. Troops of the Warwickshire Regiment occupied the Institute during the Irish War of Independence in 1921 and considerable damage was caused to the building and its contents. Limerick MTI eventually re-opened in October 1923 and such was the impact of the closure that it was effectively a new start-up.\n\nThe Vocational Education Committee was established in July 1930 and took over the running of the MTI, with its main focus on providing full-time education to students between the ages of fourteen and sixteen. This continued in much the same format until 1967, when the Limerick VEC was suspended for three years over irregularities in appointing staff. The School of Art had relocated to the former County Infirmary and Nurses' Home in Mulgrave Street in 1962, now Limerick College of Further Education.\n\nLimerick missed out on a new technical college in 1966 with the establishment of the Regional Technical Colleges, as the Department of Education decided to establish a National Institute for Higher Education instead (later to become the University of Limerick). The reconvened Limerick City VEC planned to build Limerick Technical College and acquired land at Moylish Park to do this. The college was opened in 1975 and has since developed into the main campus of Limerick Institute of Technology.\n\nThe School of Art continued to grow at its Mulgrave Street location and by the mid 1970s the lack of space was becoming a serious issue. 1980 saw the school finally taking shape as what is now the Limerick School of Art and Design under the reconstituted LTC, which had become the College of Art, Commerce and Technology (CoACT), and this coincided with a move to a VEC property on George’s Quay, formerly St. Anne’s Vocational School, which had been opened in 1939 but vacated in 1978. However, the move to George’s Quay proved to be a short-term solution as the school quickly outgrew this site also. CoACT rented rooms in Bruce House on Rutland Street and in the Granary on Michael Street to accommodate the extra courses and students but this quickly got out of control with the school renting a further five properties during this period.\n\nWhen CoACT finally achieved RTC status in 1992, work began on finding a suitable location for the school. The Good Shepherd Convent on Clare Street was purchased from the Good Shepherd Sisters in October 1994 and some emergency refurbishment allowed occupancy as early as January 1995. Further refurbishment and development work took place and its final stage was completed in September 2008.\n\nClare Street originally backed onto the walls of the Irishtown and derives its name from John Fitzgibbon, the 1st Earl of Clare who was Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1789 to 1802. James O'Sullivan, a tobacco merchant, constructed the street on swampy land known as \"Múin na Muice\", the moor or common of the pigs, and dedicated it to Fitzgibbon.\n\nThe Clare Street Campus is located on the site of an old Lancastrian School, developed by Joseph Lancaster for the education of the poor in the early 19th century. Lancaster was a Quaker, born in London in 1788, who had devoted himself to the education of the poor. His system was to employ the more advanced boys as monitors, or assistant teachers, to enable a few masters to teach a large number of boys. Spelling and reading were taught from charts hung on the walls, thereby dispensing with the need for books for the poor and slates were used to write on, to save paper. His first school was founded in London in 1801 and his school in Limerick was probably founded around 1806. The entrance to the school was on Old Clare Street and this street became known locally as \"The Long Can\", after the Lancastrian School.\n\nAttendance figures dropped at the school and it gradually fell into disrepair. In November 1821, The Christian Brothers purchased the school for £200. In 1858, they let part of the garden to Madame De Beligond, superioress of the Good Shepherd Convent at an annual rent of £10. When the Christian Brothers left the building in 1888, they sold it to the nuns for £200. They established a girls' reformatory on the site of the old Thomond Brewery, adjacent to the convent, which was one of three breweries still in operation in Limerick city in the 1870s. It was sold to the nuns in 1879 and demolished to construct the reformatory to house young women who had become pregnant out of wedlock. They also established a Magdalene laundry on another adjacent site which had been a public execution ground in the 16th and 17th centuries, known as the Farrancroghy execution site. They continued to operate the reformatory and the laundry at the site until it was sold to the Regional Technical College in 1994.\n\nMajor refurbishment and construction works have been carried out at the site, in two phases. The first saw the refurbishment of much of the main building and chapel in the late 1990s. The second phase was completed in August 2008 and consisted of construction of additional space, further refurbishment and considerable ground works, including a new entrance onto Clare Street.\n\nLSAD offers a number of art and design courses:\n\n\nMost of the students of LSAD reside in nearby student accommodation compounds, Grove Island, Parkville, and Parkview. The closest accommodation to the art college is Grove Island, with Parkview and Parkville student accommodation being the furthest away. Many single apartments are also available in the city centre.\n\n\n"}

Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of fairy tales, folklore, fables, myths, and legends, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs \"from an oral folk tale\", written by \"a single identifiable author\", which can be characterised as \"simple and anonymous\", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to folktales.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1245942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1245942", "title": "Mädchen in Uniform", "text": "Mädchen in Uniform\n\nManuela von Meinhardis, whose mother had died when she was young and father serves in the military, is enrolled at an all-girls boarding school headed by the traditional and iron-fisted Fräulein von Nordeck zur Nidden. Manuela is immediately exposed to the strictness of the school when receiving her uniform and having many of her possessions taken from her. While the other girls at the school receive Manuela with open arms, she still feels very out of place, until she meets Fräulein von Bernburg, a teacher at the school. After witnessing Fräulein von Bernburg's compassion for the other girls, Manuela develops a passionate love for her teacher. The first spark of love begins with a goodnight kiss. While the teacher normally gives all the girls a goodnight kiss on the forehead, Manuela receives one on the lips.\n\nThere is a meeting asking the teachers in the school and the headmistress. Fräulein von Bernburg advocates using compassion and love when dealing with the students, but is met with disagreement from the headmistress and the other teachers.\n\nDuring class, the girls are reciting from an assigned reading. The girls who are called upon all know their recitations, except Manuela. After class, Fräulein von Bernburg calls for Manuela to meet her in her room. Manuela expects to be punished for not knowing the assigned material, but Fräulein von Bernburg comments on the state of the clothes the girl came to the school with, noting that there were many holes in them. Fräulein von Bernburg then gives one of her own petticoats to Manuela, at which she begins to weep. After much crying, Manuela confesses her love for Fräulein von Bernburg, and the teacher states that she loves Manuela but that she cannot give her special treatment because the other girls will be jealous.\n\nThe girls gather around Ilsa von Westhagen, another student, as she reads aloud a letter to her parents complaining about the conditions at the school. She has a worker at the school smuggle the letter out.\n\nThe girls are preparing to put on a play, \"Don Carlos\", by Friedrich Schiller, for the birthday of the headmistress. Manuela plays Don Carlos, the lead male role. Ilsa is to play another major role in the play, but is barred from performing after her letter to her parents denouncing the school is returned because of a wrong address. Ilsa packs up to leave the school, but Fräulein von Bernburg convinces her to stay. The girls put on the play for the headmistress and her guests; it is a great success, with a standout performance by Manuela.\n\nAfter the play, the girls all meet for dinner and are served punch with alcohol in it by the kitchen workers. After much dancing and singing, the girls ask Manuela about her relationship with Fräulein von Bernburg. Without knowing that the headmistress's assistant is in the room, Manuela tells them of the petticoat that Fräulein von Bernburg gave her. Then, she declares that she is not afraid of anything or anyone—yelling it drunkenly in the direction of the headmistress, who has now entered the room.\n\nAfter passing out, Manuela is brought to a room, where no-one is allowed to see her. She is scolded by the headmistress. The headmistress is then informed that the princess is on her way to the school to speak to her. The students and teachers all line up for the arrival of the princess. After observing all the students, she asks to see Manuela. The princess tells Manuela that she knew Manuela's mother and respected her. The princess says that Manuela looks a little pale and asks whether she is sick, at which the headmistress rushes her away and denies any paleness.\n\nAfter the meeting with the princess, the headmistress scolds Fräulein von Bernburg for being too close and compassionate with her students. She also tells her that she is never to speak to Manuela again. When Fräulein von Bernburg leaves the headmistress's office, Manuela is waiting for her. Fräulein von Bernburg tells Manuela to meet her in her room. In her room, Fräulein von Bernburg tells Manuela that while she cares for her, she is to never speak to her again. Manuela responds by saying that she will die. Fräulein von Bernburg tells her not to say such things and sends her away. As Manuela leaves the room, the headmistress arrives to scold Fräulein von Bernburg for speaking to Manuela and says that she can no longer be a teacher at the school. Fräulein von Bernburg says that she could not continue there anyway, for she needs to stand for justice.\n\nAt this point, the girls are all looking for Manuela and cannot find her. Manuela has climbed up the main staircase and is ready to jump. Manuela is saved by the other students. The headmistress and Fräulein von Bernburg walk out of Fräulein von Bernburg's room to discover a commotion and are then told that Manuela tried to jump and kill herself. The movie ends with all the girls watching the headmistress as she walks down the stairwell and down the hall in silence.\n\n\nWinsloe's stage play had previously appeared under the title ' (\"Knight Nérestan\") in Leipzig with Hertha Thiele and Claire Harden in the lead roles. After Leipzig the play was produced on the stage in Berlin as ' with a different cast and a more prominent lesbian theme, which was again toned down somewhat for the film.\n\nHaving mostly played the same roles on stage, the cast was able to produce the film at speed and on a low budget of RM55,000. It was largely shot at the Potsdam military orphanage, now a teacher training college for women. Carl Froelich's studio in Berlin-Tempelhof was also used. The film's original working title was \"\" (\"Yesterday and Today\") but this was thought too insipid and changed to increase the chances of box-office success. Although sound had only been used for two years in cinema, it was used artfully.\n\nThe film was groundbreaking in having an all-female cast; in its sympathetic portrayal of lesbian \"pedagogical eros\" (see Gustav Wyneken) and homoeroticism, revolving around the passionate love of a fourteen-year-old (Manuela) for her teacher (von Bernburg); and in its co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements (although these failed).\n\nDuring an interview about the film decades later, Thiele said\nThe whole of \"\" was set in the Empress Augusta boarding school, where Winsloe was educated. Actually there really was a Manuela, who remained lame all of her life after she threw herself down the stairs. She came to the premiere of the film. I saw her from a distance, and at the time Winsloe told me, \"The experience is one which I had to write from my heart.\" Winsloe was a lesbian.\n\nThiele also said, \"However, I really don't want to make a great deal of [...] or account for a film about lesbianism here. That's far from my mind, because the whole thing of course is also a revolt against the cruel Prussian education system.\"\n\nAfter many screen tests, Winsloe had insisted that her friend Thiele play the lead role. Director Sagan would have preferred Gina Falckenberg who had done the role on stage in Berlin, but along with having played Manuela in Leipzig, Thiele had already played a young lesbian in Ferdinand Bruckner's stage play \"\" (\"The Creature\") and although twenty-three years old when filming began, she was considered to be more capable of portraying a fourteen-year-old.\n\nThe film had some impact in the Berlin lesbian clubs, but was largely eclipsed by the ongoing cult success of \"Der blaue Engel\" (1930). The film did however generate large amounts of fan mail to the stars from all over Germany and was considered a success throughout much of Europe. The goodnight kiss Thiele received from Wieck was especially popular: one distributor even asked for more footage of other kisses like it to splice into prints of the film.\n\nFrom its premiere at the Capitol cinema in Berlin until 1934 the film is said to have grossed some RM6,000,000. Despite the collective nature of the filming for which cast and crew received only a quarter of the normal wage, none saw a share of the 6,000,000 marks and Thiele later hinted that the profits had been mostly retained by the producers.\n\nThe film was distributed outside Germany and was a huge success in Romania. During a 1980 interview Thiele said the school play scene caused a \"longstockings and kissing\" cult when the film was first shown there. It was also distributed in Japan, the United States (where it was first banned, then released in a heavily cut version), England and France.\n\n\"\" won the audience referendum for Best Technical Perfection at the Venice Film Festival in 1932 and received the Japanese Kinema Junpo Award for Best Foreign Language Film (Tokyo, 1934).\n\nLater, an alternate ending which subtly pandered to pro-Nazi ideals enabled continued screening in German cinemas, but eventually even this version of the film was banned as 'decadent' by the Nazi regime, which reportedly attempted to burn all of the existing prints, but by then several had been dispersed around the world. Sagan and many others associated with the film fled Germany soon after the banning. Many of the cast and crew were Jewish, and those who could not escape from Germany died in the camps. \"You were only first aware that they were Jewish when fascism was there and you lost your friends,\" said Thiele, who left Germany in 1937. Assistant director Walter Supper killed himself when it became clear his Jewish wife would be arrested.\n\nDespite its later banning, ' was followed by several German films about intimate relationships among women, such as ' (\"Eight Girls in a Boat\", 1932) and \"Anna and Elizabeth\" (1933), which also starred Wieck and Thiele but was banned by the Nazis soon after its opening night, along with \"Ich für dich, du für mich\" (\"Me for You, You for Me\", 1934).\n\nThe film is said to have inspired the 1949 novel \"Olivia\" by Dorothy Bussy, which treats very similar themes, and which was made into a French film \"Olivia\" (1951) directed by Jacqueline Audry. Also in 1951, a Mexican adaptation \"Girls in Uniform\" was made. There was a German remake in 1958, directed by Géza von Radványi and starring Lilli Palmer, Romy Schneider, and Therese Giehse.\n\nThe film was almost banned in the US, but Eleanor Roosevelt spoke highly of the film, resulting in the film getting a limited release in the US in 1932-33. Prints of the film survived the war, but it was heavily censored until the 1970s, and it was not shown again in Germany until 1977 when it was screened on television there.\n\nIn 1978, Janus Films and Arthur Krim arranged for a limited re-release in the US in 35mm, including a screening at the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco. Also in 1978, the film was released in its surviving form by Janus Films on VHS with English subtitles.\n\nVersions were later released in the US (1994) and the UK (2000) by the British Film Institute. Even this version is probably missing some brief scenes. For a full understanding of what may have been censored, a viewing of the film might be followed with a reading of the 1933 novel by Christa Winsloe \"\"/\"The Child Manuela\" (Virago Press, 1994).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was published posthumously, in 1855; three years after Azevedo's death. The book is structured as a frame story containing five tales (as well as a prologue and an epilogue, thus totaling seven chapters) told by a group of five men sheltering in a tavern. It is one of the most popular and influential works of Gothic fiction in Brazilian literature.\n\nIt is said that the book was largely inspired by Spanish author José Cadalso's 1790 work \"Noches lúgubres\".\n\nThe first chapter of the book, \"Uma Noite do Século\" (\"A Night of the Century\"), introduces its setting – a tavern in an undisclosed location filled with prostitutes, drunkards and libertines. At a nearby table, influenced by the alcohol, a group of five friends – Solfieri, Bertram, Gennaro, Claudius Hermann and Johann – decide to share with each other certain events of their lives. The five tales have, in common, aspects such as unsuccessful love stories, cannibalism, murders, sexual violence, heavy drinking, among others.\n\nWhen in Rome, on a rainy night, Solfieri sees a shadow crying over a window. He realizes it is a beautiful woman. She leaves the house and Solfieri decides to follow her, and they ultimately arrive at a nearby cemetery. There, the woman cries, kneeling before a headstone, as Solfieri falls asleep watching her from afar.\n\nOne year later, Solfieri, wandering the streets of Rome after taking part in an orgy, ends into a church inadvertently. He sees a coffin and, after listening to breathing noises inside, opens it, and sees the cemetery lady he met the year before inside it. After realizing that she is still alive (but in a catalepsic state), he carries her through the city. Arriving at his home, the woman dies two days later, of a very high fever. Solfieri buries her under the floorboards of his bedroom and pays a sculptor for a statuette built in the woman's likeness.\n\nBertram tells the story of his ill-fated love for a Spanish woman from Cádiz, named Angela. Amidst their romance, Bertram's sick father, living in Denmark, calls for him. He goes, returning two years later; however, during the time he was away, Angela marries another man, having a son with him. Despite this, Bertram tries to maintain his affair with her, but Angela's husband finds out everything. Before her husband kills her, she kills him and her child, and flees with Bertram.\n\nOne day, without further explanations, she leaves him. Bertram sinks into despair as he tries to forget Angela; subdued by woe, he faints in the middle of a street and is run over by a chariot. The passengers of the chariot, an old man and his 18-year-old daughter, help him and take him to their mansion so he can recover. Bertram gets in love with the lady and they flee together, but he ultimately gets bored with her and sells the lady to a pirate in a card game. Later, he would learn that the girl poisoned the pirate and threw herself in the sea.\n\nHaving moved to Italy, Bertram decides to kill himself there, but when he is about to do it, he is saved by a sailor whom he kills unintentionally. Bertram spends some time in the sailor's ship (a corvette), where he gets in love with the captain's wife, being requited.\n\nIn the midst of this affair, the ship is attacked by pirates and sinks, but not without making the other one sink too. The captain, his wife, Bertram and two other unnamed sailors are able to save themselves in a raft. Some time later, with no water or food, the two unnamed sailors being washed out by the sea, the three lot in order to discover who will be killed and serve as food for the others. The chosen one is the captain, but he does not accept his fate and fights for his life. He loses the fight however, and Bertram and the woman are obligated to eat him because of the lack of food, maintaining themselves for two days.\n\nArriving at a beach, both already weakened by hunger, the woman asks Bertram for a last moment of love before her death. Afraid of dying, Bertram strangles her and lives at the beach in complete solitude until he is found by a British brig that rescues him.\n\nThe painter Gennaro reminisces of when he was the young apprentice of the famous Godofredo Walsh. Walsh had a young, beautiful wife named Nauza (whom Gennaro loved) and a young, beautiful daughter named Laura (who loved Gennaro). One day, Laura gets pregnant of Gennaro, but when she proposes marriage to him, he declines. Displeased, she gradually sinks into depression and dies, taking the baby with her.\n\nThe old painter, not knowing anything, visits his daughter's bedroom every night and, because of this, Gennaro starts sleeping with his wife. However, the painter is able to make Gennaro confess everything in a certain night. Days later, Godofredo takes Gennaro to a cliff and tries to kill him; however, he survives the fall and decides to return to Godofredo's house – initially planning to apologize, but later he changes his mind and decides to take his revenge on the painter and murder him. However, when he arrives at the painter's house, he finds both Nauza and Godofredo dead.\n\nClaudius Hermann, an assiduous gambler, spots the beautiful Duchess Eleonora at a horse race and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets her once more in a theatre later on, and during an entire week he stalks her.\n\nIn a certain night, he bribes one of the duchess' lackeys for permission to enter her house for an hour, and also obtains a copy of her bedroom's keys. He puts sedative in the duchess' wine and has sex with her, returning for many nights.\n\nOne day, however, her husband, Duke Maffio, inadvertently drinks some of the sedative as well. Desperate and afraid of being caught, Claudius plans to kill him, but changes his mind and kidnaps Eleonora instead while she is still sleeping. Arriving in an inn, she wakes up, and Claudius tells her everything, forcing her to stay with him. Optionless, she accepts.\n\nSome days later, Claudius has to leave in order to take care of some affairs; when he returns home, he finds the duchess and her husband dead.\n\nJohann's story begins in a different tavern, located in Paris. He was playing a game of carambole with a blond-haired man named Arthur. Johann was losing the game, while Arthur only needed to score one point to win. When it is Johann's turn to play, Arthur bumps into the table (accidentally or not), detouring Johann's ball, thus making him lose the game. Infuriated, he defies Arthur to a duel, which he accepts. They stop at a hotel to get the guns, and the blond man writes two letters. They head to a deserted and dark street. In there, they choose their guns – but only one is loaded.\n\nThey shoot. It is revealed that Johann's gun was the loaded one, and Arthur, before supposedly dying, hands Johann the letters he wrote. The first letter is addressed to Arthur's mother, and the other one is addressed to his girlfriend; he also hands Johann her address and an engagement ring. Pretending to be Arthur, Johann then decides to steal his girlfriend.\n\nIn the morning after they sleep together, Johann is attacked by a mysterious man. After a short struggle, he kills the man. However, after a close inspection, he discovers that the man he killed was his own brother, and Arthur's girlfriend was his sister.\n\nIn the last chapter, \"Último Beijo de Amor\" (\"Last Love Kiss\"), the orgy ends; everyone is sleeping. A mysterious hooded figure walks into the tavern and kills Johann, and then heads toward a man named Arnold.\n\nThe figure is revealed to be Giorgia, Johann's sister, and Arnold is actually Arthur (who was saved by a passerby after the duel) under a false name. Giorgia reveals to Arthur that she wanted to get her revenge on Johann, and having done so, the honor Johann stole from her when they slept together is finally restored.\n\nAfter exchanging some love words with Arthur, both decide to commit suicide.\n\nAn independent short film based on the book received a limited release around some Brazilian film festivals and arthouse cinemas on March 6, 2014. Directed and written by Yghor Boy, it stars Renato Basilla as Solfieri, Renan Bleastè as Bertram, Hélcio Henriques as Gennaro, Raul Figueiredo as Claudius Hermann, Sérgio Siveiro as Johann, Ricardo Merini as Arnold/Arthur and Mayara Constantino as Giorgia. Intertwined between each tale are glimpses of the academic life of Álvares de Azevedo himself, who is portrayed by Victor Mendes.\n\nThe film won the Prêmio ABC de Cinematografia for Best Direction of Photography in a Student Film in May 2015.\n\n"}

Her father was Henry Nethersole, a solicitor. She made her stage début at Theatre Royal, Brighton in 1887. In 1888, Nethersole began playing important parts in London, at first under Rutland Barrington and John Hare at the Garrick Theatre.\n\nNethersole toured Australia and the United States playing leading parts in modern plays, notably Clyde Fitch's \"Sapho\", where she and her male costar Hamilton Revelle were arrested for \"violating public decency\" for which she was later acquitted. Her powerful emotional acting, however, made a great effect in some other plays, such as \"Carmen\", in which she again appeared in America in 1906.\n\nIn 1904, Nethersole portrayed the lead role in \"La seconde madame Tanqueray\" at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe in Paris. Then she was at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in \"Magda\", \"Sapho\", \"Adrienne Lecouvreur\", and an adaptation of a French play by Eugène Scribe and Ernest Legouvé, \"Camille\", an adaptation of a French play \"La Dame aux Camélias\", and \"The Spanish Gipsy\", an adaptation of the French play \"Carmen de Mérimée\" in 1907. Every summer, Nethersole spent a week at the house of playwright Edmond Rostand in Cambo les Bains. In 1907, she performed Rostand’s play \"La Samaritaine\" an English version of it to play it in London. In a conference at the Théâtre de l'Athénée on 17 November 1908, Robert Eude said that Olga Nethersole invented the soul kiss (an especially long kiss, of which actress Maude Adams was the recordwoman).\n\nNethersole inspired the character of \"Miss Nethersoll\", an American dancer, in the French novel \"La Danseuse nue et la Dame a la licorne\" by Rachel Gaston-Charles (1908).\n\nDuring World War I, Nethersole served as a nurse in London and later established the People's League of Health, for which she received the Royal Red Cross (RRC) in 1920. She combined her theatre work with health work for the rest of her life. She was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1936.\n\nOn 9 January 1951, Nethersole died in Bournemouth, England at the age of 83. Her brother, Louis F. Nethersole, was a theatrical manager, producer and press agent and one-time husband of the American actress and singer, Sadie Martinot.\n\n\nBetween 1885 and 1890, Olga Nethersole’s portrait was painted in Omaha, Nebraska by artist Herbert A.

In the UK, in the 1950s, she was the first agent to represent black and other minority ethnic actors, writers and film-makers, and during the 1960s was instrumental in setting up one of Britain's first black theatre companies, the Negro Theatre Workshop. In the words of John La Rose, who delivered a eulogy at her funeral on 26 February 2005: \"Pearl Connor-Mogotsi was pivotal in the effort to remake the landscape for innovation and for the inclusion of African, Caribbean and Asian artists in shaping a new vision of consciousness for art and society.\"\n\nPearl Cynthia Nunez, the ninth of her parents' 12 children, was born in Diego Martin, Trinidad, to Albert Antonio Nunez and Georgina Agnes Fitt, and had a convent school education in Port of Spain. Describing her background, in an interview with Yvonne Brewster, she said: \"I came from a family of educated mixed-race people in Trinidad, and we were readily exposed to music and the arts in general and the folklore...And our education was of course in the same pattern as most of the colonials. It was a British education and an English education, so we were doing Shakespeare and all that kind of thing and all the modern poets and Dickens. We were quite familiar in our secondary school education with those writers, so we had an idea what drama was, but it was the folk theatre that imbued me with the interest I had in the theatre.\" Her first experience of performance was at the Little Carib Theatre, founded by Beryl McBurnie, who became her greatest influence.\n\nIn 1948 Pearl met and subsequently married in England the Trinidadian folk-singer and actor Edric Connor (1913–68), with whom she eventually had two children: Peter and Geraldine. She had gone to the UK to study law at King’s College, London University, but she deferred her studies to manage her husband's career. \n\nIn 1956 she and her husband began an agency for black artists, The Edric Connor Agency, which in the 1970s would be renamed the Afro-Asian-Caribbean Agency, representing people from the Caribbean, Malaysia, India and Africa across all art forms. Among the many actors, dancers, musicians and writers represented by the agency in the 20 years of its existence are Carmen Munroe, Ram John Holder, Corinne Skinner, Lloyd Reckord, Patti Boulaye, Nina Baden-Semper, Yemi Ajibade, Allister Bain, George Harris, Johnny Sekka, Osibisa, Joan Armatrading, and Earl Lovelace. The agency was also involved in the co-production of several films, most notably \"Carnival Fantastique\" (1959) and the cricket series \"West Indies vs England\" (1963), and in addition distributed other landmark films such as \"Pressure\" (London, 1975), \"Bim\" (Trinidad, 1974), \"Smile Orange\" (Jamaica, 1976), \"The Harder They Come\" (Jamaica, 1972) and \"King Carnival\" (Trinidad).\n\nConnor-Mogotsi herself trained at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama and was a broadcaster for the BBC General Overseas Service, working for their Caribbean Service and in radio plays on the Corporation's domestic networks, including \"The Barren One\" (1958); \"My People and Your People\" (1959), a \"West Indian ballad opera\" broadcast on the BBC Home Service; and Jan Carew's The \"Riverman\" (1968). She occasionally acted on the stage - as in Barry Reckord's \"You in Your Small Corner\" at the Royal Court in 1960 - and in television or film roles, including a cameo in Lindsay Anderson's \"O Lucky Man!\" (1973).\n\nIn 1961 she was integral in setting up one of the first black theatre companies in Britain, the Negro Theatre Workshop, which launched at London's Lyric Theatre with a production of \"A Wreath for Udomo\", adapted from the novel by Peter Abrahams and with a cast that featured Earl Cameron, Edric Connor, Lloyd Reckord and Joan Hooley. Another notable production was of Wole Soyinka's \"The Road\" (1965), which was first staged for the Commonwealth Arts Festival. In 1966 the Workshop also produced an interpretation of the Easter story entitled \"The Dark Disciples\", which was televised and represented Britain at the First World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal. She was a co-founder of the West Indian Theatre Trust and of the West Indian Students' Union based in Earls Court, London; she was also a member of the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) and the Committee Against Racial Discrimination (CARD).\n\nIn 1971, three years after Edric Connor's death, she married Joe Mogotsi, leader of the South African singing group The Manhattan Brothers, and together they organized tours throughout the world for black South African artists. They also co-authored the book \"Mantindane - \"He Who Survives\": My Life With The Manhattan Brothers\" (2002).\n\nIn 1972 she was awarded Trinidad and Tobago's Hummingbird Silver Medal for \"outstanding services to the immigrant community in the United Kingdom\".\n\nIn 1992 she was an interviewee in the two-part BBC television documentary \"Black and White In Colour\", directed by Isaac Julien, which examined the contribution of black and Asian people to British television history from the birth of television in 1936 to 1992. In 1995, Connor opened the 12th International Book Fair of Radical Black and Third World Books in London.\n\nOn 20 January 1997 she gave the first talk in the \"Life Experience With Britain\" series of talks and conversations at the George Padmore Institute in London.\n\nConnor Mogotsi, aged 81, died on 11 February 2005 in Johannesburg, South Africa, where she had gone with Mogotsi for the premiere of the film \"Sophiatown\". Her funeral took place at St Martin's Church, Kensal Green, on 26 February.\n\nThe Edric and Pearl Connor Papers, 1941–1978, were donated to the Alma Jordan Library at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago, and a collection of additional related items is housed in the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928374", "title": "Perfection", "text": "Perfection\n\nPerfection is a state, variously, of completeness, flawlessness, or supreme excellence. \n\nThe term is used to designate a range of diverse, if often kindred, concepts. These have historically been addressed in a number of discrete disciplines, notably mathematics, physics, chemistry, ethics, aesthetics, ontology, and theology.\n\nThe form of the word long fluctuated in various languages. The English language had the alternates, \"perfection\" and the Biblical \"perfectness.\" The word \"perfection\" derives from the Latin \"perfectio\", and \"perfect\" — from \"\"perfectus\". These expressions in turn come from \"perficio\"\" — \"to finish\", \"to bring to an end.\" \"\"Perfectio\"(n)\" thus literally means \"a finishing\", and \"perfect\"(us)\"\" — \"finished\", much as in grammatical parlance (\"perfect\").\n\nMany modern languages have adopted their terms for the concept of \"perfection\" from the Latin: the French \"\"parfait\" and \"perfection\"; the Italian \"perfetto\" and \"perfezione\"; the Spanish \"perfecto\" and \"perfección\"\"; the English \"perfect\" and \"perfection\"; the Russian \"\"совершенный\" (sovyershenniy) and \"совершенcтво\" (sovyershenstvo); the Croatian and Serbian \"savršen\" and \"savršenstvo\"; the Czech \"dokonalost\"; the Slovak \"dokonaly\" and \"dokonalost\"; the Polish \"doskonały\" and \"doskonałość\".\"\n\nThe genealogy of the concept of \"perfection\" reaches back beyond Latin, to Greek. The Greek equivalent of the Latin \"\"perfectus\" was \"teleos\".\" The latter Greek expression generally had concrete referents, such as a perfect physician or flutist, a perfect comedy or a perfect social system. Hence the Greek \"\"teleiotes\" was not yet so fraught with abstract and superlative associations as would be the Latin \"perfectio\"\" or the modern \"perfection.\" To avoid the latter associations, the Greek term has generally been translated as \"completeness\" rather than \"perfection.\"\n\nThe oldest definition of \"perfection\", fairly precise and distinguishing the shades of the concept, goes back to Aristotle. In Book \"Delta\" of the \"Metaphysics\", he distinguishes three meanings of the term, or rather three shades of one meaning, but in any case three different concepts. That is perfect:\n\nThe first of these concepts is fairly well subsumed within the second. Between those two and the third, however, there arises a duality in concept. This duality was expressed by Thomas Aquinas, in the \"Summa Theologica\", when he distinguished a twofold perfection: when a thing is perfect in itself — as he put it, in its \"substance\"; and when it perfectly serves its \"purpose\".\n\nThe variants on the concept of perfection would have been quite of a piece for two thousand years, had they not been confused with other, kindred concepts. The chief of these was the concept of that which is the best: in Latin, \"excellentia\" (\"excellence\"). In antiquity, \"\"excellentia\" and \"perfectio\" made a pair; thus, for example, dignitaries were called \"perfectissime\"\", just as they are now called \"excellency.\" Nevertheless, these two expression of high regard differ fundamentally: \"\"excellentia\" is a distinction among many, and implies comparison; while \"perfectio\"\" involves no comparison, and if something is deemed perfect, then it is deemed so in itself, without comparison to other things. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who thought much about perfection and held the world to be the best of possible worlds, did not claim that it was perfect.\n\nThe parallel existence of two concepts of perfection, one strict (\"perfection,\" as such) and the other loose (\"excellence\"), has given rise, perhaps since antiquity but certainly since the Renaissance, to a singular paradox: that the greatest perfection is imperfection. This was formulated by Lucilio Vanini (1585–1619), who had a precursor in the 16th-century writer Joseph Juste Scaliger, and they in turn referred to the ancient philosopher Empedocles. Their argument, as given by the first two, was that if the world were perfect, it could not improve and so would lack \"true perfection,\" which depends on progress. To Aristotle, \"perfect\" meant \"complete\" (\"nothing to add or subtract\"). To Empedocles, according to Vanini, perfection depends on incompleteness (\"\"perfectio propter imperfectionem\"), since the latter possesses a potential for development and for complementing with new characteristics (\"perfectio complementii\"\"). This view relates to the baroque esthetic of Vanini and Marin Mersenne: the perfection of an art work consists in its forcing the recipient to be active—to complement the art work by an effort of mind and imagination.\n\nThe paradox of perfection—that imperfection is perfect—applies not only to human affairs, but to technology. Thus, irregularity in semiconductor crystals (an imperfection, in the form of contaminants) is requisite for the production of semiconductors. The solution to the apparent paradox lies in a distinction between two concepts of \"perfection\": that of regularity, and that of utility. Imperfection is perfect in technology, in the sense that irregularity is useful.\n\nPerfect numbers have been distinguished ever since the ancient Greeks called them \"\"teleioi\".\" There was, however, no consensus among the Greeks as to which numbers were \"perfect\" or why. A view that was shared by Plato held that 10 was a perfect number. Mathematicians, including the mathematician-philosopher Pythagoreans, proposed as a perfect number, the number 6.\n\nThe number 10 was thought perfect because there are 10 fingers to the two hands. The number 6 was believed perfect for being divisible in a special way: a sixth part of that number constitutes unity; a third is two; a half — three; two-thirds () is four; five-sixths (\"pentamoiron\") is five; six is the perfect whole. The ancients also considered 6 a perfect number because the human foot constituted one-sixth the height of a man, hence the number 6 determined the height of the human body.\nThus both numbers, 6 and 10, were credited with perfection, both on purely mathematical grounds and on grounds of their relevance in nature. Belief in the \"perfection\" of certain numbers survived antiquity, but this quality came to be ascribed to other numbers as well. The perfection of the number 3 actually became proverbial: \"omne trinum perfectum\" (). Another number, 7, found a devotee in the 6th-century Pope Gregory I (Gregory the Great), who favored it on grounds similar to those of the Greek mathematicians who had seen 6 as a perfect number, and in addition for some reason he associated the number 7 with the concept of \"eternity.\"\n\nThe Middle Ages, however, championed the perfection of 6: Augustine and Alcuin wrote that God had created the world in 6 days because that was the perfect number.\n\nThe Greek mathematicians had regarded as perfect that number which equals the sum of its divisors that are smaller than itself. Such a number is neither 3 nor 7 nor 10, but 6, for 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\nBut there are more numbers that show this property, such as 28, which = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. It became customary to call such numbers \"perfect.\" Euclid gave a formula for (even) \"perfect\" numbers:\nwhere \"p\" and 2 − 1 are prime numbers.\n\nEuclid had listed the first four perfect numbers: 6; 28; 496; and 8128. A manuscript of 1456 gave the fifth perfect number: 33,550,336. Gradually mathematicians found further perfect numbers (which are very rare). In 1652 the Polish polymath Jan Brożek noted that there was no perfect number between 10 and 10.\n\nDespite over 2,000 years of study, it still is not known whether there exist infinitely many perfect numbers; or whether there are any odd ones.\n\nToday the term \"perfect number\" is merely historic in nature, used for the sake of tradition. These peculiar numbers had received the name on account of their analogy to the construction of man, who was held to be nature's most perfect creation, and above all on account of their own peculiar regularity. Thus, they had been so named on the same grounds as perfect objects in nature, and perfectly proportioned edifices and statues created by man; the numbers had come to be called \"perfect\" in order to emphasize their special regularity.\n\nThe Greek mathematicians had named these numbers \"perfect\" in the same sense in which philosophers and artists used the word. Jamblich (\"In Nicomachi arithmeticam\", Leipzig, 1894) states that the Pythagoreans had called the number 6 \"marriage,\" \"health,\" and \"beauty,\" on account of the harmony and accord of that number.\n\nThe perfect numbers early on came to be treated as the measure of other numbers: those in which the sum of the divisors is greater than the number itself, as in 12, have — since as early as Theon of Smyrna, ca. 130 A.D. — been called \"redundant\" (), \"more than perfect\" (\"plus quam perfecti\"), or \"abundant numbers\", and those the sum of whose divisors is smaller, as in 8, have been called \"deficient numbers\" (\"deficientes\").\n\nCurrently 47 perfect numbers have been identified.\n\nA variety of physical and chemical concepts include, in their names, the word \"perfect.\"\n\nThe physicist designates as a \"perfectly rigid\" body, one that \"is not deformed by forces applied to it.\" He uses the concept in the full awareness that this is a fictitious body, that no such body exists in nature. The concept is an \"ideal construct\".\n\nA \"perfectly plastic\" body is one that is deformed infinitely at a constant load corresponding to the body's limit of plasticity: this is a physical \"model\", not a body observed in nature.\n\nA \"perfectly black\" body would be one that absorbed completely, radiation falling upon it — that is, a body with a coefficient of absorption equal to unity.\n\nA crystal is perfect when its physically equivalent walls are equally developed; it has a perfect structure when it answers the requirements of spatial symmetry and is free of structural defects, dislocation, lacunae and other flaws.\n\nA \"perfect fluid\" is one that is incompressible and non-viscous — this, again, is an ideal fluid that does not exist in nature.\n\nA \"perfect gas\" is one whose molecules do not interact with each other and which have no volume of their own. Such a gas is \"fictitious\", just as are perfectly solid, perfectly rigid, perfectly plastic and perfectly black bodies. They are termed \"perfect\" in the \"strict\" (non-metaphorical) sense of the word. These are all concepts that are necessary in physics, insofar as they are limiting, ideal, fictitious — insofar as they set the extreme which nature may at the most approach.\n\nIn a \"looser\" sense, real things are called \"perfect\" if they approximate perfection more or less closely, though they be not, strictly speaking, perfect.\n\nThe relation of these \"perfect\" bodies to \"real\" bodies may be illustrated by the relation of a perfect gas to a real one. The equation of state of a perfect gas is a first approximation to a quantum equation of state that results from statistical physics. Thus, the equation of state of a real gas within classical limits assumes the form of the equation of state of a perfect gas. That is, the equation of state of a perfect gas describes an ideal gas (comprising points, that is, dimensionless molecules that do not act upon one another).\n\nThe perfect gas equation arose from the work of Robert Boyle, Edme Mariotte and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, who, in studying the properties of real gases, found formulas applicable not to these but to an ideal, perfect gas.\n\nThe \"ethical\" question of perfection concerns not whether man \"is\" perfect, but whether he \"should\" be. And if he \"should\" be, then how is this to be attained?\n\nPlato seldom actually used the term, \"perfection\"; but the concept of \"good\", central to his philosophy, was tantamount to \"perfection.\" He believed that approximation to the idea of perfection makes people perfect.\n\nSoon after, the Stoics introduced the concept of perfection into ethics expressly, describing it as harmony — with nature, reason, man himself. They held that such harmony—such perfection—was attainable for anyone.\n\nPlato and the Stoics had made perfection a philosophical watchword. Soon it would be transformed, in Christianity, into a religious one.\n\nThe Christian doctrine of perfection is in the Gospels as well as elsewhere in the Bible. Matthew 5:48 enjoins: \"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.\" Early Christian writings, especially Paul's, are replete with calls to perfection. Many of these are collected in a discourse by St. Augustine, \"De perfectione iustitiae hominis\". They begin already with the Old Testament: \"Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.\" (\"Deuteronomy\" 18:13.) Elsewhere synonyms for \"perfection\" are \"undefiled\", \"without rebuke\", \"without blemish\", \"blameless\", \"holy\", \"righteous\", \"unblamable\", \"unreprovable.\"\nAugustine explains that not only that man is properly termed perfect and without blemish who is already perfect, but also he who \"strives\" unreservedly after perfection. This is a broader concept, of \"approximate\" perfection, resembling that used in the exact sciences. The first ancient and Christian perfection was not very remote from modern \"self-perfection\". St. Ambrose in fact wrote about \"degrees\" of perfection (\"gradus piae perfectionis\").\n\nAlong with the idea of perfection, Holy Scripture conveyed doubt as to whether perfection was \"attainable\" for man. According to 1 John 1:8, \"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" Similarly Jesus said in Matthew 19:17: \"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God...\"; while Jesus does not deny that he himself is good, he does call into question the idea that anyone but God can even be good, let alone perfect. And St. Jerome wrote: \"Perfectio vera in coelestibus\" — true perfection is to be found only in heaven.\n\nAs early as the 5th century CE, two distinct views on perfection had arisen within the Church: that it was attainable by man on earth by his own powers; and, that it may come to pass only by special divine grace. The first view, which was championed by Pelagius, was condemned in 417 CE; the second view, which was championed by St. Augustine, prevailed at the very beginning of the 5th century and became authoritative.\n\nStill, the Church did not condemn the writings of the Pseudo-Areopagite, purportedly the first bishop of Athens, voicing a \"natural\" possibility for man to rise to perfection, to the contemplation of God. And so, for centuries, two views contended within the Church.\n\nEven as, for the ancient philosophers, the essence of perfection had been harmony, so for the Gospel and the Christian theologians it was charity, or love. St. Paul wrote (\"Epistle to the Colossians\", 3:14): \"And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.\"\n\nSt. Gregory wrote that perfection will be realized only after the fulfillment of history — only \"then will the world be beautiful and perfect.\" Still, everyone should make his own approach to perfection — to holiness. Discourses in moral theology and asceticism were generous with advice on how this was to be done.\n\nThe medieval concept of perfection and self-perfection, especially in its mature form, can be natural for modern man. As formulated by Peter Lombard, this concept implies that perfection is a result of \"development\". And as described by Giles of Rome, perfection has not only personal sources (\"\"personalia\") but \"social\" ones (\"secundum statum\"\"). Since the individual is formed within a society, the second perfection subsumes the first, in accordance with the \"order of the universe\" (\"ordo universi\"). The social perfection is \"binding\" on man, whereas personal perfection is only \"becoming\" to him.\n\nTheses on perfection persist within the Church to the present day. The first condition for perfection is the desire of it. Also necessary is grace — but God gives grace to those who desire perfection and strive for it. Another condition for perfection is constancy of striving and effort. Augustine says: \"He who stops, regresses.\" And effort is necessary in things not only great but also in the smallest; the Gospel according to St. Luke says: \"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\" An aid in approaching perfection is an awareness of God's perfection and of one's own imperfection.\nThe 14th century saw, with the Scotists, a shift in interest from moral to ontological perfection; the 15th century, particularly during the Italian Renaissance, a shift to artistic perfection.\n\nThe first half of the 16th century saw John Calvin's complete conditioning of man's perfection on the grace of God.\n\nThe second half of the 16th century brought the Counter-reformation, the Council of Trent, and a return of the Catholic concept; and also, heroic attempts to attain perfection through contemplation and mortification. This was the age of Ignatius Loyola and the founding of the Jesuit Order; of St. Teresa of Ávila (1515–82) and St. John of the Cross (1542–91), and the 1593 founding of the Barefoot Carmelites. This was the culminating point in the history of the Christian idea of perfection; at the same time, it was the terminal point as there soon began attempts at reforming the idea.\n\nThe first half of the 17th century saw attempts at a Catholic reform of the idea of perfection. This was the time of Cornelis Jansen (1585–1638) and of Jansenism — of a growing belief in predestination and in the impossibility of perfection without grace.\n\nWith the second half of the 17th century came a further development in the doctrine of predestination — the doctrine of \"Quietism.\" Perfection could be reached through a passive awaiting of grace rather than by an active striving. This theory, formulated in Spain by Miguel de Molinos (ca. 1628 - 1697), spread in France, where it was espoused by Madame Guyon (1648–1717) and for a time attracted François Fénelon.\n\nThe 18th century brought a sea change to the idea of moral perfection. Faith in it remained, but it changed character from religious to secular. This secular, 18th-century perfection was a fundamental article of faith for the Enlightenment. Its central tenet was that \"nature was perfect\"; and perfect, too, was the man who lived in harmony with nature's law.\n\nPrimitive man was held to be the most perfect, for he was closest to nature. Perfection lay behind present-day man rather than before him, for civilization distanced man from perfection instead of bringing him closer to it.\n\nA second interpretation, however, took the contrary view: civilization perfected man by bringing him closer to reason, and thereby to nature; for reason would direct life with due consideration for the laws of nature.\n\nThe former, retrospective view of perfection had antecedents in antiquity: Hesiod and Ovid had described a \"golden age\" that had existed at the beginning of time, and which had been succeeded by silver, copper and Iron Ages, each inferior to the previous. The renewal of this view now, after two millennia, was stimulated by European contact with the \"primitive\" peoples of the Americas. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was but one of many who wrote in a similar vein.\n\nThese two mid-18th-century schools of thought — one seeing perfection in nature and in the past, and the other in civilization and in the future — represented a reaction not against the idea of perfection, but against its transcendental interpretation: as, earlier, the measure of perfection had been the idea of God, so now it was the idea of nature or of civilization. It was the latter idea that ultimately gained the upper hand and passed into the 19th century as the legacy of the Enlightenment.\n\nThe idea of perfection as transcendental, fell away; only worldly perfection counted. The idea that perfection was a matter of grace, also fell by the wayside; man himself must strive for it, and if a single man could not accomplish it, then perhaps mankind could. As God had been the measure of perfection during the Middle Ages, so now man was: the measure had become smaller, more accessible. To the thinking of the 19th century, such worldly, human perfection might ultimately be attainable by everyone. And if not perfection, then \"improvement\". This would be the great concept of the modern age.\n\nAt the very midpoint of the 18th century, there occurred an exceptional momentary retreat from the idea of perfection. It was in the French \"Encyclopédie\". The entry, \"Perfection\" (vol. XII, 1765), discussed only technical perfection, in the sense of the matching of human products to the tasks set for them; no mention was made of ontological, moral or esthetic perfection.\n\nOtherwise, the 18th century saw great declarations championing the future perfection of man, as in Immanuel Kant's \"Idee zu einer allgemeinem Geschichte\" (1784) and Johann Gottfried von Herder's \"Ideen\" (1784/91).\n\nPerfection was expected to come about by a variety of means. Partly it would be by way of \"natural\" development and progress (the view espoused by David Hume) but more so by way of \"education\" (precursors of this view included John Locke, David Hartley, and the leaders of the Polish Enlightenment) and by way of overt \"state\" action (Claude Adrien Helvétius, later Jeremy Bentham); reliance was placed in cooperation among people (Charles Fourier, 1808), later in eugenics (Francis Galton, 1869). While the foundations of the faith in the future perfectibility of man changed, the faith itself persisted. It linked the people of the Enlightenment with the idealists and romantics — with Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the Polish Messianists — as well as with the 19th-century Positivists and evolutionists; Herbert Spencer penned a great new declaration championing the future perfection of man.\n\nThe idea of human perfectibility had, however, become more comprehensive. Man would attain greater perfection, in the sense that he would live more rationally, healthily, happily, comfortably. But there was no adequate term for this new conception, as the term \"perfection\" had a moral coloring, while the new goal was more intellectual, physical and social.\n\nIn 1852, John Henry Newman, the future British cardinal, wrote that it would be well if the English language, like the Greek, had a term to express intellectual perfection, analogously to the term \"health\", which addresses man's physical state, and to \"virtue\", which speaks to his moral nature. During the 19th century, the Germans would come to call perfection, thus construed, \"culture\" (\"Kultur\"), and the French would call it \"civilization\" (\"civilisation\").\n\nOne of the elements of perfection, in its new construction, is \"health\", understood by the World Health Organization as \"a state of complete physical and mental well-being.\"\n\nStill, the burgeoning achievements of contemporary biology have not dislodged the age-old interest in moral perfection — with the important distinction, that the goal now is not so much perfection as \"improvement\". A classic early-19th century exponent of this view was Fichte.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, the advances of science and technology appear to have been paralleled to some extent by increasingly pluralistic attitudes. The Polish philosopher Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886–1980) has written: \"To demand of someone that he strive after perfection seems equally inappropriate as to blame him for not striving after it.\" Such striving, he adds, \"is often egocentric and yields poorer moral and social results than an outward-directed behavior based not on self-perfection but on good will and kindliness toward others.\"\n\nThe ancient Greeks viewed perfection as a requisite for beauty and high art. The Pythagoreans held that perfection was to be found in the right proportions and in a harmonious arrangement of parts. The idea that beauty and art were characterized by perfection, was subsequently embraced by Plato, who believed that art ought to be \"apt, suitable, without deviations\" — in short, \"perfect\".\n\nFrom a conviction that perfection was a single quality, the Pythagoreans, Plato and their adherents held that beauty also was a single quality; hence, for every kind of art, there was but one perfect and proper form. Plutarch stated (\"De Musica\") that, during the early Greek age, musical harmonies that were recognized as perfect were \"legally binding\" at public performances.\n\nSimilarly, in temple architecture from the 5th century BCE, there were established orders. There were established proportions for Doric temples, and for Ionic temples. Likewise in sculpture, for centuries, it was a matter of dogma that certain proportions of the human body were perfect and obligatory.\n\nThere was also a prevalent belief that certain shapes and proportions were in themselves perfect. Plato felt that the perfect proportion was the ratio of the side to the diagonal of a square. His authority was so great that architects and other artists continued using this proportion, even when ignorant of its source, as late as the Middle Ages.\nAnother early idea — one that was to be espoused by many illustrious writers and artists of various periods — found perfection in the circle and the sphere. Aristotle wrote in the \"Physica\" that the circle was \"the perfect, first, most beautiful form.\" Cicero wrote in \"De Natura Deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods): \"Two forms are the most distinctive: of solids, the sphere... and of plane figures, the circle... There is nothing more commensurate than these forms.\"\n\nIn a commentary to Aristotle's \"De coelo et mundo\" (\"On the Heavens and Earth\"), the medieval Pole, Jan of Słupcza, wrote: \"The most perfect body ought to have the most perfect form, and such [a body] is heaven, while the most perfect form is the round form, for nothing can be added to it.\" In the famous illustrated \"Les très riches heures du duc de Berry\", paradise is depicted as contained within an ideal sphere.\n\nThe Renaissance architect Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) stated: \"the round form is the most perfect of all.\"\n\nThe most excellent of 16th-century architects, Andrea Palladio, held that \"the most perfect and most excellent\" form was \"the round form, since of all forms it is the simplest, the most uniform, the strongest, the most capacious\" and \"is the most suitable for rendering the unity, infinity, uniformity and righteousness of God.\" This was the same thought as in Jan of Słupcza and in Serlio, and it was one of uncommon durability.\n\nThe Middle Ages — Romanesque and Gothic alike — had been quite taken with the idea of perfection. But a true explosion of the imperative for perfection came with the Renaissance.\n\nRenaissance aesthetics placed less emphasis than had classical aesthetics on the unity of things perfect. Baldassare Castiglione, in his \"Courtier\", wrote, of Leonardo, Andrea Mantegna, Raphael, Michelangelo and Giorgione, that \"each of them is unlike the others, but each is the most perfect [\"perfectissimus\"] in his style.\" \nThe great architect and polymath Leone Battista Alberti wrote (\"De architectura\") that \"the art of building... in Italy [had] achieved perfect maturity\", that the Romans had \"created such a perfect art of building that there was in it nothing mysterious, hidden or unclear.\" This was yet another formulation of the concept of perfection.\n\nDaniele Barbaro, in his 1567 translation of Vitruvius, classically defined perfection as \"that which lacks nothing and to which nothing can be added.\"\n\nThe Renaissance showed a marked concern with \"preeminence\" in perfection. Leonardo concluded that the most perfect of the arts was painting. In 1546 Benedetto Varchi compared great masters in the arts. Others compared art and science, art and nature, and perfection in the arts of the ancients with that in the modern masters. The 16th century saw comparisons of their music, the 17th — of their visual arts and especially of their poetry. These comparisons construed perfection fairly loosely; the concept was treated more strictly by architects.\n\nThe Renaissance distinguished a variety of properties to perfection. It was variously held to be:\n\nIn the eclectic view of the late Renaissance, perfection in a work would require uniting the talents of \"many\" artists. Paolo Pino held that only that painter would be perfect who combined the talents of Titian and Michelangelo.\n\nThe concept of perfection was harder to apply to Renaissance literature but became so common — often, linked to \"eccelente\" — as to become banal. Its frequent application brought about its relativization and even subjectivization.\n\nBeginning with Serlio and Palladio, perfection in art had become less important, less definite, less objective. The striving for perfection no longer had the importance for men of letters that it did for the great architects. But the 17th century still revered perfection, as shown by the appearance of that word in book titles: \"De perfecta poesi\" by the Polish poet Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski (1595–1640); \"Le peintre parfait\" (1767 by André Félibien; and \"Idée de la perfection de la peinture\" (1662) by Fréart de Chambray.\n\nSarbiewski offered several theses: poetry not only imitates things \"perfectissime\" (\"most perfectly\"), but imitates them as they ought \"perfectissime\" to be in nature; perfect art is recognized by its agreement with nature, as well as its universality; art is the more perfect, the nobler (\"nobilior\") its manner of representing things; it is the more perfect, the more truths it contains; perfection has various degrees — it is higher in poetry than in prose.\n\nIn classicism, especially in French 17th-century classicism, from an \"ideal\" attainable by few, perfection became an \"obligation\" for every author. And inasmuch as the criterion of perfection had been lowered, \"perfection\" now meant only \"correctness.\" In the ensuing devaluation, it was not enough that art be \"perfecta\", it should be \"perfectissima\".\n\nPerfection, formerly the \"supreme\" characterization for a work of art, now became but one of \"many\" positive characterizations. Cesare Ripa, in his \"Iconologia\" (published 1593, but typical for the 17th century), presented \"perfezione\" as a concept of equal status with grace (\"grazia\"), prettiness (\"venustà\") and beauty (\"bellezza\").\n\nLeibniz's pupil, Christian Wolff, in his \"Psychology\", wrote that beauty consists in perfection, and that this was why beauty was a source of pleasure. No such general esthetic theory, explicitly naming perfection, had ever been formulated by any of its devotees from Plato to Palladio.\nWolff's theory of beauty-as-perfection was developed by the school's chief aesthetician, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten. This tradition remained active in Germany as late as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who considered both beauty and sublimity to be ideas of perfection; when unity prevailed, beauty emerged; when plurality — sublimity.\n\nIn the latter part of the 18th century, Immanuel Kant wrote much in his \"Critique of Judgment\" about perfection — inner and outer, objective and subjective, qualitative and quantitative, perceived clearly and obscurely, the perfection of nature and that of art. Nevertheless, in aesthetics Kant found that \"The judgment of taste [i.e., aesthetic judgment] is entirely independent of the concept of perfection\" — that is, beauty was something different from perfection.\n\nEarlier in the 18th century, France's leading aesthetician, Denis Diderot, had questioned whether perfection was a more comprehensible idea than beauty. Jean-Jacques Rousseau had treated perfection as an unreal concept, and wrote Jean le Rond d'Alembert, \"Let us not seek the chimera of perfection, but that which is the best possible.\"\n\nIn England, in 1757, the important aesthetician Edmund Burke denied that perfection was the cause of beauty. Quite the contrary, he argued that beauty nearly always involved an element of \"imperfection\"; for example, women, in order to heighten their attractiveness, emphasized their weakness and frailty, which is to say, their imperfection.\n\nThe 18th century was the last for which perfection was a principal concept in aesthetics. In the 19th century, perfection survived only vestigially as a general expression of approval. Alfred de Musset held that \"Perfection is no more attainable for us than is infinity. One ought not to seek it anywhere: not in love, nor beauty, nor happiness, nor virtue; but one should love it, in order to be virtuous, beautiful and happy, insofar as that is possible for man.\"\n\nIn the 20th century, Paul Valéry wrote: \"To strive for perfection, to devote endless time to a work, to set oneself—like Goethe—an unattainable goal, are all intents that are precluded by the pattern of modern life.\"\n\nThe dismissal of the question concerning whether artists \"can\" achieve perfection, still left the question: Do artists \"want\" to achieve it? Is that their actual goal? Some artists, schools and epochs \"have\" aimed for perfection. Others have nurtured \"other\" goals: pluralism, novelty, powerful sensations, faithfulness to truth, self-expression and expression of the world, creativity and originality — all of which may roughly be summarized as \"expression.\"\n\nThere have been ages of perfection, and ages of expression. The arts of ancient Greece, the Renaissance and neoclassicism were arts of perfection. In the mannerist, baroque and romantic periods, expression has prevailed.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Anaximander described the world as \"endless\" (\"apeiron\"), Xenophanes — as \"the greatest\" (\"megistos\"). But while they ascribed great qualities to the world, they did not regard it as perfect.\nOnly Parmenides seems to have considered existence to be \"tetelesmenon\" (\"finished\"); and Melissos, his successor in the Eleatic school, said that existence \"was entirely\" (\"pan esti\"). Thus both saw perfection in existence; true existence was one, constant, immutable. Moreover, Parmenides thought the world to be finite, limited in all directions, and like a sphere — which was a mark of its perfection.\n\nParmenides' view was embraced to some extent by Plato. He thought that the world was the work of a good Demiurge, and that this was why order and harmony prevailed in the world. The world was the best, the most beautiful, perfect. It had a perfect shape (spherical) and a perfect motion (circular).\n\nBut Plato said nothing about the Demiurge architect-of-the-world himself being perfect. And understandably so, for perfection implied finitude, limits; whereas it was the world, not its creator, that had limits. A similar view was held by Aristotle: the world could be perfect, but God could not.\n\nOnly the pantheist Stoics held the divinity to be perfect — precisely because they identified it with the world. Cicero wrote in \"De natura deorum\" (On the Nature of the Gods) that the world \"encompasses... within itself all beings... And what could be more nonsensical than denying perfection to an all-embracing being... Besides the world, there is no thing that does not lack something and that is harmonious, perfect and finished in every respect...\"\n\nAt a certain moment, Greek philosophy became bound up with the religion of the Christians: the abstract concept of first cause became linked with the religious concept of God; the \"primum movens\" became identified with the Creator, the absolute with the divine Person. Features of an absolute existence were discovered in the Person of the Creator: He was immutable, timeless. And absolute existence took on the attributes of a person: it was good, omnipotent, omnipresent. Christian theology united the features of the first cause in Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" with those of the Creator in the \"Book of Genesis\". But the attributes of God did not include perfection, for a perfect being must be \"finite\"; only of such a being might one say that it lacked nothing.\n\nThere was another reason for the denial, to God, of perfection — in a branch of Christian theology that was under the influence of Plotinus. In this view, the absolute from which the world derived could not be grasped in terms of human concepts, even the most general and transcendent. Not only was that absolute not matter, it was not spirit either, nor idea; it was superior to these. It exceeded any description or praise; it was incomprehensible and ineffable; it was beyond all that we may imagine — including perfection.\n\nMedieval Christian philosophy held that the concept of perfection might describe Creation, but was not appropriate to describe God. Saint Thomas Aquinas, indicating that he was following Aristotle, defined a perfect thing as one that \"possesses that of which, by its nature, it is capable.\" Also (\"Summa Theologica\"): \"That is perfect, which lacks nothing of the perfection proper to it.\" Thus there were, in the world, things perfect and imperfect, more perfect and less perfect. God permitted imperfections in Creation when they were necessary for the good of the whole. And for man it was natural to go by degrees from imperfection to perfection.\n\nDuns Scotus understood perfection still more simply and mundanely: \"Perfection is that which it is better to have than not to have.\" It was not an attribute of God but a property of creation: all things partook of it to a greater or lesser degree. A thing's perfection depended on what sort of perfection it was eligible for. In general, that was perfect which had attained the fullness of the qualities possible for it. Hence \"whole\" and \"perfect\" meant more or less the same (\"totum et perfectum sunt quasi idem\").\nThis was a teleological concept, for it implied an end (goal or purpose). God created things that served certain purposes, created even those purposes, but He himself did not serve any purpose. Since God was not finite, He could not be called perfect: for the concept of perfection served to describe \"finite\" things. Perfection was not a theological concept, but an ontological one, because it was a feature, in some degree, of every being. The 9th-century thinker Paschasius Radbertus wrote: \"Everything is the more perfect, the more it resembles God.\" Still, this did not imply that God himself was perfect.\n\nThe concept of perfection, as an attribute of God, entered theology only in modern times, through René Descartes — and in the \"plural\", as the \"perfections\" of God.\n\nAfter Descartes, the concept of perfection as a principal concept in philosophy was upheld by other great 17th-century thinkers. In Benedict Spinoza's philosophy, however, there was no personal God, and perfection became a property of — even a synonym for — the existence of reality (that is, for the essence of things).\n\nLeibniz wrote: \"As M. Descartes states, \"existence\" itself is perfection.\" Leibniz added: \"Perfection, I call any simple quality, if it is positive and absolute, such that, if it expresses something, it does so without limits.\"\n\nAt the same time, Leibniz also construed perfection, in his \"Monadology\", in an utterly different way: \"Only that is perfect which possesses no limits, that is, only God.\" This concept would last out the entire 17th century. Subsequently, Immanuel Kant would describe perfection as \"omnitudo realitatis\" (\"the omnitude of reality\"). Thus perfection, which during the Middle Ages could be a property of any individual being, in 17th-century philosophy became as well, and indeed preeminently, a property of God.\n\nLeibniz's pupil and successor, Christian Wolff, took up this concept of perfection — but with a difference. Wolff ascribed perfection not to being as a whole, but once again to its individual constituents. He gave, as examples, an eye that sees faultlessly, and a watch that runs faultlessly. He also distinguished variants — \"perfectio simplex\" and \"composita\", \"primaria\" and \"secundaria\" — and differentiated the magnitude of perfection (\"magnitudo perfectionis\").\n\nWolff's pupil, Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, derived perfection from rules, but anticipated their collisions (\"regularum collisio\") leading to exceptions (\"exceptio\") and limiting the perfection of things. Baumgarten distinguished perfection \"simplex\" and \"composita\", \"interna\" and \"externa\", \"transcendentalis\" and \"accidentalis\"; and, positing so broad a construction, he arrived at the conclusion that \"everything is perfect.\"\n\nIn short, Wolff and his pupils had returned to the ontological concept of perfection that the Scholastics had used. The \"theological\" concept of perfection had lived only from Descartes to Leibniz, in the 17th century.\n\nThanks to Wolff's school, the concept of perfection lasted in Germany through the 18th century. In other western countries, however, especially France and Britain, in that century the concept of perfection was already in decline. It was ignored by the French \"Grande Encyclopédie\".\n\nThe history of the concept of perfection had undergone great evolutions — from \"\"Nothing\" in the world is perfect\", to \"\"Everything\" is perfect\"; and from \"Perfection is \"not\" an attribute of God\", to \"Perfection \"is\" an attribute of God.\"\n\nWith Christian Wolff's school, every thing had become perfect. This was a singular moment in the history of the ontological concept of perfection; and soon thereafter, that history came to an end.\n\nThe foregoing discussion shows that the \"term\" \"perfection\" has been used to designate a variety of \"concepts\":\n\nExcept for the first, mathematical sense, all these concepts of \"perfection\" show a kinship and oscillate between ideal and approximation.\n\nHowever, the expression \"perfect\" is also used colloquially as a superlative (\"perfect idiot,\" \"perfect scoundrel,\" \"perfect storm\"). Here \"perfectum\" is confused with \"excellens\" of an approving, admiring or condemnatory kind.\n\nPerfection has also been construed as that which is \"the best\". In theology, when Descartes and Leibniz termed God \"perfect,\" they had in mind something other than \"model\"; than that which \"lacks nothing\"; than that \"achieves its purpose\"; than that fulfills its functions; or than that \"is harmonious\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1678827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1678827", "title": "Political satire", "text": "Political satire\n\nPolitical satire is satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.\n\nPolitical satire is usually distinguished from political protest or political dissent, as it does not necessarily carry an agenda nor seek to influence the political process. While occasionally it may, it more commonly aims simply to provide entertainment. By its very nature, it rarely offers a constructive view in itself; when it is used as part of protest or dissent, it tends to simply establish the error of matters rather than provide solutions.\n\nSatire can be traced back throughout history; wherever organized government, or social categories, has existed, so has satire.\n\nThe oldest example that has survived till today is Aristophanes. In his time satire targeted top politicians, like Cleon, and religion, at the time headed by Zeus. \"Satire and derision progressively attacked even the fundamental and most sacred facts of faith,\" leading to an increased doubt towards religion by the general population. The Roman period, for example, gives us the satirical poems and epigrams of Martial. Cynic philosophers often engaged in political satire.\n\nDue to lack of political freedom of speech in many ancient civilizations, covert satire is more usual than overt satire in ancient literatures of political liberalism. Historically, the public opinion in the Athenian democracy was remarkably influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theatres. Watching or reading satire has since ancient time been considered one of the best ways to understand a culture and a society.\n\nDuring the 20th and 21st Centuries satire is found in an increasing number of media (in cartoons as political cartoons with heavy caricature and exaggeration, and in political magazines) and the parallel exposure of political scandals to performances (including television shows). Examples include musicians such as Tom Lehrer, live performance groups like the Capitol Steps and the Montana Logging and Ballet Co., and public television and live performer Mark Russell. Additional subgenres include such literary classics as \"Gulliver's Travels\" and \"Animal Farm\", and more recently, internet \"Ezine\" and website sources such as \"The Onion\".\n\nOne example is Maurice Joly's 1864 pamphlet entitled \"The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu\" (\"Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu\"), which attacks the political ambitions of Napoleon III. It was first published in Brussels in 1864. The piece used the literary device of a dialogue between two diabolical plotters in Hell, the historical characters of Machiavelli and Montesquieu, to cover up a direct, and illegal, attack on Napoleon's rule. The noble baron Montesquieu made the case for liberalism; the Florentine political writer Machiavelli presented the case for cynical despotism. In this manner, Joly communicated the secret ways in which liberalism might spawn a despot like Napoleon III. However, \"The Prince\" itself has also been sometimes understood as political satire.\n\nAccording to Santayana, Nietzsche was actually \"a keen satirist\".\n\"Nietzsche's satire\" was aimed at Lutheranism.\n\nThe UK has a long tradition of political satire, dating from the early years of English literature. In some readings, a number of William Shakespeare's plays can be seen – or at least performed – as satire, including \"Richard III\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\". Later examples such as Jonathan Swift's \"A Modest Proposal\" are more outright in their satirical nature.\n\nIn modern era, political satire in the United Kingdom includes pamphlets and newspaper articles, such as \"Private Eye\", topical television panel shows such as \"Have I Got News for You\", and television series such as \"Yes Minister\", \"House of Cards\" and \"The Thick of It\" and \"ToryBoy The Movie\".\n\nSatire became more visible on American television during the 1960s. Some of the early shows that used political satire include the British and American versions of the program \"That Was the Week That Was\" (airing on the American Broadcasting Company, or ABC, in the U.S.), CBS's \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\", and NBC's \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\". During the months leading up to the 1968 presidential election, Richard Nixon appeared on \"Laugh-In\" and repeated the program's catch-phrase \"Sock it to me.\" Other forms of satire of the 1960s and early 1970s typically used the sitcom format, such as the show \"All in the Family\".\n\nWhen \"Saturday Night Live\" debuted in 1975, the show began to change the way that comedians would depict the president on television. Chevy Chase opened the fourth episode of the show with his impersonation of a bumbling Gerald Ford. Chase did not change his appearance to look like President Ford, and he portrayed the president by repeatedly falling down on the stage. Some of the other famous presidential impersonations on \"Saturday Night Live\" include Dan Aykroyd's Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter caricatures, Dana Carvey as George H. W. Bush, Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton, Will Ferrell as George W. Bush, and Jay Pharoah as Barack Obama. Hammond was the first cast member to impersonate Donald Trump, but now Alec Baldwin portrays him.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, \"Saturday Night Live\" gained wide attention because former cast member Tina Fey returned to the show to satirize Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. In addition to Fey's striking physical resemblance to Palin, the impersonation of the vice presidential candidate was also noteworthy because of Fey's humorous use of some of exactly the same words Palin used in media interviews and campaign speeches as a way to perform political satire.\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" also uses political satire throughout its \"Weekend Update\" sketch. \"Weekend Update\" is a fake news segment on the show that satirizes politics and current events. It has been a part of \"SNL\" since the first episode of the show on October 11, 1975.\n\n\"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" use stylistic formats that are similar to \"Weekend Update\". On \"The Daily Show\", host Jon Stewart used footage from news programs to satirize politics and the news media. Stephen Colbert performed in character on \"The Colbert Report\" as a right-wing news pundit. Both hosts' television programs were broadcast on Comedy Central, while \"The Daily Show\" continues to run featuring a new host. Colbert became the host of \"The Late Show\", succeeding David Letterman. With their shows, Stewart and Colbert helped increase public and academic discussion of the significance of political satire. \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" and \"The Jim Jefferies Show\" are also examples of political commentary.\n\nAccording to the findings of the 2004 Pew Survey, both younger and older audiences are turning to late-night comedy shows as not only a source of entertainment, but also for an opportunity to gain political awareness. For this reason, Geoffrey Baym suggests that shows that make use of political satire, such as \"The Daily Show\", should be considered as a form of alternative journalism. Utilizing satire has shown to be an attractive feature in news programming, drawing in the audiences of less politically engaged demographic cohorts. Moreover, satire news programming can be considered alternative because satire plays an important role in dissecting and critiquing power.\n\nIn his article \"The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism\", Baym detailed how \"The Daily Show\", then hosted by Jon Stewart, presented news stories. For the satire news show, presenting information in a comprehensive manner was used to give viewers a greater perspective of a situation. Often, Stewart studded his segments with additional background information, or reminders of relevant and past details. For example, \"The Daily Show\" displayed the full video of Bush's comments regarding Tenet's resignation in 2004. This was a deliberate choice by the show in attempt to give a more sincere representation of the event. Moreover, it can be seen as a challenge and critique of what more traditional news shows failed to include. In this way, satire news can be seen as more informative than other news sources. Notably, research findings released by National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES) concede that followers of satire news are more knowledgeable and consume more news than the general population.\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph Faina has considered the satire used in news shows as a facilitator in developing a public journalism practice. Faina explains in his article that the nature of satire encourages viewers to become politically engaged, and a civic participant, in which the humor exercised by hosts elicit responses in viewers. However, Faina has acknowledged that this model is somewhat idealistic. Nevertheless, Faina argues that the potential still exists. Not to mention, with the rise in technology and the growing ubiquity of cellular phones, it can be argued that civic participation is all the more easier to accomplish.\n\nThough satire in news is celebrated as a vehicle toward a more informed public, such view is not universally shared among scholars. Critics have expressed their hesitancy toward the infiltration of lighthearted practices to cover more dire topics like political affair. Potentially off-color remarks, or vulgar comments made by the likes of Stephen Colbert of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\", or Samantha Bee, host of \"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee\", can be used as examples of what critics are concerned over. Here, satire is believed to diminish the gravity of a topic.\n\nBaym proposes that as these shows are alternative, they have no obligation to \"abide by standard practices\". Unlike traditional news sources, which may be required to adhere to certain agendas, like political affiliation or advertising restrictions, hosts of satire news shows are free and zealous to showcase personal contributions through their mentions of disdain, qualms, and excitement. Critics of satire in news shows thus believe that the showcasing of an overly and openly frustrated host will induce or perpetuate \"cynicism in viewers\".\n\n\n"}

Other Carrigan Report recommendations were enacted in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, which raised the age of consent and banned artificial contraception. On dance halls, the report stated:\n\n\"In the course of the Inquiry no form of abuse was blamed more persistently for pernicious consequences than the unlicensed dances held all over the country in unsuitable buildings and surroundings, for the profit of persons who are liable to no control or supervision by any authority. The scandals that are the outcome of such a situation are notorious. They have been denounced in pastorals, exposed in the Press, and condemned by clergy, judges and justices, without avail. Before us the Commissioner, speaking for the Civic Guard, said these dance gatherings in many districts were turned into \"orgies of dissipation, which in the present state of legislation the police are powerless to prevent.\" In short, there is no effective legislation to put down this nuisance.\"\n\nThe Public Dance Halls Bill was introduced in 1934 by the then government of Fianna Fáil, and supported by the opposition Fine Gael and Labour parties. It was supported by the Catholic hierarchy. Secular nationalist institutions like the Gaelic League the legislation were seen as beneficial for protecting Irish culture against foreign influence.\n\nLicensing is administered at the district court, subject to the discretion of the local judge. In the early years of its effect, they were less tolerant of more recently introduced musical styles, such as set dancing (seen as \"foreign\") and jazz dance clubs. However, it also disadvantaged many traditional Irish musical activities, such as private house dances and crossroad dances, forcing spontaneous and social music and dance into a controlled and commercialized environment. This set the conditions for the predominance of the céilidh, with its large and loud musical ensembles and wide open dance spaces. The ceilidh arose at the expense of older traditional music, which declined in popularity for decades until the creation of the Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, and later the Folk Revival brought new attention to traditional Irish music.\n\nThe Act remains in force, with amendments. Nightclubs may be subject to stricter conditions in some districts than in others, depending on the particular judge. The Irish Nightclub Industry Association has described the legislation as \"archaic\". In 2001 there was confusion about whether the Act applied to lapdancing clubs.\n\n"}

{"id": "4735624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4735624", "title": "Renaissance Revival architecture", "text": "Renaissance Revival architecture\n\nRenaissance Revival (sometimes referred to as \"Neo-Renaissance\") is a broad designation that covers many 19th century architectural revival styles which were neither Grecian (see Greek Revival) nor Gothic (see Gothic Revival) but which instead drew inspiration from a wide range of classicizing Italian modes. Under the broad designation \"Renaissance architecture\" nineteenth-century architects and critics went beyond the architectural style which began in Florence and central Italy in the early 15th century as an expression of Humanism; they also included styles we would identify as Mannerist or Baroque. Self-applied style designations were rife in the mid- and later nineteenth century: \"Neo-Renaissance\" might be applied by contemporaries to structures that others called \"Italianate\", or when many French Baroque features are present (Second Empire).\n\nThe divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe, particularly in France and Italy, has added to the difficulty of defining and recognizing Neo-Renaissance architecture. A comparison between the breadth of its source material, such as the English Wollaton Hall, Italian Palazzo Pitti, the French Château de Chambord, and the Russian Palace of Facets—all deemed \"Renaissance\"—illustrates the variety of appearances the same architectural label can take.\n\nThe origin of Renaissance architecture is generally accredited to Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) Brunelleschi and his contemporaries wished to bring greater \"order\" to architecture, resulting in strong symmetry and careful proportion. The movement grew from scientific observations of nature, in particular human anatomy.\n\nNeo-Renaissance architecture is formed by not only the original Italian architecture but by the form in which Renaissance architecture developed in France during the 16th century. During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war booty, but also stylistic ideas. In the Loire valley a wave of chateau building was carried out using traditional French Gothic styles but with ornament in the forms of pediments, arcades, shallow pilasters and entablatures from the Italian Renaissance.\n\nIn England the Renaissance tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as Longleat House. Often these buildings had symmetrical towers which hint at the evolution from medieval fortified architecture. This is particularly evident at Hatfield House built between 1607 and 1611, where medieval towers jostle with a large Italian cupola. This is why so many buildings of the early English Neo-Renaissance style often have more of a \"castle air\" than their European contemporaries, which can add again to the confusion with the Gothic revival style.\n\nWhen in the 19th century Renaissance style architecture came into vogue, it often materialized not just in its original form according to geography, but as a hybrid of all its earlier forms according to the whims of architects and patrons rather than geography and culture. If this were not confusing enough, the new Neo-Renaissance then frequently borrowed architectural elements from the succeeding Mannerist period, and in many cases the even later Baroque period. Mannerism and Baroque being two very opposing styles of architecture. Mannerism was exemplified by the Palazzo del Te and Baroque by the Wurzburg Residenz.\n\nThus Italian, French and Flemish Renaissance coupled with the amount of borrowing from these later periods can cause great difficulty and argument in correctly identifying various forms of 19th-century architecture. Differentiating some forms of French Neo-Renaissance buildings from those of the Gothic revival can at times be especially tricky, as both styles were simultaneously popular during the 19th century.\n\nJohn Ruskin's panegyrics to architectural wonders of Venice and Florence contributed to shifting \"the attention of scholars and designers, with their awareness heightened by debate and restoration work\" from Late Neoclassicism and Gothic Revival to the Italian Renaissance. As a consequence, a self-consciously \"Neo-Renaissance\" manner first began to appear circa 1840. By 1890 this movement was already in decline. The Hague's Peace Palace completed in 1913, in a heavy French Neo-Renaissance manner was one of the last notable buildings in this style.\n\nCharles Barry introduced the Neo-Renaissance to England with his design of the Travellers Club, Pall Mall (1829–1832). Other early but typical, domestic examples of the Neo-Renaissance include Mentmore Towers and the Château de Ferrières, both designed in the 1850s by Joseph Paxton for members of the Rothschild banking family. The style is characterized by original Renaissance motifs, taken from such Quattrocento architects as Alberti. These motifs included rusticated masonry and quoins, windows framed by architraves and doors crowned by pediments and entablatures. If a building were of several floors, the uppermost floor usually had small square windows representing the minor mezzanine floor of the original Renaissance designs. However, the Neo-renaissance style later came to incorporate Romanesque and Baroque features not found in the original Renaissance architecture which was often more severe in its design.\n\nLike all architectural styles, the Neo-Renaissance did not appear overnight fully formed but evolved slowly. One of the very first signs of its emergence was the Würzburg Women's Prison, which was erected in 1809 designed by Peter Speeth. It included a heavily rusticated ground floor, alleviated by one semicircular arch, with a curious Egyptian style miniature portico above, high above this were a sequence of six tall arched windows and above these just beneath the slightly projecting roof were the small windows of the upper floor. This building foreshadows similar effects in the work of the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson whose work in the Neo-Renaissance style was popular in the USA during the 1880s. Richardson's style at the end or the revival era was a severe mix of both Romanesque and Renaissance features. This was exemplified by his \"Marshall Field Warehouse\" in Chicago (completed in 1887, now demolished).\n\nHowever, while the beginning of Neo-Renaissance period can be defined by its simplicity and severity, what came between was far more ornate in its design. This period can be defined by some of the great opera houses of Europe, such as Gottfried Semper's Burgtheater in Vienna, and his Opera house in Dresden. This ornate form of the Neo-Renaissance, originating from France, is sometimes known as the \"Second Empire\" style, by now it also incorporated some Baroque elements. By 1875 it had become the accepted style in Europe for all public and bureaucratic buildings. In England, where Sir George Gilbert Scott designed the London Foreign Office in this style between 1860 and 1875, it also incorporated certain Palladian features.\n\nStarting with the orangery of Sanssouci (1851), \"the Neo-Renaissance became the obligatory style for university and public buildings, for banks and financial institutions, and for the urban villas\" in Germany. Among the most accomplished examples of the style were Villa Meyer in Dresden, Villa Haas in Hesse, Palais Borsig in Berlin, Villa Meissner in Leipzig; the German version of Neo-Renaissance culminated in such turgid projects as the Town Hall in Hamburg (1886–1897) and the Reichstag in Berlin (completed in 1894).\n\nIn Austria, it was pioneered by such illustrious names as Rudolf Eitelberger, the founder of the Viennese College of Arts and Crafts (today the University of Applied Arts Vienna). The style found particular favour in Vienna, where whole streets and blocks were built in the so-called Neo-Renaissance style, in reality, a classicizing conglomeration of elements liberally borrowed from different historical periods.\n\nNeo-Renaissance was also the favourite style in Kingdom of Hungary in the 1870s and 1880s. In the fast-growing capital, Budapest many monumental public buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style like Saint Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian State Opera House. Andrássy Avenue is an outstanding ensemble of Neo-Renaissance townhouses from the last decades of the 19th century. The most famous Hungarian architect of the age, Miklós Ybl preferred Neo-Renaissance in his works.\n\nIn Russia, the style was pioneered by Auguste de Montferrand in the (1835), the first in Saint Petersburg to take \"a story-by-story approach to façade ornamentation, in contrast to the classical method, where the façade was conceived as a unit\". Konstantin Thon, the most popular Russian architect of the time, used Italianate elements profusely for decorating some interiors of the Grand Kremlin Palace (1837–1851). Another fashionable architect, Andrei Stackensneider, was responsible for Marie Palace (1839–1844), with \"the faceted rough-hewn stone of the first floor\" reminiscent of 16th-century Italian palazzi.\n\nThe style was further elaborated by architects of the Vladimir Palace (1867–1872) and culminated in the Stieglitz Museum (1885–1896). In Moscow, the Neo-Renaissance was less prevalent than in the Northern capital, although interiors of the neo-Muscovite City Duma (1890–1892) were executed with emphasis on Florentine and Venetian décor. While the Neo-Renaissance is associated primarily with secular buildings, Princes Yusupov commissioned the interior of (1909–1916) near Moscow to be decorated in strict imitation of the 16th-century Venetian churches.\n\nThe style spread to North America, where it became a favourite domestic architectural style of the wealthiest Americans. The Breakers in Newport, Rhode Island, was a residence of the Vanderbilt family designed by Richard Morris Hunt in 1892; it and contemporaneous Gilded Age mansions exemplify the ambitions of wealthy Americans in equaling and surpassing the ostentatious lifestyles of European aristocrats. During the latter half of the 19th century 5th Avenue in New York City was lined with \"Renaissance\" French chateaux and Italian palazzi, all designed in Neo-Renaissance styles. Most of these have since been demolished.\n\nOne of the most widely copied features of Renaissance architecture were the great staircases from the chateaux of Blois and Chambord. Blois had been the favourite residence of the French Kings throughout the renaissance. The Francis I wing, completed in 1524, of which the staircase is an integral part was one of the earliest examples of French Renaissance. French renaissance architecture was a combination of the earlier Gothic style coupled with a strong Italian influence represented by arches, arcades, balustrading and, in general, a more flowing line of design than had been apparent in the earlier Gothic. The Chateau de Blois's triumphal staircase was imitated almost from the moment of its completion, and was certainly the predecessor of the \"double staircase\" (sometimes attributed to Leonardo da Vinci) at the Château de Chambord just a few years later.\n\nA Grand Staircase whether based on that of Blois, or the Villa Farnese was to become one of the features of Neo-Renaissance design. It became a common feature for the staircase to be not just a feature of the internal architecture but also the external. But whereas at Blois the stairs had been open to the elements in the 19th century new and innovative use of glass was able to give protection from the weather, giving the staircase the appearance of being in the true renaissance open style, when it was in fact a truly internal feature. Further and more adventurous use of glass also enabled the open and arcaded Renaissance courtyards to be reproduced as lofty halls with glazed roofs. This was a feature at Mentmore Towers and on a far larger scale at the Warsaw University of Technology, where the large glazed court contained a monumental staircase. The \"Warsaw University of Technology staircase\", though if Renaissance in spirit at all, is more in the lighter, more columned style of Ottaviano Nonni's (named il Mascherino) staircase designed for Pope Gregory XIII at Rome's Palazzo Quirinale in 1584, thus demonstrating that architects wherever their location were selecting their Neo-Renaissance styles reardless of geography\n\nGothic influences on both period and revived Renaissance architecture are readily apparent, first as much building occurred during the period of transition from the Gothic to the Renaissance style; and also as Renaissance−era design took the form of the addition of Renaissance ornamentation to Gothic−era buildings thus creating an accretion of details from disparate sources. Architects who designed in the Renaissance Revival style usually avoided any references to Gothic Revival architecture, drawing instead on a variety of other classically based styles. However, there are exceptions and occasionally the two distinct styles are mixed. The sub-variety of Gothic design most frequently employed is floral Venetian Gothic, as seen in the Doge's Palace courtyard, built in the 1480s.\n\nA common Baroque feature introduced into the Renaissance Revival styles was the \"imperial staircase\" (a single straight flight dividing into two separate flights).\n\nThe staircase at Mentmore Towers designed by Joseph Paxton, and the one at the Warsaw University of Technology designed by Bronisław Rogóyski and Stefan Szyller (late 19th century), both rise from pastiches of true Renaissance courtyards. Both staircases seem more akin to Balthasar Neumann's great Baroque staircase at the Würzburg Residenz than anything found in a true Renaissance Palazzo. The apparent Baroque style staircase at Mentmore is not without a Renaissance influence, its first flight is similar to \"The staircase of the Giants\" rises from the Doge's Palace Courtyard, designed when the Venetian Gothic was being uncomfortably merged with Renaissance style. Similarly to that at Mentmore, the Staircase of the Giant's terminates on to an arcaded loggia. Perhaps not ironically the Hall and Staircase at Mentmore were designed by Paxton to display furniture formerly housed in the Doge's Palace.\n\nParis is home to many historicist buildings that partake equally from Renaissance and Baroque source material, such as the Opera Garnier. However, the Parisian Hôtel de Ville faithfully replicates the true French Renaissance style, complete with the steeply pitched roofs and towers, as it was a reconstruction, completed circa 1880, of the previous Hôtel de Ville.\n\nIn the British Raj in 1880, the façades of the 1777 Writers' building in Kolkata were redesigned in the Renaissance Revival style then popular in colonial India, though this version was remarkable in its unique design. Loggias of Serlian arches deceptively form an almost Indian appearance, yet they sit beneath a Mansard roof. In what at first glance appears an Indian building, on closer examination shows a Historicist example of Classical Palladianism combined with the French Renaissance, a uniquely distinctive interpretation of the Renaissance Revival style.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Neo-Renaissance style was in reality an eclectic blending of past styles, which the architect selected on the whims of his patrons. In the true Renaissance era there was a division of labour between the architect, who designed the exterior highly visible shell, and others—the artisans—who decorated and arranged the interior. The original Italian mannerist house was a place for relaxation and entertaining, convenience and comfort of the interior being a priority; in the later Baroque designs, comfort and interior design were secondary to outward appearance. This was followed by the Neoclassical period, which gave importance to the proportions and dignity of interiors, but still lost the comfort and internal convenience of the mannerist period. It was during the Neo-Renaissance period of the 19th century that the mannerist comforts were re-discovered and taken a step further. Not only did the improved building techniques of the 1850s allow the glazing of formerly open loggias and arches with the newly invented sheets of plate glass, providing the first \"picture windows\", but also the blending of architectural styles allowed interiors and exteriors to be treated differently. It was at this time that the concept of \"furnishing styles\" manifested itself, allowing distinctions to be made between interior rooms and external appearances, and indeed between the various rooms themselves. Thus the modern concept of treating a room individually, and differently from its setting and neighbours, came into its infancy. Classic examples of this are the great Rothschild house in Buckinghamshire, hybrids of various Renaissance chateaux, and 16th century English country houses, all with interiors ranging from \"Versailles\" to \"Medici\", and in the case of Mentmore Towers a huge central hall, resembling the arcaded courtyard of a Renaissance villa, conveniently glazed over, furnished in Venetian style and heated by a fireplace designed by Rubens for his house in Antwerp\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century Neo-Renaissance was a commonplace sight on the main streets of thousands of towns, large and small around, the world. In southern Europe the Neo-Renaissance style began to fall from favour circa 1900. However, it was still extensively practiced in the 1910s in Saint Petersburg and Buenos Aires by such architects as Leon Benois, Marian Peretyatkovich, or Francisco Tamburini ().\n\nIn England it was so common that today one finds \"Renaissance Italian Palazzi\" serving as banks or municipal buildings in the centres of even the smallest towns. It has been said \"It is a well-known fact that the nineteenth century had no art style of its own.\" While to an extent this may be true, the same could be said of most eras until the early 20th century, the Neo-Renaissance in the hands of provincial architects did develop into a style not always instantly recognisable as a derivative of the Renaissance. In this less obvious guise the Neo-Renaissance was to provide an important undercurrent in totalitarian architecture of various countries, notably in Stalinist architecture of the Soviet Union, as seen in some pavilions of the All-Soviet Exhibition Centre.\n\nNeo-Renaissance architecture, because of its diversity, is perhaps the only style of architecture to have existed in so many forms, yet still common to so many countries.\n\n"}

Originating from ancient Rome, it continued for almost five centuries. Roman portraiture is characterised by unusual realism and the desire to convey images of nature in the high quality style often seen in ancient Roman art. Some busts even seem to show clinical signs. Several images and statues made in marble and bronze have survived in small numbers. Roman funerary art includes many portraits such as married couple funerary reliefs, which were most often made for wealthy freedmen rather than the patrician elite. \n\nPortrait sculpture from the Republican era tends to be somewhat more modest, realistic, and natural compared to early Imperial works. A typical work might be one like the standing figure \"A Roman Patrician with Busts of His Ancestors\" (c. 30 B.C.).\n\nBy the imperial age, though they were often realistic depictions of human anatomy, portrait sculpture of Roman emperors were often used for propaganda purposes and included ideological messages in the pose, accoutrements, or costume of the figure. Since most emperors from Augustus on were deified, some images are somewhat idealized. The Romans also depicted warriors and heroic adventures, in the spirit of the Greeks who came before them.\n\nThe origin of the realism of Roman portraits may be, according to some scholars, because they evolved from wax death masks. These death masks were taken from bodies and kept in a home altar. Besides wax, masks were made from bronze, marble and terracotta. The molds for the masks were made directly from the deceased, giving historians an accurate representation of typically Roman features.\n\nIn the days of the Republic, full-size statues of political officials and military commanders were often erected in public places. Such an honor was provided by the decision of the Senate, usually in commemoration of victories, triumphs and political achievements. These portraits were usually accompanied by a dedicatory inscription. If the person commemorated with a portrait was found to have committed a crime, the portrait would be destroyed.\n\nDevelopment of the Roman portrait was associated with increased interest in the individual, with the expansion of the social circle portrayed. At the heart of the artistic structure of many Roman portraits is the clear and rigorous transfer of unique features of the model, while still keeping the general style very similar. Unlike the ancient Greek portraits that strived for idealization (the Greeks believed that a good man must be beautiful), Roman portrait sculpture was far more natural and is still considered one of the most realistic samples of the genre in the history of art.\n\nRoman portraiture of the Imperial period includes works created throughout the provinces, often combining Greek, Roman, and local traditions, as with the Fayum mummy portraits.\n\n"}

Scenic designers design sets and scenery that aim to support the overall artistic goals of the production.\n\nA designer looks at the details searching for evidence through research to produce conceptual ideas that’s best toward supporting the content and values with visual elements. The subject of, “How do we generate creative ideas?” is a very legitimate question.

To have an attitude toward learning, seeking, and engaging in creativity and to be willing to be adventurous, inquisitive and curious. Our imagination is highly visual.

{"id": "19984951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19984951", "title": "The Death of Actaeon", "text": "The Death of Actaeon\n\nThe Death of Actaeon is a late work by the Italian Renaissance painter Titian, painted in oil on canvas from about 1559 to his death in 1576 and now in the National Gallery in London. It is very probably one of the two paintings the artist stated he had started and hopes to finish (one of which he calls \"Actaeon mauled by hounds\") in a letter to their commissioner Philip II of Spain during June 1559. However, most of Titian's work on this painting possibly dates to the late 1560s, but with touches from the 1570s. Titian seems never to have resolved it to his satisfaction, and the painting apparently remained in his studio until his death in 1576. There has been considerable debate as to whether it is finished or not, as with other very late Titians, such as the \"Flaying of Marsyas\", which unlike this has a signature, perhaps an indication of completion. \nIt is a sequel of Titian's work \"Diana and Actaeon\" showing the story's tragic conclusion, which approximately follows the Roman poet Ovid's account in the \"Metamorphoses\": after Actaeon surprised the goddess Diana bathing naked in the woods, she transformed him into a stag and he was attacked and killed by his own hounds.\n\nBoth paintings belong to a group of large-scale mythological paintings inspired by the \"Metamorphoses\" and referred to by Titian himself as ‘poesie’, the visual equivalent of poetry, which he began producing for Philip II of Spain in 1551 and which also include \"Danaë\" (many versions, Philip's in the Prado, Madrid), \"Venus and Adonis\" (private collection, London, but also other versions), \"Perseus and Andromeda\" (Wallace Collection, London), \"The Rape of Europa\" (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston), \"Diana and Actaeon\" and \"Diana and Callisto\" (shared by National Gallery of Scotland with NG London). However, as \"The Death of Actaeon\" was never delivered to Philip, it is not always counted in the series.\n\nOvid's account does not include Diana herself pursuing Actaeon, or shooting at him, though in some other classical accounts she does chase him. She seems to have just loosed an arrow, but there is no sign of the arrow in the painting, nor is the bowstring visible. The goddess does not have her attribute of the small crescent in her hair that Titian's other two depictions in the \"poesie\" do, which troubled one early critic.\n\nThere were ancient reliefs and engraved gems showing either Diana hunting with dogs, or Actaeon being attacked by his dogs, and a few Renaissance works, but the subject was rare, and \"it may be that Titian had never seen another painting or other representation of the subject.\"\n\nIt was probably still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576, and presumably sold in Venice by his heirs. It probably belonged to the famous Venetian collection of Bartolomeo della Nave, most of which was bought for James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton (then still a Marquess) in 1636-38, one of the great collectors of the period in Britain. Hamilton's brother-in-law, Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh (as he later became) was English ambassador to Venice, and helped to arrange the purchase. A list of available paintings he sent Hamilton includes \"A Diana shooting Adonis in forme of a Hart not quite finished\" by Titian.\n\nHamilton, who was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War, was captured and executed in 1649 after losing the Battle of Preston to Oliver Cromwell. This, like most of his collection, was bought by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1647 to 1656. The painting appears (looking rather lighter in tone than today) in David Teniers the Younger's painting of the \"Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm\" (1651, now Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), as well as his different versions of the subject now in Petworth House and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.\n\nThe archduke seems to have given it to Queen Christina of Sweden, whose route into exile went through the Spanish Netherlands, before she settled in Rome. It does not appear in an inventory of her collection made in Antwerp in 1656, but is in one made in Rome in 1662 or 1663. After her death it eventually passed, with much of her collection, into the Orleans Collection in Paris in 1721. Like most of the collection, it was bought by a consortium in London after the French Revolution, and then sold in 1798 to Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet for the modest sum of 200 guineas, the price no doubt reflecting that it was considered by Hume and others as unfinished. Hume described it as \"a great painting never finished but quite beautiful\".\n\nHume was the author of the first monograph on Titian, published in 1829, and \"was especially appreciative of preliminary sketches by Venetian artists (or what he believed to be such).\" His collection passed by descent to Adelbert Brownlow-Cust, 3rd Earl Brownlow, who was made a Trustee of the National Gallery in 1897. By 1914 Brownlow needed to raise some cash, and offered the gallery this painting for £5,000 and a portrait by Anthony van Dyck for £10,000, writing \"I only ask from the Gallery what I consider to be a very low price because I am anxious to see them in the gallery\".\nThe van Dyck was bought but the Titian declined, because of the opposition of another trustee, Alfred de Rothschild, who declared that the Titian \"would not fetch £5 at Christie's\". Other trustees may have been in favour but the \"difficult character\" of Rothschild, who was hoped to be planning a bequest to the gallery, might have resigned if the purchase was made. In 1919 the painting was bought via the dealers Colnaghi's for £60,000 by Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood (then Viscount Lascelles), giving \"the measure of Rothschild's expertise and of Brownlow's generosity\". \n\nIn 1971, when the painting had already been on loan to the National Gallery for ten years, the trustees of the 7th Earl sold the painting at Christie's for £1,680,000. It was bought by the dealer Julius Weitzner and swiftly resold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu for £1,763,000. At this point an export licence was needed, and the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art suspended granting one for one year to allow a British buyer to match this price. The public campaign in 1971 to buy it for the United Kingdom was one of the great successes of Martin Davies's directorship of the National Gallery, despite Davies's own lukewarm enthusiasm for the painting. It was eventually purchased in 1972 (as catalogue number NG6420) with £1,000,000 from the gallery's funds and a special Treasury grant matching other donations pound for pound; these included £100,000 from the Art Fund and £50,000 from the Pilgrim Trust, the rest raised by a public appeal, then a great innovation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34898622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34898622", "title": "Urban Light", "text": "Urban Light\n\nUrban Light (2008) is a large-scale assemblage sculpture by Chris Burden located at the Wilshire Boulevard entrance to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The 2008 installation consists of restored street lamps from the 1920s and 1930s. Most of them once lit the streets of Southern California.\n\n\"Urban Light\" is composed of 202 street lamps arranged in a near grid. The lamps mostly came from the streets of Southern California, including Hollywood, Glendale, and Anaheim, with some from Portland, Oregon. There are 16 different streetlight models represented, many of which were commissioned for particular neighborhoods and streets. The Broadway Rose, the largest and most ornate of the models, is represented by six lamps. The style was found in downtown Los Angeles; a few can still be seen on Sixth Avenue between Olive and Flower Streets. The sculpture's glass globes are of three general shapes: round, acorn, and cone. The 309 LED bulbs are solar powered and switch on from dusk until dawn, governed by an astronomical timer. \n\nWriting in the \"Los Angeles Times\", Susan Freudenheim described the restored lamps as displaying \"elaborate floral and geometric patterns\" at the base, with \"fluted shafts and glass globes that cap them...meticulously cleaned, painted and refurbished to create an exuberant glow.\"\n\nBurden viewed his sculpture as a formal entry way to the museum on Wilshire Boulevard: \"I've been driving by these buildings for 40 years, and it's always bugged me how this institution turned its back on the city.\"\n\nBurden first began collecting street lamps in December 2000 without a specific work in mind, and continued collecting them for the next seven years. He purchased his first two lamps at the Rose Bowl Flea Market at $800 each after they were pointed out by curator Paul Schimmel's son Max. The vendor, Jeff Levine, had been restoring the lamps by salvaging parts and later sold Burden more of his collection. Burden purchased others from contractor and collector Anna Justice, who was instrumental in the restoration of sandblasting, recasting missing parts, rewiring to code, and then painting a uniform grey. As Burden's collection grew, the ground around his Topanga Canyon studio became littered with parts, which the artist referred to as \"lamp carcasses\". \n\nIn late 2003, Burden discussed installing a hundred of the lamps at the Gagosian Gallery in New York, but the gallery eventually balked at the cost. While he later sent 14 lamps to an exhibition in London, his goal was to keep as much of his then 150-piece collection together as possible. To that end, he invited visitors to view the street lamps outside his studio, where he had installed them in dense rows on two sides of the building. Among the prospective purchasers in mid-2006 was The MAK Museum for Applied Art in Vienna and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, represented by its new director, Michael Govan. He visited the studio at twilight, and from the driveway, saw the lights lit and concluded that the installation would be a perfect fit. Govan was followed by Andrew M. Gordon, a Goldman Sachs executive who would later become chairman of the museum's board. Gordon approved the purchase through his family foundation for an undisclosed price.\n\n\"Urban Light\" was preceded by Sheila Klein's \"Vermonica\" (1993)\",\" which placed 25 Los Angeles street lamps in a parking lot at the corner of Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevards. \n\nThe \"Urban Light\" installation took place amid changes to the LACMA campus, which included a new building, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, and two new open spaces. The sculpture dominates one of them, a forecourt located between Wilshire Boulevard and LACMA's entry pavilion.\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" critic Christopher Hawthorne gave the arrangement a mixed review, describing \"Urban Light\" as \"a kind of pop temple, deftly straddling the lines between art and architecture and between seriousness and irony.\" \"It's also a joy to walk through, but there's no getting around the fact that it turns what might have been an actual public square along Wilshire—a space defined from day to day by the people using it—into an outdoor room for one sizable and very insistent piece of art.\" Hawthorne also argued that \"Urban Light\" was the first of four large-scale installations at LACMA in which Michael Govan challenged and undermined \"the polite axial symmetry of the master plan he inherited from\" architect Renzo Piano and his patrons. Those installations also include Tony Smith's black aluminum sculpture, called \"Smoke\", that fills the atrium of the Ahmanson Building, a palm garden by Robert Irwin installed along the edge of the Resnick Pavilion, and, just north, Michael Heizer's \"Levitated Mass\". \n\nAlthough \"Urban Light\" fills what had been Renzo Piano's planned \"public square\" space, it nevertheless succeeded where the empty public space dismally failed. K. M. Williamson, social ecologist and director of Public Art in Public Places, saw \"Urban Light\" as not reducing the plaza space but instead fundamentally redefining it and enlivening it. Michael Govan believed that \"Urban Light\" imparted a \"feeling of walking through an ancient temple\", one that echos the Greco-Roman temple facades of many East Coast museums. Those facades \"are really faux; they’re neoclassical...and here [Burden has] assembled an honest-to-goodness Los Angeles temple made of local materials, in our time.\" ,\n\nSince its 2008 installation, \"Urban Light\" has become an extremely popular attraction. According to Public Art in Public Places, \"Urban Light\" has become the most visited, photographed and well-known public artwork in Southern California. Director Ivan Reitman was one of the first filmmakers to incorporate the public artwork in a motion picture, using the location for a scene in his film \"No Strings Attached\". Echoing Burden's own view, he called the artwork \"an extraordinary beacon\" that \"lights up a desperate part of Wilshire that felt almost abandoned at night.\" \"Urban Light\" was featured in the Tori Amos video \"Maybe California\" and the film \"Valentine's Day\". The work appeared in a Guinness commercial and in a \"Vanity Fair\" article featuring cast members of the television series \"Glee\", as well as in numerous amateur photos posted online. LACMA itself has featured the work as part of its own promotional efforts, including a 3D public service announcement preceding the film \"Megamind\". In 2014, the sculpture was used in a dance scene in VH1's \"Hit the Floor\". \n\nThe first known selfie taken at the sculpture was shot four days after the work opened and was posted to Flickr. The sculpture has its own hashtag: #urbanlight. While not rented out as a wedding site, \"Urban Light\" has been the setting for many vows.\n"}
{"id": "35872960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35872960", "title": "Vollard Suite", "text": "Vollard Suite\n\nThe Vollard Suite is a set of 100 etchings in the neoclassical style by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, produced from 1930-37. Named for the art dealer who commissioned them, Ambroise Vollard (1866-1939), the suite is in a number of museums, and individual etchings from the suite are collectible. More than 300 sets were created, but many were broken up and the prints sold separately.\n\nIn 1930 Picasso was commissioned to produce the etchings by the art dealer and publisher Ambroise Vollard in exchange for paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne..\n\nPicasso worked extensively on the set in the spring of 1933, and completed the suite in 1937. It took a further two years for the printmaker Roger Lacourière to finish printing the 230 full sets, but the death of Vollard in 1939 and the Second World War meant that the sets only started coming onto the art market in the 1950s.\n\nA 1971 exhibition of the suite in Madrid was attacked by a paramilitary group, the Guerrilleros del Christo Rey (Warriors of Christ the King) who tore the pictures and poured acid over the prints. The group attacked things associated with Spanish exiles like Picasso who aligned themselves with the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nA spinning residential building in Brazil was named Suite Vollard after the suite.\n\nA complete set is owned by the National Gallery of Australia and a complete set was acquired by the British Museum in 2011 after a donation of £1 million from financier Hamish Parker, a director of Mondrian Investment Partners. The donation was in memory of Parker's father, Major Horace Parker. It had been the British Museum's ambition to own the set and the acquisition was described by the museum's director, Neil MacGregor, as \"one of the institution's most important acquisitions of the past 50 years\".\n\nThe works are not based on a literary source, and are not titled, although according to the Fundación Juan March, \"Some of the themes have a remote origin in Honoré de Balzac’s short story \"Le Chef-d’oeuvre inconnu\" (The Unknown Masterpiece, 1831), which greatly impressed Picasso. It tells the story of a painter’s efforts to capture life itself on canvas through the means of feminine beauty\". The works are inscribed by Picasso with the year month and day that he drew the image. Writing in the \"Daily Telegraph\" Richard Dorment claims that as Picasso took such a long time to create the suite, \"the imagery and the emotional register of the prints constantly shifts to reflect Picasso's erotic and artistic obsessions, marital vicissitudes, and the darkening political situation in Europe...In the years Picasso worked on the series, fascism spread through Europe, and civil war erupted in Spain. These anxieties also found their way into the Vollard Suite, so that by the time you reach the end of the show and the last images of the blind minotaur, you feel that you are in a different emotional universe from the sunlit arcadia you encountered at the show’s beginning\".\n\nThe suite begins with prints exploring the theme of the sculptor's studio, Picasso's mistress, Marie-Thérèse Walter, is portrayed as a model lying in the arms of a bearded sculptor. Picasso had recently been inspired by Marie-Thérèse to create a series of monumental bronze heads in the neoclassical style. Picasso had also recently been commissioned by the publisher Albert Skira in 1928 to create original intaglio prints for his translation of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", which appeared in 1931.\n\nDorment comments that a minotaur appears, joining in scenes of bacchic excess, but the minotaur is transformed from a gentle lover and bon vivant into a rapist and devourer of women, reflecting Picasso's turbulent relationships with Marie-Thérèse and his wife Olga. In a third transformation, the minotaur becomes pathetic, blind and impotent, he wanders by night, led by a little girl with the features of Marie-Thérèse. The final three prints from the suite are portraits of Vollard.\n\nPicasso learned new techniques of etching during the suite, from relatively simple line etchings, through burin, dry point, aquatinting and sugar aquatinting learnt through in his workshop, this enabled him to achieve more painterly effects. Most of the prints were completed to Picasso's satisfaction in a single state, but others, especially the erotic compositions, exist in several states, fourteen in one case.\n\n\n\n"}
