Rippon presented radio and television news programmes in South West England before moving to BBC One's \"Nine O'Clock News\", becoming a regular presenter in 1975. She was the first female journalist permanently to present the BBC national television news.\n\nRippon appeared on a Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976, presented the first two series of \"Top Gear\" and also presented \"Come Dancing\". She was a presenter on, and co-founder of, breakfast television franchisee TV-am. In the 1990s, she moved to radio, presenting daily news programmes for LBC Newstalk between 1990 and 1994, and appeared on Channel 4's \"The Big Breakfast\" as a stand-in newsreader. She presented the BBC broadcast of the United Kingdom Ballroom Championships at the Bournemouth International Centre in 1991.\n\nRippon has written fourteen books, toured with a production of \"Anything Goes\" and presented a segment of BBC One's \"The One Show\".\n\nSince 2009, she has co-presented the BBC consumer show \"Rip Off Britain\" with Gloria Hunniford and Julia Somerville and since 2013, she has co-hosted \"Holiday Hit Squad\" on the BBC alongside Helen Skelton and Joe Crowley.\n\nRippon was born in Plymouth, Devon, into a working-class family. Her father, John, was a Royal Marine; she first saw him in 1947 when he returned from World War II. Rippon's Scottish mother, Edna, worked at a fine china company called Lawley's and was also a seamstress. She attended Public Secondary School, Coburg Street in Plymouth.\n\nAfter leaving school at 17, Rippon joined the photographic office of the \"Western Morning News\" and worked for the \"Sunday Independent\", and later, BBC local radio and Westward Television as an editor.\n\nWhen she was 21, Rippon began her television career at BBC South West in Plymouth in 1966, before becoming a reporter for BBC TV news. Rippon first presented a national news programme on BBC2 in 1974. For a fortnight, she replaced newsreader Richard Baker – who was on holiday – on BBC One's \"Nine O'Clock News\", and was offered a permanent newsreading role on that programme in 1975. Rippon was called by newspapers the first female television newsreader. However, ITN's Barbara Mandell predated her, having first appeared on the second night of ITV in 1955; Nan Winton was the first female BBC newsreader in 1960, and Mary Marquis had already been BBC Scotland's main newsreader for a few years. Rippon was the first female journalist to read the news regularly on national television.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Guardian\", she said: \"You just become an automated autocue reader and if you've half a brain you want an opportunity to use it. When I read the Nine O'Clock News, I kept my brain active by working on programmes like \"Antiques Roadshow\" (which she briefly hosted in 1979), \"Top Gear\" and \"In the Country\".\" Rippon was a guest in the 1976 Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show, first appearing behind a BBC newsdesk, then emerging to perform a high-kicking dance routine. Her appearance was so popular she made a cameo appearance in the following year's show, in which she was revealed to be one of a chorus line. Rippon later presented the long-running show \"Come Dancing\".\n\nIn 1977, Rippon hosted the Eurovision Song Contest at the Wembley Conference Centre in London. She was the first presenter of BBC television's \"Top Gear\", presenting the motoring programme from 1977 to 1979. Rippon appeared briefly on TV-am following its launch in 1983. After a much publicised exit from TV-am (with most of its other founder presenters), she worked as an Arts and Entertainments correspondent for WHDH-TV (then known as WNEV) in Boston, Massachusetts for a brief period. Rippon co-presented the BBC's coverage of the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981 and BBC One's coverage of the 1979 UK general election results. In the mid-1980s, she hosted the quiz show, \"Masterteam\" on BBC One, and hosted ITV's revival of the panel game \"What's My Line?\" from 1989 to 1990. She also became a regular presenter on BBC Radio 2, often sitting in for Jimmy Young and presenting a seasonal Friday night show from 1986 to 1989.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994, she presented \"Angela Rippon's Morning Report\", a daily radio news programme on LBC Newstalk, and, later, \"Angela Rippon's Drivetime\". She was a stand-in newsreader on Channel 4's The Big Breakfast until 2002. In 2005, Rippon co-hosted a series of \"Sun, Sea and Bargain Spotting\" for BBC 2 and in April 2006, she toured the UK as a cast member of the musical \"Anything Goes\". In 2007, she became a presenter on \"Cash in the Attic\", a BBC One daytime television programme broadcast where presenters meet members of the general public, who seek out valuables and antiques to be sold at auction, in their homes.\n\nIn 2010, Rippon appeared for one night on the ITV show \"Dancing on Ice\" as a judge, covering for Robin Cousins and returned to the show as one of 16 participants in the sixth season on 9 January 2011, with her professional partner, Canadian ice skater Sean Rice. In March 2011, she appeared with Lenny Henry, Samantha Womack and Reggie Yates in a BBC documentary to raise funds for Comic Relief. It was called \"Famous, Rich and in the Slums\", and showed four celebrities travelling to Kibera in Kenya, Africa's largest slum. In 2011 she joined the One Show, presenting a 5-minute slot called \"Rippon's Britain\". On 19 November 2011, Rippon appeared on Children in Need, performing alongside BBC newsreaders Sian Williams, Susanna Reid, Sophie Raworth, and Emily Maitlis in a special one-off edition of \"Strictly Come Dancing\". In the same month she worked briefly on BBC Radio 5 Live as a stand-in presenter on the \"Double Take\" programme.\n\nRippon joined the BBC again, as a co-presenter on the BBC One show \"Holiday Hit Squad\" in 2013, alongside Joe Crowley and Helen Skelton. The show returned for a second series in March 2014.\n\nIn 2014, Rippon co-hosted the ITV Saturday night entertainment series \"Amazing Greys\" alongside Paddy McGuinness. The show lasted for just one series. In April 2016, she co-presented the two-part BBC One series \"How to Stay Young\".\n\nIn 2018, Rippon was a co-presenter of live coverage of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for Channel Seven (Australia) alongside Michael Usher and Melissa Doyle.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Rippon wrote a series of children's books about a character called \"Victoria Plum\" that was published by Purnell and Sons. Victoria Plum was a tree fairy in \"the Great Wood\". Merchandise and a Christmas annual were released following the second series. In 1982, she wrote a book \"Mark Phillips: The Man and His Horses\", about the Princess Royal's then husband. Rippon has since written keep-fit guides for older people, including \"Stay Active, Stay Supple, Stay Healthy\".\n\nRippon is patron of the Old Time Dance Society. In 2010, she attended the society's 25th Anniversary Ball of the Year. In 2000, Rippon was appointed Chair of English National Ballet. After several years of involvement, she resigned in late 2003 following complaints and briefings about her leadership style, which was described as \"schoolmistressy\" and \"imperious\".\n\nIn 1967 at the age of 22, she married Christopher Dare, an engineer. They separated in 1989, divorcing later. They had no children.\n\nShe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in 1981 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\nRippon was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours.\n\nRippon was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from Plymouth University in 2012.\n\nShe was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to dementia care in her role as development lead with Dementia Friendly Communities.\n\n"}

Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past is a 2016 non-fiction book by American author and essayist Chuck Klosterman.\n\nThe premise of the book is that most of what we believe is likely to be wrong, but to avoid delusions in our perceptions, Klosterman advises us to “think about the present as if it were the distant past.”\n\nKlosterman examines such things as: the history of scientific theories such as gravity, our perception of historical literary geniuses, our interests in entertainment and professional sports—as background examples to challenge confidence in our contemporary perceptions, to try to detect how those perceptions might be mistaken. In a series of what have been called thought experiments, various topics (literary greats, multiverses, time, dreams, democracy, television shows, sports) are analyzed under “Klosterman’s Razor”: the concept that \"the best hypothesis is the one that reflexively accepts its potential wrongness to begin with.”\n\n\"But What If We're Wrong?\" reached \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in the Culture category.\n\nJim Holt wrote in \"The New York Times\" that while he was \"never bored\" and Klosterman's goals were admirable, the book left him \"exasperated,\" Holt asserting the book lacked rigor and treated profound questions with glibness: \"My hackles raised, I argued inwardly with the author on every page.\"\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" indicated the book is \"full of intelligence and insights\" and \"makes readers think,\" challenging our beliefs \"with jocularity and perspicacity.\"\n\n\"Publisher's Weekly\" acknowledged the book was \"pop philosophy\" but noted parts were based on interviews of \"heavyweights,\" adding that Klosterman's humor and curiosity \"propel the reader through the book.\"\n\nIn \"The Oregonian,\" Douglas Perry recognized the impossibility of the predicting the future, explaining why the book includes \"endless streams of maybes, coulds and ifs, all leading to a shrug\"—while affirming that Klosterman is \"good company throughout the long, fruitless expedition.\"\n\nIn the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,\" Will Ashton asserted the book to be Klosterman's most wide-reaching accomplishment to date and confirmed the writer’s \"signature wit,\" but wrote that Klosterman appeared \"overwhelmed\" by the challenge, leaving \"an ongoing sense (Klosterman) is grasping here.\"\n\nIn a review for the online literary magazine \"The Millions,\" Ashley Perez argued, \"Klosterman allows himself to be swayed, and allows himself to be wrong. The ebb and flow of opinions shows how difficult Klosterman’s project is, and how charming a writer he can be.\"\n\nThe book's cover, designed by Paul Sahre, was judged among the year's best, as chosen by the art director of \"The New York Times Book Review\".\n\n"}

Canvas prints are often used in interior design, with stock images, or customised with personal photographs. Canvas prints are intended to reproduce the look of original oil or acrylic paintings on stretched canvas.\n\nReproductions of original artwork have been printed on canvas for many decades using offset printing. Since the 1990s, canvas print has been associated with either dye sublimation or inkjet print processes (often referred to as repligraph or giclée respectively). The canvas print material is generally cotton or plastic based poly canvas, often used for the reproduction of photographic images.\n\nModern large format printers are capable of printing onto canvas rolls measuring or more. Modern examples of inkjet-based printers capable of printing directly onto canvas are the HP Designjet z6100 and the Epson Ultra Chrome 11880. Printers such as these allow artists and photographers to print their works directly onto canvas media, with slow print speed settings available to ensure print quality is not diminished.\n\nPrinted canvas for wall art is generally of a weight around 400 gsm and should be 100% pure white cotton for a more exact colour representation.\n\nAfter the image is printed, the canvas is trimmed to size and glued, or stapled to traditional stretcher bars, or a wooden panel and displayed in a frame, or as a gallery wrap. The frames are usually constructed from solid pine and underpinned for added strength. A print that is designed to continue round the edges of a stretcher frame once gallery-wrapped is referred to as full-bleed. This can be used to enhance the three-dimensional effect of the mounted print.\n\nCanvas prints are commonly used in home decor, either chosen by professional interior designers, or by the homeowner. Canvas prints can be mass produced and available through high street retailers and home improvement stores, such as IKEA, or personalized one-off canvas prints produced from the individual's own photograph, or drawing, usually uploaded via the Internet, or ordered direct from social media websites.\n\nCanvas prints are often used as a cheaper alternative to framed artwork as there is no glazing required and the pine frame is not usually visible, so do not need to be varnished, or treated.\n\n"}
{"id": "48402268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48402268", "title": "Causal loop", "text": "Causal loop\n\nA causal loop in the context of time travel or the causal structure of spacetime, is a sequence of events (actions, information, objects, people) in which an event is among the causes of another event, which in turn is among the causes of the first-mentioned event. Such causally-looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a billiard ball striking its past self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine \"before\" its past self enters it, giving its past self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike its past self the very glancing blow that altered its path.\n\nBackwards time travel would allow for causal loops involving events, information, people or objects whose histories form a closed loop, and thus seem to \"come from nowhere.\" The notion of objects or information which are \"self-existing\" in this way is often viewed as paradoxical, with several authors referring to a causal loop involving information or objects without origin as a \"bootstrap paradox\", an \"information paradox\", or an \"ontological paradox\". The use of \"bootstrap\" in this context refers to the expression \"pulling yourself up by your bootstraps\" and to Robert A. Heinlein's time travel story \"By His Bootstraps\". The term \"time loop\" is sometimes used to refer to a causal loop, but although they appear similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting.\n\nAn example of a causal loop paradox involving information is given by Everett: suppose a time traveler copies a mathematical proof from a textbook, then travels back in time to meet the mathematician who first published the proof, at a date prior to publication, and allows the mathematician to simply copy the proof. In this case, the information in the proof has no origin. A similar example is given in the television series \"Doctor Who\" of a time-traveler who copies Beethoven's music from the future and publishes it in Beethoven's time in Beethoven's name. Everett gives the movie \"Somewhere in Time\" as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and gives her the same watch that she will later give to him.\n\nKrasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes - information or an object looping through time - are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws. He does not find this paradoxical, and attributes problems regarding the validity of time travel to other factors in the interpretation of general relativity.\n\nA 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and Igor Novikov labeled such items without origin as \"Jinn\", with the singular term \"Jinnee\". This terminology was inspired by the Jinn of the Quran, which are described as leaving no trace when they disappear. Lossev and Novikov allowed the term \"Jinn\" to cover both objects and information with reflexive origin; they called the former \"Jinn of the first kind\", and the latter \"Jinn of the second kind\". They point out that an object making circular passage through time must be identical whenever it is brought back to the past, otherwise it would create an inconsistency; the second law of thermodynamics seems to require that the object become more disordered over the course of its history, and such objects that are identical in repeating points in their history seem to contradict this, but Lossev and Novikov argued that since the second law only requires disorder to increase in \"closed\" systems, a Jinnee could interact with its environment in such a way as to regain lost order. They emphasize that there is no \"strict difference\" between Jinn of the first and second kind. Krasnikov equivocates between \"Jinn\", \"self-sufficient loops\", and \"self-existing objects\", calling them \"lions\" or \"looping or intruding objects\", and asserts that they are no less physical than conventional objects, \"which, after all, also could appear only from either infinity, or a singularity.\"\n\nThe term \"predestination paradox\" is used in the \"Star Trek\" franchise to mean \"a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past.\" This use of the phrase was created for a sequence in a 1996 episode of \"\" titled \"Trials and Tribble-ations\", although the phrase had been used previously to refer to belief systems such as Calvinism and some forms of Marxism which encouraged followers to strive to produce certain outcomes while at the same time teaching that the outcomes were predetermined. Smeenk and Morgenstern use the term \"predestination paradox\" to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past, but ends up helping to cause that same event.\n\nA self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be \"truly\" known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. Predestination does not necessarily involve a supernatural power, and could be the result of other \"infallible foreknowledge\" mechanisms. Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in Newcomb's paradox. A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play \"Oedipus Rex\", in which Oedipus becomes the king of Thebes, whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling. The movie \"12 Monkeys\" heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.\n\nGeneral relativity permits some exact solutions that allow for time travel. Some of these exact solutions describe universes that contain closed timelike curves, or world lines that lead back to the same point in spacetime. Physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov discussed the possibility of closed timelike curves in his books in 1975 and 1983, offering the opinion that only self-consistent trips back in time would be permitted. In a 1990 paper by Novikov and several others, \"Cauchy problem in spacetimes with closed timelike curves\", the authors suggested the \"principle of self-consistency,\" which states that \"the only solutions to the laws of physics that can occur locally in the real Universe are those which are globally self-consistent.\" The authors later concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.\n\nPhysicist Joseph Polchinski argued that one could avoid questions of free will by considering a potentially paradoxical situation involving a billiard ball sent back in time. In this situation, the ball is fired into a wormhole at an angle such that, if it continues along its course, it will exit in the past at just the right angle to hit its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Thorne referred to this problem as \"Polchinski's paradox\". Two students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies. In the revised scenario, the ball would emerge from the future at a different angle than the one that had generated the paradox, and delivers its past self a glancing blow instead of knocking it completely away from the wormhole. This blow changes its trajectory by just the right degree, meaning it will travel back in time with the angle required to deliver its younger self the necessary glancing blow. Echeverria and Klinkhammer actually found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and Robert Forward showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could actually be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions.\n\nEcheverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne published a paper discussing these results in 1991; in addition, they reported that they had tried to see if they could find \"any\" initial conditions for the billiard ball for which there were no self-consistent extensions, but were unable to do so. Thus it is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven. The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.\n\nNovikov's views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov's self-consistency principle as an ad hoc solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel. Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops, but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity.\n\nPhysicist David Deutsch shows in a 1991 paper that quantum computation with a negative delay—backwards time travel—could solve NP problems in polynomial time, and Scott Aaronson later extended this result to show that the model could also be used to solve PSPACE problems in polynomial time. Deutsch shows that quantum computation with a negative delay produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning. Researchers published in 2014 a simulation validating Deutsch's model with photons. However, it was shown in an article by Tolksdorf and Verch that Deutsch's CTC (closed timelike curve, aka causal loop) fixed point condition can be fulfilled to arbitrary precision in any quantum system described according to relativistic quantum field theory on spacetimes where CTCs are excluded, casting doubts on whether Deutsch's condition is really characteristic of quantum processes mimicking CTCs in the sense of general relativity.\n"}

The man beats and sexually assaults Mei-hsun, and leaves her for dead. Mei-hsun survives, and is able to identify her assailant in a police lineup, resulting in his execution by firing squad, an event which Mei-hsun witnesses in a dream the moment it occurs. The rapist's death does little to comfort Mei-hsun, who is plagued by nightmares and visions of the man, and is horrified to learn that she is pregnant with what she assumes is his child. Mei-hsun tries to have an abortion in secret, but as the procedure is about to begin, an invisible force attacks the doctor and nurse, and flings the former out a window.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to get rid of the baby, which she is convinced is evil, Mei-hsun throws herself down a flight of stairs, though this merely causes the child to be born a month premature. While Mei-hsun's husband, nanny, and friends all believe he is normal, the baby is in fact supernatural, and torments his mother when no one else is around to witness his actions. One day, to try and put Mei-hsun at ease, the nanny suggests she take the child to a temple where exorcisms are performed, in attempt to rid the boy of whatever being she believes is corrupting him.

The nanny's young son visits Mei-hsun to ask if she has seen his mother, who Mei-hsun goes to look for, eventually stumbling onto her hidden body. Mei-hsun rushes home, where the killer murders a visiting female friend and her suitor, impaling the latter with a knife, and causing the former to bleed uncontrollably before asphyxiating her and crushing her head. The killer attacks Mei-hsun, who manages to fend him off long enough for her husband and a police officer to appear, and banish the undead madman by drenching him in wine, and shooting him several times.\n\n\nA one and a half out of five was awarded by \"Hysteria Lives!\", which wrote that \"Devil Returns\" was woefully derivative of a number of superior works (the most prominent being \"Halloween\") and a \"schizophrenic\" film, albeit one where \"the last half an hour is pretty suspenseful – if obviously shamelessly unoriginal\". The Bloody Pit of Horror gave \"Devil Returns\" two and a half stars out of five, stating \"The first hour is very solid, the acting is good and the film effectively builds suspense throughout\" and \"The premise deals with post traumatic stress and postpartum depression, the fears of a first time mother that she won't be able to connect with her child and other female/mother centered issues in an insightful and interesting way...\" before concluding that the film's shift into being a \"Halloween\" rip-off for the final third was \"abrupt, random and basically ruins what had come before it\".\n"}

Hal David wrote the lyrics. The song was Warwick's biggest international hit to that point, selling several million copies worldwide and winning Warwick her first Grammy Award. David's lyrics tell the story of a native of San Jose, California who, having failed to break into the entertainment field in Los Angeles, is set to return to her hometown.\n\nThe song was released on the 1968 RIAA Certified Gold album \"Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls\". \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\" was issued as the follow-up single to the double-sided hit \"(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls\"/ \"I Say a Little Prayer\" in April 1968. It became Warwick's third consecutive Top Ten song in the closing months of 1967 and into 1968, punctuating the most successful period of Warwick's recording career.\n\nThe song peaked at #8 in the UK, Ireland, and Canada. It also charted highly in France, Italy, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, Lebanon, Japan,and many other countries throughout the world. The single was one of the most successful of Warwick's international hits, selling over 3,500,000 copies worldwide. The flip-side of the single, \"Let Me Be Lonely,\" also penned by Bacharach/David, charted in the Billboard Hot 100 as well and became one of many double-sided hits for Warwick.\n\nBacharach had composed the music for the song before David wrote its lyrics. David had a special interest in San Jose, having been stationed there while in the Navy.\n\nThe track was the last Dionne Warwick single to be recorded at New York City's Bell Studios. It features a prominent use of bass drum, played by session musician Gary Chester. The engineer was Ed Smith, who devised the famous introduction to the tune by directly attaching a mike to the head of Chester's bass drum.\n\nWarwick did not like \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose,\" and she had to be convinced to record it. In a May 1983 interview with \"Ebony,\" she said: \"It's a dumb song and I didn't want to sing it. But it was a hit, just like [her recent Top Ten hit] 'Heartbreaker' is. I'm happy these songs were successful, but that still doesn't change my opinion about them.\" Though she still does not like it, the song remains one of Warwick's most popular chart selections, and she still includes it in almost every concert she performs.\n\nWarwick won her first Grammy, the 1969 Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, for \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose.\" She told \"Jet\" in May 2002 that winning this award was the overall highlight of her career.\n\n\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\" has also been recorded by Connie Francis, Rita Reys, The George Shearing Quintet, The Avalanches, The Baja Marimba Band, The Temptations and The Supremes together, Neil Diamond, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Nancy Sinatra, The Starlite Orchestra, De-Phazz, Jim O'Rourke, Bossa Rio (1970), Trijntje Oosterhuis, Paper Dolls, and the Carpenters, among others.\n\nNon-English renderings of the song include \"Le chemin pour San José\" by Ginette Reno – #8 Québécois hit for the year 1968 – , \"Heiß ist der Kaffee in San José\" by Corry Brokken, \"Snart Så Stiger Solen Upp Igen\" by Siw Malmkvist and \"La route du bonheur\" by .\n\nWarwick re-recorded the song as a salsa-flavored collaboration with Celia Cruz and the Pete Escovedo Orchestra for her 1998 album \"Dionne Sings Dionne.\"\n\nThe song has been recorded on various Burt Bacharach tribute albums, including by Medeski Martin & Wood on \"Great Jewish Music: Burt Bacharach\" (1997), by both Yazz and Dionne Warwick (separately) on \"Tribute to Burt Bacharach & Hal David\" (2002), by Trijntje Oosterhuis on \"The Look of Love\" (2006), and by Kahimi Karie on \"All Kinds of People ~Love Burt Bacharach~\" (2010).\n\nIn 1977, Maureen McCormick, Geri Reischl & Susan Olsen performed the song during a medley on an episode of \"The Brady Bunch Variety Hour\".\n\n"}

{"id": "58563173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58563173", "title": "Drowned Land", "text": "Drowned Land\n\nDrowned Land is a 1912 oil sketch by the 20th-century Canadian painter Tom Thomson.\n\nThe work was painted in the fall of 1912, possibly on the Mississagi River. It depicts an area desolate and damaged due to flooding via damming. It was purchased by the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto in 1937 and has remained in the collection ever since. It was produced near the beginning of Thomson's short art career, just as he was beginning a transition from commercial art into a full-time painting.\n\nIn 1912 after Thomson's initial experience of visiting Algonquin Park, he and his colleague William Broadhead went on a two month expedition up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting began to be apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, has been lost due to two canoe spills experienced during the trip, the first spill being on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids.\n\nThomson's art director while at Grip Ltd., Albert Robson, identified \"Drowned Land\" as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip. Art historian David Silcox has suggested that it was perhaps painted on Lake Scugog or near Owen Sound. It was painted with oil on paper, which was further embossed with canvas texture, all mounted on plywood. A similar support was used for \"View Over a Lake: Shore with Houses\".\n\nThe painting came right as Thomson was transitioning from commercial art into fine art and indicates his innate talent. It is similar to a sketch from the previous year, \"Near Owen Sound\", in terms of colour, drawing and texture. On display is a \"camera-like precision\" and his incredible attention to detail in capturing scenes. Indeed, David Silcox has speculated that \"Drowned Land\" as well as other paintings may have been completed with a photograph as a memory aid given their \"uncanny precision.\" The painting is especially notable for its skill of composition and precision, especially when compared with some of Thomson's other work from this period, such as \"The Canoe\" and \"Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park\". These early sketches show how he had not yet established his own form of expression, being particularly dark and dreary compared to his later work. The subject of desolation was uncommon for the time, having not been seen in Canadian painting since the works of topographers in the early-nineteenth century.\n\nThe painting, like others from this period, depicts ideal fishing territory that Thomson likely would have enjoyed. Many of his paintings were overt in their depictions of the lumber industry, including dams, pointers, alligators and drives, the presence of industry being on his mind from early on. \"Drowned Land\" however is more subtle as it does not directly display any logging equipment. Instead, it presents the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. A hopeful recovering growth is apparent in the distance behind the skeleton of trees in the foreground.\n\nThe painting was purchased by the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1937 from Mellors Fine Arts in Toronto and has remained in the AGO's collection ever since. It has been on display in several exhibitions since its purchase.\n\n\n"}

Vincent was a bank examiner and relocated to Washington D.C. in 1930. Her mother suffered from undiagnosed and untreated depression, this led to a challenging marriage, and ultimately a divorce. Vincent gained custody of all children and moved to Tuckahoe, New York.\n\nAfter graduating from high school Evelyn joined the Women's Army Corps, and was stationed in Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nShe later moved to Baldwin, New York and was employed as a bookkeeper at the Kitab Engraving Company on Pearl Street. She met her fiance Barry Rhodes, a college student discharged from the United States Army Air Force.\n\nOn April 30, 1947, McHale took a train from New York to Easton, Pennsylvania to visit Rhodes. The next day, after leaving Rhodes' residence, she returned to New York City and went to the Empire State Building where she jumped from the 86th floor observatory. A security guard was reportedly standing approximately ten feet from her just before she jumped.\n\nRhodes did not notice any indication of suicide before McHale left. Detective Frank Murray found her suicide note in a black pocketbook next to her neatly folded cloth coat over the observation deck wall which read:\n\nHer body was identified by her sister, Helen Brenner.\n\nIn accordance with her wishes, she was cremated with no memorial, service or grave.\n\nHer then-fiance, Barry became an engineer before moving South, he died in Melbourne, Florida on October 9th 2007, unmarried.\n\nThe photo of her body, taken by Robert Wiles, has been compared to the photograph by Malcolm Wilde Browne of the self-immolation of Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức who burned himself alive at a busy Saigon road intersection on June 11, 1963, which is widely regarded as among the most iconic suicide photographs. Ben Cosgrove of \"Time\" described the photo as \"technically rich, visually compelling and ... downright beautiful\". Cosgrove described her body as \"resting, or napping, rather than ... dead\" and appears as if she is \"daydreaming of her beau\".\n\nAndy Warhol used Wiles' photo in one of his prints entitled \"Suicide (Fallen Body)\".\n\nHer picture was also used on the cover of Saccharine Trust's album \"Surviving You, Always\", released in 1984 by SST Records.\n\nDavid Bowie's 1993 video for the single \"Jump They Say\" includes a recreation of the image, with the singer splayed atop a smashed car.\n\nThe cover of the 1995 album \"Gilt\" by the Tucson band Machines of Loving Grace uses a color photo that recreates the original image.\n\nThe shot is also referenced at the start of Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video.\n"}

Kill! is a 1965 American exploitation film directed by Russ Meyer and co-written by Meyer and Jack Moran. It follows three go-go dancers who embark on a spree of kidnapping and murder in the California desert.\n\nThe film is known for its violence, provocative gender roles, and eminently quotable \"dialogue to shame Raymond Chandler\". It is also remembered for the performance of star Tura Satana, whose character Richard Corliss called \"the most honest, maybe the one honest, portrayal in the Meyer canon\". \"Faster, Pussycat!\" was a commercial and critical failure upon its initial release, but it has since become widely regarded as an important and influential film.\n\nThree wild, uninhibited go-go dancers—Billie, Rosie, and Varla, dance at a club before racing their sports cars across the California desert. They play a high-speed game of chicken on the salt flats and encounter a young couple, Tommy and Linda, out to run a time trial. After breaking Tommy's neck in a fight, Varla kidnaps and drugs Linda.\n\nIn a small desert town, they stop at a gas station where they see a wheelchair-bound old man and his muscular, dim-witted son. The gas station attendant tells the women that the old man was crippled in a railway accident, “going nuts\" as a result, and that he received a large settlement of money that is hidden somewhere around his decrepit house in the desert. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the old man, and the three women follow him back to the ranch, with their captive in tow.\n\nAt the ranch they encounter the old man, his younger son (who they learn is called \"The Vegetable\" due to his feeblemindedness) and his elder son, Kirk. The group all have lunch together, and Billie taunts Rosie when Varla leaves with Kirk, hoping to seduce him into revealing the location of the money. Linda subsequently escapes the drunken Billie and runs away into the desert. The old man and the younger son pursue in their truck. The younger son catches Linda and seems about to assault her, but he collapses in tears as Varla and Kirk arrive. Kirk finally acknowledges his father’s lecherous nature and the old man’s hold over his younger brother, and he vows to have his younger brother institutionalized. He tries to take the hysterical Linda into town in the truck, but the old man says that he has thrown away the keys, and Kirk and Linda set out across the desert on foot.\n\nVarla drives back to the house and tells Billie and Rosie that they should kill the men and the girl to cover up Linda’s kidnapping and the murder of her boyfriend. Billie refuses, but as she walks away, Varla throws a knife into her back just as the old man and his younger son arrive. Rosie and Varla hit the old man with their car, killing him and knocking over his wheelchair to reveal the money hidden inside. Rosie is stabbed and killed by the younger son while trying to retrieve the knife from Billie's body. Varla tries to ram him into a wall with her car, injuring him. She drives off in the truck and overtakes Kirk and Linda, chasing them into a gully. Varla and Kirk fight hand-to-hand. She gets the better of him until Linda hits her with the truck, and she dies. Kirk and Linda drive off together in the truck.\n\nThe film was a follow up to an earlier Meyer movie. \"`We had just done a film called \"Motorpsycho\", which was about three bad boys, and it had gone through the roof. So I said, `Well, let's do one with three bad girls'.\"\n\nThe screenplay is credited to Jack Moran from an original story by Russ Meyer. The first draft was titled \"The Leather Girls\" and was written over a brief four-day period by Moran, who also collaborated with Meyer on \"Common Law Cabin\" and \"Good Morning and... Goodbye!\". The screenplay went through a second working title—\"The Mankillers\"—and had already begun production when the sound editor, Richard S. Brummer, came up with the now-immortal final title. Although neither Moran nor Meyer overtly cited any prior works as inspiration, the plot has been called a “loose remake of \"The Desperate Hours\", or possibly \"The Virgin Spring\"\" by one prominent film critic and a “pop-art setting of Aeschylus's \"Eumenides\"” by at least one classical scholar.\nHaji had worked with Meyer on \"Motor Psycho\". She recommended Tura Satana to him.\n\nLori Williams later said \"Russ didn't want to hire me because he didn't think I had a big enough bust! I said I could use pushups in my bra, which I did. He didn't know whether it would work, but then in rehearsals he finally said okay. I kind of did my part like a cartoon, like the rest of the film, bigger than life.\"\n\n\"Faster, Pussycat!\" had a modest budget of about $45,000 and was shot in black and white in order to save money. \n\nThe film began shooting at the Pussycat Club, a strip club in Van Nuys, before moving on to the California desert later that night. The film's early racing scene was shot on the dry salt flats of Lake Cunniback, the gas station scene was filmed in the town of Randsburg, and the scenes at the Old Man's house at Ollie Peche's Musical Wells Ranch outside the town of Mojave. During principal photography, the cast and crew stayed at the Adobe Motel in Johannesburg.\n\nMeyer, who got his start making movies while serving in the US Army's 166th Signal Photographic Company during World War II, had a reputation for running strictly regimented film shoots with a small crew composed largely of former Army buddies. Actor Charles Napier, who appeared in five of Meyer's films, said that \"Working with Russ Meyer was like being in the first wave landing in Normandy during World War II.\" Meyer considered the \"Faster, Pussycat!\" shoot no different, saying \"It was the usual thing with me. It's like being in the military. Everybody has to get up and do their jobs to get things together, and that's it.\" Meyer's directorial style and the rules he imposed upon cast and crew caused clashes with his equally strong-willed star, Tura Satana. \n\nThere was also friction between Susan Bernard and her director and co-stars, much of which they attributed to the presence of her mother on the set (necessitated by Bernard being a sixteen-year-old minor at the time). Bernard has said in interviews that she was truly scared of Satana, and some have thought that this contributed to her performance as a frightened kidnapping victim.\n\nAccording to Sutana, \"Everybody [on set] did everything from moving props to marking scenery and marking spots where we had to be in the next take. I had to stage the fight scenes because nobody else knew how to do them, and so literally when I did the fight scenes, I really had to pick up each and every one of those guys and carry them through in order for them to look realistic. Basically I had to lay one guy on the floor because he was afraid he was going to get hurt. A lot of it actually had to be done in reverse,so try to imagine doing a fight scene that way.\"\nThe film's title song, \"Faster Pussycat!\", was performed by California band, the Bostweeds. The lyrics were written by Rick Jarrard and the music was written and sung by Lynn Ready, who formed the Bostweeds and sang leads. The track was never released commercially, but it did appear in February 1966 as a promotional-only 45 single without a B-side.\n\n\"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" premiered in Los Angeles on August 6, 1965. Atypically for a Meyer film, it was a box office failure upon its initial release. \n\n\"When it first came out, it was not successful,\" said Meyer. \"At the time, people didn't understand that women could have a relationship with other women.\"\nIt was generally dismissed as an exploitative \"skin flick\" by the few critics who took any note of it at all. John L. Wasserman of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", for example, reviewed a double bill of \"Faster, Pussycat!\" and \"Mudhoney\" in April 1966, saying that \"\"Pussycat\" has the worst script ever written, and \"Mudhoney\" is the worst movie ever made.\"\nIn the years since, the film has been regarded more favorably, gaining in both commercial and critical stature. As of April 2015 it holds a \"fresh\" rating on film review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, with 73% (nineteen of twenty-six) critic reviews positive. In his review of the film's 1995 re-release, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars. Noted feminist film critic B. Ruby Rich said that when she first saw \"Faster, Pussycat!\" in the 1970s she \"was absolutely outraged that [she'd] been forced to watch this misogynist film that objectified women and that was really just short of soft-core porn.\" Upon viewing it again in the early 1990s, however, she \"just loved it\" and wrote a piece in the \"Village Voice\" reappraising the film and discussing her change in opinion.\n\n\"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" is currently number 674 on the tenth edition of the often-referenced \"1,000 Greatest Films\" list and 377th on the \"Sight & Sound\" \"Greatest Films Poll.\" It is frequently mentioned on lists of the best B movies and cult movies of all time.\n\nThe film has also been influential on other filmmakers. Writer-director John Waters stated in his book \"Shock Value\" that \"\"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" is, beyond a doubt, the best movie ever made. It is possibly better than any film that will be made in the future.\" He later said on its re-release that \"it ages like fine wine.\" Music video director Keir McFarlane acknowledged that a scene in the video for the Janet Jackson song \"You Want This\" was a direct homage to \"Faster, Pussycat!\", showing the Porsche-driving singer and her female companions driving circles around two men in the desert. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino referenced the movie and thanked Meyer in the credits of his film \"Death Proof\", and it was reported in \"Variety\" in 2008 that Tarantino was interested in remaking \"Faster, Pussycat!\"\n\nThe film \"Bitch Slap\" was inspired by the films of Russ Meyer, especially \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" Much like this film, it follows three female characters who travel to a desert location to find a treasure. The film's opening and closing credits even have clips from \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" in a montage of clips from other B movies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9505271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9505271", "title": "Finian's Rainbow (film)", "text": "Finian's Rainbow (film)\n\nFinian's Rainbow is a 1968 Irish-American musical film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Fred Astaire and Petula Clark. The screenplay by E. Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy is based on their 1947 stage musical of the same name. It is a fantasy about an Irishman and his daughter who steal a leprechaun's magic pot of gold and emigrate to the United States, where they become involved in a dispute between rural landowners and a greedy, racist U.S. Senator. \n\nThe film was nominated for several Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and a Writers Guild of America Award.\n\nA lovable rogue named Finian McLonergan absconds from his native Ireland with a pot of gold secreted in a carpetbag, plus his daughter Sharon in tow. His destination is Rainbow Valley in the mythical state of Missitucky, where he plans to bury his treasure in the mistaken belief that, given its proximity to Fort Knox, it will multiply.\n\nHot on his heels is the leprechaun Og, desperate to recover his stolen crock before he turns human. Among those involved in the ensuing shenanigans are Woody Mahoney, a ne'er-do-well dreamer who woos Sharon; his mute sister Susan, who expresses herself in dance; Woody's good friend and business partner Howard, an African-American botanist determined to grow mentholated tobacco; and bombastic Senator Billboard Rawkins, who wears his bigotry as if it were a badge of honor.\n\nComplications arise when Rawkins, believing there is gold in Rainbow Valley, attempts to seize the land from the people who live there and makes some racial slurs while doing so. Sharon furiously wishes he would turn black himself—and, because she is in close proximity to the magical pot of gold, which is capable of granting three wishes, Rawkins does exactly that. Sharon is accused of witchcraft and sentenced to be burned at the stake unless she can make him white again.\n\nTo save his daughter, Finian tries to find the pot of gold, unaware Susan has discovered it and hidden it under a bridge. Rawkins eventually meets Og, who quickly realizes what caused the senator's change in race. Seeing that the change of skin color did nothing to alter his hateful racism, Og casts a spell to make Rawkins more open-minded.\n\nSharon and Woody gather in the barn to be married, but the sheriff, his deputies, and the local district attorney barricade the doors and promise to burn the building down if Rawkins is not white by sunrise. Og meets with Susan on the bridge under which the gold is hidden and wishes she could talk. When she begins to speak, Og realizes they are standing above the gold.\n\nFor a brief moment he considers using the final wish to retain his leprechaun status and return to the fairy world. After a passionate kiss, he decides he would rather remain human with Susan and wishes for Rawkins to be white once more. Thanks to the now-empty crock helping to put out an accidental fire that was about to consume the barn, Howard's mentholated tobacco experiments become successful, ensuring financial success for all the poor people of Rainbow Valley, both white and black. Sharon and Woody are wed, and bid a fond farewell to Finian, who leaves Rainbow Valley in search of his own rainbow.\n\nSince the musical was such a success on stage, there had always been interest in filming it. MGM was interested in filming it in 1948 as a vehicle for Mickey Rooney. However, Harburg set the price for the rights at $1 million and wanted creative control.\n\nFor a time, a German company wanted to make it. In 1954, the Distributors Corporation of America wanted to make it as an animated film. A soundtrack of the score was recorded by several stars, but the film was not completed. In 1958, the authors of the musical teamed with Sidney Buchman to produce the film independently but the film did not proceed.\n\nIn 1960, the rights were held by Marvin Rothenberg who wanted Michael Gordon to direct and Debbie Reynolds to star. It was announced the film would be budgeted at $2 million and be released by United Artists. However the film did not eventuate.\n\nHarburg stated in 1960 that he was told part of the reason it was so difficult to get a film version made was Hollywood was scared of fantasy musicals. Another reason was the McCarthyism of the period.\n\nIn 1965, Harold Hecht bought the film rights and hired Harburg and Saidy to write a script and some new songs. Hecht said he intended to film in nine months. \"This time we really mean business,\" said Harburg. \"We've gotten a substantial deal and participation in money and production. Up until now \"Finian\" has been making so much money on the road that we didn't want to kill the goose laying all those golden eggs. But you become more idealistic as you grow older and you tend to stop thinking about yourself.\"\n\nIn September 1966 Warner Bros. announced they had the rights and they would make a film produced by Joseph Landon and starring Fred Astaire, with the aim to get Tommy Steele as the leprechaun. The budget was expected to be $4 million.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola was signed as director in February 1967. Petula Clark then came on board as the female lead and Steele confirmed as the leprechaun, although Robert Morse had expressed interest.\n\nWarner Bros. had optioned the film rights to the stage musical, and they were on the verge of expiring. With \"Camelot\" having proven to be more costly than anticipated, and its commercial success still undetermined since it had not been released, Jack L. Warner was having second thoughts about another musical project, but when he saw Petula Clark perform on her opening night at the Coconut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, he knew he had found the ideal Sharon.\n\nHe decided to forge ahead and hoped for the best, despite his misgivings about having nearly-novice \"hippie\" director Francis Ford Coppola at its helm. Although Clark had made many films in the 1940s and 1950s in her native Great Britain, this would be her first starring role in ten years, and her first film appearance since rising to international fame with \"Downtown\" four years earlier.\n\nIt was known that Dick Van Dyke was considered to play the role of Finian, back in 1965, however, financial problems caused the filming to be postponed, and Van Dyke dropped out of consideration. (Source: \"The Films of Fred Astaire\")\n\nFred Astaire, whose last movie musical had been \"Silk Stockings\" eleven years earlier, and who had concentrated on his TV specials in the interim, was persuaded at the age of sixty-nine to return to the screen to portray the title character. Given his status as a screen legend and to accommodate his talents, the role was given a musical presence it had not had on stage, and he was given top rather than the original third billing.\n\nWhile a construction crew transformed more than nine acres of backlot into Rainbow Valley, complete with a narrow gauge railway, schoolhouse, general store, post office, houses, and barns, Coppola spent five weeks rehearsing the cast, and before principal photography began, a complete performance of the film was presented to an audience on a studio soundstage. In the liner notes she wrote for the 2004 Rhino Records limited, numbered edition CD release of the soundtrack, Clark recalls that old-Hollywood Astaire was befuddled by Coppola's contemporary methods of film-making and balked at dancing in \"a real field with cow dung and rabbit holes.\" Although he finally acquiesced to filming a sequence in the Napa Valley near Coppola's home, the bulk of the movie was shot on studio soundstages and the backlot, leaving the finished film with jarring contrasts between reality and make-believe.\n\nClark was nervous about her first Hollywood movie and particularly concerned about dancing with old pro Astaire. He later confessed he was just as worried about singing with her. The film was partially choreographed by Astaire's long-time friend and collaborator Hermes Pan, who was fired by Coppola during filming. \"Finian's Rainbow\" proved to be Astaire's last major movie musical, although he went on to dance with Gene Kelly during the linking sections of \"That's Entertainment, Part 2\".\n\nClark recalls that Coppola's approach was at odds with the subject matter. \"Francis... wanted to make it more real. The problem with \"Finian's Rainbow\" is that it's sort of like a fairy tale... so trying to make sense of it was a very delicate thing.\" Coppola opted to fall somewhere in the middle, with mixed results. Updating the story line was limited to changing Woody from a labor organizer to the manager of a sharecroppers' cooperative, making college-student Howard a research botanist, and a few minor changes to the lyrics in the Burton Lane-E. Y. Harburg score, such as changing a reference to Carmen Miranda to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Other than that, the plot remains firmly entrenched in an era that predates the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nBecause preview audiences found the film overly long, the musical number \"Necessity\" was deleted prior to its release, although the song remains on the soundtrack album. It can also be heard as background music, when Senator Rawkins first shows up in Rainbow Valley in his attempt to buy Finian out.\n\nIn August 2012, Clark told the BBC Radio 4 show The Reunion that she and her fellow cast members smoked marijuana during the filming of the movie. \"There was a lot of Flower Power going on,\" she said. \nReleased in major cities as a roadshow presentation complete with intermission, at a time when the popularity of movie musicals was on the wane, the film was dismissed as inconsequential by many critics, who found Astaire's obviously frail and aged appearance shocking and Steele's manic performance annoying. In the \"New York Times\", Renata Adler described it as a \"cheesy, joyless thing\" and added, \"there is something awfully depressing about seeing \"Finian's Rainbow\"... with Fred Astaire looking ancient, far beyond his years, collapsed and red-eyed... it is not just that the musical is dated... it is that it has been done listlessly and even tastelessly.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", on the other hand, thought it was \"the best of the recent roadshow musicals... Since \"The Sound of Music\", musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... \"Finian's Rainbow\" is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with as much fun as possible... it is the best-directed musical since \"West Side Story\". It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him look younger with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the \"New York Times\" review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken.\"\n\n\"Time Out London\" calls it an \"underrated musical... the best of the latter-day musicals in the tradition of Minnelli and MGM.\"\n\nHighly praised by all was Petula Clark, whom Ebert described as \"a surprise. I knew she could sing, but I didn't expect much more. She is a fresh addition to the movies: a handsome profile, a bright personality, and a singing voice as unique in its own way as Streisand's.\" John Mahoney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said she \"invites no comparisons, bringing to her interpretation of Sharon her own distinctive freshness and form of delivery.\" In the \"New York Daily News\", Wanda Hale cited her \"winsome charm which comes through despite a somewhat reactive role.\" Joseph Morgenstern of \"Newsweek\" said she \"looks lovely\" and \"sings beautifully, with an occasional startling reference to the phrasing and timbre of Ella Logan's original performance.\" \"Variety\" observed, \"Miss Clark gives a good performance and she sings the beautiful songs like a nightingale.\" Clearly, in the United States at least, Clark was known only as a singer, although she had appeared as an actress in British films since she was a child.\n\nThe film earned $5.1 million in rentals in North America.\n\nThe film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy but lost to \"Oliver!\" Petula Clark was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy but lost to Barbra Streisand in \"Funny Girl\"; Fred Astaire was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy but lost to Ron Moody in \"Oliver!\"; and Barbara Hancock was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture but lost to Ruth Gordon in \"Rosemary's Baby\".\n\nRay Heindorf was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Score – Adaptation or Treatment but lost to Johnny Green for Oliver! M.A. Merrick and Dan Wallin were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound but lost to Jim Groom for \"Oliver!\"\n\nE.Y. Harburg and Fred Saidy were nominated for Best Written American Musical by the Writers Guild of America.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nThe film was released on DVD on March 15, 2005. Presented in anamorphic widescreen format, it captures all of Astaire's footwork, most of which was unseen in the original release. It has audio tracks in English and French, with both the dialogue and songs translated into the latter language. Fluent in French, Clark was the sole cast member to record the foreign version.\n\nBonus features include commentary by Francis Ford Coppola, who focuses mostly on the film's shortcomings, a featurette on the world premiere on Finian's Rainbow, and the original theatrical trailer.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray on March 7, 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2621420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2621420", "title": "Frederic Clay", "text": "Frederic Clay\n\nFrederic Emes Clay (3 August 1838 – 24 November 1889) was an English composer known principally for his music written for the stage. Clay, a great friend of Arthur Sullivan's, wrote four comic operas with W. S. Gilbert and introduced the two men.\n\nWhile working as a civil servant in the Treasury department, Clay began composing seriously in the early 1860s. His first big success was \"Ages Ago\" (1869), a short comic opera with a libretto by W. S. Gilbert, for the small Gallery of Illustration. Other pieces with Gilbert and others followed, and Clay turned to composing full-time after his father died in 1873. That year, he composed a successful opera-bouffe version of \"The Black Crook\" for the Alhambra Theatre. Clay's last piece with Gilbert was \"Princess Toto\" (1875). He also composed two cantatas. His last two works were both successful operas composed in 1883, \"The Merry Duchess\" and \"The Golden Ring\". He then suffered a stroke that paralysed him at age 44.\n\nClay was born in Paris to English parents, James Clay (1804–1873), a member of parliament, and his wife, Eliza Camilla Woolrych. Clay was the fourth of six brothers and sisters. His father was celebrated as a player of whist and the author of a treatise on that subject, as well as an amateur composer. His mother also had a musical background, as her mother had been an opera singer. Clay was educated at home by private tutors in London, studying piano and violin, and then music composition under Bernhard Molique and, in 1863, with Moritz Hauptmann in Leipzig, Germany. He then worked as a civil servant in the Treasury department while also pursuing composing.\n\nAfter the death of his father in 1873, his inheritance enabled him to become a full-time composer. With the exception of some songs, hymns, instrumental pieces and two cantatas, his compositions were nearly all written for the stage. In the mid-1860s, Clay and his friend Arthur Sullivan became frequent guests at the home of John Scott Russell. By about 1865, Clay became engaged to Scott Russell's youngest daughter Alice, and Sullivan wooed the middle daughter Rachel. The Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, but he broke it off.\n\nClay wrote his first short play for the amateur stage in 1859 called \"'The Pirate's Isle\", and completed the short comic play \"Out of Sight\" the following year. His first professionally produced piece was an opera entitled \"Court and Cottage\", with a libretto by Tom Taylor, which was produced at Covent Garden Theatre in 1862. In 1865, for the same theatre, he composed another opera, the unsuccessful \"Constance\" (1865), with a libretto by Thomas William Robertson. With B. C. Stephenson, he wrote three pieces played by amateurs: \"The Pirate's Isle\", \"Out of Sight\" and \"The Bold Recruit\" (1868), and with W. S. Gilbert he wrote \"Ages Ago\" (1869) for Thomas German Reed's Gallery of Illustration. This piece ran for 350 performances and was revived several times. Clay introduced Gilbert to Arthur Sullivan during a rehearsal for \"Ages Ago\". \"The Bold Recruit\" was revived at a benefit by German Reed at the Gallery of Illustration in 1870 as a companion piece to \"Ages Ago\".\n\nThese were followed by \"The Gentleman in Black\" (1870, also with Gilbert), \"In Possession\" (1871, also for German Reed), \"Happy Arcadia\" (1872, with Gilbert), \"Oriana\" (1873, with a libretto by James Albery), \"Green Old Age\" and \"Cattarina\" (both 1874, with libretti by Robert Reece), \"Princess Toto\" (1875, the last collaboration between Clay and Gilbert), and \"Don Quixote\" (1876). \"Ages Ago\" (a one-act piece) and \"Princess Toto\" (a three-act comic opera) are considered to be among Clay's most tuneful and attractive works. \"The Times\" wrote that the music of \"Princess Toto\" \"is probably surpassed by no modern English work of the kind for gaiety and melodious charm.\"\n\nClay also composed part of the score for the spectacle \"Babil and Bijou\" (1872, also for German Reed) and the successful opera-bouffe version of \"The Black Crook\" (1873 based on the same source material as the earlier American musical of the same name and starring Kate Santley), both of which were produced with success at the Alhambra Theatre. He also furnished incidental music for a revival of \"Twelfth Night\".\n\nClay's two cantatas were \"The Knights of the Cross\" (1866) and \"Lalla Rookh\" (containing perhaps Clay's best-known song, \"I'll sing thee songs of Araby\" and also \"Still this golden lull\"), which was produced successfully at the Brighton Festival in 1877. Clay had difficulty finding work in London and moved to America. There he met with only mixed success and returned to England in 1881. His last works were \"The Merry Duchess\" (1883) at the Royalty Theatre, starring Kate Santley and in which Louie Henri also appeared, and \"The Golden Ring\" (starring Marion Hood) (1883), both with words by G. R. Sims. The latter was written for the reopening of the Alhambra, which had been burned to the ground the year before. These shows were both successful and showed an artistic advance upon Clay's previous work.\n\nClay's friend, Sir Arthur Sullivan, wrote: \"In all his works Clay showed a natural gift of graceful melody and a feeling for rich harmonic colouring. [His songs included] 'She wandered down the mountain side,' 'Long ago' and 'The Sands of Dee'\". Other songs that achieved popularity are \"Gipsy John\" and \"Who Knows\".\n\nAfter conducting the second performance of \"The Golden Ring\" in December 1883, Clay suffered a stroke that paralysed him and cut short his productive life. In 1889 at the age of 51, he was found drowned in his bath at the home of his sisters in Great Marlow, England, presumably a suicide. He was buried in Brompton cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "144048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144048", "title": "Happening", "text": "Happening\n\nA happening is a performance, event, or situation meant to be considered art, usually as performance art. The term was first used by Allan Kaprow during the 1950s to describe a range of art-related event or multiple events.\n\nHappenings occur anywhere and are often multi-disciplinary, with a nonlinear narrative and the active participation of the audience. Key elements of happenings are planned but artists sometimes retain room for improvisation. This new media art aspect to happenings eliminates the boundary between the artwork and its viewer.\n\nIn the late 1960s, perhaps due to the depiction in films of hippie culture, the term was used much less specifically to mean any gathering of interest from a pool hall meetup or a jamming of a few young people to a beer blast or fancy formal party.\n\nAllan Kaprow first coined the term \"happening\" in the spring of 1959 at an art picnic at George Segal's farm to describe the art pieces that were going on. The first appearance in print was in Kaprow's famous \"Legacy of Jackson Pollock\" essay that was published in 1958 but primarily written in 1956. \"Happening\" also appeared in print in one issue of the Rutgers University undergraduate literary magazine, \"Anthologist\". The form was imitated and the term was adopted by artists across the U.S., Germany, and Japan. Jack Kerouac referred to Kaprow as \"The Happenings man\", and an ad showing a woman floating in outer space declared, \"I dreamt I was in a happening in my Maidenform brassiere\".\n\nHappenings are difficult to describe, in part because each one is unique and completely different from one another. One definition comes from Wardrip-Fruin and Montfort in \"The New Media Reader\", \"The term 'Happening' has been used to describe many performances and events, organized by Allan Kaprow and others during the 1950s and 1960s, including a number of theatrical productions that were traditionally scripted and invited only limited audience interaction.\" Another definition is, \"a purposefully composed form of theatre in which diverse alogical elements, including nonmatrixed performing, are organized in a compartmented structure\". However, Canadian theatre critic and playwright Gary Botting, who himself had \"constructed\" several happenings, wrote in 1972: \"Happenings abandoned the matrix of story and plot for the equally complex matrix of incident and event.\"\n\nKaprow was a student of John Cage, who had experimented with \"musical happenings\" at Black Mountain College as early as 1952. Kaprow combined the theatrical and visual arts with discordant music. \"His happenings incorporated the use of huge constructions or sculptures similar to those suggested by Artaud,\" wrote Botting, who also compared them to the \"impermanent art\" of Dada. \"A happening explores negative space in the same way Cage explored silence. It is a form of symbolism: actions concerned with 'now' or fantasies derived from life, or organized structures of events appealing to archetypal symbolic associations.\" A \"Happening\" of the same performance will have different outcomes because each performance depends on the action of the audience. In New York City especially, \"Happenings\" became quite popular even though many had neither seen nor experienced them.\n\nHappenings can be a form of participatory new media art, emphasizing an interaction between the performer and the audience. In his \"Water\", Robert Whitman had the performers drench each other with coloured water. \"One girl squirmed between wet inner tubes, ultimately struggling through a large silver vulva.\" Claes Oldenburg, best known for his innovative sculptures, used a vacant house, his own store, and the parking lot of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Los Angeles for \"Injun\", \"World's Fair II\" and \"AUT OBO DYS\". The idea was to break down the fourth wall between performer and spectator; with the involvement of the spectator as performer, objective criticism is transformed into subjective support. For some happenings, everyone present is included in the making of the art and even the form of the art depends on audience engagement, for they are a key factor in where the performers' spontaneity leads.\n\nLater happenings had no set rules, only vague guidelines that the performers follow based on surrounding props. Unlike other forms of art, Happenings that allow chance to enter are ever-changing. When chance determines the path the performance will follow, there is no room for failure. As Kaprow wrote in his essay, \"'Happenings' in the New York Scene\", \"Visitors to a Happening are now and then not sure what has taken place, when it has ended, even when things have gone 'wrong'. For when something goes 'wrong', something far more 'right,' more revelatory, has many times emerged\".\n\nKaprow's piece \"18 Happenings in 6 Parts\" (1959) is commonly cited as the first happening, although that distinction is sometimes given to a 1952 performance of \"Theater Piece No. 1\" at Black Mountain College by John Cage, one of Kaprow's teachers in the mid-1950s. Cage stood reading from a ladder, Charles Olson read from another ladder, Robert Rauschenberg showed some of his paintings and played wax cylinders of Édith Piaf on an Edison horn recorder, David Tudor performed on a prepared piano and Merce Cunningham danced. All these things took place at the same time, among the audience rather than on a stage. Happenings flourished in New York City in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Key contributors to the form included Carolee Schneemann, Red Grooms, Robert Whitman, Jim Dine \"Car Crash\", Claes Oldenburg, Robert Delford Brown, Lucas Samaras, and Robert Rauschenberg. Some of their work is documented in Michael Kirby's book \"Happenings\" (1966). Kaprow claimed that \"some of us will become famous, and we will have proven once again that the only success occurred when there was a lack of it\". In 1963 Wolf Vostell made the Happening \"TV-Burying\" at the Yam Festival in coproduction with the Smolin Gallery and in 1964 the Happening \"You\" in Great Neck, New York.\n\nDuring the summer of 1959, Red Grooms along with others (Yvonne Andersen, Bill Barrell, Sylvia Small and Dominic Falcone) staged the non-narrative \"play\" \"Walking Man\", which began with construction sounds, such as sawing. Grooms recalls, \"The curtains were opened by me, playing a fireman wearing a simple costume of white pants and T-shirt with a poncholike cloak and a Smokey Stoverish fireman's helmet. Bill, the 'star' in a tall hat and black overcoat, walked back and forth across the stage with great wooden gestures. Yvonne sat on the floor by a suspended fire engine. She was a blind woman with tin-foil covered glasses and cup. Sylvia played a radio and pulled on hanging junk. For the finale, I hid behand a false door and shouted pop code words. Then the cast did a wild run around and it ended\". Dubbing his 148 Delancey Street studio The Delancey Street Museum, Grooms staged three more happenings there, \"A Garden\", \"The Burning Building\" and \"The Magic Trainride\" (originally titled \"Fireman's Dream\"). No wonder Kaprow called Grooms \"a Charlie Chaplin forever dreaming about fire\". On the opening night of \"The Burning Building\", Bob Thompson solicited an audience member for a light, since none of the cast had one, and this gesture of spontaneous theater recurred in eight subsequent performances.\nThe Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama staged nude happenings during the late '60s in New York City.\n\nHappenings emphasize the organic connection between art and its environment. Kaprow supports that \"happenings invite us to cast aside for a moment these proper manners and partake wholly in the real nature of the art and life. It is a rough and sudden act, where one often feels \"dirty\", and dirt, we might begin to realize, is also organic and fertile, and everything including the visitors can grow a little into such circumstances.\" \nHappenings have no plot or philosophy, but rather is materialized in an improvisatory fashion. There is no direction thus the outcome is unpredictable. \"It is generated in action by a headful of ideas...and it frequently has words but they may or may not make literal sense. If they do, their meaning is not representational of what the whole element conveys. Hence they carry a brief, detached quality. If they do not make sense, then they are acknowledgement of the sound of the word rather than the meaning conveyed by it.\"\n\nDue to the convention's nature, there is no such term as \"failure\" which can be applied. \"For when something goes \"wrong\", something far more \"right\", more revelatory may emerge. This sort of sudden near-miracle presently is made more likely by chance procedures.\" As a conclusion, a happening is fresh while it lasts and cannot be reproduced.\n\nRegarding happenings, Red Grooms has remarked, \"I had the sense that I knew it was something. I knew it was something because I didn't know what it was. I think that's when you're at your best point. When you're really doing something, you're doing it all out, but you don't know what it is.\"\n\nThe lack of plot as well as the expected audience participation can be likened to Augusto Boal's Theater of the Oppressed, which also claims that \"spectator is a bad word\". Boal expected audience members to participate in the theater of the oppressed by becoming the actors. His goal was to allow the downtrodden to act out the forces oppressing them in order to mobilize the people into political action. Both Kaprow and Boal are reinventing theater to try to make plays more interactive and to abolish the traditional narrative form to make theater something more free-form and organic.\n\nAllan Kaprow's and other artists of the 1950s and 1960s that performed these Happenings helped put \"new media technology developments into context\". The Happenings allowed other artists to create performances that would attract attention to the issue they wanted to portray. Currently happenings today can be found with Jazz in a whole new way through the artistic collaboration of renowned musicians American saxophonist David Liebman, French jazz pianist Jean-Marie Machado, and multimedia visual artist Barbara Januszkiewicz. their group Jazz Vision Trio is using new media techniques and real-time improvising with jazz and art.\n\nIn 1959 the French artist Yves Klein first performed Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle. The work involved the sale of documentation of ownership of empty space (the Immaterial Zone), taking the form of a cheque, in exchange for gold; if the buyer wished, the piece could then be completed in an elaborate ritual in which the buyer would burn the cheque, and Klein would throw half of the gold into the Seine. The ritual would be performed in the presence of an art critic or distinguished dealer, an art museum director and at least two witnesses.\n\nIn 1960, Jean-Jacques Lebel oversaw and partook in the first European Happening \"L'enterrement de la Chose\" in Venice. For his performance there – called \"Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process\" – Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped 'cadaver' rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an 'executioner' while a 'service' was read consisting of extracts from the French décadent writer Joris-Karl Huysmans and le Marquis de Sade. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the 'body' – which was a mechanical sculpture by Jean Tinguely – was ceremonially slid into the canal.\n\nPoet and painter Adrian Henri claimed to have organized the first happenings in England in Liverpool in 1962, taking place during the Merseyside Arts Festival. The most important event in London was the Albert Hall \"International Poetry Incarnation\" on June 11, 1965, where an audience of 7,000 people witnessed and participated in performances by some of the leading \"avant-garde\" young British and American poets of the day (see British Poetry Revival and Poetry of the United States). One of the participants, Jeff Nuttall, went on to organize a number of further happenings, often working with his friend Bob Cobbing, sound poet and performance poet.\n\nIn Tokyo in 1964, Yoko Ono created a happening by performing her \"Cut Piece\" at the Sogetsu Art Center. She walked onto the stage draped in fabric, presented the audience with a pair of scissors, and instructed the audience to cut the fabric away gradually until the performer decides they should stop.\nIn Belgium, the first happenings were organized around 1965–1968 in Antwerp, Brussels and Ostend by artists Hugo Heyrman and Panamarenko.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the first documented happening took place in 1961, with the Dutch artist and performer Wim T. Schippers emptying a bottle of soda water in the North Sea near Petten. Later on, he organized random walks in the Amsterdam City Centre. Provo organized happenings around the little statue \"Het Lieverdje\" on the Spui, a square in the centre of Amsterdam, from 1966 till 1968. Police often raided these events.\n\nIn the 1960s Joseph Beuys, Wolf Vostell, Nam June Paik, Charlotte Moorman, Dick Higgins, and HA Schult staged Happenings in Germany.\n\nIn Canada, Gary Botting created or \"constructed\" happenings between 1969 (in St. John's, Newfoundland) and 1972 (in Edmonton, Alberta), including \"The Aeolian Stringer\" in which a \"captive\" audience was entangled in string emanating from a vacuum cleaner as it made its rounds (similar to Kaprow's \"A Spring Happening\", where he used a power lawnmower and huge electric fan to similar effect); \"Zen Rock Festival\" in which the central icon was a huge rock with which the audience interacted in unpredictable ways; \"Black on Black\" held in the Edmonton Art Gallery; and \"Pipe Dream,\" set in a men's washroom with an all-female \"cast\".\n\nIn Australia, the Yellow House Artist Collective in Sydney housed 24-hour happenings throughout the early 1970s.\n\nBehind the Iron Curtain, in Poland, artist and theater director Tadeusz Kantor staged the first happenings starting in 1965. In the second half of 1970s painter and performer Krzysztof Jung ran the Repassage gallery, which promoted performance art in Poland. Also, in the second half of the 1980s, a student-based happening movement Orange Alternative founded by Major Waldemar Fydrych became known for its much attended happenings (over 10 thousand participants at one time) aimed against the military regime led by General Jaruzelski and the fear blocking the Polish society ever since the Martial Law had been imposed in December 1981.\n\nSince 1993 the artist Jens Galschiøt have made political happenings all over the world, in November 1993 he made the happening my inner beast where twenty sculptures were erected within 55 hours without the knowledge of the authorities all over Europe. Pillar of Shame is a series of Galschiøt's sculptures. The first was erected in Hong Kong on 4 June 1997, ahead of the handover from British to Chinese rule on 1 July 1997, as a protest against China's crackdown of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. On 1 May 1999, a Pillar of Shame was set up on the Zócalo in Mexico City. It stood for two days in front of the Parliament to protest the oppression of the region's indigenous people.\n\nThe non-profit, artist-run organization, iKatun, artist group, The Institute of Infinitely Small Things, has reflected the use of \"Happenings\" influence while incorporating the medium of internet. Their aim is one that \"fosters public engagement in the politics of information\". Their project entitled \"The International Database of Corporate Commands\" presents a scrutinizing look at the super-saturating advertisements slogans, and \"commands\" of companies. \"The Institute for Infinitely Small Things uses these commands to conduct research performances- performances in which we attempt to enact, as literally as possible, what the command tells us to do and where it tells us to do it. For example, a user may look at a long list of slogans on the website database section, and may submit, in text, his or her take on the most literal way to act out the slogan/ command. The iKatun team will then act out the slogan in a research-performance related way. This means of performance art draws on the collaboration of the web world and tangible reality to conduct a new, modern Happening.\n\nKaprow explains that happenings are not a new style, but a moral act, a human stand of great urgency, whose professional status as art is less critical than their certainty as an ultimate existential commitment. He argues that once artists have been recognized and paid, they also surrender to the confinement, rather the tastes of the patrons (even if that may not be the intention on both ends). \"The whole situation is corrosive, neither patrons nor artists comprehend their role...and out of this hidden discomfort comes a stillborn art, tight or merely repetitive and at worst, chic.\" Though the we may easily blame those offering the temptation, Kaprow reminds us that it is not the publicist's moral obligation to protect the artist's freedom, and artists themselves hold the ultimate power to reject fame if they do not want its responsibilities.\n\nArt and music festivals play a large role in positive and successful happenings. Some of these festivals include Burning Man and Oregon Country Fair. Along with the famous Allan Kaprow, Burning Man frowns on the idea of spectators and stresses the importance of everyone being involved to create something amazing and unique. Both parties embody the \"audience\" and instead of creating something to show the people, the people become involved in helping create something incredible and spontaneous to the moment. Both of these events are happenings that are recreated and special each year and are always new and organic. These events draw crowds of close to 50,000 people each year and reach more people than just the attendees with their messages and ideals.\n\n\n"}

It owns, leases, operates, has booking rights for and/or equity interests in a large number of U.S. entertainment venues.\n\nThe merger initially received regulatory approval in Norway and Turkey in 2009. In October 2009, the United Kingdom's Competition Commission provisionally ruled against the merger. On December 22, 2009, the Competition Commission reversed its decision and cleared the proposed merger. The United States Justice Department approved the merger on January 25, 2010, with some conditions to which both parties agreed.\n\nAs part of the agreement with governments to merge, Ticketmaster had to sell its ownership in its self-ticketing company, Paciolan, and Live Nation Entertainment was placed under a 10-year court order prohibiting it from retaliating against venues that choose to accept competitors' ticket-selling contracts, and it \"must allow venues that sign deals elsewhere to take consumer ticketing data with them\".\n\nIn addition, the new company had to license a copy of its ticketing software to two companies—Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) and either Comcast Spectacor or another \"suitable\" company—so that both companies could compete \"head-to-head\" with Ticketmaster for venues’ business. AEG was given the option after five years to buy the software, replacing it with something else, or partnering with another ticketing company.\n\nThe merger that formed the company was opposed by members of the United States Congress, business rivals, and the Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA), whose members include Google, Oracle, Microsoft, Yahoo, Intuit, and eBay.\n\nBruce Springsteen said the merger \"would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing\".\n\nIn a January 25, 2010 press release, the TicketDisaster.org group—a coalition of consumer rights and anti-trust groups—also issued the following statement about the proposed Live Nation-TicketMaster merger:\"Despite its \"monopoly-like dominance\" controlling 70 to 80 percent of all concert ticket sales, Ticketmaster is unabashedly seeking to grow its empire - all to the detriment of the average fan. Ticketmaster is now trying to dampen competition by merging with Live Nation, the nation's largest concert promoter and second largest primary ticket seller. That merger is coming under heavy fire from consumer and industry groups and Members of Congress, particularly because of the clear anti-consumer and anti-competitive effects. As the Department of Justice reaches the final round of reviewing this merger, only one question must be answered: will the merger lead to increased prices, poorer service, or less innovation?\"\n\nIn 2018, the United States Department of Justice launched an investigation following complaints that Live Nation had engaged in anti-competitive practices following the merger. AEG has alleged that Live Nation had pressured them into using Ticketmaster as a vender. If AEG had refused, they would have lost out on business. The allegations of antitrust violations have resulted in a re-examination of the merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. Much of the initial criticisms of the merger has been re-affirmed.\n\nIn June 2013, Live Nation, two other organizations and an engineer were charged with 13 charges under Ontario health and safety laws following the collapse of a stage at a Radiohead concert in 2012 that killed one crew member. Live Nation issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and vowing to \"vigorously defend\" itself. In September 2017, after several delays, the case was dropped under the Jordan ruling, which sets strict timelines on trials. On 30 November 2017, CBC reported that the chief coroner of Ontario, Dirk Huyer, will hold an inquest into Johnson's death.\n\nThe leadership team at Live Nation Entertainment consists of the following people: \n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS<br>\nGreg Maffei – Non-Executive Chairman of the Board<br>\nMark Carleton<br>\nPing Fu<br>\nDana Walden <br>\nAriel Emanuel<br>\nRobert Enloe<br>\nJeffrey Hinson<br>\nJimmy Iovine<br>\nJames Kahan<br>\nRandall Mays<br>\nMark Shapiro<br>\n\nIn June 2013, Live Nation Entertainment announced a joint venture with Insomniac Events, a promoter focused on electronic dance music. \n\nIn October 2013, Live Nation completed its acquisition of Voodoo Music & Arts Experience, one of the leading music festivals in New Orleans. \n\nIn 2014, Live Nation announced the launch of the Maverick group – a management company led by artist manager Guy Oseary.\nIn December 2014, Live Nation Entertainment acquired Austin-based live entertainment and artist management company C3 Presents.\n\nIn August 2015, Live Nation announced it would form Live Nation Germany, which would be created in partnership with German promoter Marek Lieberberg. Live Nation Germany also has oversight over Live Nation events in Austria and Switzerland. \n\nIn March 2016, Live Nation expanded its presence in South Africa with the acquisition of Big Concerts International, the country's leading concert promoter. \n\nIn April 2016, Live Nation completed a deal with Founders Entertainment to acquire a majority stake in the company, adding the Governors Ball Music Festival to Live Nation's festival portfolio. \n\nIn October 2016, Live Nation Entertainment bought AC Entertainment, a Knoxville Tennessee music company.\n\nIn January 2017, Live Nation Entertainment acquired a controlling interest in BottleRock Napa Valley Music Festival.\n\nIn February 2017, Live Nation Entertainment acquired a majority interest in Israeli promoter Blue Stone Entertainment.\n\nIn May 2018, Live Nation Entertainment acquired Rock in Rio Music Festival.\n"}
{"id": "5151456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5151456", "title": "Louis Quinze", "text": "Louis Quinze\n\nThe Louis XV style or Louis Quinze is a style of architecture and decorative arts which appeared during the reign of Louis XV of France. From 1710 until about 1730, the period known as the Regency, it was largely an extension of the \"Style Louis XIV\" of his great-grandfather and predecessor, Louis XIV of France. From about 1730 until about 1750, it became more original, decorative and exuberant, in what was known as the \"rocaille\" style, under the influence of the King's mistress, Madame de Pompadour. It marked the beginning of the European Rococo movement. From 1750 until the King's death in 1774, it became more sober, ordered, and began to show the influences of neoclassicism.\n\nThe chief architect of the King was Jacques Gabriel from 1734 until 1742, and then his more famous son, Ange-Jacques Gabriel, until the end of the reign. His major works included the Ecole Militaire, the ensemble of buildings overlooking the Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde; 1761-1770), and the Petit Trianon at Versailles (1764). Over the course of the reign of Louis XV, while interiors were lavishly decorated, the facades gradually became simpler, less ornamented and more classical. The facades designed by Gabriel were carefully rhymed and balanced by rows of windows and columns, and, on large buildings like the Place de la Concorde, often featured grand arcades on the street level, and classical pediments or balustrades on the roofline. Ornamental features sometimes included curving wrought-iron balconies with undulating rocaille designs, similar to the rocaille decoration of the interiors.\n\nThe religious architecture of the period was also sober and monumental, and it tended, at the end of the reign, toward the neoclassical. Major examples include the Church of Saint-Genevieve (now the Panthéon), built from 1758 to 1790 to a design by Jacques-Germain Soufflot, and the Church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-1777) by Jean Chalgrin, which featured an enomrous barrel-vaulted nave.\n\nInterior decoration during the reign of Louis XV fell into two periods; the first especially featured rocaille ornament, sculpted sinuous curves and counter-curves, often in floral and vegetative patterns, applied to the panels of the walls, often with medallions in the center. The panels large mirrors were framed in often framed with sculpted palm leaves or other floral decoration. Unlike the rococo style, the ornament was usually restrained, symmetrical and balanced. In the early period of the style, the designs were often inspired by French versions of Chinese art, animals, especially monkeys (\"Singerie\") and arabesques, or themes taken from works of the artists of the period, including Jean Bérain the Younger, Watteau and Jean Audran.\n\nAfter 1750, in reaction to the excesses of the earlier style, the designs and moldings on the interior walls were white or pale colored, more geometric, decorated with sculpted garlands, roses, and crowns, and ornamented with designs inspired by ancient Greece and Rome. This style was found in the \"Salon de Compagnie\" at the Petit Trianon, and it was the predecessor of the Louis XVI style.\n\nThe chairs of the Louis XV style, compared with those of Louis XIV, were characterized by lightness, comfort and harmony of lines. The traverse support of the legs disappeared, and the chairs were designed so one could sit back comfortably. The legs had a curving 'S shape. The carved decor featured sculpted fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage. The \"dossier\", or back of the chair, was \"violones\", slightly curved like a violin. Several new variants of chairs appeared including the \"bergere\", with stuffed upholstered arms, \"A confessional\", with upholstered and padded arms; the \"Marquise\", a \"bergere\" seating two persons, with a low back, and short arms.\n\nThe Console table was a table designed to be placed against a wall, usually used for displaying art objects; it was almost always in the rocaille style, with undulating curves, modeled after seashells and foliage. very sinuous, twisting rocaille modeled after seashells and foliage.\n\nThe Commode was a new type of furniture which had first appeared late in the reign of Louis XIV. It was a chest drawers resting on four S-shaped legs. It usually featured gilded bronze ornament, but during the reign of Louis XV, it was also covered with plaques of exotic woods of different colors in geometric patterns or floral shapes. A particular variation, called the \"façon de Chine\" or \"Chinese fashion\" emerged, which contrasted the gilded bronze against black lacquered wood. A large number of skilled \"ébénistes\" from around Europe were employed to fine wood Commodes and other furniture for the King. They included Jean-François Oeben, Roger Vandercruse Lacroix, Gilles Joubert, Antoine Gaudreau, and Martin Carlin.\n\nA variety of other new types of furniture appeared, including the \"chiffonier\", a cabinet with five drawers, and the \"table de toilette\", a kind of desk-table with three shutters, the central one having a mirror.\n\nLater in the reign of Louis XV, between 1755 and 1760, tastes in furniture began to change. The \"rocaille\" designs began more discreet and restrained, and the influence of antiquity and neo-classicism began to appear in new designs of furniture. The Commodes became to have more geometric forms; the decoration turned from rocaille to geometric forms, garlands of oak leaves, flowers and classical motifs. A new type of tall cabinet, the \"Cartonnier\", made its appearance between 1760 and 1765. It took its inspiration from Greek mythology and architecture, with friezes, vaulting, sculpted trophies, bronze lion heads, and other classic, elements.\n\nThe dominant subjects of painting in the early reign of Louis XV were mythology and history, the same as those of Louis XV. Later in the reign, when Louis began to construct new apartments within the palaces of Versailles and Fontanebleau, his tastes turned more to pastoral scenes and genre painting. Madame de Pompadour, the king's mistress, was also one of the major patrons of the artists of the period.\n\nThe most favored artist of the King was François Boucher, He produced for the King art of every description; religious paintings, genre scenes, landscapes, pastorals, and exotic scenes, frequently featuring gatherings of cheerful and seductive nudes. As the king's other great passion was hunting, he painted \"Leopard hunt\" (1765) and \"Crocodile hunt\" (1767) for the King's new apartments at Versailles. In 1767, near the end of the career, he was named First Painter of the King.\n\nOther notable painters included Jean Baptiste Oudry, whose hunting scenes decorated royal apartments in Versailles, and were made into tapestries and popular engravings; the portrait artists Maurice Quentin de la Tour and Jean-Marc Nattier, who made portraits for the royal family and aristocracy; and the genre painter Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin.\nThe sculptural styles of the \"Grand Siécle\" of Louis XIV continued to dominate during most of the reign of Louis XV. Madame de Pompadour was a particularly enthusiastic patroness of sculpture, and many busts and statues were made of her or commissioned by her. The most prominent sculptors of the early period were the Guillaume Coustou the Younger and his brother, Guillaume Coustou the Elder, Robert Le Lorrain, and Edmé Bouchardon. Bouchardon created the equestrian statue of Louis XV for the center of the new Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde) which was modeled after that of Louis XIV in the Place Louis le Grand (now Place Vendôme) by François Girardon. After the death of Bouchardon, the statue was finished by another major monumentalist of the period, Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. In the later part of the reign of Louis XV, sculptors began to give greater attention to the faces; the leaders of this new style were Jean-Antoine Houdon noted for his busts of celebrated authors and statesmen, and Augustin Pajou, who made notable portrait busts of the natural scientist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Madame du Barry. Sculpture began to reach a larger popular audience during this period, thanks to reproductions made from terra cotta and unglazed porcelain.\n\nIn the later years of his reign, Louis constructed a major new square in the center of the city, Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde, with a harmonious row of new buildings, designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel. He built other monumental squares in the centers of Rennes and Bordeaux. He also constructed one monumental fountain in Paris, the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons, with statuary by Edmé Bouchardon; but it was poorly sited on a narrow street, and while it had an abundance of sculpture, because of the antiquated water supply of Paris, it produced very little water. The fountain was criticized by Voltaire in a letter to the Count de Caylus in 1739, while it was still under construction:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34226585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34226585", "title": "Nathdwara Painting", "text": "Nathdwara Painting\n\nNathdwara Painting refers to a painting tradition and school of artists that emerged in Nathdwara, a town in Rajsamand district in the Western state of Rajasthan in India. Nathdwara paintings are of different sub-styles of which \"Pichhwai\" paintings are the most popular. The word \"Pichwai\" derives from the Sanskrit words \"pich\" meaning back and \"wais\" meaning hanging. These paintings are cloth paintings hung behind the image of the Hindu god Shrinathji.\n\nThe Nathdwara school is a subset of the Mewar school of painting and is seen as an important school in the 17th and 18th century miniature paintings. The sub-styles of Mewar painting include Udaigarh, Devgarh and Nathdwara as important centers of miniature production. The temple of Shrinathji is believed to have provided a boost to the art activities in the town. It is recorded that to avoid the oppression of the iconoclast Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, the image of Shrinathji, a child manifestation of Krishna was installed in Nathdwara in 1670 by Goswami priests from Mathura. After this, many artists, including the famous Acharya Gopinathji, motivated by religious fervor came and created paintings of Srinathji.\n\nPichhwai are intricate paintings which portray Lord Krishna. They exist in the holy town of Nathdwara in the Rajasthan state of India.\n\nKrishna is shown in different moods, body postures, and attire more commonly found on a cloth or paper. It is a very ancient form of art passed on from generation to generation and it has a very devotional theme towards Lord Krishna.\n\nThe purpose of Pichhwais, other than its artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. They have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors in the area.\n\nThese artists mostly live in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. It is no wonder that many times a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skillful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist.\n\nMost works produced in this style revolve around the figure of Shrinathji as a manifestation of Krishna and refer to the incident of him holding the Govardhan hill on his last finger. Each \"pichwai\" painting is considered a \"seva\" or an offering to the deity and hence personifies Shrinathji as a prince with jewels and luxuries, surrounded by the milkmaids, gopis. These \"seva\" themes are based on different seasons and paintings are made to depict different moods of the season. There are also paintings that show the Lord in different costumes celebrating different festivals. Other themes like Mata Yashoda, Nandlal and Balgopal figures are also painted in this style. Some of the paintings are gem-encrusted.\n\n"}
{"id": "52992510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52992510", "title": "Northern Master", "text": "Northern Master\n\nThe Northern Master was an anonymous artist in the late 13th century who worked in the Upper Church of the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi. Although his precise origin is unknown, he is thought to be of French, German, or English origin. He and his assistants played a critical role in painting by merging northern Gothic and Italian influences in the frescoes. Also attributed to him are the designs for some of the stained glass windows.\n\nThe Northern Master worked in the Upper Church of the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi at roughly the same time as Cimabue did, decorating the upper part of the north transept. The style of the work is markedly Gothic, perhaps French, German, or English, and for this the artist is referred to as the Northern Master (called in Italian either the \"Maestro Oltremontano, \"\"master from over the mountains\" or the \"Maestro Oltralpe\", \"master from over the Alps\").\n\nAttributed to him are two large lunettes (containing images of the \"Transfiguration \"and \"Saint Luke kneeling next to a throne\"); all the work in the left loggia (with busts of angels in clipeuses and life-sized figures of saints and prophets behind the columns); and various decorative elements (perhaps entrusted to his assistants) with geometric and floral motifs found underneath the arches of the lunettes, stained glass windows, and columns. Sometimes also attributed to him are the decorative bands of the vaults, in particular the masks near the joints on the pilasters, as well as the remains of the two grand figures in the niches (\"Isaiah \"and \"David\") flanking the stained glass windows at the head of the transept along with the two painted rosettes above them. The work in the right loggia is generally attributed one of the Roman masters.\n\nThe Northern Master's work (unfortunately much damaged) is particularly important not only for its quality of painting but even more so because it represents a bridge between the purely Gothic style from over the Alps (in France, England, and Germany) and the Italian schools (in Assisi, Florence, and Rome). In a few places his work is patently Gothic (in an epoch in which this style had only just taken root in Italian architecture); in other areas it demonstrates an assimilation of elements from Roman culture (as in the acanthus leaves with their classical flavor, found underneath the arches of the windows); and yet other areas show an exclusively Roman influence tied to a collaborator and successor.\n\nCimabue himself also appears to have been inspired by this Gothic influence, especially in the decorative bands and motifs, and to a certain scale and fluency in design. Some art historians even hypothesize that the two artists worked together in the lower register of the apse (the \"Annunciation of Joachim and his offering\", the angels holding vases at the bases of the \"Four Evangelists \"in the vaults, and the \"Crucifixion \"in the left transept).\n\nThe profile of spires and pinnacles drawn over the small trefoil arches of the loggia in itself indicates a clear adhesion to Gothic culture. There is a particular dialogue established in the frescoes between these painted details and the real architectonic elements, that produce the window frames made with columns and arches that create the spaces into which the frescoed prophets are inserted. The loggias have created a series of painted niches, behind a gallery of real columns, which do not always correspond: a feature previously seen only in the Sancta Sanctorum of St. John Lateran (rediscovered in the middle of the 20th century) which perhaps suggests that the artist was at some point in Rome where he distinguished himself and was then enlisted by Nicholas IV to assist in the Assisi decoration.\n\nThe idea of painting that not only imiates, but that is engaged enough to actually alter its environment, was then a novelty in an area normally accessible to the public and would have far-reaching consequences in later works of art.\n\nAnother characteristic of the Northern Master can be found in his figures, which are physiologically individualized. This can be seen in the way the masks at the bases of the vaults are treated, or in the figures of saints and prophets in the left loggia. Inspired by the decorative designs found in the French enamels, which contain spiraling leaves and vines, the artist clearly owes a debt to classical culture for the presence of meander and rhombus, with acanthus leaves also present.\n\nOil paint, at the time a predominantly northern medium, was also found to have been used by this artist in Assisi. In addition to the paintings, the design of some of the stained glass windows, also a chiefly northern medium, are attributed to him.\n\nSome critics (for example Henry Thode, Josef Strzygowski, Bernard Berenson, and Federico Zeri) believe no such artist as the Northern Master existed, attributing everything to Cimabue and his school on the basis of what Vasari indicated.\n\nIt was Aubert who first noted the decidedly gothic aspect of the work in this portion of the transept, connecting it to the style seen in the stained glass windows (constructed in part by French and German artists). Luigi Coletti followed, insisting on a connection to Sainte-Chapelle in Paris based on the peculiarly harsh color scheme of this part of the frescos (golds, dark reds, \"turchini\", etc.). He wrote: \"The style is rigorously linear; and this is very clear in the figurative parts, where the volumes appear resolved in many flat layers\". Brandi in 1951 spoke of a painter \"transalpino\" for the \"Transfiguration\", without hypothesizing for any specific nationality. Ultimately, the question of the artist's origin is one that has been extremely difficult to resolve, even if some studies have indicated points of contact with details in the stained glass windows that are decidedly German in taste, or in the other frescoes, like those in the Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg where the figures have a similar design and the faces a similar composition.\n"}

Her father met her mother, Nina Shakhetdinova, an Azerbaijanian, while he was stationed in the Caucasus. Nina died when Olga was very young. Olga's stepmother, who was also her former nurse, showed little interest in her, especially after the birth of her own daughter by Olga's father. When her father, Major General Komarov, died in 1881 Olga was placed in an orphanage for children of the nobility.\n\nShe married Boris Eduardovich Forsh, who had also been born into the family of a high-ranking military officer, in 1895. In the 1890s she studied at various art schools, most importantly in Kiev and St Petersburg, where she worked in the studio of Pavel Chistyakov.\n\nIn 1904 Boris Forsh resigned from the military in objection to his having to serve at the executions of political prisoners. He was deprived of his salary, and he and Olga moved to a farm in the Ukraine with their two children. Olga was also pregnant at the time. She later attributed the inspiration for her early stories to this extended period of living among the peasantry. Her first works of fiction were published in 1907. She continued drawing and painting, and worked as an art teacher at the Levitskaya School in Tsarskoye Selo in 1910-11, but she turned toward writing as time went by.\n\nOlga was interested in the fashionable ideas of the time, including Tolstoyanism, Theosophy and Buddhism, but was increasingly drawn to Socialism. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Olga and her husband became active supporters of the Bolsheviks. Olga's husband died of typhus while serving with the Red Army in Kiev. After his death she continued to dedicate herself to cultural work.\n\nShe devoted several novels to the history of revolutionary thought and the revolutionary movement in Russia. Among them are \"Palace and Prison\" (1924–25, also made into a film script), about the revolutionary Mikhail Stepanovich Beideman, \"The Fervid Workshop\" (1926), about the Revolution of 1905–07, and \"Pioneers of Freedom\" (1950–53), which deals with the Decembrists. She also wrote the three-part biographical novel \"Radishchev\", which comprises the books \"Jacobin Leaven\" (1932), \"The Landlady of Kazan\" (1934–35), and \"The Pernicious Book\" (1939). Her experimental play \"The Substitute Lecturer\" was published in 1930.\n\nThe fate of the creative individual under an oppressive regime is treated in the novel \"The Contemporaries\" (1926), which is about Nikolay Gogol and A. A. Ivanov. In the novels \"The Lunatic Ship\" (1931) and \"The Raven\" (originally titled \"The Symbolists\", 1933), Olga portrayed life among the St Petersburg artistic intelligentsia in the early 20th century and the first post revolutionary years and created portraits of such contemporaries as Maxim Gorky, Alexander Blok and Fyodor Sologub.\n\nOlga rose to prominence in the arena of Soviet literature, playing important roles at the 1934 Congress of Writers, and at the 1954 Congress, where she gave the opening address. She was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (twice) and the Order of the Badge of Honour.\n\nShe died in Tyarlova, a suburb of Leningrad, in 1961. She was buried in the Kazan Cemetery, on the outskirts of Pushkin.\n\n"}

Painting was a relatively widespread, popular and diverse means of communication and expression for both religious and utilitarian purpose throughout the regions of the Western Hemisphere. During the period before and after European exploration and settlement of the Americas; including North America, Central America, South America and the islands of the Caribbean, the Bahamas, the West Indies, the Antilles, the Lesser Antilles and other island groups, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. Many of the perishable surfaces, such as woven textiles, typically have not been preserved, but Precolumbian painting on ceramics, walls, and rocks have survived more frequently.\n\nThe oldest known paintings in the South America are the cave paintings of Caverna da Pedra Pintada, in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest that date back 11,200 years. The earliest known painting in North America is the [[Cooper Bison Skull]] found near [[Fort Supply, Oklahoma]], dated to 10,200 BCE.\n\nEach continent of the Americas hosted societies that were unique and individually developed cultures; that produced totems, works of religious symbolism, and decorative and expressive painted works. African influence was especially strong in the art of the Caribbean and South America. The arts of the indigenous people of the Americas had an enormous impact and influence on [[European art]] and vice versa during and after the [[Age of Exploration]]. Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands and England were all powerful and influential [[colonial power]]s in the Americas during and after the 15th century. By the 19th century cultural influence began to flow both ways across the Atlantic.\n\nThe murals of [[Teotihuacan]] that adorn the archaeological site (and others, like the [[Wagner Murals]], found in private collections) and from hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors are the source of most of what is understood about that ancient civilization. The painting of the murals, perhaps thousands of them, reached its zenith between 450 and 650 CE. The painters' artistry was unrivalled in Mesoamerica and has been compared with that of [[Florence, Italy]].\n\nA series of [[mural]]s were found in the Tepantitla compound in Teotihuacan. In 1942, archaeologist [[Alfonso Caso]] identified the central figures as a Teotihuacan equivalent of \"[[Tlaloc]],\" the Mesoamerican god of rain and warfare. During the 1970s researcher Esther Pasztory re-examined the murals and concluded that many paintings of \"Tlaloc\" instead showed a \"feminine\" deity, an analysis based on a number of factors including the gender of accompanying figures, the green bird in the headdress, and the spiders seen above the figure. Pasztory concluded that the figures represented a vegetation and fertility goddess that was a predecessor of the much later Aztec goddess [[Xochiquetzal]].\n\nThe Great Goddess has since been identified at locations other than Tepantitla – including Teotihuacan's Tetitla compound, the Palace of the Jaguars, and the Temple of Agriculture – as well as on several vessels.\n\nLarge painted [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[mural]]s were found in the archaeological site [[Bonampak]], in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] of [[Chiapas]] near the border with [[Guatemala]]. What is referred to as \"The Temple of the Murals\" is a long narrow building with 3 rooms atop a low-stepped pyramid base. The interior walls preserve the finest examples of classic Maya painting. Huge paintings cover the walls of one of the structure's three rooms. The paintings show the story of a single battle and its victorious outcome.\n\nThe [[Nazca culture]] of [[Peru]] produced painted pottery and painted ceramics depicting religious and symbolic characters as well as imagery of personages within the culture. They produced in addition to ceramics, highly complex textiles and [[Geoglyph]]s. The period from 1-700 A.D is generally considered when this group thrived. Modern knowledge about the culture of the Nazca is built upon the study of [[Cahuachi]] the ceremonial center from (1-500 AD).\n\nIn the area that is now the United States, many different and diverse [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of people created painting and ornamental painted objects of a large variety. The oldest known example is the [[Cooper Bison Kill Site|Cooper Bison skull]], which was painted with a red zigzag circa 10,200 BCE in present-day [[Oklahoma]]. [[Body painting]], [[rock art]], [[hide painting]] flourished in ancient North America, as well as painting on ceramics, textiles, and other surfaces.\n\n[[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] ([[Anasazi]]) of the American Southwest have a longstanding tradition of painting interior murals and ceramics, as did the [[Mogollon culture]], ancestors of [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]] tribes, who lived in an area near the [[Gila Wilderness]]. The [[Fremont culture]] of [[Utah]] are known for their abundant rock paintings throughout [[Utah]], particularly those at [[Range Creek|Range Creek Canyon]]. The [[Patayan]] typically painted ceramics with a red slip. The [[Hohokam]], ancestors of the [[Akimel O'odham]] and [[Tohono O'odham]], are known for their red-on-buff painted ceramics. [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]] is the best known monument of [[Hohokam]] culture.\n\n[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|Native Americans in California]] created many pieces and environments of [[rock art]]. The most elaborate and artistic painted [[pictograph]]s being the [[Rock art of the Chumash people]], and [[petroglyph]]s those of the [[Coso people]] in the [[Coso Rock Art District]].\n\nAncient [[Northwest Coast art]] features formline painting on woven items and wood; however, few of these items survived the centuries the [[temperate rainforest]] climate.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Pre-Columbian art]]\n[[Category:Mesoamerican art]]\n[[Category:Indigenous painting of the Americas]]\n[[Category:History of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n[[Category:Art by region|Americas]]"}

After graduating from Birmingham University in 1979 (BA, English), she spent five years working in BBC Television Drama. In 1985 she was awarded an Arts Council of Great Britain bursary to be Trainee Director at the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich. The following year she was appointed Associate Director at the Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham, then in 1989 Associate Director of the Bristol Old Vic, where her production of \"The Comedy of Errors\" was a success.\n\nShe moved on to the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester where she directed \"The Winter's Tale\", \"The School for Scandal\", \"Medea\", and an acclaimed production of \"Death and the King's Horseman\" by Wole Soyinka. In 1991 she made her debut at the Royal Shakespeare Company with a well-received production of a little-known play by Thomas Shadwell, \"The Virtuoso\". Although she followed this in 1992 with a successful production of the rarely seen \"Artists and Admirers\" by Alexander Ostrovsky, she has, as of 2007, never returned to the RSC.\n\nAlso in 1992 came her first commercial success: her Royal Court Theatre production of John Guare's \"Six Degrees of Separation\" transferred to the West End. In 1994 she made her debut at Royal National Theatre with a production of \"Pericles\" which divided the critics. There was general praise, however, for her productions of \"\"Hysteria\"\" by Terry Johnson at the Royal Court and Bertolt Brecht/Kurt Weill's \"The Threepenny Opera\" at the Donmar Warehouse.\n\nBy this time, Lloyd's work had come to the attention of Nicholas Paine, then running Opera North. For her debut as an opera director he steered her to what was, at least in the UK, an obscurity – \"L'Etoile\" by Chabrier. The production was a great success, setting Lloyd on a significant and award-winning career as an opera director. Productions since then include \"La Boheme\", \"Gloriana\", Cherubini's \"Medea\", Albert Herring and Peter Grimes for Opera North; \"Dialogues of the Carmelites\" for English National Opera/Welsh National Opera; Verdi's \"Macbeth\" (for the Bastille Opera and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden); the premiere of Poul Ruders' opera \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (from the novel by Margaret Atwood); and a controversial Ring cycle for ENO. She received an International Emmy, a FIPA d'Or and the Royal Philharmonic Society Award.\n\nIn spite of the mixed reception accorded to her first production at the National Theatre, Lloyd nonetheless returned to direct productions of \"The Way of the World\", \"Pericles\", \"What the Butler Saw\", \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\" and \"The Duchess of Malfi\", which were well received. She directed an award-winning production of \"Boston Marriage\" at London's Donmar Warehouse in 2001. Other recent work includes Friedrich Schiller's \"Mary Stuart\" newly adapted by poet Peter Oswald, which ran at the Donmar Warehouse, London, and was transferred to the Apollo Theatre, London, and then to the Broadway in spring 2009.\n\nIn 1999 Lloyd was offered the chance to direct the ABBA musical \"Mamma Mia!\", which became a hit, not only in the West End and on Broadway, but worldwide. She directed the 2008 cinematic adaptation, which marked her feature debut. By the end of 2008, the film had been certified as the biggest grossing film at the UK box office ever. It was also certified as the UK's biggest-selling DVD. She was nominated as Best Director of a Play in the 2009 Tony Awards for her production of \"Mary Stuart\".\n\nLloyd directed \"The Iron Lady\", a biopic of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, with Meryl Streep as Thatcher.

The character, created by writer-producer Ehren Kruger and portrayed by Naomi Watts, serves as the protagonist of \"The Ring\" and \"The Ring Two\", sharing similarities with Reiko Asakawa from the original Japanese films.\n\nIntroduced in the 2002 film, Rachel is an investigative journalist who must figure out a way to escape death after watching a cursed video tape that she discovered while investigating the death of her niece. In \"The Ring Two\", Rachel must delve into the history of Samara Morgan after her son gets sick with a mysterious ailment.\n\nIn \"The Ring\", Rachel Keller, an investigative journalist, is asked by her sister Ruth to investigate the mysterious circumstances behind her niece Katie's death. She informs Rachel that she found her daughter's distorted corpse in the closet and that her official cause of death was a heart attack, despite Katie being a healthy teenager. Katie's remaining friends make Rachel aware of the legend of the cursed videotape and that Becca, Katie's friend, was institutionalized after witnessing her being killed. She also discovers that Katie's boyfriend and her two other friends all died in bizarre accidents on the same night at 10 PM. Rachel travels to Shelter Mountain Inn and stays at Cabin 12, the same cabin where Katie and her friends watched the cursed videotape. Rachel finds the mysterious tape and watches it, after which the phone rings. Rachel hears a childish voice utter \"seven days\". Rachel seeks help from her ex-boyfriend Noah Clay, a video analyst. Later, Rachel discovers that Aidan watched the tape just as Noah calls her and tells her that he believes her. Rachel researches the lighthouse from the tape and discovers that it was located in Moesko Island, the home of an ill-fated horse breeder named Anna Morgan, who appeared on the cursed videotape. After investigating, Rachel discovers Anna had an adopted daughter named Samara, who possessed nensha, allowing her to burn disturbing images into the minds of people, animals and objects. Rachel meets Anna’s surviving husband Richard, but he makes her leave when she begins to ask questions about Samara. She then speaks to the island’s physician, Dr. Grasnik, who explains that Anna experienced horrible visions and dreams after Samara began burning gruesome images into her mind. Rachel watches the missing medical footage, which was revealed to be Samara explaining her powers to her psychiatrist during a psychiatric session. As the footage ends, Richard abruptly strikes her in the head and subsequently decides to end the torment Samara inflicted upon him by electrocuting himself in the bathtub. Noah arrives and they discover an image of the same tree found in both Shelter Mountain Inn and the cursed videotape beneath the wallpaper in the attic of a horse barn, where Samara was kept to prevent her from inflicting harm onto others. Returning to Shelter Mountain Inn, they discover a well beneath the floorboards of Cabin 12. Rachel accidentally falls into the well, where she receives a vision revealing that Anna was the one who killed Samara via suffocating her with a plastic bag and dumping her body into the well, where she survived for seven days. Finding her skeletal remains, Rachel discovers that the time she was supposed to be killed by the curse has passed, she and Noah return home, believing the curse was finally broken. However, Aidan makes her realize the curse was never ending. Noah is killed and Rachel discovers that she was to late. She realizes that she had been spared after making a copy and passing the copy to Noah. Rachel decides to save Aidan by making a copy of the initial copy she sent to Noah so that he can avoid death by showing someone else the tape.\n\n\"The Ring Two\", takes place one year after the first film. Rachel and Aidan have moved to Astoria from Seattle. Rachel works at The Daily Astorian for editor Max Rourke. Rachel learns of a local teen's death and begins investigating; from the horrified expression on the boy's face, she deduces that Samara is involved. Sure enough, Samara appears, declaring that she has been looking for her. Rachel obtains the videotape and burns it. Aidan encounters Samara in a nightmare and he starts developing hypothermia and bruises on his arms. At a county fair, Aidan takes photographs of his reflection, where Samara appears. Rachel realizes Aidan may be possessed by Samara. Max allows Rachel and Aidan to stay with him and while attempting to give Aidan a bath, Samara causes the water to recede from the bath, replacing Aidan, grabbing Rachel and she tries to drown Samara. Max enters, seeing her drowning Aidan instead, and forces her to take her son to the hospital. Samara takes control of Aidan’s body and telepathically forces Dr. Temple to commit suicide. Rachel arrives, discovering an affectionate Aidan waiting for her, but acting odd. Rachel falls asleep, dreaming of Aidan, who tells her that she will have to exorcise Samara. Upon awakening, Rachel drugs Samara with sleeping pills and places her in the bath to temporarily drown Aidan in order to exorcise her. Samara is removed, but appears in the television. Rachel allows herself to be dragged into Samara’s monochromatic world. Finding herself in the bottom of the well Samara died in, Rachel discovers the lid is partially open. Rachel escapes the well, sealing Samara inside. Wandering through the woods, she comes to the cliff where Samara’s adoptive mother Anna committed suicide. Hearing Aidan’s voice, Rachel throws herself off the cliff into the sea, awakening back in the real world, and reunites with Aidan.\n\nIn an interview, Watts revealed that she was originally hesitant to accept the role because she feared being typecast and discussed her character saying, \"it's such a great role, especially the protagonist being female when that kind of part is normally reserved for the guys. She gets to go through such an incredible journey, not just with the struggle and chaos that's happening around her, but her own personal journey.\" and stated \"I like her complexities and the fact that she thinks everything's OK because she's not fighting with her son. She then discovers that throughout the journey that she needs to be a better mum, has a moment to reflect and think: OK I've learned something through this, which I liked.\" In another interview, Watts discussed her character saying that \"It was the character that drew me to this project,\" and elaborated further by saying \"What I think sets it apart, is that the character has her own personal journey to go through. She starts out as a flawed person and not a very good mother, and after all the chaos, she learns to recognize what her child needs.\"\n\nFollowing the success of the 2002 film, Naomi Watts revealed that she was contractually obligated to star in \"The Ring Two\", stating that she \"didn't have the power of choice\" but said that she did not have any second thoughts about reprising her role as Rachel stating that her character \"had a lot more substance and it was about confronting the situation, the psychological aspects to it, and moral dilemmas, which I think have come up again in the sequel. They took a long time with the script, DreamWorks are very clever people, they know how to make it right and they persisted. We have a great director, who directed the original one, and we have a great cast. I think there is always that fear of doing any sequel but we took our time in trying to make it the best we could, while also give a nod to the audience.\"\n\nIn an interview with BBC, Gore Verbinski discussed Watts performance saying, \"Naomi's great. She's completely dedicated to her performance and not to her image. That process allows her to become Rachel in this movie and go to some darker areas that I think a lot of actors wouldn't feel comfortable doing.\" While discussing Rachel's character arc in \"The Ring Two\", Watts stated, \"Well, emotionally she's obviously in a very different place. And, you know, she's living with this enormous guilt and, there's no one she can talk to. What have I done? Did I do the right thing? She needs so much to, share a connection with somebody else. But she can't, she's too ashamed and so, it's just her and her son. So, the best thing she thinks she can do is move to another environment and create almost a whole new identity.\"\n\nIn \"Misfit Sisters: Screen Horror as Female Rites of Passage\", S. Short discusses the distinctiveness of the character noting, \"the woman responsible for investigating the murder mystery at the heart of \"The Ring\" is not led by visions or intuition, but by her instincts as a journalist working for the Seattle Correspondent.\" In \"Heroes of Film, Comics and American Culture: Essays on Real and Fictional Defenders of Home\", Lisa M. DeTora states:\nLeigh Kolb from IndieWire notes that the \"ambiguous ending suggests that Rachel may indeed save her son, but will have to harm another to do so. This idea of motherly self-sacrifice portrays the one way that Rachel–single, working mother–can redeem herself.\" Sarah Crocker ranked Rachel 13th on her list of \"13 Horror Movie Heroines That Kick Butt\". Paul Clinton of CNN.com praised Watts' performance, stating that she \"is excellent in this leading role, which proves that her stellar performance in \"Mulholland Drive\" was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between scepticism and the slow realisation of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape.\" In a post for AMC, Stacie Ponder states, \"One of the things I like about Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) in Gore Verbinski’s The Ring is that she wasn’t the best mom in the world. She didn’t neglect her weirdo kid, Aidan (David Dorfman), but she was concerned first and foremost with her own life and her own career.\"\n\nRachel is the protagonist of the fan film \"RINGwhispers\". In this short film, Rachel returns to Moesko Island after discovering that several teenagers have mysteriously disappeared there.\n"}

In 1956 it was acquired by and remains the home of the English Stage Company and is notable for its contributions to contemporary theatre.\n\nThe first theatre on Lower George Street, off Sloane Square, was the converted Nonconformist Ranelagh Chapel, opened as a theatre in 1870 under the name The New Chelsea Theatre. Marie Litton became its manager in 1871, hiring Walter Emden to remodel the interior, and it was renamed the Court Theatre.\nSeveral of W. S. Gilbert's early plays were staged here, including \"Randall's Thumb\", \"Creatures of Impulse\" (with music by Alberto Randegger), \"Great Expectations\" (adapted from the Dickens novel), and \"On Guard\" (all in 1871); \"The Happy Land\" (1873, with Gilbert Abbott à Beckett; Gilbert's most controversial play); \"The Wedding March\", translated from \"Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie\" by Eugène Marin Labiche (1873); \"The Blue-Legged Lady\", translated from \"La Dame aux Jambes d'Azur\" by Labiche and Marc-Michel (1874); and \"Broken Hearts\" (1875). By 1878, management of the theatre was shared by John Hare and W. H. Kendal.\n\nFurther alterations were made in 1882 by Alexander Peebles, after which its capacity was 728 (including stalls and boxes, dress circle and balcony, amphitheatre, and gallery). After that, Arthur Cecil (who had joined the theatre's company in 1881) was co-manager of the theatre with John Clayton. Among other works, they produced a series of Arthur Wing Pinero's farces, including \"The Rector\", \"The Magistrate\" (1885), \"The Schoolmistress\" (1886), and \"Dandy Dick\" (1887), among others. The theatre closed on 22 July 1887 and was demolished.\n\nThe present building was built on the east side of Sloane Square, replacing the earlier building, and opened on 24 September 1888 as the New Court Theatre. Designed by Walter Emden and Bertie Crewe, it is constructed of fine red brick, moulded brick, and a stone facade in free Italianate style. Originally the theatre had a capacity of 841 in the stalls, dress circle, amphitheatre, and a gallery.\n\nCecil and Clayton yielded management of the theatre to Mrs. John Wood and Arthur Chudleigh in 1887, although Cecil continued acting in their company (and others) until 1895. The first production in the new building was a play by Sydney Grundy titled \"Mamma\", starring Mrs. John Wood and John Hare, with Arthur Cecil and Eric Lewis. By the end of the century, the theatre was again called the \"Royal Court Theatre\".\n\nHarley Granville-Barker managed the theatre for the first few years of the 20th century, and George Bernard Shaw's plays were produced at the New Court for a period. It ceased to be used as a theatre in 1932, but was used as a cinema from 1935 to 1940, until World War II bomb damage closed it.\n\nThe interior was reconstructed by Robert Cromie, and the number of seats was reduced to under 500. The theatre re-opened in 1952. George Devine was appointed artistic director at the suggestion of Oscar Lewenstein, one of the founders of the English Stage Company. Greville Poke, another co-founder was appointed Honorary Secretary of the ESC in October 1954. The ESC opened at the Royal Court in 1956 as a subsidised theatre producing new British and foreign plays, together with some classical revivals. Devine aimed to create a writers' theatre, seeking to discover new writers and produce serious contemporary works. Devine produced the new company's third production in 1956, John Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\", a play by one of the angry young men. The director was Tony Richardson. Osborne followed \"Look Back In Anger\" with \"The Entertainer\", with Laurence Olivier in the lead as Archie Rice, a play the actor effectively commissioned from the playwright. Significantly, although it was quickly reversed, the artistic board of the ESC initially rejected the play. Two members of the board were in agreement in opposing \"The Entertainer\". The Conservative Christian verse dramatist Ronald Duncan, the third co-founder of the ESC, disliked the work of Osborne according to Osborne biographer John Heilpern, while Lewenstein, a former Communist, did not want one of the theatre's new plays to be overwhelmed by its star and did not think much of the play.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the ESC became involved in issues of censorship. Their premiere productions of Osborne's \"A Patriot for Me\" and \"Saved\" by Edward Bond (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a 'private members club' to circumvent the Lord Chamberlain, formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the Theatres Act 1968. The \"succès de scandale\" of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of theatre censorship in the UK. During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Ann Jellicoe and N.F. Simpson. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by Christopher Hampton, Athol Fugard, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill, Hanif Kureishi, Sarah Daniels, Errol John, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Martin Crimp, Sarah Kane, Sylvia Wynter, Mark Ravenhill, Martin McDonagh, Simon Stephens, Leo Butler, Polly Stenham and Nick Payne. Early seasons included new international plays by Bertolt Brecht, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Marguerite Duras. In addition to the 400-seat proscenium arch Theatre Downstairs, the much smaller studio Theatre Upstairs was opened in 1969, at the time a 63-seat facility. \"The Rocky Horror Show\" premiered there in 1973. The theatre was Grade II listed in June 1972.\n\nThough the main auditorium and the façade were attractive, the remainder of the building provided poor facilities for both audience and performers, and the stalls and understage often flooded throughout the 20th century. By the early 1990s, the theatre had deteriorated dangerously and was threatened with closure in 1995. The Royal Court received a grant of £16.2 million from the National Lottery and the Arts Council for redevelopment, and beginning in 1996, under the artistic directorship of Stephen Daldry, it was completely rebuilt, except for the façade and the intimate auditorium. The architects for this were Haworth Tompkins. The theatre reopened in February 2000, with the 380-seat Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, and the 85-seat studio theatre, now the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Since 1994, a new generation of playwrights debuting at the theatre has included Joe Penhall, Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Roy Williams amongst others. Since the 1990s, the Royal Court has placed an emphasis on the development and production of international plays. By 1993, the British Council had begun its support of the International Residency programme (which started in 1989 as the Royal Court International Summer School), and more recently the Genesis Foundation has also supported the production of international plays. The theatre received a 1999 International Theatre Institute award. In May 2008 The English Stage Company presented \"The Ugly One\" by Marius von Mayenburg at the \"Contact International Theatre Festival\" in Poland.\n\nArtistic Directors have included Ian Rickson (1998–2006), Max Stafford-Clark, Stuart Burge, Robert Kidd, Nicholas Wright, Lindsay Anderson, Anthony Page, and William Gaskill. From 2007 to 2012, the theatre's Artistic Director was Dominic Cooke and the deputy artistic director was Jeremy Herrin. Vicky Featherstone, the first female artistic director, previously founding head of the National Theatre of Scotland, replaced Cooke as Artistic Director in April 2013.\n\nCaryl Churchill's play \"Seven Jewish Children\" opened at the theatre in February 2009. Many Jewish leaders and journalists have criticised \"Seven Jewish Children\" as antisemitic, contending that it violates the rule that \"a play that is critical of, and entirely populated by, characters from one community, can be defended only if it is written by a member of that community\". Further, Associate Director Ramin Gray has been accused of hypocrisy, as he is reported to have stated that he would be reluctant to stage a play critical of Islam.\n\nMichael Billington in \"The Guardian\" described the play as \"a heartfelt lamentation for the future generations\". The paper contended that the play, though controversial, is not antisemitic, yet \"Seven Jewish Children\" was viewed by another \"Guardian\" writer as historically inaccurate and harshly critical of Jews. Jonathan Hoffman, co-vice chairman of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland, called the play \"a libellous and despicable demonisation of Israeli parents and grandparents\" and expressed fear that it would \"stoke the fires of antisemitism\". He added that the play is a modern blood libel drawing on old anti-Semitic myths. Jeffrey Goldberg of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" also calls the play a blood libel. Columnist Melanie Phillips wrote that the play is \"an open vilification of the Jewish people... drawing upon an atavistic hatred of the Jews\" and called it \"Open incitement to hatred\". \"The New York Times\" wrote that the play \"at times paints heartless images of Israelis.\"\n\nIn reply, the Royal Court issued the following statement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It became a Grade II listed building in 1972.\n\nThe statue is a copy of an 1712 sculpture by Francis Bird in Carrara marble which formerly stood at the same location. Queen Anne was the ruling British monarch when the new St Paul's Cathedral was completed in 1710. Bird's statue was unveiled at a thanksgiving service for the Peace of Utrecht, held 7 July 1713. The statue cost £1,130, excluding the marble which was provided by the Queen. It was surrounded by an elegant metal railing made by Jean Tijou. The Tijou railings were later removed and replaced by heavier railings to match the others around the cathedral. The original statue was attacked at least three times, in 1743, 1768, and 1882, with noses and arms damaged, and it was also badly weathered by the 1880s. Reputedly, the statue was once defaced with the lines \"Brandy Nan, Brandy Nan, left in the lurch; Her face to the gin-shop, her back to the church\", alluding to the Queen's reputed fondness for strong liquor and the location of a gin palace near the cathedral.\n\nRichard Claude Belt was commissioned in 1885 to create a replacement statue from Sicilian marble, supplied by the Corporation of London at a cost of £1,800. Belt was imprisoned for obtaining money by false pretences in March 1886, and Louis Auguste Malempré completed the sculpture. The building work to install the statue was done by Mowlem and Sons, supervised by the city architect Sir Horace Jones, and the new sculpture was unveiled by Reginald Hanson, the Lord Mayor of London, on 15 December 1886, the year before the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.\n\nThe Baroque sculpture depicts Queen Anne standing, facing down Ludgate Hill towards Ludgate Circus. She is robed, wearing the collar of the Order of the Garter and a gilded crown, with one hand holding a gilded orb and the other a gilded sceptre. The figure stands on a Portland stone pedestal by architect Christopher Wren, decorated with four symbolic figures, one on each corner: to the west, towards Ludgate Hill, are Britannia with gilded trident (representing England) and a figure representing France (with fleur-de-lys on the visor of her helmet), holding between them a carved representation of the British Royal Coat of Arms, and to the east, towards St Paul's Cathedral, are figures representing Ireland (with harp) and North America (a Native American, with feathered skirt and headdress, gilded bow, quiver of arrows, and lizard). The pedestal stands on three steps surrounded by heavy cast iron railings.\n\nThe pedestal bears two inscriptions: on the south side \"The Original STATUE / was erected on this spot in the year 1712 / to commemorate the completion of / SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL / FRANCIS BIRD Sculptor.\" and on the north side: \"This Replica / of the Statue of QUEEN ANNE / was erected at the expense of / The CORPORATION of LONDON / In the year 1886 / The Rt. Hon. / SIR REGINALD HANSON M.A. F.S.A. / Lord Mayor / Wm. Braham Esq / Chairman of the City Lands Committee.\"\n\nAfter they were removed, the original 8-ton weathered sculpture, and the four similarly weathered 5-ton stone figures from the base, were rediscovered months later abandoned in the yard of a London stonemason. They were acquired by Augustus Hare and installed in the grounds of his house at Holmhurst St Mary near Hastings, with Queen Anne mounted on an elliptical pedestal and the four other seated figures on steps around at the base, similar to the original. The house was Grade II listed in 1976, and the statue received a separate Grade II* listing at the same time. \n\n\n"}

In particular, symmetry elements can be identities, mirror planes, axes of rotation (both proper and improper), and centers of inversion. A symmetry element corresponds to a symmetry operation that generates the same representation of an object.\n\nThe identity symmetry element is found in all objects and is denoted E. It corresponds to an operation of doing nothing to the object.\n\nMirror planes are denoted by σ. In particular, a vertical mirror plane is denoted σ.\n\nCyclic symmetry, also known as radial symmetry, is represented by an axis about which the object rotates in its corresponding symmetry operation. For proper axes of rotation, cyclic symmetry is denoted as C, where n is the order of rotation.\nImproper rotation, also known as screw axis symmetry, is denoted by S. \nImproper rotation is the composition of a rotation axis and a mirror plane.

It was found to have a different painting hidden under it using X-ray technology in 2014 by a group of art historians and scientists from the Phillips Collection in Washington, assisted by scientists from the Cornell University High Energy Synchrotron Source.\n\nIn \"The Blue Room\" we can see Picasso’s blue period being fully developed. His cool hues and strong use of natural light draw the viewer in to see this young idealized woman bathing in a tub in what we can assume is her bedroom. Although the painting could be described as patchy or mildly unclear, the subject and scene are still identifiable. The woman's figure and small studio background are typical of Picasso's blue period, as seen in other works such as \"The Blind Man’s Meal\" (1903).\n\nThe painting was investigated by several scientific methods in 2017. The investigation revealed the hidden portrait described below and the identity of the pigments used in both paintings. Picasso employed a wide palette of vivid pigments such as vermilion, viridian, chrome yellow, and cadmium yellow. He used predominantly Prussian blue for the blue areas.\n\nAlthough this piece can be considered typical of Picasso’s early blue period works, something interesting has come up in the last few years concerning this piece. Using x-ray cameras, scientists from the Phillip’s Collection in Washington discovered another painting just underneath the surface: a portrait of an old man resting his head in his hands.\n\nHistorians who have collectively collected biographical information regarding Picasso and his life during his Blue Period have concluded that he likely painted over another of his paintings because of his prolificacy in painting but lack of extra canvases. His economic state would not have allowed him to purchase the many materials needed in order to be a full-time artist. His “melancholy blue portraits” did not result in many eager buyers, or people willing to pay for the portraits he created of random people off the street. Picasso likely painted over several of his works until one would sell, earning money to purchase more materials.\n\n"}

The work is considered a masterpiece of Bomberg's work in this period. Bomberg was a founder member of the London Group, and the painting is considered a leading example of Vorticism, although Bomberg resisted being described as a Vorticist.\n\nThe painting is a striking composition of human figures formed from white and blue geometric planes and angles, in a rectangular bath of vibrant red surrounded by a landscape of mustard brown, arranged around a brown and black vertical element (perhaps a column at the baths). There is a suggestion that the bathers are waving their arms as if in a Bacchanalian revel. The scene is based on Schewzik Russian Vapour Baths in Brick Lane, Whitechapel, near Bomberg's home in east London, which was used by the local Jewish population for cleanliness and for religious observances, including the mikveh ritual bath. Bomberg's Jewishness was a very important part of his identity as an artist. The bathing room, with a communal bath approximately 10-foot square and balcony above, was open to either men and women on different days, and may also have been the inspiration for his 1913 work, \"Ju-Jitsu\".\n\nBomberg created a series of crayon, gouache and chalk studies before the painting. The completed work measures by . It was a key component in his one-man exhibition the Chenil Gallery in Chelsea in 1914. In addition to taking first place in the catalogue, the work was hung on the wall outside the gallery so that it could have \"every advantage of lighting and space\". A critic remarked that the work was \"rained upon, baked by the sun and garlanded with flags\", but it did not entice many passing the gallery to enter. The \"London Chronicle\" noted that \"The passers-by make no comment, because they do not recognise it as a picture\". Bomberg recalled that as they turned the corner of King's Road, horses pulling the number 29 bus would shy at it.\n\nThe work was purchased by the Tate Gallery in 1964, seven years after Bomberg's death. \n\n"}

Turner painted three watercolours of the Rigi, a mountain in the Alps in Central Switzerland, which he had visited the previous summer. Widely regarded as some of his finest works, the watercolours capture the transitory effects of light and atmospheric conditions at the Rigi. According to John Ruskin, \"Turner had never made any drawings [watercolours] like these before, and never made any like them again ... He is not showing his hand in these, but his heart.\"\n\nThe Blue Rigi, Sunrise, better known simply as The Blue Rigi, was acquired in 2007 by the Tate Gallery in Britain for £4.95m, matching the price achieved at auction in 2006, then the largest sum paid by the Tate for a single artwork. The Red Rigi is held by Australia's National Gallery of Victoria and shows the mountain blushed by the evening sun. \"The Dark Rigi\" is held in a private collection. Many preparatory sketches are held by the Tate as part of the Turner Bequest.\n\nBetween January and March of 2007, the three Rigi watercolours were united for the first time in an exhibition held at the Tate Gallery.\n\nTurner painted several variations of the Rigi in 1842, following a visit to Switzerland the previous summer. Completed examples include \"The Red Rigi\", blushed by the evening sun, originally sold to H.A.J. Munro of Novar and now held by the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, and The Dark Rigi, an early morning view, in a private collection. Many preparatory sketches are held by the Tate as past of the Turner Bequest.\n\nVictorian art critic John Ruskin may have been the first to describe the different members of Turner's Rigi series by their colours. The different colours and moods of Turner's Rigi series draws parallels that of Hokusai's prints of Mount Fuji, Cézanne's paintings of Mont Sainte-Victoire, and Monet's series of Rouen Cathedral.\n\nTurner painted the watercolours as part of a commercial series of ten watercolours. He worked up 15 sample studies (sketches) to show potential patrons his intentions, with the hope of securing commissions for fully worked up watercolours to be sold for 80 guineas each. He also completed \"The Blue Rigi\" and \"The Red Rigi\", and two others, as examples of how the finished paintings would look. Most were bought by Munro, including \"The Red Rigi\", and he commissioned Turner to complete \"The Dark Rigi\". Ruskin later bought \"The Red Rigi\" from Munro.\n\n\"The Blue Rigi\" depicts the Rigi mountain in central Switzerland, viewed from the southwest across Lake Lucerne. The \"Queen of Mountains\" is blue in the early morning light, wreathed by veils of morning mist. The tonality is built up with layers of colour wash, with fine detail added through cross-hatching with a fine brush. The planet Venus glints in the yellow morning sky above, where paint has been scratched out with a fingernail to reveal the bright white ground. In the left foreground, drawn in with pen and brown ink, ducks can be seen rising from the lake, alarmed by a gunshot and chased by two dogs, to the right foreground.\n\nTurner sold \"The Blue Rigi\" in 1842 through dealer Thomas Griffith to whaling mogul Elhanan Bicknell. After Bicknell's death, the painting was sold at Christie's in April 1863 for 296 guineas to the art dealer Agnew's, and resold a month later to John Edward Taylor (son of the founder of the \"Manchester Guardian\"). \"The Blue Rigi\" was engraved as a mezzotint by Sir Frank Short in 1910.\n\nAfter Taylor's death, the painting was sold in July 1912 for 2,700 guineas, again auctioned at Christie's and acquired by Agnew's. Agnew's acquired about two thirds of the Taylor's Turners in the 12-day sale, including \"The Red Rigi\" for 2,100 guineas. \"The Blue Rigi\" was acquired by cotton broker Walter H. Jones and inherited by his widow, Maud. Jones later also acquired \"The Red Rigi\" from Agnew's, after it was sold to a different collector and then auctioned at Christie's again in 1928. After her death, \"The Blue Rigi\" was acquired for a third time by Agnew's at a Christie's auction, in July 1942, for 1,500 guineas, and sold to a private collector. \"The Red Rigi\" was sold at the same sale for 1,100 guineas. It was acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria, in Melbourne, Australia, in 1947.\n\nIn 2000-01, \"The Blue Rigi\" was illustrated as the frontispiece to the catalogue accompanying an exhibition of Turner's watercolours at the Royal Academy. The work was auctioned for a fourth time at Christie's on 5 June 2006, achieving a sale price of £5,832,000 including buyer's premium, against an estimate of £2m. The hammer price doubled the record for a British work on paper, previously set by Dante Gabriel Rossetti's \"Pandora\" at £2.6m in 2000. The work was temporarily denied an export licence and it was acquired by the Tate Gallery in 2007 at a matching price (after allowance for tax reliefs) of £4.95m - the largest sum paid by the Tate for a single artwork. The acquisition was funded by £1,950,000 from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, £2m from the Tate's own resources, £500,000 from the Art Fund, and £582,000 raised from the public by the \"Save the Blue Rigi\" appeal.\n\n\"The Dark Rigi\" was also sold to a private collector in February 2006, for £2.7m. A proposed sale to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, was abandoned when the British government imposed a temporary export ban.\n\nThe three Rigi paintings - \"Blue\", \"Red\" and \"Dark\" - were exhibited together at the Tate Gallery in 2007, and again in 2014.\n\nMartin Hardie wrote of Turner: \"In the Rigi drawings he is the insuperable master of technique. He used every possible manipulation of brush, colour and paper, every device, every weapon in his armoury, sponging, rubbing, washing, stippling, hatching, touching and retouching, to express the vibration and radiation of light. Light was his theme.\"\n\n\n"}

May 27, 1977 - ) is a Belgian ecological architect. He designs futuristic-like ecodistrict projects which take account of several aspects of sustainability (renewable energies, biodiversity, urban agriculture).\n\nVincent Callebaut was born in 1977 in Belgium. He graduated in 2000 from the Institute Victor Horta, he moved to Paris to intern with architects Odile Decq and Massimiliano Fuksas and then founded his own company, « \"Vincent Callebaut Architectures\" ».\n\nThe project consists on implementing \"vertical farms\" in Manhattan along the East River at the South edge of the Roosevelt Island. In a way to rethink the city's food production and encourage each inhabitant to participate to the gardens, one of the visions of the Dragonfly project was defined as: 'Eating an apple just picked out of a collective orchard in the fourth floor while looking at New York through the window and then go back to your office just in the upper floor.' This project was inspired by the Japanese movie \"Laputa : Castle in the sky\".\n\nThe Dragonfly building is high, shaped as firefly wings. It is composed of two towers related by a 'bio-climatic' glasshouse. It deploys itself between two crystalline wings made out of glass and steel. The structure in honeycomb stitch allows the sunlight to pass through the building. This concept is seen as a feeder farm and reconnects the consumers with producers. This prototype of urban farm would have superimposed 132 floors and estending vertically with garden vegetables, fields, production of meat, milk, poultry and eggs where people could grow their own food. The Dragonfly can accommodate 28 different agricultural fields for the production. It is self-sufficient in energy, water and bio-fertilizing, powered by sunshield and eolian systems. These combine solar and wind power, which would make the Dragonfly self-sufficient.\nEverything is recyclable in a continuous auto-feeding so that nothing is lost. The spaces between the wings are designed to take advantage of solar energy by accumulating warm air in the structure during winter. During the summer it is cooling which is facilitated through natural ventilation and \"evapo-perspiration\" from the plants.\n\nThe objectives of the Dragonfly project were defined as:\n\nThe Lilypad or Floating ecopolis project is based on the idea of creating a place for future refugees of Current sea level rise caused by Global warming.\n\nFormerly called \"Agora Garden\", Vincent Callebaut designed a tower for Taipei, promoting vertical construction in an overpopulated city. It is a concept of eco-construction to reduce the carbon footprint of its inhabitants.\n\nVincent Callebaut Architectures SARL replied to an invitation to tender in November 2010. As of 2014 the project is under construction, and due for completion in 2016.\n\nThe shape of the building looks like a molecule of DNA with its double helix (but in opposite chirality of most common (known) B-form DNA). This was designed to represent a symbol of life and dynamism. The surface area is about .\n\nThe aim of the project is to represent a perfect symbiosis between humans and nature. Vincent Callebaut aims to develop an avant-gardist architecture and tries to institute a new life style in harmony with nature. The building is intended to guarantee environmental norms in order to obtain the Green Building Label delivered by the Home Affairs Ministry of Taipei.\n\nThe project addresses four ecologic objectives of the Copenhagen Accord:\n\n\nThe Agora Garden concept embraces the Cradle to Cradle philosophy: \"nothing is lost and everything transforms itself\" (Antoine Lavoisier). All materials are recycled or recyclable in order to imitate the processes of natural ecosystems. For example, at the top there is a huge free access garden covered by photovoltaic panels which produce electricity for the building. The tower is surrounding by trees which increase the biodiversity in the city.\n\nAgora Garden was planned as twenty levels in a double helix formation, with a total twist from bottom to top of ninety degrees. The twist satisfies four major objectives. Firstly, thanks to this architecture, the morphology of the building changes according to its orientation: On the East/West side we can see a rhomboidal pyramid, when one the North/South side we can see a reverse pyramid. Then, all flats have their own balconies looking like a hanging garden. Thirdly, there is no vis-à-vis so inhabitants have privacy and a panoramic view on Taipei. \n\nThe six main components of the project are :\n\nThe Gate is under construction in Cairo (Egypt).

Thus, style is a term that may refer, at one and the same time, to both conventions that go beyond the individual writer and to singular aspects of individual writing. Beyond the essential elements of spelling, grammar, and punctuation, writing style is the choice of words, sentence structure, and paragraph structure, used to convey the meaning effectively. The former are referred to as \"rules\", \"elements\", \"essentials\", \"mechanics\", or \"handbook\"; the latter are referred to as \"style\", or \"rhetoric\". The rules are about \"what\" a writer does; style is about \"how\" the writer does it. While following the rules drawn from established English usage, a writer has great flexibility in how to express a concept. The point of good writing style is to\nnot to\nalthough these are usually evident and are what experts consider the writer’s individual style.\n\nDiction, or the choice of \"words\", is obviously a central element in every writer’s style. Although good diction is partly a matter of trial and error, of tinkering with sentences until they sound right, it is also a matter of following certain general preferences that careful readers and writers tend to share.\n\nSome methods for using diction effectively in writing:\n\nSooner or later, a writer will have the essential elements of formal \"sentence\" correctness under control and will want to find the best ways of making sentences convey meaning effectively: how to phrase statements definitely, place coordinate thoughts in coordinate structures, subordinate to sharpen the relation between main assertions and modifying elements, eliminate unnecessary words, vary sentence structure, maintain consistency of tone, and smooth the general flow of words. Seemingly minor improvements—the moving of a clause from one position to another, a shift from the passive to the active voice, even a slight change in rhythm—can make the difference between drab sentences and pointed ones.\n\nSome methods for writing effective sentences:\n\nThe most important unit of meaning in every literary work is the \"paragraph\". Although each sentence conveys a thought, a literary work is not just a sequence of, say, eighty thoughts; it is rather a development of one central thesis through certain steps. Those steps are paragraphs. Within an effective paragraph the sentences support and extend one another in various ways, making a single, usually complex, unfolding idea.\n\nApart from outright incoherence, choppiness, or long-windedness, perhaps the most common flaw in paragraph construction is rigidity of presentation. Having something to say, the writer merely says it—and goes on to do just the same in the following paragraph. As a result, the reader feels, not like a participant in the writer’s thought, but like someone receiving instructions or being shown a rapid succession of images.\n\nSome methods for writing effective paragraphs:\n\nNote how rewriting the familiar sentence, \"These are the times that try men’s souls.\" by Thomas Paine, changes the overall impact of the message.\n\nCompare the following passages, and note how the authors convey their messages in different manners, as a result of their choices.\n\n\"Hamlet\", Act II, Scene 2 (1599–1602) by William Shakespeare:\n\n\"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1859) by Charles Dickens:\n\n\"Memories of Christmas\" (1945) by Dylan Thomas:\n\n\"The Strawberry Window\" (1955) by Ray Bradbury:\n\n\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" (1963) by Martin Luther King, Jr.:\n\nThe writer's voice is a rather vague metaphorical term by which some critics refer to distinctive features of a written work in terms of spoken utterance. The voice of a literary work is then the specific group of characteristics displayed by the narrator or poetic \"speaker\" (or, in some uses, the actual author behind them), assessed in terms of \"tone\", \"style\", or \"personality\". Distinctions between various kinds of narrative voice tend to be distinctions between kinds of \"narrator\" in terms of how they address the reader (rather than in terms of their perception of events, as in the distinct concept of \"point of view\"). Likewise in non-narrative poems, distinctions can be made between the personal voice of a private lyric and the assumed voice (the persona) of a dramatic monologue.\n\nAn author uses sentence patterns not only to make a point or tell a story, but to do it in a certain manner that amounts to a personal signature, a characteristic way of presenting reality. It is perfectly understandable that an aspiring writer could fall in love with the work of a brilliant literary figure (for example, William Faulkner or William S. Burroughs) and then try to emulate that literary voice, but when an amateur aims deliberately for the sort of mature voice found in seasoned professionals, the result is likely to be literarily pretentious and largely unreadable. In fact, this sort of literary pretentiousness is a clear mark of an amateur. A strong, distinctive, authoritative writing voice is something most fiction writers want and is something any writer can bring out in himself or herself, but oddly enough, it can’t be produced by concentrating on it, nor can it be imparted by an editor or teacher. Such an effect is achieved simply by writing often and carefully. Spending creative energy in the service of the way sentences read as prose is likely to be at the expense of the characters or story. Writers should concentrate on characters and story and let their voice take care of itself.\n\nWriting coaches, teachers, and authors of creative writing books often speak of the writer's voice as distinguished from other literary elements. However, as voice is often described vaguely, their distinction may be only superficial. In some instances, voice is defined nearly the same as style; in others, as genre, literary mode, point of view, mood, or tone.\n\n"}
