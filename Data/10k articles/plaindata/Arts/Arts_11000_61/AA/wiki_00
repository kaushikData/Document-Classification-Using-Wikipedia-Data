{"id": "2506344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2506344", "title": "Aandhi", "text": "Aandhi\n\nAandhi (translation: Storm) is a 1975 Indian political drama film starring Sanjeev Kumar and Suchitra Sen, and directed by Gulzar. At the time it was alleged that the film was based on the life of the then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her relationship with her estranged husband, but in reality, only the look was inspired by the politician Tarkeshwari Sinha and Indira Gandhi. The story is based on a chance meeting of an estranged couple after several years, when wife Aarti Devi, now a leading politician happens to stay in the hotel run by her husband during an election campaign. The movie is noted for its songs composed by Rahul Dev Burman, written by Gulzar and sung by Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar.\n\nSuchitra Sen, the noted actress from Bengali cinema, who also worked in a few Hindi films, played the lead role of Aarti Devi after actress Vyjayanthimala refused the film as she had reservations about enacting the role.\n\nThe movie was not allowed a full release when Mrs. Gandhi was in power. The film was banned during the national emergency of 1975 a few months after its release. The ban immediately made the film a national topic. After her defeat in the 1977 national elections, the ruling Janata Party cleared it and had it premiered on the state-run television channel. It proved to be an important film in the career of Sen, and also her last Hindi film, as she retired from films altogether in 1978. At the 23rd Filmfare Awards, she was nominated for Filmfare Best Actress Award, while Sanjeev Kumar won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film itself won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie.\n\nJ.K. (played by Sanjeev Kumar) is a Hotel manager. One day he gallantly comes to the rescue of a politician's drunk daughter, Aarti (Suchitra Sen). Aarti falls in love with J.K. and both get married in a small ceremony. After few years, the married couple face many differences due to which they decide to separate. Years later, J.K. and Aarti meet again when she is an established politician. Despite the separation, both of them feel the closeness but fearing that her name might be tarnished and jeopardise her career, Aarti does not want to step forward.\n\n\nGulzar said the film had no semblance with the personal life of then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. He wanted to make film about modern Indian politician, and so he modelled the character on Indira Gandhi and to some extent on noted parliamentarian from Bihar, Tarkeshwari Sinha.\n\nAn early version of the film's story was written by veteran screenwriter Sachin Bhowmick, however it did not go well with Gulzar. He had an idea of an estranged couple meeting in an hotel after years, and started developing it. Hindi writer Kamleshwar joined as the writing crew, as the film started shooting. He later went on to write a full-fledged novel, \"Kali Aandhi\" (Black Storm), which is quite different from the film. Subsequently, the film was written simultaneously along with another Gulzar film, \"Mausam\" (1975), which was also written by Bhushan Banmali and Gulzar. Along with \"Khushboo\", \"Aandhi\" also released in the same year; 1975 proving to be the most prolific for director-screenwriter Gulzar's career.\n\nThe lead role of Aarti Devi was offered to actress Vyjayanthimala, who refused as she was fazed by physical resemblance of her character with Indira Gandhi. Later in 2011, she recounted \"Aandhi\" as one of few films she regretted not doing besides \"Mr and Mrs 55\" (1955) by Guru Dutt and \"Bandini\" (1963) by Bimal Roy, \"I admired Indiraji (Gandhi) so much so that I got cold feet when the role was offered to me.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, director Gulzar had approached Suchitra Sen, with screenplay for a film to be produced by Sohanlal Kanwar, however when she suggested some changes which Gulzar didn't agree upon, the film never got made. For film \"Aandhi\" producer J. Om Prakash insisted upon Gulzar to approach Sen again and actor Sanjeev Kumar was also keen on working with Sen. This time when the new script was done, Gulzar went to meet her in Kolkata, she agreed without any script issues, resulting in a \"casting coup\". In fact, Sen now promised Gulzar to not suggest any changes, and she stuck to her promise all through the filming. For the role Aarti Devi's estranged husband Sanjeev Kumar was already cast, who had previously worked in Gulzar's \"Koshish\" (1973), again as an older man. Kumar, one of finest actors of his generation, went on to collaborate with Gulzar in numerous films, like \"Mausam\" (1975), \"Angoor\" (1981) and \"Namkeen\" (1982).\n\n\nLike most of Gulzar's films, including \"Mausam\" and \"Ijaazat\", the narrative of Aandhi also unfolds through various flashbacks. The film was almost shot together with \"Mausam\", with Sanjeev Kumar playing the lead of an old man in both the films. Though Aandhi was released first, it ran into political controversy and portions of it has to be reshot, meanwhile Mausam was completed and released. The songs of the film were shot at various locations in Jammu and Kashmir state, like \"Tum Aa Gaye Ho\" was shot around Pari Mahal gardens in Srinagar, the classic \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se\" at the ruined 7th-8th century Martand Sun Temple, near Anantnag, while \"Is Mod Se Jaate Hai\" was shot at Pahalgam. Most of the songs have architectural ruins as a backdrop, depicting brokeness. Gulzar's family, wife actress Raakhee and daughter young Meghna Gulzar accompanied him on the shooting in Kashmir, however upon the return Rakhee and Gulzar separated.\n\nIn her memoir, daughter Meghna mentioned that Gulzar's wife Rakhee had once said to him, \"Agar aap shayar na hote, to bade hi ordinary hote\" (If you weren't a poet, you would have been very ordinary), this line was paraphrased and spoken by Aarti Devi to her husband in the film. The film looks at the life of a career-minded woman in the political arena, which is large dominated by men. Aarti inherits the legacy of her ambitious politician father, and comes in conflict with her role as dutiful wife. Soon she has to make choices to resolve the conflicts, and part ways with her husband, giving career rather duty as a daughter precedence over her personal life. When they meet again after nine years of separation, the dominating personality created under influence of her father has mellow and wisdom risen and she sees what she has missed. Yet she finds herself at a choice point once again, should she give up her political career or settle for matrimonial life. Aandhi takes on a feminist theme, also taken up in Ray's \"Mahanagar\" before, as it questions the price women often have to pay for political aspirations or career aspiration for that matter, when her unambitious hotel manager husband refuses to support.\n\nIt also satirizes the political opportunism in Indian democracy, where politicians visit the common man only every five years, at the time of elections. Through the lines of the song \"Salaam kijiye aali janaab aaye hain, ye paanch saalon ka dene hisaab aaye hain. (Bow to the masters.. They have come after five years...).\n\nAt the 23rd Filmfare Awards held in 1976, the film was nominated in various categories. \nThe music of this film was composed by Rahul Dev Burman with lyrics by Gulzar. Director-lyricist Gulzar first worked with Burman or Pancham as he commonly known as in \"Parichay\" (1972), giving popular songs like \"Beeti Na Bitai Raina\" and \"Musafir Hoon Yaaro\". In the following years their team gradually developed in the preceding years, eventually reaching a flourish in 1975 with two important film scores in the same year, \"Aandhi\" and \"Khushboo\". Previously Gulzar had like the use of pure notes (shuddha swara) in \"Raina Beete Jai\" from \"Amar Prem\" (1972) by Burman, a treatment which was used in the film's title music. The Lata Mangeshkar-Kishore Kumar duet \"Is Mod Se Jaate Hain\" extended the major scale usage with an added sharp (Teevra Madhyam) and reminiscence of Raga Yaman. Even the interludes included Indian classical instruments, like flute played by Hariprasad Chaurasia, sarod by Zarin Daruwala (Sharma) and sitar by Jairam Acharya, aided by a violin ensemble. The tune of \"Tere Bina..\" another Lata Mangeshkar-Kishore Kumar duet, was originally created as Durga Puja song, \"Jete Jete Potho Holo Deri\" in Bengali, which Gulzar liked and wrote lyrics around the tune \n\nThe RD-Gulzar team created for the film, songs which were both acclaimed and also popular songs of the decade. Songs like \"Tere Bina Zindagi\", \"Tum Aa Gaye Ho\" and \"Is Mod Se Jate Hain\" are considered eternal classics in Indian cinema. Songs \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se\" and \"Is Mod Se Jate Hain\" were listed 5th and 14th respectively on Binaca Geetmala annual list 1975. As per Planet Bollywood listings, \"Tere Bina Zindagi Se\" stands number 2 amongst top 10 Bollywood songs of the 1970s.\n\nThe film released in February 1975 amidst controversy, as rumours abound that it was based on the life of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Some of film's posters also hyped the similarity, with lines like, \"See your Prime Minister on screen\" and \"the story of a great woman political leader in post-Independence India\", were featured in a film magazine. Eventually, the film was given a go ahead after it was seen by two staff members and then Information and Broadcasting minister, I.K. Gujral. After the release, similarity was seen in the dressing and mannerism of lead Aarti Devi, played by Suchitra Sen and Mrs Gandhi, including the sarees and streak of white hair. During the June Legislative assembly election campaign in Gujarat, some opposition politicians were shown scenes of the film, depicting Aarti Devi smoking and drinking. As the film gained momentum, some ambitious exhibitors even started promoting the film with the line, \"See Indira Gandhi in Aandhi\", by now film was openly courting controversy, despite being only a mild satire on politicians. The film was eventually banned after 26 weeks after its release. In June State of Emergency was declared in India by Mrs. Gandhi and on 12 July despite heavy press censorship, \"The Statesman\" managed to carry the headline on its front page, \"Screening on Aandhi banned\". Gulzar who had then taken the film to Moscow International Film Festival got the news of the ban prior to the screening. He was also informed that the film publicity posters be taken down and the prints sent back.\n\nSubsequently, while \"Mausam\" was being premiered in December 1975, portions of Aandhi were being reshot. It included the controversial drinking scene and to establish the fact it was not a biopic, a scene with Aarti Devi looking at the framed image of Indira Gandhi tells her father that she wants to serve India like Mrs Gandhi, \"Woh meri ideal thi\" (She is my ideal) was inserted. After Indira Gandhi lost the general election of 1977 and Janata Party came to power it was re-released and also shown on the state-run national television. The film went on to become biggest hit of the Sen's Bollywood career, of which Aandhi was the last film, though she did two more Bengali films before retiring from acting in 1978. \n\nSome critics, including Subhash K. Jha have drawn thematic parallels between Indira Gandhi and her father Jawaharlal Nehru as depicted in the film also references to their personal lives. Also the role of Sanjeev Kumar, having shades of Mrs. Gandhi's husband. All through the controversy, Gulzar denied any connection with Indira Gandhi, it was only after she lost the national elections in 1977 and Janata Party came to power, did he admit, \"Yes, the film was made with Indira Gandhi in mind\". Sanjeev Kumar on his part said, only the characterisation of his role was based on Feroze Gandhi.\n\n"}

She worked in collaboration with her husband John Gavin throughout her career. She wrote the majority of his films and was arguably the first specialist screenwriter in the history of the Australian film industry. In newspapers she was advertised as the \"well known picture dramatizer\" and was praised for creating \"cleverly constructed stories\". Many of her films are considered lost.\n\nShe was born in Sydney as Agnes Adele Wangenheim. At the age of eighteen she married Barnett Kurtz, and became Agnes Kurtz. Barnett Kurtz had attempted to divorce Agnes in March 1897. Kurtz read a letter to the court in which Agnes said she wanted a divorce; Agnes said she did not want to divorce and wrote the letter just to annoy her husband; the divorce was not granted. In December 1897 Agnes sued for the divorce on the grounds of adultery by her husband and it was granted. Their divorce was highly publicized.\n\nOn October 3, 1898, Agnes married stage actor John Gavin, and for many years they worked together in Vaudeville and Bland Holt's stage company.\n\nIn 1904, Agnes Gavin was accused of abusing her neighbor with violent language, as well as menacing her with a hammer and threatening to chop down her door with an ax. The court ordered her bound to the peace for six months.\n\nIn her first marriage she had a daughter named Isadore, who died on September 12, 1917. John Gavin died in 1938 and Agnes followed in 1947.

{"id": "499651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=499651", "title": "Agnieszka Holland", "text": "Agnieszka Holland\n\nAgnieszka Holland (born 28 November 1948) is a Polish film and television director and screenwriter. Best known for her political contributions to Polish cinema, Holland is one of Poland's most eminent filmmakers. She began her career as assistant to directors Krzysztof Zanussi and Andrzej Wajda, and emigrated to France shortly before the 1981 imposition of the martial law in Poland.\n\nHolland is best known for her films \"Europa Europa\" (1991) and her 2011 drama \"In Darkness\", which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. In 2017 she received Alfred Bauer Prize (Silver Bear) for her film \"Spoor\" at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nHolland was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1948. She is the daughter of journalists Irena (née Rybczyńska) and Henryk Holland, who was a prominent Communist activist since 1935 and a captain of Polish Army. Holland's mother was Catholic and her father Jewish, but she was not brought up in any religious faith. Her father, Henryk Holland, lost his parents in a ghetto during the Holocaust, and spent most of his adult life denying his own Jewishness. Holland's mother participated in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as a member of the Polish resistance movement. Holland's Catholic mother aided several Jews during the Holocaust and received the Righteous Among the Nations medal from the Yad Vashem Institute in Israel.\n\nHolland was often ill as a child, and spent much of her time writing, drawing and directing short plays with other children. When she was eleven, her parents, whose marriage had been continuously contentious, divorced and her mother soon remarried a Jewish journalist, Stanislaw Brodski.\n\nHolland describes her relationship with her father as influential, but very distant. According to Holland, \"he was very interesting, very intelligent, and in the last years of his life he gave me a lot of doors to the art an the film. But he wasn't really interested in the young children and he only noticed me when he wanted to make a kind of show\". Holland recalls beings showed off to her father's friends during late night gatherings, and then being ignored in the morning when he was no longer entertaining. When Holland was thirteen, her father died under police interrogation while under house arrest in Warsaw. Although official reports labeled his death a suicide, his family and others believe he was murdered by the communist police, by defenestration.\n\nHolland attended the Stefan Batory Gymnasium and Lyceum in Warsaw. After high school, she studied at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) because, as she said in an interview, she thought the Czechoslovak films of the 1960s were very interesting: \"I watched first films of Miloš Forman, Ivan Passer, and Vera Chytilova. They seemed to be fantastically interesting to me, unlike what was being made in Poland at that time\". At FAMU, she also met her future husband and fellow director, Laco Adamik.\n\nHolland witnessed the Prague Spring of 1968 while in Czechoslovakia, and was arrested for her support of the dissident movement for the government reforms and political liberalization. She describes her time in Prague as her \"introduction to politics, violence, beauty, art, marriage, film and other arts...everything that happened to [her] after was based on this Czechoslovak experience\". During her time in prison, she spent time in a cell between two inmates who had fallen in love. It became her job to pass erotic notes and messages between them. Holland herself said that \"it was like phone sex and I was the cable\". It was during her time in Prague and in prison that she realized \"shed rather be an artist than an agitator\". Holland graduated from FAMU in 1971. She returned to Poland and wrote her first screenplay. Though it was censored and stopped from being developed, it attracted the attention of Andrezej Wajda, who became her mentor. Her daughter with Adamik, Kasia (born 28 December 1972), is also a director.\n\nThe events and confusing identities that made up her childhood resulted in Holland being known to have a signifiant struggle with identity, which manifests itself in many of her most famous films, specifically those related to Polish-Jewish interactions during the Holocaust. According to Holland, the tense relationship between Polish natives and Jewish Poles is still an ongoing issue. She says that \"some Jews from Poland are still hostile to the Polish...There are things in Catholicism and Polish nationalism which are deeply anti-Semitic\". Her widely acclaimed film \"Europa, Europa\" brought her success and recognition in Hollywood, but she has always, and still faces trouble in her career and life due to her past. Holland's \"mixed Polish Catholic and Jewish ancestry...places her at the hub of this century's violence\". Theses conflicts and hardships have been the inspiration for films such as \"Europa, Europa\" and \"In Darkness.\"\n\nHolland began her career as an assistant director for Polish film directors Krzysztof Zanussi and Andrzej Wajda. Her credits include Zanussi's 1973 film, \"Iluminacja\" (\"Illumination\"), and Wajda's 1983 film, \"Danton\". She was first assistant director on Wajda's 1976 \"Man of Marble\", an experience which gave her the capability to explore political and moral issues within the confines of an oppressive regime. Though she had a large role to play in the success of this film, her name was kept off of the credits because of censorship laws. In the first part of her career, Holland was unable to release any films under her own name because of the harsh censorship of Communist authorities. Wajda offered to adopt her but she refused, convinced that she could eventually release films under own name. Her first major film was \"Provincial Actors\" (\"Aktorzy Prowincjonalni\"), a 1978 chronicle of tense backstage relations within a small-town theater company which was an allegory of Poland's contemporary political situation. It won the International Critics Prize at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHolland directed two more major films in Poland, \"Fever\" (Gorączka, 1980, entered in the 31st Berlin International Film Festival) and \"A Lonely Woman\" (\"Kobieta samotna\") in 1981, before emigrating to France shortly before the December 1981 imposition of martial law in Poland. She was told that she could not return to Poland, and was unable to see or even have any contact with her daughter for over eight months. During this time, though safe, Holland was unable to create any successful films on her own.\n\nKnowing she could not return to communist Poland, Holland wrote scripts for fellow Polish filmmakers in exile: Wajda's \"Danton\", \"A Love in Germany\" (1983), \"The Possessed\" (1988) and \"Korczak\" (1990). She also developed her own projects with Western European production companies, directing \"Angry Harvest\" (1985), \"To Kill a Priest\" (1988) and \"Olivier, Olivier\" (1992). Holland received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film for \"Angry Harvest\", a German production about a Jewish woman on the run during World War II.\n\nSome of Holland's most famous work has been her depictions of the Holocaust. These works have been extremely controversial because of Holland's commitment to realism, and the acceptance of all types of individuals as both victims and as flawed human beings deserving of guilt. According to an article written about Holland, her films about the Holocaust \"cling to the world as she sees it. A world in which wisdom, if it exists at all, lies in accepting the violence and human frailty in everyone, without exception, including Jewish people\". This is most poignant in Holland's 2011 film \"In Darkness,\" in which Jewish and Polish Catholic characters are juxtaposted as having some of the same reprehensible qualities as well as redeemable ones.\n\nHolland's best-known film may be \"Europa Europa\" (1991), which was based on the life of Solomon Perel (a Jewish teenager who fled Germany for Poland after \"Kristallnacht\" in 1938). At the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Poland, Perel fled to the Soviet-occupied section of the country. Captured during the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Solomon convinced a German officer that he was German and found himself enrolled in the Hitler Youth. The film received a lukewarm reception in Germany, and the German Oscar selection committee did not submit it for the 1991 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. However, it attracted the attention of Michael Barker (who handled Orion Classics’ sales at the time). \"Europa, Europa\" was released in the United States, winning the 1991 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay.\n\nAlmost twenty years later, Holland released \"In Darkness\" (2011), a German-Canadian-Polish co production that dramatized the story of a Polish sewage worker who aided a group of Jewish refugees by hiding them in the sewers of Lwów during the time when Jewish people in the city were being sent to extermination camps. The story focuses on the relationships between Native Poles and Jewish people during the Holocaust. The characters of \"In Darkness\" are shown to us as having some strong similarities, despite the fact that the realities for Jews and Ethnic Poles, specifically those depicted specifically in the film, are extremely different. By comparing The Polish protagonist to the Jewish ones, Holland recreates the morally confusing  and physically brutal world that though very different for those who were hunted, was everywhere during the Third Reich. This juxtapostion seemed to be clear reflection of Holland's own personal experience, specifically her struggle with identity and anti-semitism.\n\nUntil her successful 1991 film \"Europa, Europa,\" Holland was barely recognized as an acclaimed filmmaker in Hollywood. The film came about because of a roller coaster ride with the future producer of the film: Artur Brauner. Holland had been treated to day at Disneyland by the American Academy when she was in the running as a nominee for a foreign Oscar for her film \"Angry Harvest.\" After the difficultly she had getting \"Angry Harvest\" made, she had almost decided to give up filmmaking once and for all, but Brauner was convinced he had a perfect project for her. During her trip to Disney, Holland, \"against her better judgement decided to ride a roller coaster with her producer. After they stepped off, Holland was shaking with fear as Brauner whipped a contract out of his pocket: \"Sign!\"\". The success of this film got the attention of mainstream Hollywood, which is what gave Holland the opportunity to direct the film adaption of the 1911 world famous novel: \"The Secret Garden.\" This was Holland's first movie made for a major studio with a broad American public in mind. It was a huge change in style for Holland, who was known at the point for her generally dark and pessimistic directorial perspective.\n\nA friend of Polish writer and director Krzysztof Kieślowski, Holland collaborated on the screenplay for his film, \"\". Like Kieślowski, Holland frequently examines issues of faith in her work. Much of her film work has a strong political slant. Government reprisals, stifling bureaucratic machinery, sanctioned strikes and dysfunctional families are represented in her early work. In a 1988 interview Holland said that although women were important in her films, feminism was not the central theme of her work. She suggested that when she was making films in Poland under the Communist regime, there was an atmosphere of cross-gender solidarity against censorship (the main political issue). Holland said that she was interested in happenings between people, not the politics occurring outside them; in this context, “maybe you could say that all my movies are political.”\n\nHolland's later films include \"Olivier, Olivier\" (1992), \"The Secret Garden\" (1993), \"Total Eclipse\" (1995), \"Washington Square\" (1997), the HBO production \"Shot in the Heart\" (2001), \"Julie Walking Home\" (2001), and \"Copying Beethoven\" (2006).\n\nIn a 1997 interview, when asked how her experiences as a director have influenced her films, Holland said “filmmakers of the younger generation lack life experience” and, as a result, lack many of the tools needed to breathe humanity into their characters. Compared to directors of her generation, she feels that the younger generation comes from wealthy families, goes straight to film schools and watches movies primarily on videotape. Holland suggests that this results in what she calls a “numbness” and “conventionalization” of contemporary cinema.\n\nIn 2003, Holland was a member of the jury at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival. The following year she directed \"Moral Midgetry\", the eighth episode of the third season of the HBO drama series \"The Wire\".\n\nIn 2006, Holland returned to direct the eighth episode of the fourth season (\"Corner Boys\"). Both were written by novelist Richard Price. Show runner David Simon said that Holland was \"wonderful behind the camera\" and staged the fight between Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell in \"Moral Midgetry\" well.\n\nIn 2007 Holland, her sister Magdalena Łazarkiewicz and her daughter Katarzyna Adamik directed the Polish political drama series \"Ekipa\", and in 2008 Holland became the first president of the Polish Film Academy. On 5 February 2009, the \"Krakow Post\" reported that Holland would direct a biopic about Krystyna Skarbek entitled \"Christine: War My Love\".\n\nHer 2011 film, \"In Darkness\", was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. In January 2012, the film was one of the five nominees.\n\nHolland accepted an offer to film a three-part drama for HBO about Jan Palach, who immolated himself in January 1969 to protest \"normalization\" after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. The resulting miniseries, \"Burning Bush\", has been shown in Poland and Germany and selected for a Special Presentation screening at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. She also won the Czech Lion Award in the Best Director category for this TV series.\n\nOn 1 December 2013, the film screened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, where Holland was invited to deliver the Rajiv Vaidya Memorial Lecture: Viewing History through the Filmmaker's Lens. It was also shown at the 2013 Philadelphia Film Festival. Holland was a guest speaker at Brooklyn College.\n\nIn December 2013, Holland was announced as director of NBC's next miniseries \"Rosemary's Baby\", a two-part version of the best selling novel by Ira Levin with Zoe Saldana.\n\nAgnieszka Holland took over the chairmanship of the European Film Academy board in January 2014.\n\nIn March 2016, it was announced that Holland is set to direct an adaptation of Peter Swanson's best-selling novel \"The Kind Worth Killing\", a psychological thriller about a ruthless female killer.\n\nIn February 2017, Agnieszka Holland received The Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize for \"Spoor\". The award is given to the films that are perceived to open new perspectives in the art of film.\n\n\nAgnieszka Holland translated from Czech to Polish the novel \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\". She volunteered for this task after meeting the author, Milan Kundera, in 1982, and reading the manuscript; both were living in Paris at that time. Holland found the events of the book relatable not only to her personal experience of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia but also to the strikes of 1980 in Poland, and therefore wanted to introduce the book to the Polish audience. The translation was originally published by the London-based publisher \"Aneks\" and has since been widely reprinted.\n\n\n"}

AAAC has come to see the arts in terms of their historical and spiritual relationship to diverse neighborhoods.\n\nThe Asian American Arts Centre was founded in 1974 in New York as the Asian American Dance Theatre (AADT), a not-for-profit community arts organization. It is one of the older community arts organizations in Chinatown, Manhattan, beginning with the start of the Asian American movement and growing out of Basement Workshop with other Asian American cultural and political organizations in New York.\n\nIn 1974, the organization operated out of the New York Public Library to offer dance classes and dance presentations to the community. It obtained its original location on the third floor of 26 Bowery Street as an Artist-In-Residence (AIR) tenant in 1976; the education programs were expanded into a Saturday Community School on-site, which included dance and later art classes for children and adults. The organization started its Arts-in-Education program in 1978, conducting workshops and lectures in city-wide public schools.\n\nIn 1982, the organization created the Asian American Artists' Slide Archive (the first public archive for Asian American artists in the United States), started an annual nine-month Artists-in-Residence program, and organized its first exhibition, \"Eye to Eye\". This exhibition, which featured a panel with John Yau, David Diao, Margo Machida, Lucy Lippard, Lydia Okumura, Kit Yin Snyder, and John Woo, was the first of its kind to bring together Asian American visual artists on the East Coast.\n\nThe \"Eye to Eye\" exhibition initiated a series of visual art exhibitions as part of a new program within the AADT called the Asian Arts Institute, consisting of three to five contemporary visual art exhibitions and one folk art exhibition each year. The Traditional Arts Presentation and Documentation program began in 1985. The organization adopted its current name, the Asian American Arts Centre (AAAC), in 1987 to encompass both the dance company (AADT) and the visual arts program.\n\nIn addition to regular exhibitions at the Bowery location in Chinatown, AAAC held many of its programs at other sites and locations in the country. In 1989, the Arts Centre organized its most ambitious exhibition, \"CHINA: June 4, 1989\", in response to the Tiananmen Square student massacre. Accumulating contributions from over 300 artists over the next several months, \"CHINA: June 4, 1989\" was exhibited at the Blum Helman Gallery and PS1 (now MoMA PS1) in 1990, and travelled to Austin, Texas, Cleveland, Ohio, and later to Flint, Michigan in 1994. In conjunction with the \"CHINA: June 4, 1989\" visual art exhibition, the dance company mounted a program of performances in 1990 titled A Memorial Performance of Music, Poetry and Dance which featured Zuni Icosahedron’s U.S. debut of “Deep Structure…” among other performances by contributing artists. A smaller selection of artworks from this exhibition, including art by Martin Wong, was exhibited in Hong Kong in 1990 for the first memorial of the protests. The Arts Centre was contracted to curate an exhibition in the U.S. Senate’s Russell Rotunda in Washington, D.C. upon the escape of Chai Ling and Wang Dan, two former leaders of the student demonstrations, from China. However, upon the rejection of two proposed artworks by Byron Kim and Zhang Hongtu for the exhibition by Senate sponsors, AAAC refused to participate and withdrew the artworks it had planned to exhibit shortly before the show’s debut.\n\nThe Asian American Dance Theatre continued to perform under the artistic direction of Eleanor Yung in New York and around the United States until 1992, and was structured around four areas of programming: (1) its annual New York Dance Season, (2) touring and special performances, (3) Arts-in-Education programs, and (4) the Community School. AADT held its own New York Season in contemporary dance every year from 1976 to 1990. The dance company’s total repertoire, however, encompassed contemporary dance and traditional Asian folk/classical dance from countries such as China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bali, and the Pacific Islands. For its touring performances, AADT’s programs usually consisted of traditional dances and sometimes contemporary dances. AADT also organized special programs such as the \"D’Asia Vu Performance Series\", which ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s. The Arts-in-Education programs and Community School were continued from earlier programming begun in the late 1970s.\n\nDuring the 14-year run of AADT’s New York Season, the dance company performed at various sites and events throughout New York including Riverside Dance Festival, Marymount Manhattan College Theater, Pace University Schimmel Center, Dance Theater Workshop, Open Eye Theater, Clark Center NYC, and Synod House. For its touring performances, AADT performed at colleges and sites in Texas, Ohio, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and numerous other states throughout the country. AADT collaborated with notable choreographers Saeko Ichinohe, Sun Ock Lee, and Reynaldo Alejandro in the Asian New Dance Coalition; the company also invited guest choreographers, dancers, performers, and artists such as Yung Yung Tsuai, Muna Tseng, Zuni Icosahedron, Sin Cha Hong, poets Kimiko Hahn & Shu Ting, playwright David Henry Hwang, and artist Zhang Hongtu. Several dance company performances are currently archived in video format at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.\n\nAAAC has produced exhibition catalogs, videos, and sound recordings that document visual arts, oral traditions, music, and performances. \"ARTSPIRAL,\" a magazine published by AAAC that focuses broadly on city-wide Asian American cultural issues, ran as an annual print publication from 1988 to 1993; it was revived in 2008 as an online blog. The Artists-in-Residence program, which supported 19 young artists in total, including Zhang Hongtu, Margo Machida, Yong Soon Min, Byron Kim, and Dinh Q. Lê, concluded in 1993.\n\nAfter 1993 AAAC's programs consisted of four areas: (1) contemporary Asian American art exhibitions, (2) folk art exhibitions and research, (3) public education, and (4) the development of a permanent collection. These programs encompassed the preservation of Asian cultural traditions as well as the development of contemporary Asian and Asian American art forms.\n\nAAAC’s main annual exhibition presented young Asian American artists or artists significantly influenced by Asia. The Arts Centre also organized annual solo exhibitions for mid-career artists. Contemporary artists who have exhibited at AAAC include Vito Acconci, Ai Weiwei, Tomie Arai, Shusaku Arakawa, Natvar Bhavsar, Wafaa Bilal, Luis Camnitzer, Chen Zhen, Emily Cheng, Mel Chin, Albert Chong, Kip Fulbeck, Chitra Ganesh, Gu Wenda, Zarina Hashmi, Tehching Hsieh, Venancio C. Igarta, Yun-Fei Ji, Indira Freitas Johnson, Matsumi Kanemitsu, Ik-Joong Kang, Byron Kim, Swati Khurana, Barbara Kruger, Anna Kuo, Kwok Man Ho, Dinh Q. Lê, Simone Leigh, Choong Sup Lim, Nam June Paik, Alfonso A. Ossorio, Howardena Pindell, Faith Ringgold, Tara Sabharwal, Toshio Sasaki, Dread Scott, Roger Shimomura, Kunie Sugiura, Tam Van Tran, Tseng Kwong Chi, Toyo Tsuchiya, Martin Wong, Xu Bing, Lily Yeh, Charles Yuen, Danny N. T. Yung, and Zhang Hongtu. Fred Wilson guest curated an exhibition titled \"Aurora\" in 1990. AAAC partnered with the Teachers College at Columbia University in 1994 to hold a joint conference and exhibition titled \"Asian American Art and Culture in American Ambiance\" and \"Betrayal/Empowerment\" respectively.\n\nThe Folk Art program consisted of performances, lectures, and exhibitions, and presented traditional artists during the Lunar New Year every year. AAAC produced a collection of materials—including a video documentary titled \"Singing to Remember\" in 1971; and later in 2000, CD audio recordings, essays, and song lyrics compiled in a book titled \"Uncle Ng Comes to America\"—that captured the life story and artistry of Ng Sheung Chi, also known as Uncle Ng. Ng, a native of Taishan County in southwestern China—a region that generated the majority of Chinese immigrants to Chinatown before the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965—immigrated to the U.S. in 1979. Ng became well-known in New York’s Chinatown as a singer and composer of \"muk’yu\", or wooden fish, a type of narrative folk song typically sung in the Toisanese dialect. Gaining national recognition as a folk artist due to the Arts Centre’s efforts, Ng was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship in 1992. The Folk Art program also showcased traditions such as seal carving, shadow puppets, pointed brush technique in Chinese calligraphy, and ornamental art in classical Chinese architecture. As a gateway for artists, dancers, staff, interns, students, teachers, volunteers, and audience, AAAC has passed on the traditional and contemporary dynamics of its community’s heritage.\n\nThe Public Education program began with figure drawing classes, evolving to offer gallery talks, performances, t'ai chi workshops, and the on-site Saturday Community Art School for children. The off-site education programs took place in public and private schools, and in other community sites in the five boroughs in New York. “Stories of Chinatown”, an off-site program organized in partnership with M.S. 131 that ran from 2001 to 2007, brought local seniors and youth together to make ceramic mural portraits portraying the seniors’ lives.\n\nA frequent recipient and benefactor of government grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) since the 1970s, the Arts Centre experienced a loss in funding when Congress reduced the NEA’s annual budget from $180 million to $99.5 million in 1996 as a result of pressure from conservative American interest groups and Congress members including the American Family Foundation, Heritage Foundation, and former U.S. Senator Jesse Helms amid controversy around government funding toward sexually explicit art by artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. This also impacted the availability of state- and city-level grant funding from the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) and New York City Department of Cultural Affairs (DCLA), both of which receive funding from the NEA. As a local cultural non-profit that derived a large portion of its budget from public funding, AAAC was forced to scale back its programming from the mid-1990s to the late-2000s.\n\nIn 2010, AAAC officially moved its location from 26 Bowery Street to 111 Norfolk Street. No longer possessing a gallery space, the Arts Centre continues to remain active in the Lower Manhattan community by organizing off-site exhibitions and panel discussions, and by pursuing public arts education through its blog, social media sites, and contributions to publications such as \"Asian American Matters: A New York Anthology\" by Russell Leong. Concurrently, AAAC has redistributed much of its organizational activity towards archival documentation, historical record-keeping, and organizing its extensive permanent collection. As part of its off-site programming, the Arts Centre has frequently collaborated with the New Museum’s biennial Ideas City Festival—in 2013, it hosted a panel discussion at the Festival titled \"Space Time: Presence\" that addressed concepts of quantum space-time in both an aesthetic and scientific context. In collaboration with Think!Chinatown in 2018, AAAC produced a video introduction to fifty artists in its archive, made public in its \"Art Across Archives\" program.\n\nAlong with 20 other New York City-based organizations including the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, En Foco, and Picture the Homeless, AAAC has both endorsed and received an endorsement from the People’s Cultural Plan (PCP), an equity initiative launched in 2017 to redistribute city government funding and support to artists, art workers, tenants, community art organizations, and various historic neighborhoods in New York City. The PCP’s policy plan for the city is made up of three platforms: equitable housing, land, and development policies; labor equity; and public funding equity.\n\n\n\nThe Arts Centre includes a digital and physical archive. The archive documents Asian American art over the last 60-plus years, and in many cases, the relationship between the artist and AAAC. The physical archive, which is stored at 111 Norfolk Street, consists of approximately 1700 entries of artists’ materials, including biographical materials, publications, statements, project plans, reviews, exhibition materials (press releases, fliers, etc.), catalogs, taped interviews, and samples of works via slides, photographs and/or digital files. The digital archive, which accounts for 10% of the physical archive and contains over 170 entries, is called \"artasiamerica\" and is accessible online.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20722821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20722821", "title": "Batlló Majesty", "text": "Batlló Majesty\n\nThe Batlló Majesty (, ) is a large 12th-century Romanesque wooden crucifix, now in the National Art Museum of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. It is one of the most elaborate examples in Catalonia of an image of Christ on the Cross symbolizing his triumph over death.\n\nThe Batlló Majesty is a 12th-century Romanesque polychrome wood carving now in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, Catalonia. The Batlló Majesty is one of the finest and best-preserved examples of these Catalan sculptures. Carved wooden images were a fundamental element in churches as objects of worship. One of the most elaborate types in Catalonia was the Christ in Majesty, images of Christ on the Cross that symbolize his triumph over death, of which the most outstanding is the Batlló Majesty. The frontal geometric composition of the tunic decorated in circles and floral motifs is reminiscent of the refined Byzantine and Hispano-Moorish fabrics held in such high esteem in the Christian West during this time. The great reference for this type was the Volto Santo in Lucca (Tuscany, Italy), which was regarded as having miraculous origins and was the object of pilgrimage and extraordinary devotion from the end of the eleventh century.\n\nAt the end of the 11th century wood sculpture flourished in Catalonia. Carvers used four main formats to represent the Crucifixion:\n\nWood carving workshops were still active in the 12th century in the western part of the region in the high valleys of the Pyrenees in Catalonia. There are over thirty examples of these large crucifixes, called \"majestats\". The Batlló Majesty has been linked to the region of Olot near Girona. As with much medieval art, its creator is unknown, although a medieval legend credits Nicodemus with producing the sculpture soon after the actual Crucifixion, a pious tradition repeated elsewhere in Europe in connection with similar monumental crosses, like the better known Volto Santo in the church of San Martino, Lucca, to which they bear a notable similarity in appearance and date, these Catalan crucifixes were believed to have miraculous powers.\n\nA large number of majestats still exist from the Catalan provinces of Girona, Barcelona and Lleida, and the French province of Roussillon, such that some scholars believe these are monumental crosses once hung in almost every Romanesque church built in these regions as rood crosses. It is possible that the \"Majestats\" were the focus of an important and popular cult veneration in these regions as early as the tenth century. They were normally hung near portals of the churches or altars dedicated to the Savior. Often the backs of the majestats were painted with the Agnus Dei and the Evangelist's symbols suggesting that these crosses were also carried in processions.\n\nProbably it comes from a church in the district of Garrotxa (Girona). It entered the museum's collection donated by Enric Batlló to the Province of Barcelona on a permanent loan, 1914. Its inventory Number is 015937-000.\n\nThe cross was procured for the museum in 1914 by the collector Enric Batlló, for whom the piece is now named. It was also the same family that commissioned the construction of Casa Batlló in 1877 Barcelona, Catalonia. At the time of its first arrival at the museum, it was covered with a thick coating of varnish that obscured but helped preserve its bright colors, which have now been restored.\n\nRecent studies have revealed the pigments used to produce the colors: the red from cinnabar and the blue from lapis lazuli. Both pigments were very expensive and the sculpture is believed to have come from a studio of some importance perhaps the studio around the monastery of Ripoll.\n\nThe Batlló Majesty presents Christ bearing his suffering with noble stoicism. It is a triumphant Christ wearing a colobium, or a long, sleeveless tunic. Although the corners of his mouth turn slightly downward, Christ's open eyes and unfurrowed brow create the impression of a self-possessed impassivity. One of the striking features of the Batlló Majesty compared to others, is the well-conserved polychromy. Christ’s colobium, in imitation of rich oriental silk, is decorated with blue floral designs surrounded by circular red frames embellished with dots and circles. A thin belt with an elaborate interlace knot pulls the tunic in above Christ’s hips, making the fabric above it swell out slightly and curving the path of its flat, wide vertical folds. Such robes, called colobiums are linked with royal and priestly functions and provide a message of strength to the viewing audience. They can be seen as a visualization of image of the Apocalyptic Christ from the Book of Revelation. The iconographic tradition of Jesus in a colobium dates to 586 in a manuscript of the Syriac Gospels called the Rabbula Gospels, written by the monk Rabbula somewhere in Mesopotamia. It is thought that the tradition of depicting Christ in such costume was brought to Catalonia by artisans from Pisa who arrived in 1114 to help Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona in his conquest of the Balearic Islands.\n\nA Latin inscription above his head reads, \"JHS NAZARENUS REX IUDEORUM\" (\"Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews”) as in biblical accounts (Matthew 27:37, Mark 15:26, Luke 23:38, John 19:19).\n\nThe chronology of the Batlló Majesty is difficult to date, but the inscription on the cross and the painting could be placed in the eleventh century, although other authors dating back to the twelfth century based on the painting’s similarity to ones seen in the area of Ripoll, mid-twelfth century, which is used as an argument to support this dating, and can now be placed into 1150. The tunic also has an analogy with an Islamic motif abacus of the cloister of the abbey of Saint-Pierre de Moissac, which seems to prove the spread during the Romanesque period.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5013523", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5013523", "title": "Book talk", "text": "Book talk\n\nA booktalk in the broadest terms is what is spoken with the intent to convince someone to read a book. Booktalks are traditionally conducted in a classroom setting for students; however, booktalks can be performed outside a school setting and with a variety of age groups as well. It is not a book review, a book report, or a book analysis. The booktalker gives the audience a glimpse of the setting, the characters, and/or the major conflict without providing the resolution or denouement. Booktalks attempt to make listeners care enough about the content of the book to want to read it. A long booktalk is usually about five to seven minutes long and a short booktalk is generally 180 seconds to 4 minutes long.\n\nAccording to Carol Littlejohn (\"Keep Talking That Book! Booktalks to Promote Reading Volume II\") there is \"no known inventor of booktalking\". As far back as teachers and librarians have promoted reading and literacy booktalks have existed. One of the oldest sources to mention the actual art form of booktalking is Amelia H. Munson's \"An Ample Field\" (1950) and in \"The Fair Garden and the Swarm of Beasts\" Margaret Edwards discusses performing booktalks in the 1930s when it was difficult to get into Baltimore schools. The actual term \"booktalk\" was coined in 1985 by children's author and literature teacher Aidan Chambers, in his book \"Booktalk: occasional writing on literature and children\".\n\nIn the 1950s, booktalks were originally designed to motivate young adults to read because they had the freedom to read but chose not to. Teenagers don’t read for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to): the notion that reading is not cool, unnecessary, and uninteresting. Books also have to compete with movies, television, the Internet, and other media. By the 1980s, there are also booktalks for adults. For example, booktalks in senior centers and in adult book discussion groups in libraries. Booktalks for adults were geared towards the recommendation of new titles rather than the motivation to read. By the 1990s, booktalks were also created for children to motivate kids to read at a younger age. However, booktalks for children focused heavily on teaching kids to read using mostly picture books.\n\nThe purpose of a booktalk is to motivate listeners in order to foster good reading, writing and speaking skills by encouraging self-directed learning through reading. Booktalkers also try to incorporate learning opportunities following a book talk which include discussion topics, ideas for journals, papers, poems or other creative writing, panel discussions or presentations (visually and/or orally). Book talks are commonly used by school and public librarians, teachers, and reading coaches, to get a reader interested in a book or to recommend similar books. It is an excellent tool for reading motivation. Booktalks were used long before the advent of the Digital Age, and the \"traditional\" booktalk of yesterday is still used today. However, librarians and educators have been able to utilize the Internet and computer software in order to modernize and improve book talks.\n\nThe traditional booktalk consists of a presenter using few tools to engage his audience, save the script he has created and a copy of the book itself. Having no real \"bells and whistles\", the booktalker has to get and keep his audience's attention. While there are plenty of sources available, both on the Web and in print (see external links and further reading below), that provide examples of ready-to-present booktalks most librarians and teachers recommend that the presenter read at least a part of the book he will be booktalking. The presenter must engage the audience as any good public speaker would, with an excited feeling, a non-monotonous tone of voice, and eye contact.\n\nGenre booktalks and first-person booktalks are fairly popular. Genres to consider for a booktalk may include classics, sports, historical fiction, science fiction and fantasy, romance, fairy tales, short stories, mystery, adventure, non-fiction, short or thin books, horror, realistic contemporary fiction, humor, adult books, graphic novels, and poetry. A genre booktalk should consist of multiple books within one chosen genre. The number of books talked depends on the age of the audience. It is encouraged to have multiple genre booktalks ready in case the presenter starts to \"lose\" his audience.\n\nThe first person booktalk is considered most suitable for an \"entertainer\" presenter and is best suited for books written in first person. The booktalker presents himself as a character from a book. The presenter is not limited to characters of the same sex. However, when considering presenting an opposite sex first person booktalk the presenter must keep in mind his audience, as some audiences may be unable or unwilling to use their imagination during the booktalk.\n\nSome librarians and educators consider the non-fiction booktalk to be the best way to win over a young adult audience. Non-fiction booktalks allow the presenter to tell astonishing yet true stories that can garner an emotional response. Non-fiction booktalks include a wide range of topics such as poetry, history, music, entertainment, crafts, folklore, crime, psychology, UFOs, etc. They lend themselves to audience participation, since the presenter can ask questions throughout the booktalk, such as, \"Who has heard of a ___?\" \"Have you ever seen a ____?\" or \"Who knows what a ____ is?\" Common approaches to nonfiction booktalks include using visual or mental imagery, vignettes, notable facts and astonishing statistics, booktalking in the first-person point of view, or initially presenting a nonfiction book as though it were fiction and surprising the audience by revealing that it is nonfiction. Indexes and appendixes should be mentioned if they are included in the book.\n\nFrom creating book talks on Power Point to creating a multimedia booktalk with sound clips and video excerpts, the booktalk has gotten a makeover thanks to the Digital Age (Keane & Cavanaugh, 2009). A number of websites, listed below, have been created solely for the purpose of sharing booktalks or guiding a librarian or educator on how to create one.\n\nTeachers can use these sites to create an assignment for their students, asking them to visit a certain number of sites, browse the reviews and/or booktalks and select one book from each site that interests them. From this list the student can then choose one book to read and report on. The teacher can create a book review blog (i.e. ) and have the students post their reviews online, as well as comments on other student reviews, subject to teacher approval. By utilizing Web 2.0, such as wikis and podcasts, and software such as Power Point, the presenter can create multimedia booktalks that incorporate film and videos, music and the Internet. Using a projection screen and computer, the presenter no longer has to pass around a book to show cover art, illustrations, or photographs.\n\nWithin the scholastic setting librarians can work with teachers to create a set of rotating video booktalks that play in any location that have access to the school's closed-circuit television system. The video booktalk acts as a book trailer and can be as simple as a taped presentation from a podium to as complex as a reenactment of a scene from a book. The possibilities for the contents of a video booktalk are limited only to the creator's imagination and budget. Creating a video booktalk can be used a class assignment, teaching students not only the tools of a booktalk but incorporating the use of audio/visual materials. Software programs, such as Photo Story, iMovie, and Windows Movie Maker, can be used to create a video booktalk without any expensive equipment.\n\nOne way to find out which types of booktalks work best is to create an evaluation form for the audience to complete. Some booktalkers may have a natural inclination for first-person booktalks, while others may present typical third-person book talks, or a book talk that's been digitally enhanced to keep the interest of the audience. The audience will also determine the length of the presentation, how many booktalks are presented, how much information to disclose, and the length of the individual booktalks. The audiences of booktalks are broken down into the following categories: students (broken down into the sub categories: young children, older children, and teens), adults, senior citizens and professionals (for librarians and educators).\n\nYoung children have shorter attention spans so booktalks must be kept brief. Older children and teens are able to focus and sit at attention for longer periods of time and so booktalk presentations can be built in to fit within one class period (30–45 minutes). Within this timeframe 15-20 booktalks that are 2–3 minutes in length can be presented. The presenter will want to appeal to as many students as possible so the individual booktalks should consist of many genres.\n\nAdult and senior citizen booktalks don’t have to be strictly limited to adult titles. Choosing a children's title that will also pique the interest of adults helps keep this audience aware of current children's literature. The presenter doesn’t need to limit himself/herself to the obvious literary groups and books clubs. Booktalks for senior citizens that relate to the life experiences or periods of time that the group may have lived during, help keep the audience intrigued and involved. The presenter should also take into consideration books that available in large print or audio format for older audiences.\n\nBooktalks for professionals, such as librarians and teachers, should generally be up to 5 minutes in length and include plot summary, genre, interest and reading levels, and note controversial issues and curricular interests. Booktalks of this nature can be presented in a lecture format. The presenter may also consider including critical reviews from reliable publications.\n\nMost booktalk creators and presenters suggest only writing an outline of a booktalk so the booktalk can be presented less as a lecture and more as a conversation. They also recommend that the presenter not memorize a script. It is up to the discretion of the presenter exactly how much of the plot to talk about in the booktalk, but it is universally acknowledged that a booktalker should never give away the ending of the book.\n\nIn \"The Booktalker's Bible\" seven parameters are considered when planning a book talk: 1. Size of the group; 2. Age of the group; 3. Geography; 4. Time; 5. Money; 6. Frequency; and 7. Schedule. This title also lists six \"Golden Rules of Booktalking\": 1. Read the Book; 2. Like the Books You Booktalk; 3. Know Your Audience; 4. Booktalk; 5. Don't Tell the Ending!; 6. Leave a List.\n\nWhen creating a booktalk, or editing a previously created booktalk, the presenter needs to remember to keep the talk short and simple. The presenter needs to be able to grab the audience's attention in the first sentence. Sonja Cole, host of the video booktalk website Bookwink.com, recommends keeping a booktalk for children to no more the seven sentences. Introduce the main character and setting in sentences 1 and 2, Summarize the conflict in 3 to 5, and sentences 6 and 7 should get the audience thinking about what happens next in the story. When booktalking it is important to remember to connect with their previous experiences and engage with them. The presenter can also define and discuss the characteristics of the type of booktalk and some audiences will benefit from a comparison of print and film versions and why the book is almost always better.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to approach a book talk. Lucy Schall (author of many guides to book talks) describes the three following common ways to perform a book talk for all ages:\n\nCaroline Feller Bauer offers the following unique alternatives to perform a booktalk for children:\n\nThere is limited research conducted on the effectiveness of booktalks but they clearly demonstrate the increase of booktalked titles being circulated and lack of effect on reading attitudes.\n\nJoni Bodart's dissertation (1987) concluded that:\n\nPamela Dahl's thesis (1988) concluded that:\n\nGail Reeder's dissertation (1991) concluded that:\n\nTerrence David Nollen's dissertation (1992) concluded that:\n\n\n\n"}

It relies heavily on a stripped Classicism with Baroque and Beaux-Arts inflections. It was popular primarily during the first three decades of the 20th century, particularly among designers of railroad stations.\n\nThe term was coined in 1956 by architectural historian Carroll L.V. Meeks in his book \"The Railroad Station: An Architectural History\". Meeks credits Burham's staff architect, Charles B. Atwood, with the genesis of the design. Consulting with railroad engineer J.F. Wallace, who ensured that the layout and tracks conformed to accepted industrial practice, Atwood designed the temporary railroad station which served the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Atwood's use of the triumphal arch and colonnade in this structure was widely praised, and Meeks says Burnham strongly embraced the new style after the exposition. Burnham Baroque became Daniel Burnham's favored architectural idiom.\n\nBurnham Baroque relies heavily on Classicism, with restrained Baroque and Beaux-Arts styles often incorporated into a building's fundamental structure (such as arches) as well as its details and ornament. Architectural historian Francis Morrone has gone further, arguing that Burnham Baroque combines the Chicago school with the Neoclassic and Beaux-Arts elements used by the City Beautiful movement. But where the City Beautiful movement \"slathers\" ornamentation over a building, Burnham Baroque uses ornament to accentuate structure.\n\nBurnham Baroque was a highly influential architectural style. Burnham Baroque was one of five architectural styles utilized by the architectural firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst & White in the 1920s. It was widely mimicked by architects designing large American metropolitan railroad stations.\n\nExamples of Burnham Baroque include:\n\n"}

In another sense, they can be seen as another element in any product development process. The creative director may also assume the roles of an art director, copywriter, or lead designer. The responsibilities of a creative director include leading the communication design, interactive design, and concept forward in any work assigned. For example, this responsibility is often seen in industries related to advertisement. The creative director is known to guide a team of employees with skills and experience related to graphic design, fine arts, motion graphics, and other creative industry fields. Some example works can include visual layout, brainstorming, and copywriting. To assume the role of a creative director, one must already have an existing set of skills and expertise in many areas. Often, these types of artists start up from the very beginning in fields that can relate to motion graphics, advertisement in television, and/or book (or magazine) publishing.\n\nIn the advertising industry, a creative director is determined to develop various marketing schemes and strategies for a company or client that he or she is hired by. Assuming one is hired by a company that is fairly well known and established, there would be some type of creative department or management that the director would work with. The creative director would also serve as the project manager that works directly with employers, and in most circumstances, they would be responsible for designing concepts for advertisements and other promotional needs for their client(s). Some examples of their duties involve copywriting and laying out chronological advertisement plans which explain the ongoing process of a project. It is important for an advertisement creative director to meet their goals at specific deadline with maximum efficiency as possible. To do so, they must be able to guide the creative department effectively from start to finish. Educational requirements of this position involve a blending of skills in business and journalism. To even be considered as a creative director, one would need to have a couple of years of experience in advertising (as little as five to as many as ten years).\n\nAdvertising creative directors are usually promoted from copy writing or art directing positions. Familiarity with film-making techniques is also common. Creative directors rise to become executive creative directors or chief creative officers, a position with executive responsibility for the entire creative department, and some progress to chairman of a firm.\n\nCreative directors usually possess a communication design or fine arts & animation degree. Copywriters may have degrees in journalism, language arts, or media innovation, or may develop more emphasis on advertising copy writing while pursuing a communication design degree.\n\nWith the increased team sizes and more specialised disciplines in the games industry, certain game designers are titled as 'creative director', 'executive designer', or 'game director'. A creative director in a video game company is usually responsible for product development across a number of titles and is generally regarded as the prime design authority across the company's product range. Some examples are Peter Molyneux, Sam Lake, Neil Druckmann, or Shigeru Miyamoto whose influence extends across more than one project.\n\nThe creative director has an important responsibility in this industry. The director must devise ideas to lead a video game project forward and many responsibilities involve working with various individuals or teams spread out within the entire project/video game production. This can include cross-functional collaboration with the various disciplines involved in games development. Academically speaking, a creative director is usually degree educated but there are some circumstances where a high school education strongly focusing on aspects such as art, graphics, computer science, and math can be acceptable and provide some valuable insight to students who hope to aspire in this field of work. Some skills that a creative director working in the video game industry may have include proficiency in computer programming and graphic development (illustrations, fine art) and have excellent interpersonal and writing skills (since they deal with many other clients and management leaders). The exact skills a game director possesses will depend on their background in the industry. Creative director, or game director, is not usually an entry level position, but in a smaller studio it can be. This is more common in start up companies for instance though normally one would have to earn that role by showing their skills and development over a period of years. The entertainment industry is not always a meritocracy, however, and sometimes people just luck into or inherit such positions. Creative directors have often done their share of lower level startup positions such as internships or assisting other directors in art related work fields. It is all about advancing through the career chain, and once one has earned the position a creative director, they may be eligible to work for larger and more popular game developing companies depending on how successful they have been with past collaborative projects.\n\nThe creative director in the film industry is referred to as the production designer. A production designer carries a large responsibility of designing the look of a movie. The job is similar to a creative director's role in the video game industry in that he or she manages a team of employees and has to consistently develop new ideas and methods of working. It is vital that designers in this field are able to produce expressive/creative ideas and translate them into something cinematic. Usually a certain sum of funds is distributed among different departments in the production of a film (in this case, the art department). Creative directors must decide on how to distribute and use the funds in the most efficient and effective way to ensure maximum quality in the films art department. An example can include the structuring of scenes and sets once a film begins to undergo the shooting process. During this process, it is important for creative directors to understand what props and effects should be used and how they should be used among various sets and scenes of the film. Some important qualifications that one should have include being able to manage teams, having expertise in design (specifically in theatre, interior sets and art design), being open minded to new ideas and methods in regards to organizing film sets, and having an understanding of coordinating among different departments in order to move a project towards success. A creative director in the film industry usually starts out in lower ranks of the chain, such as an assistant to other art directors and/or as a draughtsman.\n\nCreative directors in the field of music can be broken down into various key roles that make up the whole (it may be said that one can be known as a 'music director'). It is in this artistic field where the individual, the director, must master tasks that are relatable to one another. An orchestral conductor is a prime example (but not exclusive) of this role and how one would direct music and harmonize symphonies as well as guide/direct other musician’s in an ensemble. The three roles in this sense can consist of: the active musician, the musical art director, and the instructor that teaches and informs music for society. The main requirements one would need to have is an extensive background and knowledge of music (being able to master one or more instrument), understanding the principles and theories behind music composition, developing an understanding and connection with musicians that the director would be working with to communicate music in a harmonic and creative sense, and most importantly being able to develop leadership skills among other musicians.\n\nCreative director is the highest creative position in a fashion house. The creative director does not design clothes, but instead formulates and impresses upon the designers an overarching concept or concepts for a certain collection and the label as a whole. \nA fashion creative director's main role is to establish what designs should be created, what will appeal to the target market, and how the concepts will be applied and distributed in collaboration with fashion designers who are responsible for creating the clothing and fabrics.\n\n"}

{"id": "165344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165344", "title": "E-text", "text": "E-text\n\nIn some communities, \"e-text\" is used much more narrowly, to refer to electronic documents that are, so plain text file, but that it has no information beyond \"the text itself\"—no repboldparagraph, page, chapter, or footnote boundaries, etc. Michael S. Hart, for example, argued that this \"is the only text mode that is easy on both the eyes and the computer\". Hart made the correct point that proprietary word-processor formats made texts grossly inaccessible, but that is irrelevant to standard, open data formats. The narrow sense of \"e-text\" is now uncommon, because the notion of \"just vanilla ASCII\" (attractive at first glance) has turned out to have serious difficulties:\n\nFirst, this narrow type of \"e-text\" is limited to the English letters. Not even Spanish ñ or the accented vowels used in many European languages cannot be represented (unless awkwardly and ambiguously as \"~n\" \"a'\"). Asian, Slavic, Greek, and other writing systems are impossible.\n\nSecond, diagrams and pictures cannot be accommodated, and many books have at least some such material; often it is essential to the book.\n\nThird, \"e-texts\" in this narrow sense have no reliable way to distinguish \"the text\" from other things that occur in a work. For example, page numbers, page headers, and footnotes might be omitted, or might simply appear as additional lines of text, perhaps with blank lines before and after (or not). An ornate separator line might be represented instead by a line of asterisks (or not). Chapter and sections titles, likewise, are just additional lines of text: they might be detectable by capitalization if they were all caps in the original (or not). Even to discover what conventions (if any) were used, makes each book a new research or reverse-engineering project.\n\nIn consequence of this, such texts cannot be reliably re-formatted. A program cannot reliably tell where footnotes, headers or footers are, or perhaps even paragraphs, so it cannot re-arrange the text, for example to fit a narrower screen, or read it aloud for the visually impaired. Programs might apply heuristics to guess at the structure, but this can easily fail.\n\nFourth, and a perhaps surprisingly important issue, a \"plain-text\" e-text affords no way to represent information \"about\" the work. For example, is it the first or the tenth edition? Who prepared it, and what rights do they reserve or grant to others? Is this the raw version straight off a scanner, or has it been proofread and corrected? Metadata relating to the text is sometimes included with an e-text, but there is by this definition no way to say whether or where it is preset. At best, the text of the title page might be included (or not), perhaps with centering imitated by indentation.\n\nFifth, texts with more complicated information cannot really be handled at all. A bilingual edition, or a critical edition with footnotes, commentary, critical apparatus, cross-references, or even the simplest tables. This leads to endless practical problems: for example, if the computer cannot reliably distinguish footnotes, it cannot find a phrase that a footnote interrupts.\n\nEven raw scanner OCR output usually produces more information than this, such as the use of bold and italic. If this information is not kept, it is expensive and time-consuming to reconstruct it; more sophisticated information such as what edition you have, may not be recoverable at all.\n\nIf actuality, even \"plain text\" uses some kind of \"markup\"—usually control characters, spaces, tabs, and the like: Spaces between words; two returns and 5 spaces for paragraph. The main difference from more formal markup is that \"plain texts\" use implicit, usually undocumented conventions, which are therefore inconsistent and difficult to recognize.\n\nThe narrow sense of e-text as \"plain vanilla ASCII\" has fallen out of favor. Nevertheless, many such texts are freely available on the Web, perhaps as much because they are easily produced as because of any purported portability advantage. For many years Project Gutenberg strongly favored this model of text, but with time, has begun to develop and distribute more capable forms such as HTML.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1794963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1794963", "title": "Hague School", "text": "Hague School\n\nThe Hague School is a group of artists who lived and worked in The Hague between 1860 and 1890. Their work was heavily influenced by the realist painters of the French Barbizon school. The painters of the Hague school generally made use of relatively somber colors, which is why the Hague School is sometimes called the \"Gray School\".\n\nAfter the great periods of Dutch art in the Golden Age of the 17th century, there were economic and political problems which diminished activity in art. The fine arts in the Netherlands enjoyed a revival around 1830, a time now referred to as the Romantic period in Dutch painting. The style was an imitation of the great 17th-century artists. The most widely accepted paintings of this period were landscapes and paintings which reflected national history. Andreas Schelfhout was a painter of landscapes, especially winter scenes, but also woodlands and the dunes between The Hague and Scheveningen. His best known pupils included Wijnand Nuyen, Johan Barthold Jongkind, and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch. Schelfhout's friend and occasional collaborator Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen principally composed pastoral landscapes like those of Golden Age master Paulus Potter, but trained several prominent Hague School artists, notably his son Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen, Willem Roelofs, , Hubertus van Hove, and Weissenbruch. Wijnand Nuyen was one of the best of the romantic artists of the time and he had a great influence on Weissenbruch and Johannes Bosboom.\n\nArt training at that time was usually in the form of drawing schools, with no painting classes. Many young artists who later became members of the Hague School were frustrated by this and scattered to various places to receive the training they desired. Gerard Bilders left the Hague Academy of Drawing and completed training with the Swiss animal painter, Charles Humbert. Paul Gabriël went to Kleve, just over the German border, to study with the landscape painter Barend Cornelis Koekkoek. Jozef Israëls, unsatisfied with the academies at Groningen and Amsterdam, left for Paris to attend classes at the studio of François-Édouard Picot. Jacob Maris left the Hague Academy for the corresponding institution in Antwerp and from there he went to study with Ernest Hébert in Paris. His brother Matthijs Maris studied with Nicaise de Keyser in Antwerp. Hendrik Willem Mesdag left Groningen to perfect his skills in Brussels under Willem Roelofs. He also received additional instructions from Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who would later move to England.\n\nIn the 1830s artists like Théodore Rousseau, Jean-François Millet, Charles-François Daubigny, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot found their way to Barbizon, a forested area near Fontainebleau. The emphasis of their work here was on painting nature as they saw it - Barbizon was not a school but a community of artists. This gave rise to the well known Barbizon school and their example was followed in the 1850s by a few Dutch painters who gathered in Oosterbeek in order to work in the surrounding countryside.\n\nThese painters had been influenced by the artists of the Barbizon School and emulated them by registering their impressions with rapid strokes of color. Johannes Warnardus Bilders, father of Gerard Bilders, moved to Oosterbeek in 1852 and attracted many pupils: Anton Mauve, a cousin-in-law of Vincent van Gogh, the Maris brothers (Jacob, Willem and Matthijs) in the summer, as well as the regular visitors Willem Roelofs and Paul Gabriël. Some of these artists, such as Jozef Israëls, Jacob Maris and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch visited Barbizon to paint there.\n\nThere was a slight connection between the \"Düsseldorf Art Association\" when an exhibition on \"Fishing in Scheveningen\" occurred. It concerned such artists as , , and Andreas Achenbach.\n\nThe call of the Düsseldorf painters' school attracted artists of the Hague school, such Johannes Bosboom and J. W. Bilders. At the beginning of his career Jozef Israëls went on a study trip to Düsseldorf. Also Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Philip Sadée came to Düsseldorf. The Düsseldorf academy was famous as a training center for her scenery and histories painting. The bright colour order which distinguishes those paintings is unmistakable.\n\n Gerard Bilders had been seeking something of the kind in his own work, but on visiting the national Exhibition in Brussels in 1860, he found what he had been looking for: a colored gray tonality, or as he put it \"the impression of a warm, fragrant gray.\" The muted tones and warm gray that Bilders found here was certainly discussed with his friends in Oosterbeek and found its way into the work of the young Hague School painters.\nThe migration of these artists to The Hague began in the late 1860s. Hendrik Willem Mesdag was the first, moving there in 1869. Jacob Maris returned to The Hague in 1870 after the family's experience in Paris in the Franco-Prussian War. That same year Jozef Israëls came to The Hague, as did Anton Mauve. Willem Maris, Johannes Bosboom and Weissenbruch had always lived there. For Mesdag, the move marked the end of his student days in Brussels. For Maris it meant a break with the Paris dealers, who would not let him paint what he wanted. Friendship played an important role in this group of painters and whenever one of them was invited to take part in a major exhibition, he would arrange for his friends to also submit work. The outside world was thus presented with a picture of a united artistic and stylized front. The gray tonality was to become one of the characteristics of the Hague School.\nThe name \"Hague School\" was coined in 1875 by a critic, Jacob van Santen Kolff, who used the phrases \"a new way of seeing and depicting things\", \"intent to convey mood, tone takes precedence over color\", \"almost exclusive preference for so-called 'bad weather' effects\", and \"gray mood.\" The Hague School artists were less interested in a faithful portrayal of what they saw than in conveying the atmosphere and impression of the moment. They painted in mostly in subdued colors, with a penchant for gray. That is why the Hague School is sometimes also called the Gray School.\n\nThe painters of the Hague School conducted some of their artistic discussions as member of the Pulchri Studio, which had been founded in 1847 by Bosboom, Willem Roelofs and J. H. Weissenbruch at the home of the Hague painter Lambertus Hardenberg. Growing discontent among the young artists in The Hague about the apparently insufficient opportunities for training and development was the reason for establishing the Pulchri Studio. Many members of the Hague School served on the board of the Pulchri Studio, so that the society became a bastion of the school for many years.\n\nOver the years, the artists of the Hague School changed. Jacob Maris enriched his palette with vivid brushwork, especially in his Amsterdam town views. Jozef Israëls had completely abandoned his anecdotal manner and somber coloring. J. H. Weissenbruch blurred the details in his later work, painting beach scenes and landscapes in magnificently conceived planes of color with an almost abstract quality. Willem Maris became the painter of light he had always tried to be, producing summer meadows with sunlight sparkling on the water and cattle—the quintessence of the Dutch landscape. Matthijis Maris' further development was also remarkable, albeit tragic. Despite the support of family and friends, he led a solitary existence. He worked for years on his paintings of brides and portraits of children, which became increasingly hazy and dreamy until finally becoming completely detached from reality.\n\nBy the mid-1880s the united front of the Hague School began to crumble. The character of the city of The Hague changed as it became larger. The small fishing village of Scheveningen changed as new suburbs were built and factories transformed the area. Weissenbruch and Roelofs found The Hague to be growing too fast and retreated to the polders to continue painting.\n\nAnton Mauve and Jozef Israëls became active in the Laren School which perpetuated aspects of the Hague School. Albert Neuhuys, Hein Kever and Evert Pieters, were especially active there between 1880 and 1900. Realistic interiors of Laren farm houses, as well as plein air landscapes were the preferred subjects of the paintings. Anton Mauve was particularly active in the latter and his views of the heathlands were quite popular with American art lovers.\nWhile The Hague was becoming too large for some, it was too small for others who became influential in the Amsterdam Impressionism group which developed there. This movement drew on city life for its subject matter, although the contrast with the Hague School was less pronounced than is occasionally suggested. This group included some who are designated below as members of the second generation of the Hague School such as George Hendrik Breitner, Isaac Israëls (son of Jozef Israëls), Willem Bastiaan Tholen and Willem de Zwart (also known as William Black). In addition, Willem Witsen, Floris Verster, Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller and Jan Toorop have some background with the Hague School and are considered to be in the Amsterdam Impressionism movement.\n\nAlthough not usually associated with the Hague School, Johan Jongkind was called a forerunner of impressionism who influenced Eugène Boudin, who later was mentor to Claude Monet. Others who had at least a tangential connections with the artists of the Hague School are Charles Rochussen, Richard Bisschop and Lawrence Alma-Tadema.\n\nAround the 1890s in France, impressionism was followed by post-impressionism, which places greater emphasis on the form, structure and content of the painting. This movement, too, was picked up in the Netherlands, resulting in a Dutch post-impressionism and introducing abstract elements and cubism into modern painting. Famous examples are Vincent van Gogh, who received his first art training from Anton Mauve, as well as Piet Mondrian, who initially painted in the manner of the Hague School and then in a variety of styles and techniques documenting his search for a personal style.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18969691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18969691", "title": "Intentionally blank page", "text": "Intentionally blank page\n\nAn intentionally blank page or vacat page (from Latin: \"vacare\" for \"being empty\") is a page that is devoid of content and may be unexpected. Such pages may serve purposes ranging from place-holding to space-filling and content separation. Sometimes, these pages carry a notice such as \"This page [is] intentionally left blank.\" Such notices typically appear in printed works, such as legal documents, manuals, and exam papers, in which the reader might otherwise suspect that the blank pages are due to a printing error and where missing pages might have serious consequences.\n\nIntentionally blank pages are usually the result of printing conventions and techniques. Chapters conventionally start on an odd-numbered page (recto page); therefore, if the preceding chapter happens to have an odd number of pages, a blank page is inserted at the end. Book pages are often printed on large sheets because of technical and financial considerations. Thus, a group of 8, 16, or 32 consecutive pages will be printed on a single sheet in such a way that when the sheet is mechanically folded and cut, the pages will be in the correct order for binding. This is called an even working, and the group of pages is called a section or signature. Books printed in this manner will always have a number of pages that is a multiple of the number in such a signature, such as a multiple of 8, 16, or 32. As a result, these books will usually have pages left blank, unless by chance or editorial ingenuity the exact number of pages are printed.\n\nFor example, if a book with 318 pages of content is printed using 32-page signatures, it will require 10 signatures, 320 pages in total. At the very end of the book — that is, at the end of the last signature — there will be 2 unused (blank) pages.\n\nIf a printer's document processor has been designed to skip completely blank pages, notices may also be required on intentionally blank pages to prevent incorrect page numbering.\n\nIntentionally blank pages are ubiquitous in technical and instructional manuals, directories, and other large, mass-produced volumes of text. The contents of manuals produced by a given product's vendor are often compiled from generic instructions suitable for a variety of products, with additional instructions or chapters included for the specific product or model in question. This automation of manual generation leads to intentionally blank pages to fit the requirements for mass printing.\n\nIn digital documents, pages are intentionally left blank so that the document can be printed correctly in double-sided format, rather than have new chapters start on the backs of pages. Intentionally blank pages have also been used in documents distributed in ring binders. The intention is to leave room for expansion without breaking the document's page numbering. This allows updates to be made to a document while requiring minimal new pages, reducing printing costs. The only drawback is the increased time required by the reader to manually insert various newly updated pages into their correct locations in the document.\n\nIntentionally blank pages can be useful in standardized tests such as the GCSE, Higher School Certificate, SAT, CAT, ACT, MCAT, and GRE. In these exams, there are often individual, timed sections in which test-takers are prohibited from proceeding to the next section until that section's time interval has passed and the examiner allows them to continue. Because all of these separate sections are printed consecutively in the examination booklet, it may be possible for a test-taker who has finished the section early to see through the page and read the problems in the next section. By placing intentionally blank pages between these sections, the test-taker is prevented from cheating in this way. By printing a notice on the page, such as \"this page has been intentionally left blank\", test-takers will not be concerned that their test has been misprinted, especially as test instructions often instruct students to check for missing or blank pages and to report any defective test booklets to a proctor. These pages may also be useful as scratch paper.\n\nIn books of sheet music, relatively short pieces of music that span two to four pages often need to be arranged so the number of page turns for the performer is minimized. For example, a three-page work (starting on the left-hand sheet) followed immediately by a two-page work involves one page turn during each work. If a blank page immediately followed the three-page work (on the right-hand sheet), the two-page work will span the left and right pages, alleviating the need for a page turn during the second work. Intentionally blank pages may also prevent a page turn during a difficult passage.\n\nIn the United States armed forces, classified documents require page checks whenever custody is transferred or an inventory is conducted. Blank pages are all marked \"This page intentionally left blank\", so page checks are unambiguous, and every page of the document is accounted for.\n\nIntentionally blank pages placed at the end of books are often used to balance the folios that make up the book (see bookbinding). Often these pages are completely blank with no such statement or are used as \"Notes\" pages, serving a practical purpose. In the case of telephone-number directories, these pages are often used to list important numbers and addresses. These pages may list other books available from the same publisher.\n\nBook publishers have also used stylized designs (dingbats) underneath the last paragraph of a chapter to indicate that no other content is to be expected until the next chapter, allowing for the possibility of blank pages without misunderstandings by the readers.\n\nThere are also published books that, as a novelty, contain nothing but blank pages.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21329941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21329941", "title": "Kiowa Five", "text": "Kiowa Five\n\nThe Kiowa Six, previously known as the Kiowa Five, is a group of six Kiowa artists from Oklahoma in the early 20th century. They were Spencer Asah, James Auchiah, Jack Hokeah, Stephen Mopope, Lois Smoky, and Monroe Tsatoke.\n\nStephen Mopope (1898–1974), the oldest in the group, was born on the Kiowa Reservation in Oklahoma Territory. His relatives, including his great-uncles Silver Horn and Fort Marion ledger artist Ohettoint, recognized his artistic talent at an early age and taught him traditional Kiowa painting techniques. Jack Hokeah (ca. 1900/2-1969) was orphaned at a young age and raised by his grandmother. Later in life, San Ildefonso Pueblo potter Maria Martinez adopted him as a son and he lived with her family for a decade in New Mexico. Monroe Tsatoke (1904–1937) was born near Saddle Mountain, Oklahoma. His father Tsatokee (\"Hunting Horse\") was his first artistic influence. James Auchiah (1906–1974) was born near present-day Medicine Park, Oklahoma. His grandfather was Red Tipi, a ledger artist, medicine man, and bundle keeper. Spencer Asah (ca. 1905/1910-1954) was born in Carnegie, Oklahoma. His father, a buffalo medicine man, provided Asah with the traditional cultural background to inspire his art. Lois Smoky (1907–1981), born near Anadarko, was the youngest of the group and the only woman.\n\nFive of the artists attended the St. Patrick's Mission School in Anadarko, serving Kiowa, Comanche and Apache children. Operating from 1872 to 1996, the school, also known as the Anadarko Boarding School, was the longest surviving of the seven schools for Native American children in Oklahoma operated by St. Patrick's Mission. There, the five Kiowa artists received formal art instruction from a Choctaw nun, Sister Mary Olivia Taylor (1872–1931).\n\nMonroe Tsatoke did not attend St. Patrick's and did not receive formal art training until the Anadarko Agency field matron, Susan Peters, took an interest in the young Kiowa artists and established an art club. Peters arranged for Mrs. Willie Baze Lane of Chickasha, Oklahoma, to give them painting lessons.\n\nSusie Peters encouraged Swedish-American artist Oscar Jacobson, the director of the University of Oklahoma's art department to create a special program for the Kiowa artists. In 1926, Asah, Hokeah, Tsatoke, and Mopope moved to Norman. They were soon joined by Lois Smoky in 1927 and lived together in a house rented by Lois Smoky's parents.\n\nJacobson provided studio space for the group, but felt that he did not want to interfere with the direction their painting was taking. Dr. Edith Mahler, an art professor at OU provided painting instruction and critiques. In the fall of 1927, James Auchiah joined the program at OU.\n\nLois Smoky returned home in 1927, leaving the program. She married and was devoted to her family. Although she did not continue painting, she became a beadwork artist. Since her paintings are the rarest, they have become the most collectible of the group.\n\nWhile Jacobson did not wish to dictate subject matter to the six artists, he actively promoted their work. He arranged for their work to be shown at the Denver Art Museum. In 1928, Jacobson entered their watercolor paintings in the First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where they received international acclaim. Their work continued to be exhibited throughout Europe. In 1929, Jacobson collaborated with a French printer to produce \"Kiowa Art,\" a portfolio of 24 pochoir prints of paintings by Asah, Hokeah, Tsatoke, Mopope, and Smoky of intertribal dancers, ceremonies, musicians, and Kiowa daily life.\n\nWhen they participated in the 1932 Venice Biennale, their exhibit \"was acclaimed the most popular exhibit among all the rich and varied displays assembled.\"\n\nThe Kiowa Six are considered significant in the development of Native American painting by bridging the era of Ledger Art to flat-style Southern Plains painting. While not the first Native Americans to be successful in the international mainstream art world, their careers proved inspirational to many Native artists in the 20th century.\n\nInspired by the narrative, representational qualities of Plains hide painting and ledger art, the Kiowa Six created a new style of painting that portrayed ceremonial and social scenes of Kiowa life and stories from oral history, which is characterized by solid color fields, minimal backgrounds, a flat perspective, and emphasis on details of dance regalia.\n\n\n"}

The folklore's basis derives from a variety of belief systems, including Shamanism, Confucianism, Buddhism and more recently Christianity. Mythical creatures often abound in the tales, including the Korean conception of goblins.\n\nThere are many types of folklore in Korean culture, including Imuldan (이물담), focused on supernatural beings such as monsters, goblins and ghosts. The most common of which are the Dokkaebi (도깨비), meaning goblin. However, this term differs from the European concept of 'goblin' in that they do not possess a evil or demonic characteristic. Instead, they are creatures with powers that seek to both bring delight to people and misery. These beings engage either in friendly or annoying behavior with humans. Their interactions with humans represent the belief in the supernatural and their interactions with humanity. The presence of these beings is meant to represent both difficulties and pleasures in life.\n\nA revival on internet sites occurred recently, providing inspiration for artists and illustrators.\n\nRecent achievements in keeping Korean folklore alive include the 150-part animated TV series, \"Animentary Korean Folklore\", telling old tales with a traditional 2-D Korean styled animation.\n\n\n"}

Her father worked in the Navy and later as a college teacher. She has three siblings and seven half-siblings on her father's side. She got interested in politics during her childhood.\n\nDesjardins studied at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, between 1990 and 1994, earning a bachelor's degree in economics. Subsequently, she went to Russia for two years to study at Herzen University in Saint Petersburg, where she studied Russian studies and learned to speak Russian. Starting in 1996, she attended Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. She received a Master of Science degree in journalism from that university the following year.\n\nDesjardins' first job in journalism was at the local television station WBTW in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, between 1998 and 1999, when she was fired. Next, she worked as a freelance reporter for \"The Sun News\", a Myrtle Beach newspaper, and, at the same time, as a freelance reporter for the news agency Reuters. After a few months, in October 1999, she left \"The Sun News\" and joined the Columbia NBC-affiliate WIS as a political reporter, while she remained a reporter for Reuters. At WIS, she covered the South Carolina Legislature, the debate on the display of the Confederate Flag at the South Carolina State House, and the 2000 Republican presidential primaries.

{"id": "5506948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5506948", "title": "List of video games notable for speedrunning", "text": "List of video games notable for speedrunning\n\nSpeedruns are popular for a large variety of games. Most high-level speedruns have been performed by members of online communities. The speedrunning community originated on discussion forums in the late 90s and early 2000s, where the fastest routes through early first-person shooters were discussed. Later-on, as speedrunning became more popular, specific video games became known as common speedrunning candidates. Some modern indie games are explicitly designed for speedrunning.\n\nDecember 1993 saw the release of id Software's \"Doom\". Among some of its major features, like at that time unparalleled graphics, LAN- and Internet-based multiplayer support, and user modification possibilities, it also gave the players the ability to record demo files of their playthrough. This particular feature was first picked up by Christina “Strunoph” Norman in January 1994 when she launched the \"LMP Hall of Fame\" website.\n\nThis site was, however, quickly obsoleted by the \"DOOM Honorific Titles\", launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players. This site would create the basis for all DOOM demosites that would follow. The DHT were designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on pre-determined maps in the IWADs. These 'exams' became very popular as the player had to earn each title by sending in a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify their application. Doom II was released in October 1994, and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new Doom version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles. For example, playing with only the fists and pistol while killing all monsters on a map became known as Tyson mode, named after the heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson. Pacifist-mode was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had easy, medium, and hard difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. Many legends in the Doom speedrunning scene started out in the DHT, including George Bell (Tyson), Steffen Udluft (Pacifist), Kai-Uwe “Gazelle” Humpert, Frank “Jesus” Siebers (Nightmare), Thomas “Panter” Pilger (Reality), and Yonatan Donner. Unfortunately, the DHT always had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, made public interest wane as the years rolled on.\n\nIn November 1994, the Doom speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, took off. Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of Doom-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they all centered around one key idea: speed. Players were required to run through Doom's levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards which eventually made Doom one of the most popular games for speedrunning.\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was even at Cdrom.com for a while before István Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to the now defunct FTP server ftp.sch.bme.hu. From there on, since early 1998, it was in the hands of Ádám Hegyi, who has been the maintainer ever since. It was located for some time at Doom2.net. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bužanić took over maintaining the site and re-created a new database for WADs and PWADs. It is currently located at http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n.\n\nAs of March 2006, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.\n\n\"Quake\" was the only game to rival \"Doom\" as the most popular game to speedrun. People first started recording demos of \"Quake\" playthroughs when it was released in June 1996 and sharing them with others on the demos/e directory in Cdrom.com's \"Quake\" file hierarchy. There were two distinct kinds of demos: those in which the player killed all monsters and found all secrets on the map (called 100% demos) and those in which the player ignored these goals in order to finish the level as fast as possible (called runs). All levels were, at that time, recorded solely on the “Nightmare” difficulty level, the highest in the game.\n\nIn April 1997, Nolan “Radix” Pflug first started the Nightmare Speed Demos web site to keep track of the fastest demos. The first \"Quake Done Quick\" of the game, carrying over one level's finishing statistics to the next. The run ended up finishing the entire game on Nightmare difficulty in 0:19:49; an astonishing feat at that time. It received widespread attention from gaming magazines, being distributed with free CDs that usually came with them. This popularized speedrunning for a much larger audience than before and attracted many newcomers. Not all of those newcomers agreed with the old-timers's dogma that runs should be made on the hardest possible skill level. Thus, in August 1997 Muad'Dib's \"Quake\" Page came to be, run by Gunnar “Muad'Dib” Andre Mo and specializing in “Easy” difficulty runs. One month after that, the famous \"Quake Done Quick\" movie was superseded by a new movie called \"Quake Done Quicker\", on September 14, 1997, which improved the game's fastest playthrough time to 0:16:35.\n\nIn April 1998, Nolan and Gunnar merged their pages, thus creating Speed Demos Archive, which today is still the central repository for \"Quake\" speed demos of any kind. Ever since its creation, a large variety of tricks have been discovered in the \"Quake\" physics, which kept players interested even up to today, more than two decades after Quake's release. Subsequently, \"Quake Done Quick with a Vengeance\" was released on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through \"Quake\" in the hugely improved time of 0:12:23.\n\nAs of March 2006, Speed Demos Archive contains a total amount of 8481 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 253 hours, 44 minutes and 39 seconds. The fastest minimalist single-segment completion times that have been recorded thus far, as of June 10, 2006, are 0:13:46 for the easy difficulty run and 0:19:50 for the nightmare difficulty run, both by long-time \"Quake\" speedrunner Connor Fitzgerald. The 100% single-segment completion times are 0:46:02 for the easy difficulty run and 1:09:33 for the nightmare difficulty run, respectively Marlo Galinski and Justin Fleck.\n\nAn important aspect of the \"Quake\" speedrunning community is \"Quake Done Quick\", a collection of movies in which the game is finished as fast as possible with special rules and aims. Unlike the normal records listed above, these movies are created one level at a time rather than in one continuous play session; as such, it is possible for multiple people to help create the movie by sending in demos of individual levels, and much faster times can be aimed for as the segmentation allows one to easily try again upon committing an error. It also allows runners to only have to focus on a small portion of the game rather than all of it.\n\nThese movies are by far more popular than the conventional records, both in the community itself and outside of it. Some of them, most notably the movies that feature a fast playthrough of the game on the Nightmare difficulty level without additional voluntary challenges, have even been distributed with gaming magazines and posted on news sites. Slashdot has published an announcement of the then newly created \"Quake Done Quick with a Vengeance\" movie on its front page. Out of all the series' movies, this one is also the most popular. In it, the entire game is finished in 0:12:23 on “Nightmare” difficulty, the hardest in the game. This run succeeded \"Quake Done Quicker\" and the original \"Quake done Quick\" movie, in which the game was finished in respectively 0:16:35 and 0:19:49. The main reason for the latest installment being over 4 minutes faster, an improvement that surpassed the initial expectations of the runners, was the discovery of bunny hopping, which allowed runners to attain a much higher speed in most levels and even made it possible to save rockets or grenades for jumps that could now be done without them. This movie is currently being improved by new and old runners for a production called \"Quake done Quick with a Vengeance Part II\". As of May 2006, the improvements that have been made thus far would result in a time of 0:11:32 for the entire game, an improvement of 51 seconds.\n\nSome of the productions have been turned into Machinima movies, using so-called “recams” (showing the run from preset camera perspectives rather than the first-person view) and sometimes even custom skins, models, and a script to turn them into films rather than speedrun videos.\n\n\"Super Metroid\" (Nintendo, 1994) achieved popularity with speedrunners due to the emergence of console emulators with demo-recording features. In normal \"Super Metroid\" gameplay, the player may find certain items such as \"high-jump boots\". Since the path through the map is non-linear, it is complicated to find the most efficient speedrunning routes: areas with seemingly essential power-ups can be bypassed at the expense of the improved mobility. This drove the discovery of sequence breaking, in which a player can acquire power-ups before the game design intends, allowing whole sections of the map to be skipped. As of September 2018 the current Any% world record is held by speedrunner Behemoth, with a time of 41 minutes and 18 seconds.\n\nBecause the \"Metroid\" series awards players for completing the game with a faster time, groups of player were inspired to discuss techniques on message boards such as GameFAQs and to capture and post video of full playthroughs. Despite internet limitations in the early 2000s, the ability to share video footage of \"Metroid\" runs allowed speedrunners to collaborate and learn from one another. It was during online discussions of \"Metroid Prime\" that the term \"sequence breaking\" was first widely used.\n\nEarly platform games of the \"Super Mario\" series are popular in the speedrunning community. \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Super Mario World\", \"Yoshi's Island\" and \"Super Mario 64\" are particularly notable for speedrunning accomplishments. Most notable speedruns of \"Super Mario\" games are generally carried out without tool-assistance, though speedrunners make frequent use of glitches and even memory corruption to make optimal times.\n\nThe current record holder of the first game in the \"Super Mario\" series, \"Super Mario Bros.\", is speedrunner somewes, who beat the game in 4 minutes, 55 seconds, and 796 milliseconds on October 22, 2018. This was done by using many frame-perfect tricks and in-game warps. More novel achievements have also been accomplished in \"Super Mario Bros.\", such as beating the game with the lowest score possible.\n\nThe record-time for beating \"Super Mario World\" is in the hands of speedrunner FURiOUS, who beat the game in 41 seconds and 866 milliseconds on June 19, 2018. This was done by making the credits of the game roll using arbitrary code injection in the first level of the game, however this is not considered an entirely fair way of beating the game, and is best done using tool-assistance.\n\n\"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\" is a game that is very commonly speedrun at Awesome Games Done Quick. Charlie Hall of \"Polygon\" has described speedruns of \"Yoshi's Island\" as a \"great introduction to the showmanship and the rich community\" behind the Games Done Quick marathons. Through exchanging strategies and doing theory routing, the \"Yoshi's Island\" speedrunning community collaboratively work on pushing the time down.\n\nIt is possible to speedrun \"Super Mario 64\" in various ways. Though speedruns exist of people playing through the game as intended, it is possible to skip large portions of \"Super Mario 64\" by using glitches. Using a glitch dubbed the \"backwards long jump,\" with which the player character can move through walls, a player can skip almost all levels of the game and beat it in only a few minutes. Completing \"Super Mario 64\" 100%—i.e., collecting all the game's \"stars\"—is also a popular method of playing through the game. Recently, the 120 Stars category has become much more competitive. The current record time for Super Mario 64 in the \"120 Stars\" category was set on February 8, 2018 by the Twitch streamer Cheese05 with a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 19 seconds.\n\nThe original \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"\" are popular speedrunning candidates. The record for the first game in the series is currently held by speedrunner LackAttack24 in 28 minutes and 37 seconds. Any% speedruns of this game involve a great deal of movement optimization and item drop management, as well as some amount of luck. Speedrunners rely heavily on having bombs with which to defeat high-level enemies. A common glitch used in speedruns of this game involves clipping through walls while the screen is scrolling.\n\nThe original Japanese version of \"\", the third game in the series, can be beaten within two minutes by using particularly advantageous glitches. However, this workaround was patched in subsequent versions of the game, including the US and PAL release.\n\n\"Ocarina of Time\" speedruns used to take hours to carry out, as the game contains a large amount of long, mandatory dungeons. During the 2000s, the community of Speed Demo Archives discovered various glitches in the game that allowed players to skip portions of it. The \"Door of Time Skip\", for instance, allows player character Link to sequence break and skip many of the game's levels by passing through a wall. In 2012, the \"Wrong Warp\" glitch was discovered, which allowed Link to teleport from the first dungeon to the final boss of the game, making 20 minute speedruns of \"Ocarina of Time\" possible.\n\nSpeedruns of \"Ocarina of Time\" are somewhat dependent of the console the game is played on. Originally, speedrunners played \"Ocarina of Time\" on the Chinese-only iQue Player, because it has quicker loading times and faster scrolling text than the Nintendo 64 version. However, the current record was achieved with the Japanese version of \"Ocarina of Time\" played on the Wii Virtual Console, as this version of the game includes an exploitable glitch not present in other versions.\n\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" has been described as \"one of the most intricate and well-documented games for speed running\" because of its familiarity and potential for glitches. The current any% world record is in hands of skater82297, with a time of 17 minutes and 07 seconds, beating Torje's previous record of 17 minutes and 09 seconds. The current 100% world record is held at a time of 3 hours 53 minutes and 33 seconds, which belongs to American runner Zfg, who has held the 100% speedrun world record since March 19, 2015 and had previously become the first person to complete the 100% run in under 4 hours, doing so on August 1, 2018.\n\n\"Dark Souls\", a 2011 game by From Software, is known for its unforgiving gameplay, but despite this, the game is very popular among speedrunners. Through the use of several intricate skips, glitches, and wrong warps, it is possible to complete an Any% run in under 35 minutes, though average players take dozens of hours playing through the game once. 21-minute speedruns are possible because of a glitch dubbed the \"Kiln Skip\", which can be used to skip almost the entire second half of the game. The original method for this exploit was removed in an update, but a new method of performing it, which requires the current game update, has also been devised. The current world record for the All Bosses category speedrun is held by CapitaineToinon, clocking in at 1:09:02 IGT (in-game time).\n\nAny% runs of its sequel, \"Dark Souls II\", can be done in under 20 minutes, as it is possible to avoid almost all battles in the game and to move around the world at a \"ridiculous pace\" using the \"binoculars\" item. The tricks that make a run this short possible were patched out, but can still be used if current patches aren't downloaded.\n\n\"Spelunky\", a 2012 indie platformer created by Derek Yu, has been a common candidate for speedrunning, with its fastest runs taking between one and two minutes. As \"Spelunky\" features a large amount of random procedural generation, speedrunners cannot solely rely on memorization. To have a chance in beating the current record, a speedrunner must get a specific random seed, though despite this, skillful players may recognize repeating level patterns and know how to optimally use the game's items, such as a difficult to use \"teleporter\" that allows a player to skip large chunks of a level.\n\nDespite the high difficulty of the game, even \"Spelunky\" \"Hell\" levels have been used for speedrunning, with the world record sitting under four minutes. Another highly difficult run of the game is the so-called \"eggplant run\", in which a player has to go through a specific set of objectives to turn the final boss into an eggplant. This was done solo for the first time in November 2013 by speedrunner Bananasaurus Rex, though it took him 90 minutes. Douglas Wilson of \"Polygon\" dubbed this run \"2013's most fascinating video game moment.\"\n\n"}

Husain\n\nMaqbool Fida Husain (17 September 1915 – 9 June 2011) was a modern Indian painter of international acclaim, and a founding member of Bombay Progressive Artists' Group.\n\nHusain is associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His early association with the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group used modern technique, and was inspired by the \"new\" India after The Partition of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—sometimes treated in series—include topics as diverse as Mohandas K. Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British raj, and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. Early in his painting career, and until his death, he enjoyed depicting the lively and free spirit of horses in many of his works.Husain is the most celebrated and internationally recognized Indian artist of the 20th century. Husain is primarily known for his paintings, but is also known for his drawings and his work as a printmaker, photographer, and filmmaker. Some of his later works stirred controversy, as they depicted traditional deities of India in non-traditional ways including nude portrayals of the deities.\n\nHe also directed a few movies. In 1967, he received the National Film Award for Best Experimental Film for \"Through the Eyes of a Painter\". In 2004, he directed \"\", a film he worked on with his artist son Owais Husain, which was screened in the Marché du Film section of the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHusain was born on 17 September 1915 in Pandharpur to a Sulaymani Bohra family who trace their roots back to Gujarat within the last 200 years, and then originally to Yemen. He picked up taste in art through studying calligraphy while he stayed at a Madraasa in Baroda. Husain attended the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art in Mumbai. Early in his career Husain painted cinema posters in Mumbai. To earn extra money, he worked for a toy company designing and building toys. He often travelled to Gujarat to paint landscapes when he could afford to.\n\nHusain developed his painting skills in the 1930s, painting billboards for the growing Bollywood film industry. This was a clique of young artists who wished to break with the nationalist traditions established by the Bengal school of art and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level. The artists cite \"The Partition\" of India and Pakistan 14 August 1947, with its resulting religious rioting and heavy loss of life as their reason for forming The Progressive Artist's Group in Bombay in December 1947. The artists saw the Partition as a \"turning point\" for India, and their new style of art was urged on by, and was also a turning point for, (modern) Indian Art. Husain's first solo exhibit was in 1952 in Zurich. His first U.S.A. exhibit was at India House in New York in 1964. In 1966, he was awarded the prestigious Padma Shri .\n\nIn 1967, he made his first film,\"Through the Eyes of a Painter\" It was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival and won a Golden Bear short film award.\n\nHusain was a special invitee along with Pablo Picasso at the Sao Paulo Biennial (Brazil) in 1971.\n\nHis paintings allegedly hurt the religious sentiments of Hindu nationalist groups, which beginning in the 1990s mounted a campaign of protest against him. The paintings in question were created in 1970, but did not become an issue until 1996, when they were printed in \"Vichar Mimansa\", a Hindi monthly magazine, which published them in an article headlined \"M.F. Husain: A Painter or Butcher\". In response, eight criminal complaints were filed against him. In 2004, Delhi High Court dismissed these complaints of \"promoting enmity between different groups ... by painting Hindu goddesses – Durga and Sarswati, that was later compromised by Hindu fundamentalist groups.\"\nIn 1998 Husain's house was attacked by Hindu fundamentalist groups like Bajrang Dal and art works were vandalised. The leadership of another fundamentalist political party Shiv Sena endorsed the attack. Twenty-six Bajrang Dal activists were arrested by the police. Protests against Husain also led to the closure of an exhibition in England.\n\nHe has also produced & directed several movies, including \"Gaja Gamini\" (2000) (with his muse Madhuri Dixit who was the subject of a series of his paintings which he signed \"Fida\"). The film was intended as a tribute to Ms. Dixit herself. In this film she can be seen portraying various forms and manifestations of womanhood including the muse of Kalidasa, the Mona Lisa, a rebel, and musical euphoria. He also appeared in a scene in film \"Mohabbat\", which had Madhuri Dixit in lead role. In the film, the paintings that were supposedly done by Madhuri were actually Husain's. He went on to make \"\" (with Tabu). The film was pulled out of cinemas a day after some Muslim organisations raised objections to one of the songs in it. The All-India Ulema Council complained that the Qawwali song \"Noor-un-Ala-Noor\" was blasphemous. It argued that the song contained words directly taken from the Quran. The council was supported by Muslim organisations like the Milli Council, All-India Muslim Council, Raza Academy, Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Hind and Jamat-e-Islami. Husain's son stated that the words were a phrase referring to divine beauty that were being sung by the central character played by Tabu. He said there was no intention to offend. Following the wave of protests the enraged artist withdrew his movie from cinemas. The film was well received by the critics, however, and went on to win various awards.\n\nIn February 2006, Husain was charged with \"hurting sentiments of people\" because of his nude portraits of Hindu gods and goddesses. In addition, in 6 February 2006 issue, \"India Today\", a national English weekly published an advertisement titled \"Art For Mission Kashmir\". This advertisement contains a painting of {Bharatmata} (Mother India) as a nude woman posed across a map of India with the names of Indian States on various parts of her body. The exhibition was organised by Nafisa Ali of Action India (NGO) and Apparao Art Gallery. Organizations like Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) have protested persistently against Husain displaying the painting on the websites and even in exhibitions in north Europe. As a result, Husain apologized and promised to withdraw the painting from an auction, which was later sold for Rs 80 lakh in the auction. The painting later appeared on Husain's official website.\n\nHusain became the best-paid painter in India, his highest-selling piece fetching $1.6 million at a 2008 Christie's auction.\n\nHundreds of lawsuits in connection with Husain's allegedly obscene art were outstanding as of 2007. A warrant was issued for his arrest after he did not appear at a hearing, though this warrant was later suspended. Husain also received death threats.\n\nHusain lived in self-imposed exile from 2006 until his death. He generally lived in Doha and summered in London. For the last years of his life Husain lived in Doha and London, staying away from India, but expressing a strong desire to return, despite fears of being killed.\n\nIn 2008 Husain was commissioned to create 32 large-scale paintings of Indian history. He finished 8 before his death. In 2010, he was conferred Qatari nationality, and he surrendered his Indian passport. In Qatar, he principally worked on two large projects, one on the history of Arab civilization, commissioned by Qatar's first lady, Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned, and one on the history of Indian civilization. The works are to be housed in a museum in Doha.\n\nAt the age of 92 Husain was given the prestigious Raja Ravi Varma award by the government of Kerala. The announcement led to controversy in Kerala and some cultural organisations campaigned against the granting of the award and petitioned the Kerala courts. Social Activist, Rahul Easwar, went to Kerala High Court and it granted an interim order to stay the granting of the award until the petition had been disposed of.\n\nIn 2010, the Jordanian Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre named Husain as one of the 500 most influential Muslims.\n\nM. F. Husain died, aged 95, on 9 June 2011, following a heart attack. He had been unwell for several months. He died at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery on 10 June 2011.\n\nOther Indian artists expressed criticism. Satish Gujral publicly asked Husain whether he would dare to portray Islamic figures similarly. However Gujral stated that he deeply regretted the way Husain was treated and forced into an exile because of what Gujral termed \"the mob culture\".\n\nWriting in \"The Pioneer\", Chandan Mitra wrote, \"As long as such a law exists in the statutes, nobody can be faulted for approaching the courts against Husain's objectionable paintings, nor can the judiciary be pilloried for ordering action against the artist for his persistent and deliberate refusal to appear before the court.\"\n\nIn response to the controversy, Husain's admirers petitioned the government to grant Husain the Bharat Ratna, India's highest award. According to Shashi Tharoor, who supported the petition, it praised Husain because his \"life and work are beginning to serve as an allegory for the changing modalities of the secular in modern India – and the challenges that the narrative of the nation holds for many of us. This is the opportune and crucial time to honour him for his dedication and courage to the cultural renaissance of his beloved country.\"\n\nOn his part Husain stated that leading Hindu leaders have not spoken a word against his paintings, and they should have been the first ones to have raised their voice and only people with political intentions created controversy.\n\nAfter Husain's death, Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said, \"He only slipped up on the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses. Otherwise, he was happy and content in his field. If his demise is a loss for modern art, then so be it. May Allah give him peace!\"\n\n\n"}

The painting is executed in tempera on panel. It dates from between 1480 and 1483.\n\nThe \"Madonna of the Book\" is a soft and elegant work, in which Mary and the Child are seated by a window in the corner of a room. She holds a Book of Hours, the Horae Beatae Mariae Virginis, prayer books for laymen common in the thirteenth to sixteenth centuries. The infant is gazing at his mother whilst she is absorbed in reading the book. The hands of both mother and son are positioned similarly, with the right hands open as in a gesture of blessing, and left hands closed.\nSymbolizing the Passion of Christ, the Christ Child is holding the three nails of the cross, and the crown of thorns. These are probably later additions, added to make the message more explicit. This is the conventional representation in the Christian iconography. In addition, the fruit in the bowl has an emblematic meaning. The cherries represent the blood of Christ or are an allusion to Paradise, plums indicate the tenderness between Mary and the Child, and the figs are characteristic of the Resurrection.\n\nMary's blue robe, a color she is often depicted wearing, has the symbolic meanings of purity, heaven, and royalty. In this painting, as in Botticelli's other large series, the Madonna is portrayed as being serious, thoughtful and focused.\nBotticelli interprets the scene with a sensitivity and love for small details: the set of boxes and the maiolica bowl of lush fruits are depicted as a still life; the pages of the book, the garments, and the transparent veils exhibit a realistic tactile quality. The composition is refined with a good balance. Botticelli painted with subtle differences in colour, and he was able to put colours together so that they complement each other admirably. The painting is adorned with gold filigree decorating the clothes and objects. The use of gold was the result of the contractual agreement he made with the commissioner, and was included in the price of the painting. Dating from about 1480, the painting shows all the elements of Botticelli's mature poetic style: a delicate, elegant linearity, a style which is still far from the intense pathos of his late work.\" The identity of his patron is unknown.\n\nThe interrelationship of light, shapes and voids confers an ethereal quality to the work. Indeed, the painting might be considered as newly rediscovered, as a recent restoration revealed a luminescent sky and bright morning aura, which had been obscured by layers of centuries-old varnish. \nOne is reminded of other Marian images made prior to the year 1470. Botticelli might have been influenced by Filippo Lippi's \"Madonna and Child with an Angel\" from the Hospital of the Innocents in Florence. \n\nBotticelli and the \"Madonna of the Book\" were the subject of renewed interest in the 19th century. In its \"extraordinary beauty\" it appealed to Italians in particular who saw in it a source of national identity, during Italian unification (\"Risorgimento\"). Among Botticelli's admirers was Gian Giacomo Poldi Pezzoli, who bequeathed his private collection and his apartment to the public. Dr Annalisa Zanni, the Poldi Pezzoli Museum director, recently discovered more about Botticelli's technique and use of materials, as exemplified in the \"Madonna of the Book\". For example, she discovered that Botticelli's top layer of blue was lapis lazuli, a \"very precious and very expensive ingredient, indicating it was commissioned by a highly prestigious patron\".\n\nIt is housed in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan, Italy.\n"}

This led \"Cabinet\" magazine to initiate a search of its own to find which building was truly the \"world's most phallic\". Cities and readers subsequently poured in their views and staked their claims to the magazine's editors.\n\nAfter months of entries and discussion, the Ypsilanti Water Tower in Ypsilanti, Michigan, was announced as the winner, although the winner of a readers' poll was the Florida State Capitol building in Tallahassee. Another notable nominee was the Torre Agbar (Agbar Tower) in Barcelona.\n\n\"Cabinet\" noted that the Ypsilanti Water Tower, called \"the brick dick\" by locals, \"is clearly the world's most phallic.\" The tower was designed by William R. Coats and constructed as part of an elaborate city waterworks project. Located on the highest point in Ypsilanti, erection began in 1889 and was completed in 1890, at a cost of US$21,435.63.

Contained in the museum are numerous archaeological objects which came to light during a long period of excavations. The collection includes, for example, a collection of portraits of famous people from ancient Ostia, including philosophers and members of the royal family, such as busts depicting Asclepius and Volcacius Myropnous, a portrait of Faustina the Elder and the head of Trajan. The museum also has a large collection of sculptures, including the statue of Perseus holding the head of Medusa, the sculptural group of Mithras slaying the bull, and other works. There are other examples on display of great interest, such as small groups in marble depicting Cupid and Psyche and other subjects, and in another section of the museum, sarcophagi and reliefs.

Primarily, high-quality music is made available to purchase, access and play back using software on the Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, set-top boxes and mobile devices from an available distribution point, such as a computer host or server located at a telephone, cable TV or wireless data center facility.\n\nIn 1992, computer modem speeds were limited to less than 28 thousand bits per second (28 kbit/s), compared with uncompressed music on compact disc (CD) that required 150 thousand bytes per second. As a result, additional bandwidth is required to accommodate delivering audio at CD quality standards: 16-bit frame, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, stereophonic (two channel audio). This prompted telephony, CATV, cellular and satellite providers to consider changing standards, assisting in creating the information superhighway, in terms of building higher capacity for existing telecommunications infrastructures.\n\nEarly attempts at designing and developing music-on-demand technology, in accordance with the laws of the United States such as the Home Recording Act of 1992, include Access Media Network (AMN) by inventor Dale Schalow. Schalow, born in Virginia, was an independent audio engineer and programmer in Los Angeles, California, who helped record albums and music scores for David Bowie, Tin Machine, Cypress Hill, House of Pain, Beastie Boys, Interscope, and Warner Brothers. A multiplexed music-on-demand model was deployed using PCM audio sampling devices, Apple IIci, the KERMIT computer file transfer protocol, and SCSI storage systems by Schalow to validate processing 16-bit multi-channel audio from point-to-point in a professional recording studio environment, including his own independently operated Dascha company and 38 Fresh Recordings. The model conceived was introduced by Schalow to Apple Computer in 1992 after he submitted an entry into the \"I Changed the World\" contest, essentially describing how an Apple computer helped shape and change the world forever based upon its usage. Apple acknowledged the \"Accessible Music Network\" (AMN) by awarding Schalow Honorable Mention and sending him a simple gray T-shirt with the Apple logo on it. Stand-alone software created by AMN for consumer-based access was then developed for the Microsoft Windows computer operating system, as well as set-top box design prototypes conceptualized with 3D prototype imaging that required a telephone connector located next to a coaxial cable TV connector to converge low speed data uplinking with high speed downloading interactive communications.\n\nPresently, music-on-demand is still the center of controversy with a focus on illegal music downloading, peer-to-peer file swapping and the lag of legislation for rapidly changing technology on the Internet. Record labels represented by the RIAA, as well as publishers and songwriters, have vigorously defended copyrighted materials and have been successful in enforcing current laws for protecting their intellectual property. As of 2006, the new music industry has seen a rapid growth in overall revenues for legal digital music sales that has resulted in hitting and surpassing one billion dollars annually.\n\n"}
{"id": "34017712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34017712", "title": "New adult fiction", "text": "New adult fiction\n\nNew adult (NA) fiction, also rendered as new-adult fiction, is a developing genre of fiction with protagonists in the 18–30 age bracket. St. Martin's Press first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for \"...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'\". New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices. The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, Colleen Hoover, and Jamie McGuire.\n\nThe genre was originally faced criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme, while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material. In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for HarperCollins described it as \"a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside\".\n\nExamples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' \"A Court of Thorns and Roses\" and \"Throne of Glass\", Jennifer L. Armentrout's \"Wait For You\", Jamie McGuire's \"Beautiful Disaster\", Colleen Hoover's \"Slammed\", Cora Carmack's \"Losing It\", and Kendall Ryan's \"The Impact of You\".\n\nThis category is intended to be marketed to post-adolescents and young-adults ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative \"cross-over\" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience. Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience. The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from young adult fiction are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction. The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult.\n\nNew adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction.\n\nMany themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullying are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure.\n\nThis category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions.\n\nLike the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. Science fiction, urban fiction, horror, paranormal, dystopia, etc. are some examples.\n\nMany agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues. Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material. Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market. The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category. Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers.\n\nIn 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as \"Slammed\" by Colleen Hoover, \"Easy\" by Tamarra Webber, and \"Beautiful Disaster\" by Jamie McGuire got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel \"Fifty Shades of Grey\", which featured a heroine in college. Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous, and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction. Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life, and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles.\n\nFollowing the end of the St. Martin's Press contest, the new adult category has become increasingly popular through self-publishing. Major New York publishers are taking self-published authors of these titles and acquiring them for mass market sales. Some authors include:\n\n\nSome noteworthy authors of the category include:\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1950 by a group of young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951. For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading bibliographers, librarians, book collectors, booksellers and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was John Sparrow, Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly \"Warden's Meeting\" at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the \"Warden's Meeting\" continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and private presses of the age, including the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, the Rampant Lions Press, the Samson Press, the Fantasy Press, the Kit-Cat Press, Big Wheel Press, the Perpetua Press, the Incline Press, the Whittington Press, the Libanus Press, the Rocket Press, the Stanbrook Abbey Press and the Stamperia Valdonega.\n\nAfter a period of difficulties and disrupted activities in the last decade of the twentieth century, the Society closed in 2000, when interest among the students had declined so far that a junior committee could no longer be formed. However, due to the efforts of a new generation of Oxford students led by Geri Della Rocca de Candal, Enrico Emanuele Prodi and Matthew Cheung Salisbury, aided by Cristina Dondi, Richard Ovenden and a few surviving members of the former Society (notably Colin Franklin and Paul W.

As a result, there are opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and organizations to take advantage of those wishing to secure protection for their IP.\n\nRegistration services are organizations or individuals that contact IP applicants or owners and request payment for an apparently official registration of their IP.\n\nMany applicants for and owners of patents, trademarks and industrial design rights receive letters from such registration services and different IP offices and organizations around the world regularly issue warnings in connection with the offered services.\n\nThe registration services target applicants directly because patent, trademark and design applications are published a set time after filing or upon grant along with freely available information about a name and address for the applicant. Registration services use this information to send requests for payment to applicants shortly after publication. The documents are confusing as they appear to be from official governmental agencies and to be legitimate invoices.\n\nA scam increasing in frequency, as of October 2011, is an email originating from a domain name registrar or IT consulting company based in China that purports to notify a trademark holder that another entity is seeking to register the client’s trademark or business name as a domain name in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Asia. The email gives the brand owner a short period in time in which to secure the domain name for their own. These notifications are essentially solicitations. Generally, in the event there really is a third-party who is seeking to register your brand name for nefarious purposes, there are channels available for addressing such uses if and when they materialize.\n\n\nRegistration services are known to target applicants of international patent applications.

{"id": "490979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=490979", "title": "The Beastmaster", "text": "The Beastmaster\n\nThe Beastmaster is a 1982 sword and sorcery film directed by Don Coscarelli and starring Marc Singer, Tanya Roberts, John Amos and Rip Torn loosely based on the novel \"The Beast Master\" by Andre Norton. The film is about a child who is stolen from his mother's womb by a witch. The child grows into Dar, who has the ability to communicate telepathically with animals. Dar grows up in a village where he learns to do battle. But the village is destroyed by a race of beast-like warriors under the control of the sorcerer Maax. Dar vows revenge and travels with new friends to stop Maax from causing any more problems.\n\nCommercially \"The Beastmaster\" was not considered a box office success during its original cinematic run; however later it received extensive television exposure and success on cable in the American market on channels TBS and HBO. The original film spawned two sequels as well as a syndicated television series that chronicled the further adventures of Dar.\n\nIn the kingdom of Aruk, the high priest Maax [ ] is given a prophecy by his witches that he would die facing the son of King Zed. Learning of Maax's scheme to murder his child as a sacrificial offering to the kingdom's god Ar, Zed exiled Maax and his followers from the city. However, Maax sent one of his witches to transfer the unborn child from the womb of Zed's queen and into a cow to be born. After his birth the witch brands the infant with Ar's mark, but is killed by a villager who takes the infant in his care and raises him as his own son. Named Dar while raised in the village of Emur, the child learns how to fight while advised by his father to keep his ability to telepathically communicate with animals a secret. Years later, a fully grown Dar witnesses his people being slaughtered by the Juns, a horde of fanatic barbarians allied with Maax. Dar, the only survivor of the attack, journeys to Aruk to avenge his people. In time, Dar is joined by an eagle that he names Sharak, a pair of thieving ferrets he calls Kodo and Podo, and a black tiger whom he names Ruh.\n\nEventually, Dar meets a redheaded slave girl called Kiri before getting himself lost and ending up surrounded by an eerie half-bird, half-human race who dissolve their prey for nourishment. As the bird men worship eagles, they spare Dar when he summons Sharak and give him an amulet should he need their aid. Dar soon arrives to Aruk where Maax had assumed total control with the Juns support and subjects the people to witness their children being sacrificed. After having Sharak save the child of a townsman named Sacco, Dar learns that Kiri is to be sacrificed. On his way to save her, Dar is joined by Zed's younger son Tal and his bodyguard Seth, learning that Kiri is Zed's niece as the three work to save her. While Seth goes to gather their forces, Dar helps Kiri and Tal infiltrate the temple and save the now eyeless Zed and while escaping from the temple's beast-like Death Guards and Maax himself, leading his small coven of evil witches.\n\nConsumed by revenge, Zed refuses to listen to Dar's warning against ordering an immediate attack on the city and rejects him as a freak. Forced to leave, Dar later learns that his friends are captured and races to Aruk to save them from being sacrificed. In the conflict that followed, Maax reveals Dar's relationship to Zed before slitting his throat and facing the Beastmaster. Despite being stabbed, revived by his remaining witch before she was killed, Maax was about to kill Dar when Kodo sacrifices himself to cause the high priest to fall into the sacrificial flames. But the victory is short-lived as the Jun horde are approaching Aruk, arriving by nightfall to face the trap Dar and the people set up for them. Tal gets wounded as Dar succeeds in burning most of the Juns alive while defeating their chieftain before the bird-men arrive to consume those remaining. The following day, though Seth learned that he is Zed's first born, Dar explains that Tal would make a better king as he leaves Aruk. Dar sets off into the wild with Kiri, Ruh, Sharak and Podo (who has given birth to two baby ferrets) on the path to new adventures.\n\n\n\"Beastmaster\" began with a screenplay in the early 1980s written by Paul Pepperman and Don Coscarelli. The two writers based their film on Andre Norton's 1959 novel \"The Beast Master\". The writers changed the story dramatically as the original novel had the hero named Hosteen Storm who was a Navajo fighter in a futuristic science fiction setting. Norton was unhappy with the liberties taken with the film's script and asked for her name to be removed from the credits. When Coscarelli signed on as a director, Pepperman became the film's producer and brought in co-producer Sylvio Tabet to the project. The producers went to raise funds for the film at the 1981 MIFED film market in Milan and at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. The budget of $9 million was raised, giving director Coscarelli his highest budget to work with up until that point in his career.\n\nCoscarelli was frustrated while making the film, during which he feuded with the film's executive producer predominantly over the film's editing and casting. Coscarelli originally wanted Demi Moore for the role of Kiri, but the executive producer overrode his choice and had Tanya Roberts cast. The role of Maax was originally written for Klaus Kinski, but he was not cast over a salary dispute. The film was shot over the course of five-and-a-half months. The film was shot in California's Simi Valley and in Los Padres National Forest's Lake Piru in Ventura County, and Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. Interior shots were done at MGM/UA lot.\n\nThe score was composed and conducted by Lee Holdridge; it was recorded in Rome with members of The Orchestra of the Academy of Santa Cecilia of Rome and the Radio Symphony Orchestra of Rome. The soundtrack album was originally issued by Varèse Sarabande, and subsequently by C.A.M. In 2013 Quartet Records released a 1200-copy limited edition featuring the original album (tracks 1–13, disc 1) and most of the film's score (Holdridge wrote eighty minutes of music for the film; a few cues could not be found, but the album includes music that was not heard in the finished product).\n\n\n\"The Beastmaster\" was planned to open December 25, 1982 until it was announced in July that United Artists had acquired domestic distribution rights and rescheduled the film for a summer release. It was rescheduled to August 1982 had a promotional sneak peek of the film at the Comic Book and Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Beastmaster\" premièred in theatres on August 19, 1982. It was released in 16 cities in the United States on 165 screens and opened in eight more cities and 66 screens in its second week. The film opened in fifth place on its opening week. After six weeks, it had a total box office of revenue of $3,561,475.\n\nIt subsequently received significant local TV and cable airplay, notably HBO and TBS and TNT. The film was shown so often on HBO, that comedian Dennis Miller joked that HBO stood for \"Hey, Beastmaster's On\". In 1993, a programming director for TNT claimed that it was second-only to \"Gone with the Wind\" as the most popular movie to air on the network and attributed its success to its \"mythological appeal—it's more serious than the \"Conan\" movies.\" while Another programming director, for Cinemax, stated that \"You can come into any part of it and not feel you've missed much.\"\n\n\"The Beastmaster\" grossed roughly $14 million on its initial theatrical release. Josh Milrad was nominated for a Young Artist Award for \"Best Young Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture\" for his co-starring role as Tal in the film.\n\nAccording to \"Variety\", the film opened to mixed reviews. Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave it two stars out of four and wrote that it \"isn't bad as much as it is overlong. After one of the film's major bad guys has been bumped off, the film inexplicably goes on for another 20 minutes. In this sort of brainless adventure film, one climax is enough.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" thought the film was \"neither better nor worse than 'Conan the Barbarian'\" and \"looks both big and cheap.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"When 'The Beastmaster' begins, it is very hard to tell what it is all about. An hour later, it is very hard to care what it is all about. Another hour later, it is very hard to remember what it was all about.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a veritable comic book adventure come alive\" that \"succeeds on its own merits.\" Tom Milne of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" found the film \"marginally livelier\" than \"Conan the Barbarian\" but criticized the \"very basic acting, the appalling post-synching, the sets which resort to disconcertingly ramshackle models, and direction of supreme stodginesss which predictably uses helicopter shots to illustrate the eagle's spying missions (when all it sees as a rule is the hero prancing on the hilltops in self-conscious martial arts poses).\"\n\nThe film holds a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3 out of 10.\n\n\"The Beastmaster\" received a sequel in 1991 \"\". The film was directed by the original film producer Sylvio Tabet. The direct-to-video third film was released in 1996 titled \"\". Both sequels feature Marc Singer in the role of Dar. The films were followed by a syndicated television series in 1999. The television series changes the backstory of Dar who is played by Daniel Goddard.\n\n\n"}

The exhibitions challenge a popular western mindset of God as a white male and instead explores new images showing \"The Black Woman is God\".\n\nThe first iteration of The Black Woman is God was intended as a solo exhibition for Seneferu, curated by Green, at the African American Art & Culture Complex. Seneferu agreed to participate in the exhibition only if other black female artists were included. The exhibition included 20 visual and performance artists. The opening reception also included a performing arts show as part of the exhibition and was called \"vibrant and magnificent\".\n\nThe second, expanded iteration of The Black Woman is God, with 60 artists, opened on July 7, 2016 and ran through August 16, 2016.\n\nArt critics called it as \"timely\", \"organic\", and \"vivid\". Sheila Bapat of Bitch Magazine said \"The exhibit intentionally turns the historic devaluation of Black women and their contributions—social, political, economical—on its head. This exhibit asserts Black women’s power and beauty and does not seek to devalue any other group in the process... It applies pressure to the beliefs and values undergirding the laws and policies that exclude Black women’s lives from economic policymaking and their labor from economic value and protection.\"\n\nThe third iteration of The Black Woman is God, also curated by Karen Seneferu and Melorra Green, returned to SOMArts on July 20, 2017, running through August 26, 2017. The exhibition has the work of 80 artists on view. SOMArts, the California Digital Library and Art Practical held a Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon on July 22 in conjunction with the exhibition \"to raise the online visibility of Black women artists and challenge the gaps in art history that erase or minimize Black women’s contributions as artists, activists and social change-makers.\"\n\nThey plan for 2018 to have more events in Oakland where many artists live and would like future exhibitions to travel around the country and the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "14767906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14767906", "title": "The Great Escape (book)", "text": "The Great Escape (book)\n\nThe Great Escape is an insider's account by Australian writer Paul Brickhill of the 1944 mass escape from the German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III for British and Commonwealth airmen. As a prisoner in the camp, he participated in the escape plan but was debarred from the actual escape 'along with three or four others on grounds of claustrophobia'. The introduction to the book is written by George Harsh, an American POW at Stalag Luft III. This book was made into the 1963 film \"The Great Escape\".\n\nThe book covers the planning, execution and aftermath of what became known as \"The Great Escape\". Other escape attempts (such as the Wooden Horse) are mentioned as well as the postwar hunt for the Gestapo agents who murdered fifty of the escapees on Hitler's direct order. The book was published in 1950. Brickhill, a journalist before and after the war, had previously written the story four different ways, initially as a BBC talk, then as newspaper and \"Reader's Digest\" articles, and in the 1946 book \"Escape to Danger\" which he co-wrote with Conrad Norton. By the time of the 1950 book, Brickhill had eliminated some of the less heroic aspects of the story, including the fact that a large proportion of the compound's population had no interest in the escape.\n\nMuch of the book is focused on Royal Air Force Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, also known as \"Big X\", including his capture, early escape attempts, and planning of the escape. All the major participants and their exploits are described by Brickhill. Among these are Tim Walenn, the principal forger, who 'gave his factory the code name of \"Dean and Dawson\", after a British travel agency'; Al Hake, the compass maker; Des Plunkett, the ingenious chief map tracer, who made a mimeograph for reproducing maps; and Tommy Guest, who ran a team of tailors. Major John Dodge, who was related by marriage to Winston Churchill, was one of the escapees. The German officers and guards (called 'goons' by the prisoners) included teams of 'ferrets' who crawled about under the raised huts looking for signs of tunnels. They were carefully watched by teams of POW 'stooges', one of whom was Paul Brickhill, 'boss of a gang of \"stooges\" guarding the forgers'.\n\nIn the end, seventy-six men escaped. Seventy-three were recaptured and fifty of those were shot by the Gestapo against the Geneva Convention which stated that POW's could not be killed for trying to escape. Four of the remaining twenty-three later tunnelled out of Sachsenhausen (a concentration camp), but were recaptured and chained to the floor of their cells. One of them, Major John Dodge, was released to secure a cease-fire. Three made it home safely.\n\nThe book is dedicated \"to The Fifty\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the escape, according to Brickhill, 5,000,000 Germans spent time looking for the prisoners, many of them full-time for weeks. According to Brickhill's biographer Stephen Dando-Collins, while this may have been an aspiration of the escapees, there is no foundation for such an exaggerated claim, which added to the story's heroic narrative.\n\nThree tunnels were dug for the escape. They were named \"Tom\", \"Dick\", and \"Harry\". The operation was so secretive that everyone was to refer to each tunnel by its name. Bushell took this so seriously that he threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word \"tunnel\" aloud. \"Tom\" was dug in hut 123 and extended west into the forest. It was found by the Germans and dynamited. \"Dick\" was dug in the shower room of hut 122 and had the most secure trap door. It was to go in the same direction as \"Tom\" and the prisoners decided that the hut would not be a suspected tunnel site as it was more inward than the others. \"Dick\" was abandoned for escape purposes because the area where it would have surfaced was cleared for camp expansion. \"Dick\" was then used to store dirt, supplies, and as a workshop. \"Harry\", which was in hut 104, was the tunnel ultimately used for the escape. It was discovered as the escape was in progress with only seventy-six of the planned two hundred and twenty prisoners free. To avoid the disaster of \"Tom\", \"Harry\" was filled with sewage, sand, and sealed with cement. After the escape, the prisoners started digging another tunnel called \"George\", but this was abandoned when the camp was evacuated.\n\nOn October 2, 2012, Penguin released \"Human Game: The True Story of the 'Great Escape' Murders and the Hunt for the Gestapo Gunmen\" by author and journalist Simon Read. The book details the 50 murders that took place following the escape and the three-year manhunt by the Royal Air Force to bring the killers to justice.\n\nOn January 27, 1951, NBC broadcast a live drama adaptation as an episode of \"The Philco Television Playhouse\", starring E.G. Marshall, Everett Sloane, Horace Braham, and Kurt Katch. The live broadcast was praised for engineering an ingenious set design for the live broadcast, including creating the illusion of underground tunnels.\n\nIn 1963, the Mirisch brothers worked with United Artists to adapt the book to produce the film \"The Great Escape\" starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Richard Attenborough.\n\nThe film itself was also an inspiration for the film \"Chicken Run\".\n\nIn 1986, Ocean Software released the first \"Great Escape\" video game for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and DOS platforms.\n\nIn 2003, a new \"Great Escape\" game based on the film was released by Eidos for Xbox and PlayStation 2.\n\nProducer and writer Hideo Kojima took inspiration from \"The Great Escape\" for 1987's \"Metal Gear\".\n\n\n"}

The \"kinship\" members have been further identified as Saint Anne with a book on the left with her husband Joachim behind her and behind him Saint Joseph holding a lily towards his wife as a gesture of the immaculate conception. Three young cousins of the infants, the later disciples Simon, Jacob and John, pour wine into a chalice in the centre of the painting which is a reference to the Eucharist, and beyond them a sculpture of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac on the altar represents God's sacrifice of Jesus. A young Judas stands lighting the candles of the choir gate. In the doorways of the choir gate stand the other two former husbands of Saint Anne, the fathers of the other two Marias who are positioned behind St. Elisabeth.\n\nThis painting is a former altarpiece of an unspecified church, though it is tempting to imagine similarities to the \"Commanderie van Sint-Jan\" where Geertgen is known to have lived and worked: Janskerk, Haarlem. The provenance of this painting only goes back to a Brussels sale in 1797 however, and indeed the painting was purchased in 1808 as a work by Jan and Hubert van Eyck. It wasn't until 1888 that it was identified as a work by the Haarlem master. Since then several attempts have been made to determine the origins of the painting. In his translated \"Schilder-boeck\", Hessel Miedema reported that Geertgen died somewhere between 1486 and 1492, while recent dendrochronology, on the other hand, places the painting around 1496 at the earliest. The painting has many similar details in common with Albert van Ouwater's circa 1445 \"Lazarus\" and the tiled floor is similar to a contemporary painting by the Master of Alkmaar:\n\nThis painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all \"Highlights of the Rijksmuseum\" catalogs. It was the subject of a mini-exhibition after 17 years were spent 1983-2000 restoring 12 centimeters of water damage at the bottom of the painting.\n\n"}
{"id": "92494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92494", "title": "The King in Yellow", "text": "The King in Yellow\n\nThe King in Yellow is a book of short stories by American writer Robert W. Chambers, first published by F. Tennyson Neely in 1895. The book is named after a play with the same title which recurs as a motif through some of the stories. The first half of the book features highly esteemed weird stories, and the book has been described by critics such as E. F. Bleiler, S. T. Joshi and T. E. D. Klein as a classic in the field of the supernatural. There are ten stories, the first four of which (\"The Repairer of Reputations\", \"The Mask\", \"In the Court of the Dragon\", and \"The Yellow Sign\") mention \"The King in Yellow\", a forbidden play which induces despair or madness in those who read it. \"The Yellow Sign\" inspired a film of the same name released in 2001.\n\nThe British first edition was published by Chatto & Windus in 1895 (316 pages).\n\nThe first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:\n\n\nThese stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters that are often artists or decadents, inhabitants of the \"demi-monde\".\n\nThe first and fourth stories, \"The Repairer of Reputations\" and \"The Yellow Sign\", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories, \"The Mask\" and \"In the Court of the Dragon\", are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: \"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\"\n\nThe weird and macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.\n\nThe stories in the book are:\n\n\nThe fictional play \"The King in Yellow,\" has at least two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla and \"The Stranger\", who may or may not be the title character.\n\nChambers' story collection excerpts some sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\n\nIt is also stated, in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, \"Not upon us, oh, king! Not upon us!\"\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths. \"The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect.\" Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: \"If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it [...]\" (\"The Repairer of Reputations\").\n\nChambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from \"The Repairer of Reputations\":\nHe mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. \"The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever,\" he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.\nA similar passage occurs in \"The Yellow Sign\", in which two protagonists have read \"The King in Yellow\":\nNight fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.\nChambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali and Hastur from Ambrose Bierce: specifically, his short stories \"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\" and \"Haïta the Shepherd\". There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in \"Haïta the Shepherd\", but is implicitly a location in \"The Repairer of Reputations\", listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran.\n\nBrian Stableford pointed out that the story \"The Demoiselle d'Ys\" was influenced by the stories of Théophile Gautier, such as \"Arria Marcella\" (1852); both Gautier and Chambers' stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural time slip. The name Jeanne d'Ys is also a homophone for the word jaundice and continues the symbolism of The King in Yellow.\n\nIn Raymond Chandler's 1938 detective story, also titled \"The King in Yellow\", the protagonist says \"The King in Yellow. I read a book by that title once.\"\n\nThe first season of HBO's \"True Detective\" television series revolves around a string of crimes committed by the elusive \"Yellow King\" with Carcosa also being mentioned on numerous occasions. Black stars are also prominent in reference and imagery during the series.\n\nSCP Foundation entry SCP-701, The Hanged King, is possibly a reference to this. The titular play being one that causes violence and insanity among both the cast and audience members.\n\nH. P. Lovecraft read \"The King in Yellow\" in early 1927\nand included passing references to various things and places from the book—such as the Lake of Hali and the Yellow Sign — in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" (1931),\none of his main Cthulhu Mythos stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers' method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The play \"The King in Yellow\" effectively became another piece of occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos alongside the \"Necronomicon\" and others.\n\nIn the story, Lovecraft linked the Yellow Sign to Hastur, but from his brief (and only) mention it is not clear what Lovecraft meant Hastur to be. August Derleth developed Hastur into a Great Old One in his controversial reworking of Lovecraft's universe, elaborating on this connection in his own mythos stories. In the writings of Derleth and a few other latter-day Cthulhu Mythos authors, the King in Yellow is an Avatar of Hastur, so named because of his appearance as a thin, floating man covered in tattered yellow robes.\n\nIn Lovecraft's cycle of horror sonnets, \"Fungi from Yuggoth\", sonnet XXVII \"The Elder Pharos\" mentions the last Elder One who lives alone talking to chaos via drums: \"The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide a face not of this earth...\". This thing with a silken mask of yellow also features in \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\". \n\nIn the \"Call of Cthulhu\" roleplaying game published by Chaosium, the King in Yellow is an avatar of Hastur who uses his eponymous play to spread insanity among humans. He is described as a hunched figure clad in tattered, yellow rags, who wears a smooth and featureless \"Pallid Mask\". Removing the mask is a sanity-shattering experience; the King's face is described as \"inhuman eyes in a suppurating sea of stubby maggot-like mouths; liquescent flesh, tumorous and gelid, floating and reforming\".\n\nAlthough none of the characters in Chambers' book describe the plot of the play, Kevin Ross fabricated a plot for the play within the \"Call of Cthulhu\" mythos.\n\n\"The Secret World\", a Lovecraft-inspired massively multiplayer online role-playing game, quotes Cassilda's Song and other elements from \"The King in Yellow\" during a quest.\n\nThe theft of a supposed manuscript of the play \"The King in Yellow\" from the British Library forms a major plot element of Charles Stross's Lovecraft-inspired book \"The Annihilation Score\".\n\nIn Alan Moore's comic series \"Providence\", as well as its sequel \"Neonomicon\", Moore re-imagines the Lovecraftian mythos while referencing and borrowing heavily from \"The King in Yellow\". The book is referenced by name throughout \"Providence\", as well as referencing a fictional variation \"Sous Le Monde\", French for \"Under the World.\" In both \"Providence\" and its sequel, a recurring character named Johnny Carcosa appears as an avatar/speaker for a Lovecraftian entity, possibly Nyarlathotep or Azathoth.\n\nGame designer Robin D. Laws, having written a collection of Chamber-inspired stories entitled \"New Tales of the Yellow Sign\", has converted the story \"Repairer of Reputations\" for \"Trail of Cthulhu\". He is currently writing a Yellow King Roleplaying Game, including crossover content for the Cthulhu Mythos.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "800980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=800980", "title": "Time Squad", "text": "Time Squad\n\nTime Squad is an American children's animated television series created by Dave Wasson for Cartoon Network, and the 10th of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. It follows the adventures of Otto Osworth, Buck Tuddrussel, and the robot Larry 3000, a trio of hapless \"time cops\" living in the far distant future who travel back in time attempting to correct the course of history. During their adventures, they run into major historical figures such as Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln, Sigmund Freud, Leonardo da Vinci, the Founding Fathers, and Moctezuma, who have taken a drastically different course of life than history dictates. The mission of the Time Squad is to guide these figures onto the correct path and ensure the integrity of the future.\n\nThe series premiered during Cartoon Network's marathon block \"Cartoon Cartoon Summer\" on June 8, 2001, and ended after two seasons on November 26, 2003, airing 26 episodes in total. In the course of its run, the series received five Annie Award nominations. Creator Dave Wasson described the series as \"a C-student's guide to history\". It is also the final Cartoon Network original series to premiere during Betty Cohen's tenure, as she later resigned due to creative disagreements with Jamie Kellner, then-head of Turner Broadcasting System.\n\nThe show is set in the year 100,000,000 AD, on a satellite which orbits Earth. This future Earth is never visited directly, though it is referred in dialogue as a peaceful utopia where there are no longer any problems to solve. All nations of the world have merged into one, and according to Tuddrussel, there are \"no wars, no pollution, and bacon is good for your heart\".\n\nDespite this cheerful vision of the future, the space station on which the characters live and from which they travel to the past is remarkably dystopic. It features a shooting range, a terrarium and a prison for repeat offenders, but it is dank, outdated (for the time) and unclean. Mostly this seems to be down to officer Buck Tuddrussel (Rob Paulsen), a scruffy and immature perennial bachelor, who nevertheless happens to be the station's most senior officer.\n\nThe only other official member of Buck's unit is Larry 3000 (Mark Hamill), a translator robot and former diplomat who was rendered more or less obsolete when all of the world's nations merged. Buck's mindless machismo clashes with Larry's effete sensibilities, and the two bicker terribly. Added to this the fact that neither of them has any great knowledge of history, they made a rather poor team together.\n\nHowever, when they encounter Otto Osworth (Pamela Adlon), an 8-year-old boy who happens to be an orphan from the 21st century, he is quickly recruited and added to the team. Otto is shown to be the only one on the team with any enthusiasm or competence for the job. The problem is, neither of the other two are particularly willing to listen to his advice, and he must often resort to trickery to make sure the mission is completed.\n\nThe Time Squad organization is set up to ensure that history is maintained and the future protected. According to Larry 3000, \"time is like a rope\", and, as it is woven at one end, ages and gradually unravels and frays at the other. In the context of the show, this often means that historical figures have made different, sometimes anachronistic, choices in life (see free will), and as such will not be able to fulfill the role that history says they fulfilled (an example of this Henry Ford did not invent the automobile assembly line due to constant hostility of the dodo birds that never became extinct). According to creator Dave Wasson, \"We started by basically knowing what a guy did in history, then found the most outlandish way he could go wrong\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Note\": Despite were all directed by series creator Dave Wasson, Larry Leichliter co-directed with him in \"Keepin' It Real with Sitting Bull\", \"A Thrilla at Attila's\", \"Pasteur's Packs O' Punch\", \"Love at First Flight\", \"Child's Play\", \"Father Figure of Our Country\", and \"Floral Patton\".\n\n\n\"Time Squad\" has not received any official DVD releases. However, the episode \"Dishonest Abe\" is featured in the \"Powerpuff Girls\" VHS \"Meet the Beat-Alls\".\n\nCartoon Network and Subway partnered to release five \"Time Squad\"-themed toys in Subway Kids Paks. The promotion lasted from September 30 to November 17, 2002.\n\nThough the series has no official video games, the character Larry-3000 appears in the Cartoon Network game \"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "47336146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47336146", "title": "İmamkullu relief", "text": "İmamkullu relief\n\nThe Hittite İmamkullu relief (previously also \"İmamkulu\") is a rock relief near the town of İmamkullu in Tomarza district in Kayseri Province, Turkey. In Turkish it is known as \"Yazılı Kaya\" (\"inscribed cliff\") and \"Şimşekkaya\" (\"lightning cliff\"). Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of Hittite art. \n\nThe trachyte block with the relief is located on the flank of the 3045 m high Bey Dağı to the south of İmamkullu. This spot marks the start of the Gezbel pass, where two routes met and crossed the Taurus Mountains in ancient times. One of them came from the Hittite heartland through Kayseri and Tomarza, following the Zamantı Irmağı river; the other came from Cappadocia via Develi,passing the Fıraktın and Taşçı reliefs on the way. The Hanyeri relief stands at the other end of the Gezbel pass, to the southeast.\n\nThe relief is about 3.25 x 2 metres and was engraved on the northwest side of a large boulder, on a slightly convex, but conveniently flat surface. It is now very worn. It consists of three sections. The left section features a human figure, moving to the right, perhaps the creator of the monument, holding a spear in his left hand and a bow in his left (the string is only roughly indicated). On his belt there are knobs and some traces of a sword. He wears a round cap and there are traces also of a horn and pointed shoes. Luwian hieroglyphs were engraved in front of his head, which name him as a son of the king. His name is given as Kuwalanamuwa. A prince of this name is also known from the Hanyeri and Manisa reliefs. Whether they are all the same person is not certain, though certainly possible.\n\nThe central portion is the largest. In the upper part, the weather god is depicted in a chariot, driving to the right. He wears pointy shoes, a short soldier's kilt and a pointed hat with horns, which identifies him as a god. Traces of a sword can also be seen on his belt. He has a mace in his right hand and holds the reins of the galloping bulls which pull his chariot with his left hand. Above his outstretched hand there are three hieroglyphs which name him as the weather god of heaven; a fourth hieroglyph below the others is no longer legible. The god and his chariot stand on the bent necks of three mountain gods, in a manner similar to the main scene at Yazılıkaya. The wear the long robes and peaked hats which are usual for mountain gods, and are armed with swords. They themselves stand on top of three chimaeric creatures with cat's heads and raised human arms.\n\nThe top part of the right portion of the relief shows a facing goddess with raised arms, who is probably Šauška/Ishtar. Her head is in profile, looking left towards the approaching weather god. Her arms hold her robe open. On her head there are four or five prongs of a crown or coiffure. Wings rise up from her shoulders. Ehringhaus identifies a six-pointed star above her right hand. Her legs are depicted without feet, in the manner of cult statues and she stands on top of a stylised tree. Between the weather god and the goddess, is a bird flying to the left. The motif of the weather god and an undressing goddess, often with a bird between them, is attested from the early Bronze age on Syrian cylinder seals (and other media). Jutta Börker-Klähn proposes a connection with the Asherdu myth, in which Ishtar in the form of a bird catches the weather god having sex with Asherdu, the wife of Elkunirsa.\n\nThe relief is dated to the 13th century BC, the late Hittite empire, like the Hanyeri relief.\n\nA report was first published by the French orientalist Louis Delaporte after its discovery by Kemaleddin Karamete of Kayseri in 1934. In 1935 the American orientalist Ignace Gelb visited the site. Sedat Alp and Ekrem Akurgal recorded the inscription in their Anatolian work of 1947. In 1975, Markus Wäfler published a description of the relief and its inscriptions. In the same year, Piero Meriggi proposed a reading of the hieroglyphs, which Hans Gustav Güterbock, who visited the relief in 1978, supported. A different reading of the left hand figure's name was proposed by Jutta Börker-Klähn. In 1983, Kay Kohlmeyer published a detailed description and discussion of the monument. Finally, Horst Ehringhaus provides another description of the image and inscriptions in his 2005 book on the cliff inscriptions of the Hittite empire.\n\nA cast of the relief is displayed outside the Archaeological Museum of Kayseri.\n\n\n"}
