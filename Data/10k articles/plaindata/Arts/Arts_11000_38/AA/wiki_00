With the institution entrusted to him, every action must be confirmed by some official certificate, sometimes by several. Not only the visitors, but also the workers of \"BORE\" literally drown in unnecessary and meaningless pieces of paper, which slows down all sorts of tasks. Pyotr Petrovich Ficusov, Petukhov's stand-in, strongly supports his boss in his unbridled bureaucratic impulses.\n\nSoon Petukhov sets out to leave for a few days to go to his bride, but the unlucky groom is robbed by a pickpocket at a station, who in turn immediately falls under the wheels of a car. Police and medics arrive to inspect the corpse, find Petukhov's name in the documents and officially declare him dead. Having received the sad news, Ficusov, who is entrusted to temporarily perform director's duties, expands intense activities related to the upcoming funeral. Heartfelt obituaries are written, telegrams of condolences from other organizations are received, wall newspapers are drawn, an orchestra is arranged ...\n\nAnd at this time the unsuspecting Petukhov returns to \"BORE\" in a good mood. When entering his office he almost faints: Petukhov sees his own portrait adorned with a black frame! He is officially dead! True to his bureaucratic training, Petukhov does not allow his death certificate to be destroyed, which has become unnecessary, instead he decides to get a certificate of being alive. Doctors take Petukhov for a madman when he comes to the hospital with such an unusual inquiry. As a result, Petukhov is in a closed bureaucratic loop of his own creation. Even faithful Ficusov is unable to help his director, since Petukhov does not have the \"correct\" authorizing document. The situation is saved by a policeman who simply tears up Petukhov's certificate of death. Bride of Petukhov leaves him, he is removed from the director's post, and his establishment is closed. In place of \"BORE\" (and similar bureaucratic organizations which nested in the building) a hotel is opened and Petukhov, now working as a tour guide, shows it to the tourists as a local landmark.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "985094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=985094", "title": "Armani", "text": "Armani\n\nGiorgio Armani S.p.A. () is an Italian luxury fashion house founded by Giorgio Armani which designs, manufactures, distributes and retails haute couture, ready-to-wear, leather goods, shoes, watches, jewelry, accessories, eyewear, cosmetics and home interiors. The brand markets these products under several labels: \"Giorgio Armani Privé\", \"Giorgio Armani\", \"Armani Collezioni\", \"Emporio Armani\" (including \"EA7\"), \"AJ | Armani Jeans\", \"Armani Junior\", and \"AX | Armani Exchange\". The brand utilizes the association of the Armani name with high-fashion, benefiting from its prestige in the fashion industry. In 2016, estimated sales of the company were around $2.65 billion. In 2017, Giorgio Armani announced that his company will close two of its fashion labels, Armani Collezioni and Armani Jeans, as part of the restructuring process for his company. While Armani Collezioni will merge back into the \"Giorgio Armani\" line, Armani Jeans will be mixed with the Emporio Armani line due to their similarities in styles and the use of the same brand logo.\n\nGiorgio Armani is in collaboration with Emaar Properties, a chain of luxury hotels and resorts in several big cities including Milan, Paris, New York, London, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Shanghai, Seoul, Dubai. The company already operates a range of cafés worldwide, in addition to a bar and nightclub.\n\n\"Giorgio Armani\" is a high-end label specializing in men's and women's ready-to-wear, accessories, glasses, cosmetics, and perfumes. It is available only in Giorgio Armani boutiques, specialty clothiers and select high-end department stores. The logo is a curved \"G\" completing a curved \"A\", forming a circle.\n\nIn 2016, the fashion house stopped using animal fur in all of its collections, citing the availability of \"valid alternatives at our disposition that render the use of cruel practices unnecessary as regards animals.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Wall Street Journal\" and other influential sources, in addition to couture line Armani Privé, Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani are company's ready-to-wear lines that show at Milan fashion week. In addition, selling at lower prices are Armani Collezioni, Armani Exchange and Armani Jeans.\n\n\"Emporio Armani\" is the second brand of Armani family, features ready-to-wear and runway collections.\nEmporio Armani focuses on trends and modern traits. Also, \"Emporio Armani\" along with \"Giorgio Armani\" are the only two ready-to-wear brands that are mainly designed by Giorgio Armani himself, and has a spotlight at Milan Fashion Week every year while Armani Collezioni, Armani Jeans, and Armani Exchange do not. Emporio Armani is usually only sold in freestanding Emporio Armani boutiques and its official website.\n\nApollo Minerva starred in four Emporio Armani underwear campaigns from Spring/Summer 2008 to Fall/Winter 2009-2010. Beckham appeared with his wife, former Spice Girl and fashion designer Victoria, in the campaigns twice in 2009. All campaigns were photographed by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott.\n\nIn January 2010, football star Cristiano Ronaldo and Hollywood movie star Megan Fox became the male and female face and body of Emporio Armani. In 2011 Megan Fox was replaced with Rihanna and Ronaldo was replaced by tennis athlete Rafael Nadal. Emporio Armani has teamed up with Reebok to create fashion shoes under the label \"EA7\".\n\nEmporio Armani has boutiques in Oslo, Frankfurt, Amman, Bahrain, Jeddah, Bogotá, Miami, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Madrid, Chicago, Paris, London, Glasgow, Los Angeles, Houston, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Milan, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, Sydney, Dubai, Daka, Lima, Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok, New York, Zürich, Cape Town, Santiago de Chile, Melbourne, Manila, Dominican Republic, São Paulo, Vienna, New Delhi, and many other cities around the world.\n\n\"Armani Collezioni\" (formerly \"Giorgio Armani Le Collezioni\") is the diffusion line of Giorgio Armani that retails at a lower price than \"Giorgio Armani\" and the haute couture line, \"Armani Privé\". The logo is usually displayed black written on a white label, but often varies. \"Armani\" being larger and \"Collezioni\" underneath it. It provides made-to-measure tailored suits and shirts where every element can be chosen. In addition to being sold in the two freestanding boutiques (which feature the \"Collezioni\" line exclusively) in Milan and Paris, \"Armani Collezioni\" usually sold in department stores and outlets while Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani only sold in freestanding boutiques.\n\nLast year, a sporty line of this label has appeared named \"Armani Collezioni Active\" in the same way as the EA7 line from Emporio Armani line.\n\n\"Armani Jeans\" is a diffusion line collection of denim-related clothing, created in 1981, by Giorgio Armani. \"Armani Jeans\" is mainly sold in department stores, although there are many freestanding \"Armani Jeans\" stores in the world, in addition to an \"Armani Jeans Cafe\" in Milan. Some Armani Jeans items are sold in Emporio Armani Stores.\n\nThis line does not feature Giorgio Armani's signature simplicity. The colors used are more diverse than those found in his higher end lines.\n\n\"A|X Armani Exchange\" was launched in 1991 in the U.S. It retails fashion and lifestyle products and is known for its occasionally provocative ad campaigns. Inspired by street-chic culture and dance music, it is targeted as the more accessible Armani brand.\n\nTo accelerate development of the nascent line, Giorgio Armani co-established the joint venture company Presidio Holdings Ltd in 2005 alongside Como Holdings, the company owned by the Singaporean tycoon Ong Beng Seng that, since 1994, has held the production and distribution license for A/X Armani Exchange in the United States, Canada, Central and South America and Asia-Pacific.\n\nInitially, the Italian company held 25% of Presidio Holdings, the remaining 75% in the hands of Como Holdings. In 2008, Giorgio Armani acquired an additional 25% stake. In 2014, it acquired the remaining 50% \"ensuring full ownership of the brand, which has 270 stores and over 3,000 employees\", the company said in a statement.\n\nArmani Exchange products are available exclusively in 270 stores in 31 countries and on the brand's website.\n\nGiorgio Armani also designs products specifically made for babies, toddlers and teenagers up to sixteen years old. Therefore, he came up with a new label called \"Armani Junior\" with a separate label within the product line entitled \"Armani Baby\". The \"Armani Junior\" brand was introduced in 1979. The sub-label was often criticized in the public eye because Armani occasionally used real fur for the \"Armani Junior\" autumn and winter collections. Many people tend to think that it's unreasonable for a large amount of the public to dress small children in high-end, luxury clothing, which families with a regular or even comfortable income cannot afford. The junior line consists of baby clothing and accessories as well as T-shirts, pullovers, suits, smokings, shoes, hats, shirts, belts, bags, underwear and accessories for children and teenagers. This \"Armani\" line is often viewed as the direct competitor of the Italian luxury brand Versace's \"Young Versace\".\n\n\"Armani Junior\" has 167 independent boutiques around the globe, which only sell the sub-label . The label is also sold in other stores by the label including \"Armani/Casa\", \"Armani Jeans\" or \"Emporio Armani\". In total, 308 independent and franchise \"Armani\" stores sell the \"Armani Junior\" and \"Armani Baby\" products throughout the whole world. In addition, the label is available in selected department stores everywhere in the world, for example Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Breuninger and Peek & Cloppenburg.\n\nThe label is a multi-million Dollar business, as the sub-label sold products woth of 2600 million Euros and earned about 750 million in 2010 and in 2011, sold products worth of about 3100 Euros and earned about 900 Euros. In 2012, the label boosted the sales, earning 1100 million Euros, selling products worth of 3600 million Euros. In 2013, the label gained sales of about 3550 million Euros, earning again 1100 million Euros that year alone.\n\nIn May 2014, Quvenzhané Wallis was named the face of \"Armani Junior\", which makes her the first major child celebrity to be the face of a luxury brand.\n\nThe \"Armani\" label also consists of a furniture and home collection called \"Armani/Casa\". While the Italian word \"casa\" usually means \"house\", its usage here instead means \"at home\". Giorgio Armani launched his interior design collection in 2000 with a flagship store opening in Milan, Italy the same year. When Armani was asked about why he wanted a furniture line, Armani said that he wanted \"people to design their own private home\". \"Designing this furniture and home collection helped me to stimulate my creative and artistic vein\", Armani said. Critics responded very positively to the \"Armani/Casa\" label calling the style \"simply elegant, a little retro with Ethno elements\" to it. A lot of critics also liked the fact that there are only a \"few ornaments\" used but with \"artistic detail\" which seem to have a \"tremendous effect on the style and furniture\" itself.\n\nArmani collaborates with \"Rubelli\" and the \"Molteni\" Group to build the home collection. As the \"Architectural Digest\" reported in February 2012, that \"Armani/Casa\" includes state-of-the-art kitchens, sold under the \"Armani/Dada\" name – a partnership with \"Molteni\" Group, as well as luxurious fabrics produced in collaboration with \"Rubelli\". \"Armani/Roca\" is yet another partnership, which provides Giorgio Armani with bathroom furniture and accessoires. The sub-label consisting of variegated products is sold in 183 independent \"Armani\" stores as well as selected retailers throughout the world. From 2000 on, \"Armani/Casa\" is a multi-million Dollar success for the label.\n\n\"Armani/Casa\" is used in the \"Armani\" hotels, equipped John Mayers New York City apartment and decorated the scenes for the 2013 film \"Paranoia\".\n\nA confectionery is also under the \"Armani\" name. The brand was established in 2002. For the creations and collections \"Armani\" collaborates with the Italian chocolate manufacturer \"Venchi\".\n\n\"Armani/Dolci\" sells chocolates, jams, honey, tea, shortbread biscuits, sugar, marrons glaces, fruit jellies and pralines. The brand is mostly part of other \"Armani\" stores but has got an independent boutique in Taichung, Taiwan. In total, 152 stores sell the \"Armani/Dolci'' products.\n\nOver the years, Armani created various limited \"Armani/Dolci\" products to celebrate special occasions. For example, Armani designed chocolate easter eggs, heart-shaped boxes with red, pink and lilac chocolate truffles for Valentine's Day, as well as a Ramadan collection for the Muslim holiday featuring refined colours of Islamic art and no alcohol. In addition, \"Armani/Dolci\" sells special delicate collections for Christmas and its significant anniversaries.\n\nThe \"Armani/Dolci\" brand is well received by both critics and the public.\n\nThe Giorgio Armani label also has a florist under its name, called \"Armani/Fiori\". The exclusive floral service is active since 2000 in major independent flower boutiques and other \"Armani\" stores around the world.\n\nThe flowers used for the \"Armani/Fiori\" arrangements come mostly from the Netherlands. The label uses a large selection of orchids, as well as exotic and tropical flowers alongside more traditional flowers such as hydrangeas, roses and peonies. Each collection is personally designed by Giorgio Armani himself as he wants to transport an \"Asian feel\". In addition, \"Armani/Fiori\" offers decorative elements like vases, flowerpots, candles and lanterns. For the collections, Armani uses precious materials like alabaster, black marble, lacquered wood in the shape of cylinders, cubes, and rhomboids. Giorgio Armani also designed special floral arrangements for occasions like Valentine's Day and spring collections. The labels floral arrangements are used in the \"Armani\" hotels.\n\nGiorgio Armani and Emaar Properties PJSC signed an agreement in 2005 for Emaar Properties PJSC to build and operate at least seven luxury hotels and three vacation resorts under the \"Armani\" name. Armani would be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the interior design and style of the hotels. The \"Armani\" hotel was opened in Burj Khalifa on April 27, 2010, comprising the bottom 39 floors of the supertall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It has 160 guest rooms and suites, and 144 residences. Giorgio Armani also designed the interiors of the \"Armani\" Residences, also within the skyscraper, and its specially designed line of products from the \"Armani/Casa\" home furnishings collection and the \"Armani/Fiori\" flower arrangements. The \"Burj Khalifa Armani Residences Road Show\" toured Milan, London, Jeddah, Moscow and Delhi. The London event was housed in the Armani Casa Showroom in New Bond Street.\n\n"}
{"id": "66076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66076", "title": "Art museum", "text": "Art museum\n\nAn art museum or art gallery is a building or space for the exhibition of art, usually visual art.\nMuseums can be public or private, but what distinguishes a museum is the ownership of a collection. Paintings are the most commonly displayed art objects; however, sculptures, decorative arts, furniture, textiles, costumes, drawings, pastels, watercolors, collages, prints, artist's books, photographs, and installation art are also regularly shown. Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings.\n\nThe term relates to public and private institutions. Public galleries are non-profit or public museums displaying selected art collections. Private galleries refer to commercial enterprises for selling art. However, both types may host traveling exhibits or temporary exhibitions including art borrowed from elsewhere.\n\nIn broad terms, in United States usage, the word \"gallery\" alone often implies a private gallery, while a public gallery is likely an \"art museum\". In British and Commonwealth usage, the word \"gallery\" alone implies a public gallery, which is distinguished from a \"private\" or \"commercial\" gallery, and the word \"museum\" alone is understood to refer to institutions holding collections of historic, archaeological or scientific artefacts, rather than fine art.\n\nThe rooms in museums where art is displayed for the public are often referred to as galleries as well, with a room dedicated to Ancient Egyptian art often being called the \"Egyptian Gallery\", for example.\n\nThe term contemporary art gallery refers to a private for-profit commercial gallery. These galleries are found clustered together in large urban centers. Smaller cities are home to at least one gallery, but they may also be found in towns or villages, and remote areas where artists congregate, \"e.g.\" the Taos art colony and St Ives, Cornwall.\n\nContemporary art galleries are often open to the general public without charge; however, some are semi-private. They profit by taking a portion of art sales; twenty-five to fifty per cent is typical. There are also many non-profit or collective galleries. Some galleries in cities like Tokyo charge the artists a flat rate per day, though this is considered distasteful in some international art markets. Galleries often hang solo shows. Curators often create group shows with a message about a certain theme, trend in art, or group of associated artists. Galleries sometimes choose to represent exclusive artists, giving them opportunities for regular shows.\n\nA gallery's definition can also include the artist cooperative or artist-run space, which often (in North America and Western Europe) operates as a space with a more democratic mission and selection process. Such galleries have a board of directors and a volunteer or paid support staff who select and curate shows by committee, or some kind of similar process to choose art often lacking commercial ends.\n\nA vanity gallery is an art gallery charging fees from artists to show their work, much like a vanity press does for authors. The shows lack legitimate curation and often include as many artists as possible. Most art professionals are able to identify them on an artist's resume.\n\nUniversity art museums and galleries constitute collections of art developed, owned, and maintained by all kinds of schools, community colleges, colleges, and universities. This phenomenon exists in the West and East, making it a global practice. Although overlooked, there are over 700 university art museums in the US alone. This number, compared to other kinds of art museums, makes university art museums perhaps the largest category of art museums in the country. While the first of these collections can be traced to learning collections developed in art academies in Western Europe, they are now associated with and housed in centers of higher education of all types.\n\nThroughout history, large and expensive works of art have generally been commissioned by religious institutions and monarchs and been displayed in temples, churches, and palaces. Although these collections of art were private, they were often made available for viewing for a portion of the public. In classical times, religious institutions began to function as an early form of art gallery. Wealthy Roman collectors of engraved gems (including Julius Caesar) and other precious objects often donated their collections to temples. It is unclear how easy it was in practice for the public to view these items.\nIn Europe, from the Late Medieval period onwards, areas in royal palaces, castles, and large country houses of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections could be viewed. At the Palace of Versailles, entrance was restricted to people wearing the proper apparel – the appropriate accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside. The treasuries of cathedrals and large churches, or parts of them, were often set out for public display. Many of the grander English country houses could be toured by the respectable for a tip to the housekeeper, during the long periods when the family were not in residence.\n\nSpecial arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with most of the paintings of the Orleans Collection, which were housed in a wing of the Palais-Royal in Paris and could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy, the art tourism of the Grand Tour became a major industry from the 18th century onwards, and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The Capitoline Museums began in 1471 with a donation of classical sculpture to the city of Rome by the Papacy, while the Vatican Museums, whose collections are still owned by the Pope, trace their foundation to 1506, when the recently discovered \"Laocoön and His Sons\" was put on public display. A series of museums on different subjects were opened over subsequent centuries, and many of the buildings of the Vatican were purpose-built as galleries. An early royal treasury opened to the public was the Grünes Gewölbe of the Kingdom of Saxony in the 1720s.\n\nPrivately established museums open to the public began to be established from the 17th century onwards, often based around a collection of the cabinet of curiosities type. The first such museum was the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, opened in 1683 to house and display the artefacts of Elias Ashmole that were given to Oxford University in a bequest.\n\nIn the second half of the eighteenth century, many private collections of art were nationalised and opened to the public.\n\nIn 1753, the British Museum was established and the Old Royal Library collection of manuscripts and artwork was donated to it for public viewing. In 1777, a proposal to the British government was put forward by MP John Wilkes to buy the art collection of the then late Sir Robert Walpole who had amassed one of the greatest such collections in Europe, and house it in a specially built wing of the British Museum for public viewing. After much debate, the idea was eventually abandoned due to the great expense, and twenty years later, the collection was bought by Tsaritsa Catherine the Great of Russia and housed in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) was opened to the public in 1779 and the Medici collection in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery). The opening of the Musée du Louvre during the French Revolution in 1793 as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection marked an important stage in the development of public access to art by transferring the ownership to a republican state; but it was a continuation of trends already well established.\nThe building now occupied by the Prado in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries were opened to the public in Vienna, Munich and other capitals. In Great Britain, however, the corresponding Royal Collection remained in the private hands of the monarch and the first purpose-built national art galleries were the Dulwich Picture Gallery, founded in 1814 and the National Gallery opened to the public a decade later in 1824.\n\nWorks on paper, such as drawings, pastels, watercolors, prints, and photographs are typically not permanently displayed for conservation reasons. Instead, public access to these materials is provided by a dedicated print study room located within the museum. Murals generally remain where they have been painted, although many have been removed to galleries. Various forms of 20th-century art, such as land art and performance art, also usually exist outside a gallery. Photographic records of these kinds of art are often shown in galleries, however. Most museum and large art galleries own more works than they have room to display. The rest are held in reserve collections, on or off-site.\n\nSimilar to an art gallery is the sculpture garden (or \"sculpture park\"), which presents sculpture in an outdoor space. Sculpture installation has grown in popularity, whereby temporary sculptures are installed in open spaces during events like festivals.\n\nThe architectural form of the art gallery was established by Sir John Soane with his design for the Dulwich Picture Gallery in 1817. This established the gallery as a series of interconnected rooms with largely uninterrupted wall spaces for hanging pictures and indirect lighting from skylights or roof lanterns.\n\nThe late 19th century saw a boom in the building of public art galleries in Europe and America, becoming an essential cultural feature of larger cities. More art galleries rose up alongside museums and public libraries as part of the municipal drive for literacy and public education.\n\nIn the middle and late twentieth century, earlier architectural styles employed for art museums (such as the Beaux-Arts style of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City or the Gothic and Renaissance Revival architecture of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum) succumbed to modern styles, such as Deconstructivism. Examples of this trend include the Guggenheim Museum in New York City by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao by Frank Gehry, Centre Pompidou-Metz by Shigeru Ban, and the redesign of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art by Mario Botta. Some critics argue these galleries defeat their purposes because their dramatic interior spaces distract the eye from the paintings they are supposed to exhibit.\n\nMany art museums throughout history have been designed with a cultural purpose or been subject to political intervention. In particular, national art galleries have been thought to incite feelings of nationalism. This has occurred in both democratic and non-democratic countries, although authoritarian regimes have historically exercised more control over administration of art museums. Ludwig Justi was for example dismissed as director of the Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) in Berlin in 1933 by the new Nazi authorities for not being politically suitable.\n\nThe question of the place of the art museum in its community has long been under debate. Some see art museums is fundamentally elitist institutions, while others see them as institutions with the potential for societal education and uplift. John Cotton Dana, an American librarian and museum director, as well as the founder of the Newark Museum, saw the traditional art museum as a useless public institution, one that focused more on fashion and conformity rather than education and uplift. Indeed, Dana's ideal museum would be one best suited for active and vigorous use by the average citizen, located near the center of their daily movement. In addition, Dana's conception of the perfect museum included a wider variety of objects than the traditional art museum, including industrial tools and handicrafts that encourage imagination in areas traditionally considered mundane. This view of the art museum envisions it as one well-suited to an industrial world, indeed enhancing it. Dana viewed paintings and sculptures as much less useful than industrial products, comparing the museum to a department store. In addition, he encouraged the active lending-out of a museum's collected objects in order to enhance education at schools and to aid in the cultural development of individual members of the community. Finally, Dana saw branch museums throughout a city as a good method of making sure that every citizen has access to its benefits. Dana's view of the ideal museum sought to invest a wider variety of people in it, and was self-consciously not elitist.\n\nSince the 1970s, a number of political theorists and social commentators have pointed to the political implications of art museums and social relations. Pierre Bourdieu, for instance, argued that in spite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position. So called cultural capital is a major factor in social mobility (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-status job). The argument states that certain art museums are aimed at perpetuating aristocratic and upper class ideals of taste and excludes segments of society without the social opportunities to develop such interest. The fine arts thus perpetuate social inequality by creating divisions between different social groups. This argument also ties in with the Marxist theory of mystification and elite culture.\n\nFurthermore, certain art galleries, such as the National Gallery in London and the Louvre in Paris are situated in buildings of considerable emotional impact. The Louvre in Paris is for instance located in the former Royal Castle of the ancient regime, and is thus clearly designed with a political agenda. It has been argued that such buildings create feelings of subjugation and adds to the mystification of fine arts.\n\nMost art museums have only limited online collections, but a few museums, as well as some libraries and government agencies, have developed substantial online catalogues. Museums, libraries, and government agencies with substantial online collections of prints, photographs, and other works on paper include:\n\n\nMuseums, libraries, and government agencies with substantial online collections with more focus on paintings and sculpture include:\n\n\nThere are a number of online art catalogues and galleries that have been developed independently of the support of any individual museum. Many of these, like American Art Gallery, are attempts to develop galleries of artwork that are encyclopedic or historical in focus, while others are commercial efforts to sell the work of contemporary artists.\n\nA limited number of such sites have independent importance in the art world. The large auction houses, such as Sotheby's, Bonhams, and Christie's, maintain large online databases of art which they have auctioned or are auctioning. Bridgeman Art Library serves as a central source of reproductions of artwork, with access limited to museums, art dealers, and other professionals or professional organizations.\n\nThere are also online galleries that have been developed by a collaboration of museums and galleries that are more interested with the categorization of art. They are interested in the potential use of folksonomy within museums and the requirements for post-processing of terms that have been gathered, both to test their utility and to deploy them in useful ways.\n\nThe steve.museum is one example of a site that is experimenting with this collaborative philosophy. The participating institutions include the Guggenheim Museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: There are relatively few local/regional/national organizations specifically for ART MUSEUMS. Most art museums are associated with local/regional/national organizations for ARTS or HUMANITIES or MUSEUMS.\nMany of these organizations, in the USA, are listed on these websites, with web links:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The basic aim of the foundation is, as quoted by founder Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, to \"disseminate art and culture by bringing together contemporary and traditional art, to collect, document, classify, preserve and promote works of contemporary and traditional art, to use this base in realizing creation, and to hand local and national cultural values down to future generations\" .\n\nThe museum was the idea of the painter and academic Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, who decided to build a museum in his hometown in the Black Sea region of Bayburt. The museum was opened in July, 2010, after taking approximately 20 years of preparation. Professor Hüsamettin Koçan said, “I didn’t do this for my own village, I did it for the people who live in my village and everywhere.”\n\n"}
{"id": "1037325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1037325", "title": "Bolliger &amp; Mabillard", "text": "Bolliger &amp; Mabillard\n\nBolliger & Mabillard, officially Bolliger & Mabillard Consulting Engineers Inc., and often abbreviated B&M, is a roller coaster design consultancy based in Monthey, Switzerland. The company was founded in 1988 by Walter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard, with Bolliger as president and Mabillard as vice-president. B&M has built over a hundred roller coasters around the world and pioneered several new ride technologies, most notably the inverted roller coaster. In North America, B&M coaster designs have been manufactured by Ohio company Clermont Steel Fabricators since 1990. B&M has grown significantly since its founding, originally employing four to as many as 37 in 2012, consisting primarily of engineers and draftsmen. In 2016, the company completed its 100th roller coaster.\n\nWalter Bolliger and Claude Mabillard started working for Giovanola, a manufacturing company who supplied rides to Intamin, in the 1970s. During their time at Giovanola, they helped design the company's first stand-up roller coaster, \"Shockwave\" at Six Flags Magic Mountain. They also worked on other projects, such as \"Z-Force\" at Six Flags Great America. Bolliger & Mabillard left Giovanola, but the company continued to use their track design, so the company's roller coasters, \"Goliath\" at Six Flags Magic Mountain and \"Titan\" at Six Flags Over Texas, use a track style very similar to B&M's.\nIn 1987, Giovanola underwent a change of management; Bolliger & Mabillard decided to leave, and founded their own company. At the time, B&M employed four people; two draftsmen, Bolliger, and Mabillard. When B&M was created, the pair had agreed not to make any more amusement attractions. However, Robert Mampe, Six Flags Great America's staff engineer, who had worked with both men during the construction of Z-Force, contacted the new company and asked it to reconfigure the cars for its Giavanola-built, Intamin bobsled coaster that was to be relocated from Six Flags Great Adventure. Following that project Mampe asked the new company to design and build a stand-up roller coaster for Six Flags Great America, similar to Shockwave at Six Flags Magic Mountain. B&M accepted the offer and hired two more draftsmen. But B&M had a problem regarding how and where to manufacture the track pieces for the roller coaster. With the impression of the work done by Clermont Steel Fabricators on \"Vortex\" at Kings Island and \"Shockwave\" Six Flags Great America, Walter Bolliger went to the steel plant and asked if they would be interested in manufacturing the track. Clermont Steel Fabricators accepted and currently manufactures all Bolliger and Mabillard roller coaster track pieces for all of North America. Now with a company to manufacture the track, B&M built its first roller coaster, a stand-up roller coaster, \"Iron Wolf\", which opened in 1990 at Six Flags Great America. Two years later, Bolliger & Mabillard built another project for Six Flags Great America, \"\", the world's first inverted roller coaster, which brought them to prominence in the industry.\n\nBolliger & Mabillard also invented the Floorless Coaster, and the Dive Coaster. The company also built its first launched roller coaster, the \"Incredible Hulk\", which is at Islands of Adventure. Although The Incredible Hulk uses a launch system, B&M classifies it as a \"Sitting Coaster\". In 2010, B&M unveiled its new Wing Coaster and premiered the prototype model, named \"Raptor\", at Gardaland in 2011. It has two seats on each side on the car that hang riders over the sides of the track. There are currently only eight in operation. In 2015, B&M constructed \"Thunderbird\" at Holiday World & Splashin' Safari, its first in-house launched coaster.\n\nBy 2010, B&M employed twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen. The company has made other contributions to the roller coaster industry. The company built the trains for the \"Psyclone\", a now-demolished wooden roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The trains were later used on the park's \"Colossus\" wooden roller coaster (until it was refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction), but were only used during October each year. The trains faced backward and usually raced against trains on the second track, which ran forward. In 2013, B&M supplied new trains for Steel Dragon 2000, built by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 2000. As of 2012, Bolliger & Mabillard has 85 operating roller coasters worldwide, twenty-two of which are listed among the \"Amusement Today\" Golden Ticket Awards Top 50 Steel Coasters List for 2012, and five are in the top 10. The company has built more roller coasters than any other manufacturer on the list.\n\nBolliger & Mabillard currently manufactures nine different roller coaster styles: Stand-Up Coaster, Inverted Coaster, Floorless Coaster, Flying Coaster, Hyper Coaster, Dive Coaster, Sitting Coaster, Wing Coaster and Family Coaster. Bolliger & Mabillard has been involved in developing new technologies and concepts in roller coasters almost since its inception. It has often worked with engineer Werner Stengel, and with designers and management of client theme parks.\n\nMany Bolliger & Mabillard coasters feature an element known as a \"pre-drop\", a short drop after the top of the lift hill and before the start of the first drop, designed to reduce stress on the lift chain. The flat section between the pre-drop and the first drop serves as a shelf to support the weight of the train, reducing related stresses on the chain. On most coasters without a pre-drop, the weight of the train tends to pull on the lift chain as it begins its descent because the latter half of the train is still being lifted by the chain. Pre-drops have not been used on the company's Dive or Flying coasters, or on hyper coasters built after 1999. \"OzIris\" at Parc Astérix was the first B&M inverted roller coaster that does not feature a pre-drop. Ever since no coaster built by B&M has featured a pre-drop because the chain accelerates on newer coasters of B&M after the train passes the crest to acquire the same speed as the train when it is being taken over by gravity.\n\nMost of Bolliger & Mabillard's roller coaster trains use four-abreast seating. Each car has one row of four seats, while the train length can vary between coasters. All of the company's coaster models, except the Dive Coaster and Wing Coaster use this configuration. The Dive Coaster uses six, eight or ten-abreast seating, with two or three rows of seats. For example, \"Griffon\" at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, uses ten seats in three rows, while \"Krake\" at Heide Park uses six-across seating in three rows. On recent hyper coaster projects, B&M has used a new car design that has two rows of two seats; the two seats in the rear of the car pushed out from the centerline so that the four seats resemble a V formation. This formation has only been used on \"Behemoth\" at Canada's Wonderland, \"Diamondback\" at Kings Island, \"Intimidator\" at Carowinds and \"\" at PortAventura Park, in the resort PortAventura World. In 2013, B&M introduced a new car design that has two rows of two seats, however, they are not in a V formation.\n\nAll B&M hyper coasters use a type of restraint called a \"T-bar\" or \"Clamshell\" restraint, which consists of bar with a cushioned lap bar with two handles for riders to hold on to. This type of restraint generally does not use a seat belt, however seat belts have been added to \"Behemoth\" and \"Leviathan\" at Canada's Wonderland, \"Diamondback\" at Kings Island, and \"Intimidator\" at Carowinds, all of which have the stadium style seating. Bolliger & Mabillard also uses over-the-shoulder restraints, in that the restraint is placed over the riders' shoulders and sits and extends to the riders' laps. This type of restraint is used on Dive, Inverted, Sitting, Flying, Floorless, Stand-up, and Wing Coasters.\n\nA notable feature of Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters is the box-section track. The running rails are connected to a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as \"Talon\" at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and GateKeeper at Cedar Point, the track is filled with a proprietary sound dampening material to reduce this noise.\n\nAlso, depending on the model of the roller coaster, the track size can vary. Models such as the Flying, Wing, and Dive Coaster have heavier trains which require a larger track size while models with lighter trains, such as the Stand-Up and Hyper Coaster, do not and use a smaller sized track.\n\nAs of 2016, Bolliger & Mabillard uses three types of braking system; friction, magnetic, and water.\n\nWhen B&M was first founded, the linear magnetic eddy brake had yet to be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.\n\nMagnetic brakes were first used on \"Nitro\" at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. Magnetic brakes slow down trains much faster than friction brakes; most B&M roller coasters built in or after 2001 have at least one set of magnetic brakes. Magnetic brakes do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the brakes, the magnetic field created by the brakes slows the train. Magnetic brakes have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B&M roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.\n\nWater brakes were first introduced on \"SheiKra\" at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in 2005. Water brakes can only be used when a splashdown element, in which a body of water surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several feet into the air behind it.\n\nAs of 2018, Bolliger & Mabillard has built 115 roller coasters around the world. The Incredible Hulk and Dragon Challenge, both at |Universal Studios Islands of Adventure, were closed in 2015 and 2017 respectively. Hulk was scrapped so it could be rebuilt completely in 2016 and Dragon Challenge has been demolished so it can be replaced by an unknown coaster in 2019. Lightning at Kuwait Entertainment City is currently Standing But Not Operating due to its park being closed for a refurbishment. Some have been relocated and renamed.\n\n"}

In 1980, an attack on the Iranian city of Abadan marked the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. Hundreds of thousands of people fled the badly damaged city but a small number of civilians chose to stay, living in a city under siege. The story focuses on the experiences of Moosa, a young Abadani soldier defending his hometown. He has been chosen to assist in destroying the enemy’s \"Doomsday Machine\", a sophisticated radar system.\n\nThe book was written in 1996 and published in Persian by Soreie Mehr Publication Company in 2005. \"Chess with the Doomsday Machine\" has been nominated for and received numerous awards, and has been reprinted many times in Iran. According to critics, \"Chess with the Doomsday Machine\" is one of the most prominent novel about the Iran-Iraq war in recent years. In 2008, the book was translated from Persian into English by Paul Sprachman, a professor at Rutgers university, and published by Mazda Publishers.\n\nThe \"Doomsday Machine\" of the title is the nickname given to a British Cymbeline counter-battery radar system used to direct Iraqi counter-battery fire against Iranian artilley. Moosa the protagonist of the novel becomes an artillery spotter in the artillery duel between the two sides, using an unfinished multi-storey building as his observation post. A native Abadani, Moosa is also assigned to guard the few remaining civilians who choose to remain in the city during the Siege of Abadan.\n\nIn 2012 the Onelight Theatre decided to stage an adaptation of the Iranian novel. Onelight Theatre is a professional theatre company that has been developing and producing works in Halifax, Nova Scotia since 2002, located at Alderney Landing, Onelight is the resident theatre company at the complex. After returning home from representing Canada at the Fadjr International Theatre Festival in Tehran, the show made its Canadian premiere on February 6, 2014. The production returned to Canada after first touring ran, with a debut in Abadan, the birthplace of the story and that of Onelight Theatre's Artistic Director, Shahin Sayadi. \"Taking this work to stage in the place it all started, my hometown, has truly been an honour,\" said Sayadi, \"I'm looking forward to bringing it home to Canada next month.\" Written and directed by Shahin Sayadi, \"Chess With The Doomsday Machine\" used a combination of English, Persian and nonverbal communication to tell the story of the challenges a young soldier must face.\n\nThe production was revived at Alderney Landing, for a run between January 19 to February 7, 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45155095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45155095", "title": "Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar", "text": "Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar\n\nThe Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar or Cincinnati Music Center half dollar is a commemorative 50-cent piece struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1936. Produced with the stated purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio as a center of music, it was conceived by Thomas G. Melish, a coin enthusiast who controlled the group which was allowed to buy the entire issue from the government, and who resold the pieces at high prices.\n\nCongress approved legislation for the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces to be struck at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor Constance Ortmayer to design the coin, but the Commission of Fine Arts refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of Stephen Foster on the obverse, finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.\n\nMelish likely held back much of the issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped somewhat when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.\n\nSparked by low-mintage issues which appreciated in value, the market for United States commemorative coins spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the coin collecting hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 Old Spanish Trail half dollar. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had served as president of the American Numismatic Association (ANA). Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar, first struck in 1926.\nThomas G. Melish, a coin collector and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit. Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company. He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the Philadelphia Mint, 2,000 coins from Denver, and 3,000 from the San Francisco Mint. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was \"in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual May festival to the art of music for the past 50 years.\" Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck \"at the mints\", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing—later issues were limited to a single mint.\n\nThe bill passed Congress, and was signed by President Franklin Roosevelt on March 31, 1936. The pieces were to honor \"the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution to the art of music for the past 50 years\". Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their volume on commemorative coins, concluded that \"pressure from the above-named Association on Congress induced passage of the Act\".\n\nMelish engaged Constance Ortmayer to design the coin. Ortmayer later remembered, \"I was recommended by them, someone came through Cincinnati ... they were just looking for somebody so they recommended me\". Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly on April 4, 1936, that the original \"lacked distinction and artistic merit\" and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, withholding approval.\nMoore recited the stated purpose of the coin, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, then noted that the obverse depicted Stephen Foster, the composer and songwriter—who died in 1864, whereas Cincinnati was not notable as a center of music until at least 1873. \"The Commission is at a loss to connect a fiftieth anniversary in 1936 with a movement that began in 1873.\" Foster did live in Cincinnati, Moore admitted, but only for a brief period while working as a bookkeeper, and his main contributions to American music came later, when he lived in Pittsburgh and in New York City. Further, the coin was to commemorate Cincinnati's contributions to the art of music, and Foster \"was an American troubadour, but to music as an art he made no contribution\". Moore felt that if anyone should be depicted, it should be Theodore Thomas, who conducted the Cincinnati May Festival from its beginning in 1873 and in 1878 became director of the Cincinnati College of Music. He stated that \"Theodore Thomas was, artistically, the founder of Cincinnati as a musical center. His portrait should appear on any coin commemorative of Cincinnati 'as a center of music'\".\n\nOn May 16, \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" reported that Thomas would appear on the coin, not Foster. The paper also reported the controversy before the Commission of Fine Arts, that Melish had travelled to Washington the previous day, and had announced he had no objection to the change. Also on May 16, Melish telephoned Lee Lawrie, sculptor member of the Commission. Melish's notes indicate that Moore's objection was on behalf of Alice Roosevelt Longworth and the Longworth family, who had employed Thomas to lead the May Festival, and who wanted Thomas on the coin, although, as (per Melish) Lawrie put it, \"Thomas looks like a walrus and would be a very hard head to make\". Melish was defiant, stating that he also knew Alice Longworth well, and Foster remained on the coin. Ortmayer remembered that the \"boss\" of the Bureau of the Mint (presumably Ross) objected to the reverse design, not liking the position of the goddess' legs. Swiatek, in his later volume, averred that Melish's association put pressure on the Department of the Treasury to approve Ortmayer's design.\n\nThe Philadelphia Mint received the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, stating that the sculptor's models were in too high relief, and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece were expected to be tested by coining trial strikes in early July.\n\nThe obverse of the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar displays a bust of Stephen Foster, facing to the viewer's right, and below it, the words \"\". This phrase was taken from a biography of Foster published earlier in the 1930s. The artist's initials, \"CO\", are to the left of Foster. The name of the country, and the denomination, appear near the rim. The reverse shows a kneeling figure, intended to be the goddess of music. In the upper left portion of the field, or background, is the date 1886, in the lower right 1936, and beneath the latter the mint mark (unless struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use one). The goddess kneels on the mottos required by law to appear, and near the edge is \"\".\n\nThe design attracted comments from those interested in coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal \"The Numismatist\", noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but \"when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms ... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us ...the toy four-string lyre [the goddess] holds in her hand is not in keeping with the times or the occasion ... After all these years, Music deserved something better.\" Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, \"apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy\".\n\nArt historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his 1971 volume on American coins and medals, \"Numismatic Art in America\", criticized Ortmayer's design:\n\nThe mintage of 15,000 was struck in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 at San Francisco, with the excess from the even thousands held for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.\nMelish had been fielding inquiries from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was the peak of the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.\n\nBy December, the bottom had dropped out of the commemorative coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set, and by 1975 $550 per set of three. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set. R.S. Yeoman's \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\", published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at about a third of the set prices.\nThe circumstances of the issuance were not clear at first: Mehl wrote that the coin was to honor the 50th anniversary of the \"Cincinnati Musical Center\" which was \"founded in 1886\" and that \"either through good distribution or a great demand, the sets did not go around to all those who wanted them\". Later numismatic writers have been harsh to Melish; Swiatek deemed the coin issued because of \"false claims\" on its behalf. Kevin Flynn, in his volume on commemoratives, stated that the Cincinnati piece \"was made for pure profit and greed\". Swiatek and Breen, in their 1988 book, suggest that Melish's group \"had only one idea in mind: enriching themselves by publicizing and distributing a limited issue which could be priced into orbit by speculators\".\n\nWith the success of the issue, Melish tried to get Congress to authorize 1937-dated pieces; he was not successful. He had managed to get Congress to allow another commemorative under his control, the 1936 Cleveland Centennial half dollar. In 1942, when the ANA held its annual convention in Cincinnati, Melish hosted a hospitality suite. Dubbed the \"Pirate's Den\", it featured paintings he had commissioned, depicting coin dealers and other numismatic personalities in piratical clothes. According to Bowers, \"Overlooked was the fact that the greatest pirate of all was surely Melish himself, who undoubtedly treated many of his guests with money taken from them a few years earlier in the sale of Cincinnati sets!\"\n\n"}

{"id": "33786608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33786608", "title": "Defensor pacis", "text": "Defensor pacis\n\nThe tract Defensor pacis (The Defender of Peace) laid the foundations of modern doctrines of sovereignty. It was written by Marsilius of Padua (Italian: Marsilio da Padova), an Italian medieval scholar. It appeared in 1324 and provoked a storm of controversy that lasted through the century. The context of the work lies in the political struggle between Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor and Pope John XXII. The treatise is vehemently anticlerical. Marsilius' work was censured by Pope Benedict XII and Pope Clement VI.\n\n\"Defensor pacis\" extends the tradition of Dante's \"De Monarchia\" separating the secular State from religious authority. It affirmed the sovereignty of the people and civil law and sought to greatly limit the power of the Papacy, which he viewed as the \"cause of the trouble which prevails among men\" and which he characterized as a \"fictitious\" power. He proposed the seizure of church property by civil authority and the elimination of tithes. In his view, the Papacy would retain only an honorary pre-eminence without any authority to interpret the scriptures or define dogma.\n\nAs its name implies, it describes the State as the defender of the public peace, which is the most indispensable benefit of human society. The author of the law expresses will of the people, not of the whole populace, but of the most important part (\"valentior\") of the citizens; these people should themselves elect, or at least appoint, the head of the government, who, lest he should be tempted to put himself above the scope of the laws, should have at his disposal only a limited armed force. This chief is responsible to the people for his breaches of the law, and in serious cases they can sentence him to death. The real cause of the trouble which prevails among men is the Papacy, the development of which is the result of a series of usurpations.\n\nMarsilius denies, not only to the pope, but to the bishops and clergy, any coercive jurisdiction or any right to pronounce in temporal matters. He also denies episcopal authority of excommunications and interdicts, or other imposed interpretations of divine law. He is not opposed to penalties against heretics, but he would have them pronounced only by civil tribunals. Desiring to see the clergy practice a holy poverty, he proposes the suppression of tithes and the seizure by the secular power of the greater part of the property of the church. The clergy, thus deprived of its wealth, privileges and jurisdiction, is further to be deprived of independence, for the civil power is to have the right of appointing to benefices, etc. The supreme authority in the church is to be the council, but a council summoned by the emperor.\n\nThe pope, no longer possessing any more power than other bishops (though Marsilius recognizes that the supremacy of the See of Rome goes back to the earliest times of Christianity), is to content himself with a pre-eminence mainly of an honorary kind, without claiming to interpret the Holy Scriptures, define dogmas or distribute benefices; moreover, he is to be elected by the Christian people, or by the delegates of the people, i.e. the princes, or by the council, and these are also to have the power to punish, suspend or depose him. The theory was purely democratic, but was all ready to be transformed, by means of a series of fictions and implications, into an imperialist doctrine; and in like manner it contained a visionary plan of reformation which ended, not in the separation of the church from the state, but in the subjection of the church to the state.\n\nIn 1535, Thomas Cromwell paid William Marshall to translate \"Defensor\" into English in order to give intellectual support towards the implementation of Royal Supremacy.\n\n\n"}

It is about the treacherous nature of ego.\n\nHaving previously written about external obstacles in his book \"The Obstacle Is the Way\", Holiday sought to answer questions about what to do when the biggest obstacle is internal. In the prologue of the book, Holiday explains how finding early successes led him to the realization that ego can cloud ambition and hinder personal and professional growth, particularly when accomplishments are tied to self-worth.\n\nHoliday had the title of his book tattooed on his forearm as a daily reminder of its message.\n\n\"Ego Is the Enemy\" puts forth the argument that often our biggest problems are not caused by external factors such as other people or circumstances. Instead, our problems stem from our own attitude, selfishness and self-absorption. In other words, introducing ego into a situation often prevents us from being rational, objective and clear headed.\n\nThe book does not discuss Freud's ego or egotism as a clinical term but rather ego in a colloquial sense, defined as \"an unhealthy belief in your own importance.\" The book also discusses the difference between ego and confidence, and argues that the solution to the problem of ego is humility, self-awareness, purpose and realism.\n\n\"Ego Is the Enemy\" provides both cautionary tales as well as positive anecdotes about ego, citing numerous historical and contemporary figures including Christopher McCandless, George Marshall, John DeLorean, Larry Page, Paul Graham, Steve Jobs and William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\n\"Ego Is the Enemy\" has received generally positive reviews, with \"Outside Magazine\" commenting, \"Holiday takes philosophy out of the ivory towers and translates often-dense concepts into actionable insights.\" The book was featured in the \"NPR\" Book Concierge Guide To 2016’s Great Reads.\n\nIn the weeks after its release, the book was listed by \"Inc.\" as one of the must-read business books that summer. The book went on to achieve bestseller status lists by \"USA Today\", \"Chicago Tribune\", and \"Publishers Weekly\". \n\n"}

It depicts a moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near the Needles, off the Isle of Wight. It juxtaposes the fragility of human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the sublime power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background. The cold light of the Moon at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern. Years later, Turner made a similar sketch, \"Moonlight at Sea (The Needles)\", c.1818, as an example of marine art for his \"Liber Studiorum\".\n\nThe work shows strong influence from the work of marine artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, and the intimate nocturnal scenes of Joseph Wright of Derby. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes. Art historian Andrew Wilton has commented that the image: \"Is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century.\" \n\nAccording to Walter Thornbury, the work was sold to General Stewart for £10. The painting was acquired by Sir Henry Charles Englefield; after his death in 1822, it was sold at Christie's on 8 March 1823, as \"View of the Needles, with the effect of Moon and Fire Light\". It was bought by Englefield's nephew Francis Cholmeley, and it remained in the Cholmeley family for nearly 150 years, displayed at Brandsby Hall, and it became known as the \"Cholmeley Sea Piece\". It was loaned regularly to the Tate Gallery from 1931, and sold to the Tate Gallery in 1972 by Francis William Alfred Fairfax-Cholmeley, with finance from the Beatrice Lizzie Benson Fund.\n\n"}

A form factor may represent a broad class of similarly sized components, or it may prescribe a specific standard.\n\nAs electronic hardware has become smaller following Moore's law and related patterns, ever-smaller form factors have become feasible. Specific technological advances, such as PCI Express, have had a significant design impact, though form factors have historically been slower to evolve than individual components. Standardization of form factors is vital for compatibility of hardware from different manufacturers.\n\nSmaller form factors may offer more efficient use of limited space, greater flexibility in the placement of components within a larger assembly, reduced use of material, and greater ease of transportation and use. However, smaller form factors typically incur greater costs in the design, manufacturing, and maintenance phases of the engineering lifecycle, and do not allow the same expansion options as larger form factors. In particular, the design of smaller form factor computers and network equipment must entail careful consideration of cooling. End-user maintenance and repair of small form factor electronic devices such as mobile phones is often not possible, and may be discouraged by warranty voiding clauses; such devices require professional servicing—or simply replacement—when they fail.\n\nComputer form factors comprise a number of specific industry standards for motherboards, specifying dimensions, power supplies, placement of mounting holes and ports, and other parameters.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, it is now the performing arts center of Mercer University.\n\nThe Academy of Music was constructed in 1884 with the largest stage in the southeastern United States and seating for 2,418, almost one-fifth of Macon's population at the time. The building was renovated in 1905; the present seven-story facade was added and the building reopened as the Grand Opera House.\n\nThe Grand has had numerous historic uses; live horses and chariots appeared in a 1908 production of \"Ben-Hur\" and during World War I, actor Charlie Chaplin led the John Philip Sousa band for a fundraising effort. The theater has also hosted, among others, Sarah Bernhardt, Will Rogers, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Lionel Barrymore, Ethel Barrymore, Bob Hope, the Allman Brothers Band, and Ray Charles.\n\nMagician Harry Houdini was also a featured player at the Grand, leaving a well-known legacy: the stage sports a number of trap doors, one of which remains operational and is used occasionally today in performances such as annual production of \"The Nutcracker\" ballet. Local lore claims that the trap doors were installed specifically for Houdini.\n\nIn 1936, as the popularity of vaudeville waned, the Grand changed to a movie theater, hosting Macon's only Hollywood premiere, 1945's \"God is My Co-Pilot\".\n\nBy the 1960s, the Grand had ceased showing movies and plans were made to replace it with a parking lot. Those plans were blocked in 1967 by the Macon Arts Council, a group formed to save and restore the Grand; the group held a fundraising gala featuring the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and had the property placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Among the founders of the group was Macon architect Ellamae Ellis League who also supervised a restoration of The Grand so it could reopen as a live theater in 1969. (The second balcony, or peanut gallery, remained closed to the public and was dedicated to lighting equipment at this time, reducing the maximum seating to its current number of 1,030). Fund-raising efforts continued through the next several decades, with ongoing physical plant upgrades, with another renovation taking place in 1985.\n\nIn 1995, Mercer University signed a lease with Bibb County to manage the Grand. Subsequently, Mercer has invested in upgrading the facility to modern standards as well as making it a fixture for community events. Today, the Grand hosts many Broadway touring companies, concerts (such as those of the Macon Symphony Orchestra, community theatre productions (including the aforementioned \"Nutcracker\" holiday show), and other performances and events.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1912 by artists affiliated with the \"Cos Cob School,\" and many associated with the development of the American Impressionist movement, who sought “the promotion and maintenance of the fine arts and the exhibition of works of art in Greenwich.”\n\nAs wealthy New Yorkers looked to move out of the city at the end of the 19th century, Greenwich evolved from a rural village to a bustling suburb with an established artists’ colony and a growing market for art. Theodore Robinson and John Henry Twachtman taught summer art classes at the Bush-Holley House, and Twachtman and Leonard Ochtman were living in Greenwich full-time. \n\nThe first president of the Greenwich Society of Artists was Edward Clark Potter, best known as the sculptor of the lions at the New York Public Library; Leonard Ochtman served as the first vice-president. Other notable early Society members include John Plumer Ludlum, Elmer Livingston MacRae, William Bunker Tubby, Joseph Howland Hunt, Sr., Dorothy Ochtman, Mina Fonda Ochtman, Matilda Browne, Charles Henry Ebert, Florence W. Gotthold, George Wharton Edwards, Henry Bill Selden, J. Alden Twachtman (son of John Henry Twachtman) and other artists and patrons affiliated with the Cos Cob Art Colony. A number of these artists were active in other influential organizations at that time, including the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, the group responsible for the 1913 Armory Show. Dorothy Ochtman served as Secretary of the Society from 1928-1946, and President from 1947-1948.\n\nThe Society held its first show in September 1912 in a house donated to the town by Robert M. Bruce, which would become the Bruce Museum. Until 1926, the Society continued to organize all of the Bruce Museum’s exhibitions, and the core of the museum's permanent collection grew through purchases and gifts from these exhibitions. In 1928, the Annual Members' Exhibition of the society was moved to the art gallery of the Greenwich Library.\n\nIn 1956, the Society expanded its mission: “to further art education and to awaken and stimulate interest in arts and crafts in the Town of Greenwich by means of classes, demonstrations, lectures and exhibitions.” The name was changed the Greenwich Art Society in 1958 when it was incorporated as a non-profit organization and began providing art instruction year-round.\n\nThe Greenwich Art Society continues today as an active organization that continues to provide art classes and programs for adults and children, exhibitions for its members, workshops, and gallery trips. \n\n"}

In 1857 he joined the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris where he became a student of Alexandre Abel de Pujol.\n\nIn 1861 Guillaumet entered the Historical Landscape category of the Prix de Rome for a scholarship to study at the Academy of France in Rome. On failing to win, he instead travelled across the Mediterranean to Algeria, in north Africa. While there he contracted malaria and had to spend three months at the military hospital in Biskra.\n\nGuillaumet visited Algeria ten times between 1861 and 1867. He preferred to travel in the south and many of his works depict the life of the people of the desert.\n\nWhereas Orientalism generally gave a deliberately idealised or anecdotal picture of north Africa, Guillaumet's work was notable for portraying the harshness of life in a desert region. \"The Sahara\" features the carcass of a camel in the foreground with a caravan - or mirage of one - on the horizon and empty desert in-between. It was first exhibited to considerable success at the Salon of 1868.\n\nBetween 1879 and 1884 \"La Nouvelle Revue\" published tableaux of Algerian scenes collected together by Guillaumet. These were later published as a book, \"Tableaux Algériens\". It includes twelve echings by Guillaumet, Courtry, Paul Edmé Le Rat, Adolphe-Alphonse Géry-Bichard, August Müller and Toussaint; six photogravures by Dujardin and one hundred and twenty-eight engravings in relief from drawings and sketches by Guillaumet, himself. The book was published in 1888, after Guillaumet's death and is prefaced by a note on his life by Eugène Mouton.\n\nIn 1878, Guillaumet was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour, the highest decoration in France.\n\nHis son Gustave Guillaume (whose family name was changed), born in 1883, became a famous linguist.\n\nGuillaumet died in Paris in 1887. Speculation about the circumstances of his death, supposedly of peritonitis, was published in \"The New York Times\" on April 6. The article claimed that Guillaumet had left his wife and son to live with \"a lady who was his senior by many years\" but that a few weeks before his death he had shot himself following an argument with his mistress. \n\nGuilaumet is buried in Montmartre Cemetery.

Its theatre is located near the square of Gänsemarkt. Since 2015, the current \"Intendant\" of the company is Georges Delnon, and the current \"Generalmusikdirektor\" of the company is Kent Nagano.\n\nOpera in Hamburg dates to 2 January 1678 when the Oper am Gänsemarkt was inaugurated with a performance of a biblical Singspiel by Johann Theile. It was not a court theatre but the first public opera house in Germany established by the art-loving citizens of Hamburg, a prosperous member of the Hanseatic League.\n\nThe Hamburg \"Bürgeroper\" resisted the dominance of the Italianate style and rapidly became the leading musical center of the German Baroque. In 1703, George Friedrich Handel was engaged as violinist and harpsichordist and performances of his operas were not long in appearing. In 1705, Hamburg gave the world première of his opera \"Nero\".\n\nIn 1721, Georg Philipp Telemann, a central figure of the German Baroque, joined the Hamburg Opera, and in subsequent years Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Adolph Hasse and various Italian companies were among the guests.\n\nTo replace the aging wooden structure, the first stone was laid on 18 May 1826 for the \"Stadt-Theater\" on the present-day site of the Hamburg State Opera. The new theater, with seating for 2,800 guest, was inaugurated less than a year later with Beethoven's incidental music to \"Egmont\".\n\nIn 1873, both the exterior and interior of the structure were renovated in the reigning \"Gründerzeit\" style of the time, and again in 1891, when electric lighting was introduced.\n\nUnder the direction of Bernhard Pollini, the house mounted its first complete \"Ring Cycle\" in 1879. In 1883, the year of Wagner's death, a cycle comprising nine of his operas commenced. The musical directors Hans von Bülow (from 1887 to 1890) and Gustav Mahler (from 1891 to 1897) also contributed to the fame of the opera house.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, opera was an important part of the theatre's repertoire; among the 321 performances during the 1907–08 season, 282 were performances of opera. The Stadt-Theater performed not only established repertoire but also new works, such as Paul Hindemith's \"Sancta Susanna\", Igor Stravinsky's \"The Soldier's Tale\", Ernst Krenek's \"Jonny spielt auf\", and Leoš Janáček's \"Jenůfa\". Ferruccio Busoni's \"Die Brautwahl\" (1912) and Erich Wolfgang Korngold's \"Die tote Stadt\" (1920) both had their world premieres in Hamburg. In the 1930s, after Hitler came to power, the opera house was renamed \"Hamburgische Staatsoper\".\n\nOn the night of 2 August 1943, both the auditorium and its neighbouring buildings were destroyed during air raids by fire-bombing; a low-flying airplane dropped several petrol and phosphorus containers on to the middle of the roof of the auditorium, turning it into a conflagration.\nThe current Staatsoper opened on 15 October 1955 with Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\". Hamburg continued to devote itself to new works, such as Hans Werner Henze's \"The Prince of Homburg\" (1960), Stravinsky's \"The Flood\" (1963), Gian Carlo Menotti's \"Help, Help, the Globolinks!\" (1968), and Mauricio Kagel's \"Staatstheater\" (1971).\n\nIn 1967, under the direction of Joachim Hess, the Hamburg State Opera became the first company to broadcasts its operas in color on television, beginning with \"Die Hochzeit des Figaro\" (a German translation of \"Le Nozze di Figaro\"). Ten of these television productions have been released on DVD by ArtHaus Musik as \"Cult Opera of the 1970s\", as well as separately. All of these were performed in German regardless of the original language (six were written in German, one in French, two in English, and one in Italian).\n\nMore recently, Hamburg gave the world premières of Wolfgang Rihm's \"Die Eroberung von Mexico\" (1992) and Helmut Lachenmann's \"Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern\" (1997), for which it received much international acclaim. The company has won the \"Opera House of the Year\" award by the German magazine Opernwelt in 1997 and in 2005.\n\nRecent General Music Directors (GMD) have included Ingo Metzmacher and Simone Young. Young was the first female GMD in the company's history, serving from 2005 to 2015. Kent Nagano became GMD as of the 2015-2016 season, with an initial contract of 5 seasons. In October 2017, the company announced the extension of Nagano's Hamburg contract through 2025.\n\n\n\n"}

The present building was designed by Charles J. Phipps and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who established the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the theatre. In the early decades of the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of Shakespeare and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw, J. M. Synge, Noël Coward and J. B. Priestley. Since the First World War, the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has specialised in hosting musicals. The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation \"Chu Chin Chow\" and the current production, Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"The Phantom of the Opera\", which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.\n\nThe theatre was established by architect and playwright John Vanbrugh, in 1705, as the Queen's Theatre. Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London patent theatres, and so this theatre quickly became an opera house. Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 operas by George Frideric Handel premiered here. In the early 19th century, the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, in 1847, and presented the first London performances of Mozart's \"La clemenza di Tito\", \"Così fan tutte\" and \"Don Giovanni\". It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to hosting the London premieres of such operas as Bizet's \"Carmen\" and Wagner's \"Ring Cycle\".\n\nThe name of the theatre changes with the sex of the monarch. It first became the King's Theatre in 1714 on the accession of George I. It was renamed Her Majesty's Theatre in 1837. Most recently, the theatre was known as His Majesty's Theatre from 1901 to 1952, and it became Her Majesty's on the accession of Elizabeth II. The theatre's capacity is 1,216 seats, and the building was Grade II* listed by English Heritage in 1970. LW Theatres has owned the building since 2000. The land beneath it is on a long-term lease from the Crown Estate.\n\nThe end of the 17th century was a period of intense rivalry amongst London's actors, and in 1695 there was a split in the United Company, who had a monopoly on the performance of drama at their two theatres. Dramatist and architect John Vanbrugh saw this as an opportunity to break the duopoly of the patent theatres, and in 1703 he acquired a former stable yard, at a cost of £2,000, for the construction of a new theatre on the Haymarket. In the new business, he hoped to improve the share of profits that would go to playwrights and actors. He raised the money by subscription, probably amongst members of the Kit-Cat Club:\n\nTo recover them [that is, Thomas Betterton's company], therefore, to their due Estimation, a new Project was form'd of building them a stately theatre in the Hay-Market, by Sir John Vanbrugh, for which he raised a Subscription of thirty Persons of Quality, at one hundred Pounds each, in Consideration whereof every Subscriber, for his own Life, was to be admitted to whatever Entertainments should be publickly perform'd there, without farther Payment for his Entrance.\n\n—John Vanbrugh's notice of subscription for the new theatre\nHe was joined in the enterprise by his principal associate and manager William Congreve and an actors' co-operative led by Thomas Betterton.\n\nThe theatre provided the first alternative to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, built in 1663 and the Lincoln's Inn, founded in 1660 (forerunner of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, built in 1728). The theatre's site is the second oldest such site in London that remains in use. These three post-interregnum theatres defined the shape and use of modern theatres.\n\nThe land for the theatre was held on a lease renewable in 1740 and was ultimately owned, as it is today, by the Crown Estate. Building was delayed by the necessity of acquiring the street frontage, and a three bay entrance led to a brick shell long and wide. Colley Cibber described the audience fittings as lavish but the facilities for playing poor.\n\nVanbrugh and Congreve received Queen Anne's authority to form \"a Company of Comedians\" on 14 December 1704, and the theatre opened as the Queen's Theatre on 9 April 1705 with imported Italian singers in \"Gli amori d'Ergasto\" (\"The Loves of Ergasto\"), an opera by Jakob Greber, with an epilogue by Congreve. This was the first Italian opera performed in London. The opera failed, and the season struggled on through May, with revivals of plays and operas. The first new play performed was \"The Conquest of Spain\" by Mary Pix. The theatre proved too large for actors' voices to carry across the auditorium, and the first season was a failure. Congreve departed, Vanbrugh bought out his other partners, and the actors reopened the Lincoln's Inn Fields' theatre in the summer. Although early productions combined spoken dialogue with incidental music, a taste was growing amongst the nobility for Italian opera, which was completely sung, and the theatre became devoted to opera. As he became progressively more involved in the construction of Blenheim Palace, Vanbrugh's management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic, showing \"numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgement\". On 7 May 1707, experiencing mounting losses and running costs, Vanbrugh was forced to sell a lease on the theatre for fourteen years to Owen Swiny at a considerable loss. In December of that year, the Lord Chamberlain's Office ordered that \"all Operas and other Musicall presentments be performed for the future only at Her Majesty's Theatre in the Hay Market\" and forbade the performance of further non-musical plays there.\nAfter 1709, the theatre was devoted to Italian opera and was sometimes known informally as the Haymarket Opera House. Young George Frideric Handel produced his English début, \"Rinaldo\", on 24 February 1711 at the theatre, featuring the two leading castrati of the era, Nicolo Grimaldi and Valentino Urbani. This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage. The work was well received, and Handel was appointed resident composer for the theatre, but losses continued, and Swiney fled abroad to escape his creditors. John James Heidegger took over the management of the theatre and, from 1719, began to extend the stage through arches into the houses to the south of the theatre. A \"Royal Academy of Music\" was formed by subscription from wealthy sponsors, including the Prince of Wales, to support Handel's productions at the theatre. Under this sponsorship, Handel conducted a series of more than 25 of his original operas, continuing until 1739 Handel was also a partner in the management with Heidegger from 1729 to 1734, and he contributed to incidental music for theatre, including for a revival of Ben Jonson's \"The Alchemist\", opening on 14 January 1710.\n\nOn the accession of George I in 1714, the theatre was renamed the King's Theatre and remained so named during a succession of male monarchs who occupied the throne. At this time only the two patent theatres were permitted to perform serious drama in London, and lacking letters patent, the theatre remained associated with opera. In 1762, Johann Christian Bach travelled to London to premiere three operas at the theatre, including \"Orione\" on 19 February 1763. This established his reputation in England, and he became music master to Queen Charlotte.\nIn 1778, the lease for the theatre was transferred from James Brook to Thomas Harris, stage manager of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and to the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan for £22,000. They paid for the remodelling of the interior by Robert Adam in the same year. In November 1778, \"The Morning Chronicle\" reported that Harris and Sheridan had\n\n... at a considerable expence, almost entirely new built the audience part of the house, and made a great variety of alterations, part of which are calculated for the rendering the theatre more light, elegant and pleasant, and part for the ease and convenience of the company. The sides of the frontispiece are decorated with two figures painted by Gainsborough, which are remarkably picturesque and beautiful; the heavy columns which gave the house so gloomy an aspect that it rather resembled a large mausoleum or a place for funeral dirges, than a theatre, are removed.\n\n—November 1778, \"The Morning Chronicle\"\nThe expense of the improvements was not matched by the box office receipts, and the partnership dissolved, with Sheridan buying out his partner with a mortgage on the theatre of £12,000 obtained from the banker Henry Hoare.\n\nOne member of the company, Giovanni Gallini, had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the position of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. Gallini had tried to buy Harris' share but had been rebuffed. He now purchased the mortgage. Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer. The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre and Taylor bought Sheridan's interest in 1781. In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by Michael Novosielski, formerly a scene painter at the theatre. In May 1783, Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a forced sale ensued, with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, in the interests of the creditors. Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager. In 1788, the Lord Chancellor observed \"that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... [the interested parties] seemed to apply for relief\". Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated. Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. \"The World\" described a performance as follows: \"... the dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly.\" At other times, Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.\n\nThe theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and the dancers fled the building as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon. This too, would burn to the ground in 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.\n\nBy 1720, Vanbrugh's direct connection with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and that of his wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in Greenwich. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.\n\nTaylor completed a new theatre on the site in 1791. Michael Novosielski had again been chosen as architect for the theatre on an enlarged site, but the building was described by Malcolm in 1807 as\n\nfronted by a stone basement in rustic work, with the commencement of a very superb building of the Doric order, consisting of three pillars, two windows, an entablature, pediment, and balustrade. This, if it had been continued, would have contributed considerably to the splendour of London; but the unlucky fragment is fated to stand as a foil to the vile and absurd edifice of brick pieced to it, which I have not patience to describe.\n\n—The critic Malcolm, quoted in \"Old and New London\" (1878)\nThe Lord Chamberlain, a supporter of O'Reilly, refused a performing licence to Taylor. The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with a private performance of song and dance entertainment, but was not allowed to open to the public. The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms of revision. As a later manager of the theatre wrote, \"In the history of property, there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread.\" Meetings were held at Carlton House and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties. On 24 August 1792 a General Opera Trust Deed was signed by the parties. The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen, appointed by the Prince of Wales, who would then appoint a general manager. Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King's Theatre and the Pantheon. The committee never met, and management devolved to Taylor.\n\nThe first public performance of opera in the new theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled. This theatre was, at that time, the largest in England, and it became the home of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791–94.\n\nFrom 1793, seven small houses at the east side of the theatre fronting on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this room that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000 florins.\nWith the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794, the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of Mozart's \"La clemenza di Tito\" in 1806, \"Così fan tutte\" and \"Die Zauberflöte\" in 1811, and \"Don Giovanni\" in 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, John Nash and George Repton made alterations to the façade and increased the capacity of the auditorium to 2,500. They also added a shopping arcade, called the Royal Opera Arcade, which has survived fires and renovations and still exists. It runs along the rear of the theatre. In 1818–20, the British premieres of Gioachino Rossini's operas \"Il barbiere di Siviglia, Elisabetta, regina d'Inghilterra, L'italiana in Algeri, La Cenerentola\" and \"Tancredi\" took place, and the theatre became known as the Italian Opera House, Haymarket by the 1820s.\n\nIn 1797, he was elected as member of Parliament for Leominster, a position that gave him immunity from his creditors. When that parliament dissolved in 1802, he fled to France. Later, he returned, and was member of Parliament for Barnstaple from 1806 to 1812 while continuing his association with the theatre. Taylor paid little of the agreed receipts to performers, or composers, and lived for much of his period of management in the King's Bench, a debtors' prison in Southwark. Here he maintained an apartment next to Lady Hamilton and lived in some luxury, entertaining lavishly. \n\nJohn Ebers, a bookseller, took over the management of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (\"La gazza ladra, Il turco in Italia, Mosè in Egitto, Otello, La donna del lago\", \"Matilde di Shabran\" and \"Ricciardo e Zoraide\") took place there in the following three years. Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two more of his operas, \"Zelmira\" and \"Semiramide\", received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.\n\nIn 1828, Ebers was succeeded as theatre manager by Pierre François Laporte, who held the position (with a brief gap in 1831–33) until his death in 1841. Two of Rossini's Paris operas (\"Le comte Ory\" and \"Le siège de Corinthe\") had their British premieres at the theatre during this period, and Laporte was also the first to introduce the operas of Vincenzo Bellini (\"La sonnambula, Norma\" and \"I puritani\") and Gaetano Donizetti (\"Anna Bolena, Lucia di Lammermoor\" and \"Lucrezia Borgia\") to the British public. Under Laporte, singers such as Giulia Grisi, Pauline Viardot, Giovanni Battista Rubini, Luigi Lablache and Mario made their London stage debuts at the theatre. Among the musical directors of this period was Nicolas Bochsa, the celebrated and eccentric French harpist. He was appointed in 1827 and remained for six years at this position. When Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837, the name of the theatre was changed to Her Majesty's Theatre, Italian Opera House. In the same year, Samuel Phelps made his London début as Shylock in \"The Merchant of Venice\" at the theatre, also playing in other Shakespearean plays here.\n\nOver the course of the 1840s, Dion Boucicault had five plays produced here: \"The Bastile\" [sic], an \"after-piece\" (1842), \"Old Heads and Young Hearts\" (1844), \"The School for Scheming\" (1847), \"Confidence\" (1848), and \"The Knight Arva\" (1848). In 1853, Robert Browning's \"Colombe's Birthday\" played at the theatre.\n\nIn 1841, disputes arose over Laporte's decision to replace the baritone Antonio Tamburini with a new singer, Colletti. The audience stormed the stage, and the performers formed a 'revolutionary conspiracy'.\n\nLaporte died suddenly, and Benjamin Lumley took over the management in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, \"Don Pasquale\" and \"La fille du régiment\". Initially, relations between Lumley and Michael Costa, the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good. Verdi's \"Ernani\", \"Nabucco\" and \"I Lombardi\" received their British premieres in 1845–46, and Lumley commissioned \"I masnadieri\" from the composer. This opera received its world premiere on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish operatic diva Jenny Lind in the role of Amalia, and the British premieres of two more Verdi operas, \"I due Foscari\" and \"Attila\", followed in 1847–48. Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its present title, Her Majesty's Theatre.\n\nLumley engaged Michael Balfe to conduct the orchestra and entered negotiations with Felix Mendelssohn for a new opera. Jenny Lind had made her English début on 4 May 1847 in the role of Alice in Giacomo Meyerbeer's \"Robert le Diable\", in the presence of the Royal family and the composer Felix Mendelssohn. Such was the press of people around the theatre that many \"arrived at last with dresses crushed and torn, and coats hanging in shreds, having suffered bruises and blows in the struggle\". She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre, interspersed with national tours, becoming known as the \"Swedish Nightingale\". The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow, and the theatre closed in 1852, re-opening in 1856, when a fire closed its rival. After the reopening, Lumley presented two more British premieres of Verdi operas: \"La traviata\" in 1856 and \"Luisa Miller\" in 1858.\nFrom the early 1830s until the late 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the romantic ballet, and the theatre's resident ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him \"Premier Maître de Ballet\" (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. Among the works of ballet that he staged were \"Ondine, ou La Naïade\" (1843), \"La Esmeralda\" (1844), and \"Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit\" (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement \"Pas de Quatre\" (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including \"Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant\" (1847) and \"Electra\" (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting). Arthur Saint-Léon staged such works as \"La Vivandière\" (1844), \"Le Violin du Diable\" (1849), and \"Le Jugement de Pâris\" (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to \"Pas de Quatre\".\n\nThe Italian composer Cesare Pugni was appointed \"Composer of the Ballet Music\" to the theatre in 1843, a position created for him by Lumley. From 1843 until 1850, he composed nearly every new ballet presented at the theatre. Pugni remains the most prolific composer of the genre, having composed more than 100 original ballets, as well as composing numerous divertissements and incidental dances that were often performed as diversions during the intermissions of opera performances at the theatre. Throughout the era of the romantic ballet, the theatre presented performances by notable ballerinas, including Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito, performing in the works of Perrot, Taglioni and Saint-Léon.\n\nFrom 1862 to 1867, the theatre was managed by James Henry Mapleson, presenting Italian, French and German opera, including the British premieres of \"La forza del destino\", \"Médée\", \"Faust\" and \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, De Murska, Thérèse Tietjens, Antonio Giuglini, Charles Santley and Christine Nilsson. On the night of 6 December 1867, the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity. The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage. With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nBy the 1850s, with the era of the romantic ballet at an end, the principal personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, Russia. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted until the end of the 19th century. Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as Adeline Genée began performing. The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the Old Vic and soon took on the name of the Vic-Wells Ballet. Later, moving primarily to the Sadler's Wells Theatre, the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the Royal Opera House and became the Royal Ballet, as it is known today.\n\nA third building was constructed in 1868 at a cost of £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.\n\nMapleson returned to Her Majesty's in 1877 and 1878, after a disastrous attempt to build a 2,000-seat National Opera House on a site subsequently used for the building of Scotland Yard. On the return of the company, all the fittings of the theatre had been removed, including the seats, carpets and even the wallpaper. £6,000 was spent on fitting out the theatre, and on 28 April 1877 the building returned to theatrical use with the opening of Vincenzo Bellini's opera \"Norma\". The London premiere of Bizet's \"Carmen\" occurred here on 22 June 1878, and in subsequent seasons the theatre hosted the Carl Rosa Opera Company (Rosa's wife, Euphrosyne Parepa, had made her name in opera partly at Her Majesty's) and a programme of French plays and light opera. The company was the first to produce \"Carmen\" in English, at the theatre in February 1879, starring Selina Dolaro in the title role and Durward Lely as Don José. In 1882, the theatre hosted the London premieres of Wagner's \"Ring cycle\".\n\nMapleson returned in 1887 and 1889, but \"The Times\" commented that the repertoire comprised \"works that had long ceased to attract a large public, the singers were exclusively of second-rate quality, and the standard of performance was extremely low\". \"Rigoletto\", on 25 May 1889, was the last operatic performance given in the house.\n\nWith the rapid advances in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still held by the Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (forerunners of the Crown Estate) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. Plans were commissioned from architect Charles J. Phipps for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with Herbert Beerbohm Tree for the erection of the theatre at a cost of £55,000. The plans were approved in February 1897, and on 16 July 1896, the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid. Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.\n\nThe theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the Carlton Hotel and restaurant on the adjacent site, now occupied by New Zealand House. The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays. The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor. The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the French Renaissance. The theatre has a Corinthian colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer. This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances. The theatre lies on an east–west axis. The stage at the western end was deep and wide, and reputedly the first to be flat, rather than raked. The interior was designed by the consulting architect, W. H. Romaine-Walker (1854–1940), after the Opera at Versailles by Gabriel. Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above. In all, there were 1,319 seats. Contemporary opinion was critical of the project. Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, \"The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building.\"\n\nModern opinion of the theatre is more generous, with English Heritage describing the building as both Phipps' finest work and one of the best planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the Commonwealth Institute. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture. The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.\n\nThe current theatre opened on 28 April 1897. Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his tremendous success at the Haymarket Theatre, and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction until his death in 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome. This building did not specialise in opera, although there were some operatic performances in its early years. The theatre opened with a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker's \"The Seats of the Mighty\". Adaptations of novels by Dickens, Tolstoy, and others formed a significant part of the repertoire, along with classical works from Molière and Shakespeare. The theatre also hosted the world premiere of J. M. Synge's \"The Tinker's Wedding\" on 11 November 1909 and George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\", with Tree as Henry Higgins and Mrs Patrick Campbell as Eliza, in 1914. Tree's productions were known for their elaborate and spectacular scenery and effects, often including live animals and real grass. These remained both popular and profitable, but in his last decade, Tree's acting style was seen as increasingly outmoded, and many of his plays received bad reviews. Tree defended himself from critical censure, demonstrating his continuing popularity at the box office until his death.\nIn 1904, Tree founded the Academy of Dramatic Art (later RADA), which spent a year based in the theatre before moving in 1905 to Gower Street in Bloomsbury. Tree continued to take graduates of the Academy into his company at His Majesty's, employing some 40 actors in this way by 1911.\n\nThe facilities of the theatre naturally lent themselves to the new genre of musical theatre. \"Chu Chin Chow\" opened in 1916 and ran for an astonishing world record 2,235 performances (almost twice as long as the previous record for musical theatre – a record that it held until surpassed by \"Salad Days\" in 1955). Major productions of plays with large casts were also performed at His Majesty's. George and Ira Gershwin's \"Oh, Kay!\" had its London premiere on 21 September 1927. This starred Gertrude Lawrence and John Kirby, and ran for 213 performances. Noël Coward's operetta \"Bitter Sweet\" enjoyed a run of 697 performances beginning 18 July 1929. J. B. Priestley's theatrical adaptation of his own \"The Good Companions\" premiered on 14 May 1931.\n\nMusicals continued to dominate at the theatre in the post-Second World War period, including transfers of the successful Broadway productions \"Follow the Girls\" (1945; 572 performances) and the Lerner and Loewe musicals \"Brigadoon\" (1949; 685 performances) and \"Paint Your Wagon\" (1953; 478 performances). Leonard Bernstein's \"West Side Story\" opened in December 1958 for a run of 1,039 performances, transferring from Broadway via the Manchester Opera House. The London premiere of \"Fiddler on the Roof\" was on 16 February 1967, starring Chaim Topol, and the production ran at Her Majesty's for 2,030 performances. Forty years after the original stage adaptation, André Previn's musical adaptation of \"The Good Companions\" premiered on 11 July 1974, followed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Alan Ayckbourn's initially unsuccessful collaboration, \"Jeeves\", on 22 April 1975, which has since enjoyed considerable success.\n\nJohn Cleese organised \"A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)\" as a benefit for Amnesty International at the theatre in 1976, and it was broadcast as \"Pleasure at Her Majesty's\". This was the first of \"The Secret Policeman's Balls\", organised by and starring such performers as Peter Cook, Graham Chapman, and Rowan Atkinson. The venue was also the setting for the popular ITV variety series \"Live from Her Majesty's\", which ran on television from 1983 to 1988. It was on this programme that Tommy Cooper collapsed and died on stage in 1984.\n\nThis theatre is one of the 40 theatres featured in the 2012 DVD documentary series \"Great West End Theatres\", presented by Donald Sinden.\n\n\"The Phantom of the Opera\" had its world premiere on 9 October 1986 at the theatre, winning the Olivier Award for Best New Musical and featuring Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, who won an Olivier award for his performance in the title role. The piece is still playing at Her Majesty's, celebrating its 25th anniversary in October 2011 and surpassing 10,000 performances in October 2010. It is the second longest-running West End musical in history (after \"Les Misérables\"). In a sign of its continuing popularity, \"Phantom\" ranked second in a 2006 BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\". The musical is also the longest-running show on Broadway, was made into a film in 2004 and had been seen by over 130 million people in 145 cities in 27 countries and grossed more than £3.2bn ($5bn) by 2011, the most successful entertainment project in history.\n\nHer Majesty's Theatre's \"grand exterior\" and \"luxurious interior, with its three tiers of boxes and gold statuary around the stage\", as well as French Renaissance design, \"make it an ideal site for this Gothic tale\" set at the Opéra Garnier. The original Victorian stage machinery remains beneath the stage of the theatre. Designer Maria Björnson found a way to use it \"to show the Phantom travelling across the lake as if floating on a sea of mist and fire\", in a key scene from the musical. On 5 May 2008, for the first time in the run, the show closed for three days. This allowed the installation of an improved sound system at the theatre, consisting of over of cabling and the siting of 120 auditorium speakers.\n\nThe theatre's capacity is 1,216 seats on four levels. Really Useful Theatres Group purchased it in January 2000 with nine other London theatres formerly owned by the Stoll-Moss Group. Between 1990 and 1993, renovation and improvements were made by the H.L.M. and C. G. Twelves partnership. In 2014, Really Useful Theatres split-off from the Really Useful Group and owns the theatre.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13487", "title": "Hermann Göring", "text": "Hermann Göring\n\nHermann Wilhelm Göring (or Goering; ; 12 January 1893 – 15 October 1946) was a German political and military leader as well as one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party (NSDAP) that ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945. A veteran World War I fighter pilot ace, he was a recipient of the \"Pour le Mérite\" (\"The Blue Max\"). He was the last commander of \"Jagdgeschwader\" 1 (Jasta 1), the fighter wing once led by Manfred von Richthofen.\n\nAn early member of the Nazi Party, Göring was among those wounded in Adolf Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. While receiving treatment for his injuries, he developed an addiction to morphine which persisted until the last year of his life. After Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Göring was named as Minister Without Portfolio in the new government. One of his first acts as a cabinet minister was to oversee the creation of the Gestapo, which he ceded to Heinrich Himmler in 1934. Following the establishment of the Nazi state, Göring amassed power and political capital to become the second most powerful man in Germany. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe (air force), a position he held until the final days of the regime. Upon being named Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan in 1936, Göring was entrusted with the task of mobilizing all sectors of the economy for war, an assignment which brought numerous government agencies under his control and helped him become one of the wealthiest men in the country. After the Fall of France in 1940, he was bestowed the specially created rank of \"Reichsmarschall\", which gave him seniority over all officers in Germany's armed forces.\n\nBy 1941, Göring was at the peak of his power and influence, and Hitler designated him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of Germany's cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 that Hitler intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering his request an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.\n\nAfter the war, Göring was convicted of conspiracy, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials. He was sentenced to death by hanging, but committed suicide by ingesting cyanide the night before the sentence was to be carried out.\n\nGöring was born on 12 January 1893 at the Marienbad Sanatorium in Rosenheim, Bavaria. His father, Heinrich Ernst Göring (31 October 1839 – 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, had been the first Governor-General of the German protectorate of South-West Africa (modern-day Namibia). Heinrich had three children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was Albert. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general in Haiti, and his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.\n\nGöring's godfather was Dr. Hermann Epenstein, a wealthy Jewish physician and businessman his father had met in Africa. Epenstein provided the Göring family, who were surviving on Heinrich's pension, first with a family home in Berlin-Friedenau, then in a small castle called Veldenstein, near Nuremberg. Göring's mother became Epenstein's mistress around this time, and remained so for some fifteen years. Epenstein acquired the minor title of Ritter (knight) von Epenstein through service and donations to the Crown.\n\nInterested in a career as a soldier from a very early age, Göring enjoyed playing with toy soldiers and dressing up in a Boer uniform his father had given him. He was sent to boarding school at age eleven, where the food was poor and discipline was harsh. He sold a violin to pay for his train ticket home, and then took to his bed, feigning illness, until he was told he would not have to return. He continued to enjoy war games, pretending to lay siege to the castle Veldenstein and studying Teutonic legends and sagas. He became a mountain climber, scaling peaks in Germany, at the Mont Blanc massif, and in the Austrian Alps. At sixteen he was sent to a military academy at Berlin Lichterfelde, from which he graduated with distinction. (During the Nuremberg war-crimes trials In 1946, psychologist Gustave Gilbert measured him as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 138.)\n\nGöring joined the Prince Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) of the Prussian army in 1912. The next year his mother had a falling-out with Epenstein. The family was forced to leave Veldenstein and moved to Munich; Göring's father died shortly afterwards. When World War I began in August 1914, Göring was stationed at Mulhouse with his regiment.\n\nDuring the first year of World War I, Göring served with his infantry regiment in the area of Mülhausen, a garrison town less than 2 km from the French frontier. He was hospitalized with rheumatism, a result of the damp of trench warfare. While he was recovering, his friend Bruno Loerzer convinced him to transfer to what would become, by October 1916, the \"Luftstreitkräfte\" (\"air combat forces\") of the German army, but his request was turned down. Later that year, Göring flew as Loerzer's observer in \"Feldflieger Abteilung\" 25 (FFA 25) – Göring had informally transferred himself. He was discovered and sentenced to three weeks' confinement to barracks, but the sentence was never carried out. By the time it was supposed to be imposed, Göring's association with Loerzer had been made official. They were assigned as a team to FFA 25 in the Crown Prince's Fifth Army. They flew reconnaissance and bombing missions, for which the Crown Prince invested both Göring and Loerzer with the Iron Cross, first class.\n\nAfter completing the pilot's training course, Göring was assigned to \"Jagdstaffel\" 5. Seriously wounded in the hip in aerial combat, he took nearly a year to recover. He then was transferred to \"Jagdstaffel\" 26, commanded by Loerzer, in February 1917. He steadily scored air victories until May, when he was assigned to command \"Jagdstaffel\" 27. Serving with \"Jastas\" 5, 26, and 27, he continued to win victories. In addition to his Iron Crosses (1st and 2nd Class), he received the Zähringer Lion with swords, the Friedrich Order, the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords third class, and finally, in May 1918, the coveted \"Pour le Mérite\". According to Hermann Dahlmann, who knew both men, Göring had Loerzer lobby for the award. He finished the war with 22 victories. A thorough post-war examination of Allied loss records showed that only two of his awarded victories were doubtful. Three were possible and 17 were certain, or highly likely.\n\nOn 7 July 1918, following the death of Wilhelm Reinhard, successor to Manfred von Richthofen, Göring was made commander of the famed \"Flying Circus\", \"Jagdgeschwader\" 1. His arrogance made him unpopular with the men of his squadron.\n\nIn the last days of the war, Göring was repeatedly ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their planes to keep them from falling into enemy hands.\n\nLike many other German veterans, Göring was a proponent of the Stab-in-the-back legend, the belief which held that the German Army had not really lost the war, but instead was betrayed by the civilian leadership: Marxists, Jews, and especially the Republicans, who had overthrown the German monarchy.\n\nGöring remained in aviation after the war. He tried barnstorming and briefly worked at Fokker. After spending most of 1919 living in Denmark, he moved to Sweden and joined Svensk Lufttrafik, a Swedish airline. Göring was often hired for private flights. During the winter of 1920–1921, he was hired by Count Eric von Rosen to fly him to his castle from Stockholm. Invited to spend the night, Göring may at this time have first seen the swastika emblem, which Rosen had set in the chimney piece as a family badge.\n\nThis was also the first time that Göring saw his future wife; the count introduced his sister-in-law, Baroness Carin von Kantzow (\"née\" Freiin von Fock). Estranged from her husband of ten years, she had an eight-year-old son. Göring was immediately infatuated and asked her to meet him in Stockholm. They arranged a visit at the home of her parents and spent much time together through 1921, when Göring left for Munich to take political science at the university. Carin obtained a divorce, followed Göring to Munich, and married him on 3 February 1922. Their first home together was a hunting lodge at Hochkreuth in the Bavarian Alps, near Bayrischzell, some from Munich. After Göring met Adolf Hitler and joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1922, they moved to Obermenzing, a suburb of Munich.\n\nGöring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler. He was given command of the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) as the \"Oberster SA-Führer\" in 1923. He was later appointed an \"SA-Gruppenführer\" (Lieutenant General) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945. At this time, Carin—who liked Hitler—often played hostess to meetings of leading Nazis, including her husband, Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, and Ernst Röhm. Hitler later recalled his early association with Göring:\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party held mass meetings and rallies in Munich and elsewhere during the early 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler leading the march to the War Ministry, was shot in the leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant on the good will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.\n\nPersonal problems continued to multiply. By 1925, Carin's mother was ill. The Görings—with difficulty—raised the money in the spring of 1925 for a journey to Sweden via Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Danzig (now Gdańsk). Göring had become a violent morphine addict; Carin's family were shocked by his deterioration. Carin, who was ill with epilepsy and a weak heart, had to allow the doctors to take charge of Göring; her son was taken by his father. Göring was certified a dangerous drug addict and was placed in Långbro asylum on 1 September 1925. He was violent to the point where he had to be confined in a straitjacket, but his psychiatrist felt he was sane; the condition was caused solely by the morphine. Weaned off the drug, he left the facility briefly, but had to return for further treatment. He returned to Germany when an amnesty was declared in 1927 and resumed working in the aircraft industry. Hitler, who had written \"Mein Kampf\" while in prison, had been released in December 1924. Carin Göring, ill with epilepsy and tuberculosis, died of heart failure on 17 October 1931.\n\nMeanwhile, the NSDAP was in a period of rebuilding and waiting. The economy had recovered, which meant fewer opportunities for the Nazis to agitate for change. The SA was reorganised, but with Franz Pfeffer von Salomon as its head rather than Göring, and the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) was founded in 1925, initially as a bodyguard for Hitler. Membership in the party increased from 27,000 in 1925 to 108,000 in 1928 and 178,000 in 1929. In the May 1928 elections the NSDAP only obtained 12 seats out of an available 491 in the Reichstag. Göring was elected as a representative from Bavaria. The Great Depression led to a disastrous downturn in the German economy, and in the 1930 election, the NSDAP won 6,409,600 votes and 107 seats. In May 1931, Hitler sent Göring on a mission to the Vatican, where he met the future Pope Pius XII.\n\nIn the July 1932 election, the Nazis won 230 seats to become far and away the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis were thus entitled to select the President of the Reichstag, and elected Göring to the post.\n\nThe Reichstag fire occurred on the night of 27 February 1933. Göring was one of the first to arrive on the scene. Marinus van der Lubbe—a Communist radical—was arrested and claimed sole responsibility for the fire. Göring immediately called for a crackdown on Communists.\n\nThe Nazis took advantage of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 Party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.\n\nAt the Nuremberg trials, General Franz Halder testified that Göring admitted responsibility for starting the fire. He said that, at a luncheon held on Hitler's birthday in 1942, Göring said, \"The only one who really knows about the Reichstag is I, because I set it on fire!\" In his own Nuremberg testimony, Göring denied this story.\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Göring was often in the company of Emmy Sonnemann, an actress from Hamburg. They were married on 10 April 1935 in Berlin; the wedding was celebrated on a huge scale. A large reception was held the night before at the Berlin Opera House. Fighter aircraft flew overhead on the night of the reception and the day of the ceremony, at which Hitler was best man. Göring's daughter, Edda, was born on 2 June 1938.\n\nWhen Hitler was named chancellor of Germany in January 1933, Göring was appointed as minister without portfolio, Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation. Wilhelm Frick was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick and head of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) Heinrich Himmler hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with Rudolf Diels at its head. The force was called the \"Geheime Staatspolizei\", or Gestapo. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934. By this time, the SA numbered over two million men.\n\nHitler was deeply concerned that Ernst Röhm, the chief of the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.\n\nOne of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which had been in place since the end of World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to maintain an air force. After the 1926 signing of the Kellogg–Briand Pact, police aircraft were permitted. Göring was appointed Air Traffic Minister in May 1933. Germany began to accumulate aircraft in violation of the Treaty, and in 1935 the existence of the Luftwaffe was formally acknowledged, with Göring as Reich Aviation Minister.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler announced that the German rearmament programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, to the chagrin of Hjalmar Schacht, the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on rearmament, in spite of growing deficits. Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937, and Walther Funk took over the position, as well as control of the Reichsbank. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control under the auspices of the Four Year Plan. In July 1937, the Reichswerke Hermann Göring was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.\n\nIn 1938, Göring was involved in the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, which led to the resignations of the War Minister, \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Werner von Blomberg, and the army commander, General Werner von Fritsch. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute. Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of Blomberg. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations of homosexual activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign. Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of \"Generalfeldmarschall\". Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.\nAs minister in charge of the Four Year Plan, Göring became concerned with the lack of natural resources in Germany, and began pushing for Austria to be incorporated into the Reich. The province of Styria had rich iron ore deposits, and the country as a whole was home to many skilled labourers that would also be useful. Hitler had always been in favour of a takeover of Austria, his native country. He met on 12 February 1938 with Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, threatening invasion if peaceful unification was not forthcoming. The Nazi party was made legal in Austria to gain a power base, and a referendum on reunification was scheduled for March. When Hitler did not approve of the wording of the plebiscite, Göring telephoned Schuschnigg and Austrian head of state Wilhelm Miklas to demand Schuschnigg's resignation, threatening invasion by German troops and civil unrest by the Austrian Nazi Party members. Schuschnigg resigned on 11 March and the plebiscite was cancelled. By 5:30 the next morning, German troops that had been massing on the border marched into Austria, meeting no resistance.\n\nAlthough Joachim von Ribbentrop had been named Foreign Minister in February 1938, Göring continued to involve himself in foreign affairs. That July, he contacted the British government with the idea that he should make an official visit to discuss Germany's intentions for Czechoslovakia. Neville Chamberlain was in favour of a meeting, and there was talk of a pact being signed between Britain and Germany. In February 1938, Göring visited Warsaw to quell rumours about the upcoming invasion of Poland. He had conversations with the Hungarian government that summer as well, discussing their potential role in an invasion of Czechoslovakia. At the Nuremberg Rally that September, Göring and other speakers denounced the Czechs as an inferior race that must be conquered. Chamberlain met with Hitler in a series of meetings that led to the signing of the Munich Agreement (29 September 1938), which turned over control of the Sudetenland to Germany. In March 1939, Göring threatened Czechoslovak president Emil Hácha with the bombing of Prague. Hácha then agreed to sign a communique accepting the German occupation of the remainder of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nAlthough many in the party disliked him, before the war Göring enjoyed widespread personal popularity among the German public because of his perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself as a champion of national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. In Britain and the United States, some viewed Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.\n\nGöring and other senior officers were concerned that Germany was not yet ready for war, but Hitler insisted on pushing ahead as soon as possible. The invasion of Poland, the opening action of World War II, began at dawn on 1 September 1939. Later in the day, speaking to the \"Reichstag\", Hitler designated Göring as his successor as Führer of all Germany, \"If anything should befall me\", with Hess as the second alternate. Big German victories followed one after the other in quick succession. With the help of the Luftwaffe, the Polish Air Force was defeated within a week. The \"Fallschirmjäger\" seized vital airfields in Norway and captured Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium. Göring's Luftwaffe played critical roles in the Battles of the Netherlands, Belgium and France in May 1940.\n\nAfter the Fall of France, Hitler awarded Göring the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his successful leadership. During the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony, Hitler promoted Göring to the rank of \"Reichsmarschall des Grossdeutschen Reiches\" (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he was then the top ranking soldier of all Germany until the end of the war. Göring had already received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.\n\nThe UK had declared war on Germany immediately after the invasion of Poland. In July 1940, Hitler began preparations for an invasion of Britain. As part of the plan, the Royal Air Force (RAF) had to be neutralized. Bombing raids commenced on British air installations and on cities and centres of industry. Göring had by then already announced in a radio speech, \"If as much as a single enemy aircraft flies over German soil, my name is Meier!\", something that would return to haunt him, when the RAF began bombing German cities on 11 May 1940. Though he was confident the Luftwaffe could defeat the RAF within days, Göring, like Admiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the \"Kriegsmarine\" (navy), was pessimistic about the chance of success of the planned invasion (codenamed Operation Sea Lion). Göring hoped that a victory in the air would be enough to force peace without an invasion. The campaign failed, and Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940. After their defeat in the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe attempted to defeat Britain via strategic bombing. On 12 October 1940 Hitler cancelled Sea Lion due to the onset of winter. By the end of the year, it was clear that British morale was not being shaken by the Blitz, though the bombings continued through May 1941.\n\nIn spite of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed in 1939, Nazi Germany began Operation Barbarossa—the invasion of the Soviet Union—on 22 June 1941. Initially the Luftwaffe was at an advantage, destroying thousands of Soviet aircraft in the first month of fighting. Hitler and his top staff were sure that the campaign would be over by Christmas, and no provisions were made for reserves of men or equipment. But, by July, the Germans had only 1,000 planes remaining in operation, and their troop losses were over 213,000 men. The choice was made to concentrate the attack on only one part of the vast front; efforts would be directed at capturing Moscow. After the long, but successful, Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily diverted its Panzer groups north and south to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilize fresh reserves; historian Russel Stolfi considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive, which was resumed in October 1941 with the Battle of Moscow. Poor weather conditions, fuel shortages, a delay in building aircraft bases in Eastern Europe, and overstretched supply lines were also factors. Hitler did not give permission for even a partial retreat until mid-January 1942; by this time the losses were comparable to those of the French invasion of Russia in 1812.\n\nHitler decided that the summer 1942 campaign would be concentrated in the south; efforts would be made to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus. The Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point of the war, began on 23 August 1942 with a bombing campaign by the Luftwaffe. The Sixth Army entered the city, but because of its location on the front line, it was still possible for the Soviets to encircle and trap it there without reinforcements or supplies. When the Sixth Army was surrounded by the end of November in Operation Uranus, Göring promised that the Luftwaffe would be able to deliver a minimum of 300 tons of supplies to the trapped men every day. On the basis of these assurances, Hitler demanded that there be no retreat; they were to fight to the last man. Though some airlifts were able to get through, the amount of supplies delivered never exceeded 120 tons per day. The remnants of the German Sixth Army—some 91,000 men out of an army of 285,000—surrendered in early February 1943; only 5,000 of these captives survived the Russian prisoner of war camps to see Germany again.\n\nMeanwhile, the strength of the US and British bomber fleets had increased. Based in Britain, they began operations against German targets. The first thousand-bomber raid was staged on Cologne on 30 May 1942. Air raids continued on targets further from England after auxiliary fuel tanks were installed on US fighter aircraft. Göring refused to believe reports that American fighters had been shot down as far east as Aachen in winter 1943. His reputation began to decline.\n\nThe American P-51 Mustang, with a combat radius of over when using underwing drop tanks, began to escort the bombers in large formations to and from the target area in early 1944. From that point onwards, the Luftwaffe began to suffer casualties in aircrews it could not sufficiently replace. By targeting oil refineries and rail communications, Allied bombers crippled the German war effort by late 1944. German civilians blamed Göring for his failure to protect the homeland. Hitler began excluding him from conferences, but continued him in his positions at the head of the Luftwaffe and as plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan. As he lost Hitler's trust, Göring began to spend more time at his various residences. On D-Day (6 June 1944), the Luftwaffe only had some 300 fighters and a small number of bombers in the area of the landings; the Allies had a total strength of 11,000 aircraft.\n\nAs the Soviets approached Berlin, Hitler's efforts to organise the defence of the city became ever more meaningless and futile. His last birthday, celebrated at the \"Führerbunker\" in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed, and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere. Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, the same day that Hitler, in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide. He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.\n\nOKW operations chief Alfred Jodl was present for Hitler's rant, and notified Göring's chief of staff, Karl Koller, at a meeting a few hours later. Sensing its implications, Koller immediately flew to Berchtesgaden to notify Göring, who feared being accused of treason if he tried to take power. On the other hand, if he did nothing, he feared being accused of dereliction of duty. After some hesitation, Göring reviewed his copy of the 1941 decree naming him Hitler's successor. It not only placed Göring first in the line of succession, but also stated that, if Hitler ever lost his freedom of action, Göring had complete authority to act on Hitler's behalf as his deputy. After conferring with Koller and Hans Lammers, the state secretary of the Reich Chancellery, Göring concluded that, by remaining in Berlin to face certain death, Hitler had incapacitated himself from governing. All agreed that Göring therefore had a clear duty to take power in Hitler's stead. He was also motivated by fears that his rival, Martin Bormann, would seize power upon Hitler's death and would have him killed as a traitor. With this in mind, Göring sent a carefully worded telegram asking Hitler for permission to take over as the leader of Germany, stressing that he would be acting as Hitler's deputy. He added that, if Hitler did not reply by 22:00 that night (23 April), he would assume that Hitler had indeed lost his freedom of action, and would assume leadership of the Reich.\n\nThe telegram was intercepted by Bormann, who convinced Hitler that Göring was a traitor and that the telegram was a demand to resign or be overthrown. Hitler sent a reply to Göringprepared with Bormann's helpinforming him that, unless he resigned immediately, he would be executed for high treason. Soon afterward, Hitler removed Göring from all of his offices and ordered Göring, his staff, and Lammers placed under house arrest at Obersalzberg. Bormann made an announcement over the radio that Göring had resigned for health reasons.\n\nBy 26 April, the complex at Obersalzberg was under attack by the Allies, so Göring was moved to his castle at Mauterndorf. In his last will and testament, Hitler expelled Göring from the party and formally rescinded the decree making him his successor. He then appointed Karl Dönitz, the Navy's commander-in-chief, as president of the Reich and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, committed suicide on 30 April 1945, a few hours after a hastily arranged wedding. Göring was freed on 5 May by a passing Luftwaffe unit, and he made his way to the US lines in hopes of surrendering to them rather than to the Soviets. He was taken into custody near Radstadt on 6 May by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the US Army. This move likely saved Göring's life; Bormann had ordered him executed if Berlin had fallen.\n\nGöring was flown to Camp Ashcan, a temporary prisoner-of-war camp housed in the Palace Hotel at Mondorf-les-Bains, Luxembourg. Here he was weaned off dihydrocodeine (a mild morphine derivative)—he had been taking the equivalent of three or four grains (260 to 320 mg) of morphine a day—and was put on a strict diet; he lost . His IQ was tested while in custody and found to be 138. Top Nazi officials were transferred in September to Nuremberg, which was to be the location of a series of military tribunals beginning in November.\n\nGöring was the second-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg, behind Reich President (former Admiral) Karl Dönitz. The prosecution levelled an indictment of four charges, including a charge of conspiracy; waging a war of aggression; war crimes, including the plundering and removal to Germany of works of art and other property; and crimes against humanity, including the disappearance of political and other opponents under the \"Nacht und Nebel\" (Night and Fog) decree; the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war; and the murder and enslavement of civilians, including what was at the time estimated to be 5,700,000 Jews. Not permitted to present a lengthy statement, Göring declared himself to be \"in the sense of the indictment not guilty\". \n\nThe trial lasted 218 days; the prosecution presented their case from November through March, and Göring's defencethe first to be presentedlasted from 8 to 22 March. The sentences were read out on 30 September 1946. Göring, forced to remain silent while seated in the dock, communicated his opinions about the proceedings using gestures, shaking his head, or laughing. He constantly took notes and whispered with the other defendants, and tried to control the erratic behaviour of Hess, who was seated beside him. During breaks in the proceedings, Göring tried to dominate the other defendants, and he was eventually placed in solitary confinement when he attempted to influence their testimony. Göring told US psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn that the court was \"stupid\" to try \"little fellows\" like Funk and Kaltenbrunner instead of letting Göring take all the blame on himself. He also claimed that he had never heard of most of the other defendants before the trial.\n\nCaptain Gustave Gilbert, a German-speaking US intelligence officer and psychologist, interviewed Göring and the others in prison during the trial. Gilbert kept a journal, which he later published as \"Nuremberg Diary\". Here he describes Göring on the evening of 18 April 1946, as the trials were halted for a three-day Easter recess:\n\nOn several occasions over the course of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying on his own behalf, Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.\n\nGöring was found guilty on all four counts and was sentenced to death by hanging. The judgment stated:\n\nGöring made an appeal asking to be shot as a soldier instead of hanged as a common criminal, but the court refused. Defying the sentence imposed by his captors, he committed suicide with a potassium cyanide capsule the night before he was to be hanged.\n\nOne theory as to how Göring obtained the poison holds that US Army Lieutenant Jack G. Wheelis, who was stationed at the Nuremberg Trials, retrieved the capsules from their hiding place among Göring's personal effects that had been confiscated by the Army and handed them over to the prisoner, after being bribed by Göring, who gave him his gold watch, pen, and cigarette case. In 2005, former US Army Private Herbert Lee Stivers, who served in the 1st Infantry Division's 26th Infantry Regimentthe honour guard for the Nuremberg Trialsclaimed he gave Göring \"medicine\" hidden inside a fountain pen that a German woman had asked him to smuggle into the prison. Stivers later said that he did not know what was in the pill until after Göring's suicide.\n\nGöring's body, as with those of the men who were executed, was displayed at the execution ground for the witnesses of the executions. The bodies were cremated at Ostfriedhof, Munich, and the ashes were scattered in the Isar River.\n\nGöring's name is closely associated with the Nazi plunder of Jewish property. His name appears 135 times on the OSS Art Looting Investigation Unit (ALIU) Red Flag Names List compiled by US Army intelligence in 1945-6 and declassified in 1997.\n\nThe confiscation of Jewish property gave Göring the opportunity to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took kickbacks from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War via Pyrkal in Greece (although Germany was supporting Franco and the Nationalists).\n\nGöring was appointed Reich Master of the Hunt in 1933 and Master of the German Forests in 1934. He instituted reforms to the forestry laws and acted to protect endangered species. Around this time he became interested in Schorfheide Forest, where he set aside as a state park, which is still extant. There he built an elaborate hunting lodge, Carinhall, in memory of his first wife, Carin. By 1934, her body had been transported to the site and placed in a vault on the estate. The main lodge had a large art gallery where Göring displayed works that had been plundered from private collections and museums around Europe from 1939 onward. Göring worked closely with the \"Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg\" (Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce), an organisation tasked with the looting of artwork and cultural material from Jewish collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. Headed by Alfred Rosenberg, the task force set up a collection centre and headquarters in Paris. Some 26,000 railroad cars full of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France alone. Göring repeatedly visited the Paris headquarters to review the incoming stolen goods and to select items to be sent on a special train to Carinhall and his other homes. The estimated value of his collection—numbering some 1,500 pieces—was $200 million.\n\nGöring was known for his extravagant tastes and garish clothing. He had various special uniforms made for the many posts he held; his \"Reichsmarschall\" uniform included a jewel-encrusted baton. Hans-Ulrich Rudel, the top \"Stuka\" pilot of the war, recalled twice meeting Göring dressed in outlandish costumes: first, a medieval hunting costume, practicing archery with his doctor; and second, dressed in a red toga fastened with a golden clasp, smoking an unusually large pipe. Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano once noted Göring wearing a fur coat that looked like what \"a high grade prostitute wears to the opera.\" He threw lavish housewarming parties each time a round of construction was completed at Carinhall, and changed costumes several times throughout the evenings.\n\nGöring was noted for his patronage of music, especially opera. He entertained frequently and sumptuously, and hosted elaborate birthday parties for himself. Armaments minister Albert Speer recalled that guests brought expensive gifts such as gold bars, Dutch cigars, and valuable artwork. For his birthday in 1944, Speer gave Göring an oversize marble bust of Hitler. As a member of the Prussian Council of State, Speer was required to donate a considerable portion of his salary towards the Council's birthday gift to Göring without even being asked. \"Generalfeldmarschall\" Erhard Milch told Speer that similar donations were required out of the Air Ministry's general fund. For his birthday in 1940, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano decorated Göring with the coveted Collar of Annunziata. The award reduced him to tears.\n\nThe design of the \"Reichsmarschall\" standard, on a light blue field, featured a gold German eagle grasping a wreath surmounted by two batons overlaid with a swastika. The reverse side of the flag had the \"Großkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes\" (\"Grand Cross of the Iron Cross\") surrounded by a wreath between four Luftwaffe eagles. The flag was carried by a personal standard-bearer at all public occasions.\n\nThough he liked to be called \"der Eiserne\" (the Iron Man), the once dashing and muscular fighter pilot had become corpulent. He was one of the few Nazi leaders who did not take offence at hearing jokes about himself, \"no matter how rude\", taking them as a sign of popularity. Germans joked about his ego, saying that he would wear an admiral's uniform with rubber medals to take a bath, and his obesity, joking that \"he sits down on his stomach\". One joke claimed that he had sent a wire to Hitler after his visit to the Vatican: \"Mission accomplished. Pope unfrocked. Tiara and pontifical vestments are a perfect fit.\"\n\nJoseph Goebbels and Himmler were far more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that attitude because party politics required him to do so. His deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property as part of the Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.\n\nAt the same meeting, options for the disposition of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of Aryanization. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all. Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews. He told Gilbert that he would never have supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known what was going to happen. \"I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government\", he claimed.\n\nIn July 1941, Göring issued a memo to Reinhard Heydrich ordering him to organise the practical details of the Final Solution to the \"Jewish Question\". By the time that this letter was written, many Jews and others had already been killed in Poland, Russia, and elsewhere. At the Wannsee Conference, held six months later, Heydrich formally announced that genocide of the Jews was now official Reich policy. Göring did not attend the conference, but he was present at other meetings where the number of people killed was discussed.\n\nGöring directed anti-partisan operations by Luftwaffe security battalions in the Białowieża Forest between 1942 and 1944 that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jews and Polish civilians.\n\nGöring's younger brother Albert despised Nazism, and offered active resistance to the regime, including helping prisoners escape from concentration camps. He was arrested four times, but Hermann secured his release each time. Hermann's daughter Edda told \"The Guardian\" that Albert \"could certainly help people in need himself financially and with his personal influence, but as soon as it was necessary to involve higher authority or officials, then he had to have the support of my father, which he did get.\"\n\n\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "36836451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36836451", "title": "Modern sculpture", "text": "Modern sculpture\n\nModern sculpture is generally considered to have begun with the work of Auguste Rodin, who is seen as the progenitor of modern sculpture. While Rodin did not set out to rebel against the past, he created a new way of building his works. He \"dissolved the hard outline of contemporary Neo-Greek academicism, and thereby created a vital synthesis of opacity and transparency, volume and void\". Along with a few other artists in the late 19th century who experimented with new artistic visions in sculpture like Edgar Degas and Paul Gauguin, Rodin invented a radical new approach in the creation of sculpture. Modern sculpture, along with all modern art, \"arose as part of Western society's attempt to come to terms with the urban, industrial and secular society that emerged during the nineteenth century\".\n\nModernist sculpture movements include Art Nouveau, Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Land art, Conceptual art, and Installation art among others.\n\nThe modern sculpture movement can be said to begin at the Rodin exhibit at the Universal Exhibition held in Paris in 1900. At this event Rodin showed his Burghers of Calais, Balzac, Victor Hugo statues, and the exhibition included the first public showing of his Gates of Hell which included The Thinker.\n\nCubist sculpture, in the early 20th century, was a style that developed in parallel with cubist painting, and the formal experiments of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso. Beginning around 1909 and evolving through the early 1920s cubist artists developed new means of constructing works of art using collage, sculptural assemblage using disparate materials and traditional sculpture making from plaster and clay molds. Some sources name Picasso's 1909 bronze \"Head of a Woman\" as the first cubist sculpture. Artists like Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), whose career was cut short by his death in military service, and Alexander Archipenko, who'd arrived in Paris in 1908 and whose 1912 \"Walking Woman\" were very quick to follow Braque and Picasso's lead. Joseph Csaky, a sculptor from Hungary, exhibited his first cubist sculptures in Paris in 1911. Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens and Ossip Zadkine and others joined the earlier cubist sculptors.\n\nIn the early 20th century, during his period of cubist innovation, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his \"constructions\" fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; Picasso reinvented the art of sculpture with his innovative use of constructing a work in three dimensions with disparate material, the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art. Just as collage was a radical development in two-dimensional art; so was \"construction\" a radical development in three-dimensional sculpture. The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as \"sculpture\" that would not have been so previously, such as \"involuntary sculpture\" in several senses, including coulage. In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of ceramic art, with figures such as George E. Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson. Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the \"found object\" (French: \"objet trouvé\") or \"readymade\" with pieces such as Fountain (1917).\n\nSimilarly, the work of Constantin Brâncuși at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late 19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his \"Bird in Space\" series (1924). These elegantly refined forms became synonymous with 20th-century sculpture. In 1927, Brâncuși won a lawsuit against the U.S. customs authorities who attempted to value his sculpture as raw metal. The suit led to legal changes permitting the importation of abstract art free of duty.\n\nBrâncuși's impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as Gaston Lachaise, Sir Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miró, Ásmundur Sveinsson, Julio González, Pablo Serrano, Jacques Lipchitz and also by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by Alexander Calder, Len Lye, Jean Tinguely, and Frederick Kiesler who were pioneers of Kinetic art.\n\nSince the 1950s Modernist trends in sculpture both abstract and figurative have dominated the public imagination and the popularity of Modernist sculpture had sidelined the traditional approach. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge, -high public sculpture to be built in Chicago, known usually as the \"Chicago Picasso\". He approached the project with a great deal of enthusiasm, designing a sculpture which was ambiguous and somewhat controversial. What the figure represents is not known; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman, or a totally abstract shape. The sculpture, one of the most recognizable landmarks in downtown Chicago, was unveiled in 1967. Picasso refused to be paid $100,000 for it, donating it to the people of the city.\n\nIn the late 1950s and the 1960s, abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.\n\nBy the 1960s Abstract expressionism, Geometric abstraction and Minimalism, which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of Sir Anthony Caro, as well as welded sculpture by a large variety of sculptors, the large scale work of John Chamberlain, and environmental installation scale works by Mark di Suvero. Other Minimalists and Postminimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, Ronald Bladen, Giacomo Benevelli, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Eva Hesse, Christo, Walter De Maria, Robert Smithson, and others like John Safer who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line. led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by pop artists and modernist artists in stylized forms by artists such as: George Segal, Claes Oldenburg, Arman, Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Manuel Neri and others became popular. In the 1980s several artists, among others, exploring figurative sculpture were Robert Graham in a classic articulated style and Fernando Botero bringing his painting's \"oversized figures\" into monumental sculptures. Ceramic sculpture as practiced by Pablo Picasso, Peter Voulkos, Stephen De Staebler, Kenneth Price, and others became an important idiom of modern sculpture in the 20th century.\n\nSite specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Andy Goldsworthy, Walter De Maria, Richard Long, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude-led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the \"land art in the American West\" group of projects. These land art or \"earth art\" environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater). Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, and Bruce Nauman, among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.\n\nAlso during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Eduardo Paolozzi, Chryssa, Walter De Maria, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery, and figuration through video art, environment, light sculpture, and installation art in new ways.\n\nConceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include \"One and Three Chairs\", 1965, by Joseph Kosuth, and \"An Oak Tree\", 1973, by Michael Craig-Martin, and those of Joseph Beuys and James Turrell among others.\n\nPostmodern sculpture occupies a broader field of activities than Modernist sculpture. Rosalind Krauss identified sculpture in the expanded field, a series of oppositions around the work's relationship to its environment that describe the various sculpture-like activities that are postmodern sculpture, creating a theoretical explanation that could adequately fit the developments of Land art, Minimalist sculpture, and site-specific art into the category of \"sculpture\":\n\n\nModern sculpture is often created outdoors, as in environmental art and environmental sculpture, often in full view of spectators. Light sculpture and site-specific art also often make use of the environment. Site-specific artwork is intentionally created for a specific place. The term was first used in the mid-1970s by sculptors Patricia Johanson, Dennis Oppenheim, Athena Tacha, and others. Site specific environmental art was described as a movement by architectural critic Catherine Howett and art critic Lucy Lippard. Land art, Earthworks, (Earth art) is an art movement that makes specific use of the real landscape to form works of sculpture that are located in and make use of nature generally in altered form. It is a form of sculpture created in nature, from nature, using materials found in nature like dirt, soil, rocks, logs, branches, leaves, and water, as well as man made materials like Chain-link fencing, barbed wire, rope, rubber, glass, concrete, metal, asphalt, and mineral pigments. Ice sculpture is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles. Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about 6 to on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall.\n\nSound sculptures take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. Art toys have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by Takashi Murakami and Kid Robot, designed by Michael Lau, or hand-made by Michael Leavitt.\n\n"}

Adnan Siddiqui, Akshaye Khanna and Nawazuddin Siddiqui are featured in supporting roles. Music for the film has been composed and produced by A. R. Rahman. \"Mom\" marked Sridevi's 300th, and final major film appearance before her death on 24 February 2018.\n\nThe film was released on 7 July 2017, in four languages, and received positive reviews from film critics. It was successful commercially as well grossing almost 65 crores worldwide. Sridevi was highly lauded for her performance in the film with \"Times of India\" saying that the actress \"demonstrates why she is the high-priestess of Indian cinema.\" The film received two awards at the 65th National Film Awards : Best Actress for Sridevi, marking the first posthumous win in the category and Best Background Score for A.R. Rahman.\nAt the 63rd Filmfare Awards, the film received six nominations, including Best Actress and Best Actress (Critics) for Sridevi and Best Supporting Actor for Siddiqui.\n\nBiology teacher Devki is vivacious and popular among her students. In a class, a student, Mohit sends Devki's stepdaughter, Arya an offensive video and Devki throws his phone out of the window. At home, despite Devki's persistent and warm approach toward her, Arya remains frosty and distant, rebuffing her attempts to build a relationship. Arya is invited to a Valentine's Day party at a farmhouse; Devki permits this with great hesitation. Arya rebuffs Mohit and his hotshot buddy Charles at the party. Incensed by this very public snub, Charles, Mohit, Jagan and the watchman Babu attack Arya when she leaves the party. They brutally rape her and dump her in a drain along the side of a road, leaving her for dead after half-strangling her. She is found barely alive and brought to the hospital, where she undergoes various operations to save her. Devki and her husband Anand are shattered. Arya recovers and releases a statement naming her attackers.\n\nInspector Matthew quickly rounds up the attackers. However, the case falls apart when Arya was found to be drinking, thus building the argument that her memory is unreliable. The body samples were recovered very late and were too weak to match the attackers. The judge acquits the four attackers due to lack of evidence. Her lawyer suggests appealing to a higher court but Devki has lost faith. Arya, still in shock and broken by the court verdict, tears away from Devki. In sorrow, Devki realizes she has probably lost Arya forever.\n\nDevki recalls the somewhat shady detective, DK, whom she'd met on the night Arya was raped. A father of a daughter himself, he understands her pain and agrees to help her as Devki wants to avenge Arya.\n\nThe watchman is first. Devki seeks the help of her former students - transgender people who understand her plight. They seduce the watchman and drug him. He awakes four days later, still drunk, and finds, to his horror, that he has been castrated and remembers nothing. The hotshot Charles is next. Devki breaks into his home and mixes crushed apple seeds – a source of cyanide – into his fitness powder. Charles is paralyzed. When Mohit visits Charles at the hospital, Devki, tipped off by DK, plants apple seeds and other evidence at Mohit’s home. Inspector Matthew quickly arrests Mohit; Charles will die soon and Mohit will be the murderer. As Devki takes down each of Arya's attackers, their situations make it on the news, which Arya follows with surprise. She believes it may be her father, and she is deeply grateful to him. Matthew also suspects the father but, although he has him tailed, cannot catch him out. Then he finds Devki’s glasses in Mohit’s apartment and starts suspecting her.\n\nMatthew confronts Devki but there is no evidence. He warns her that the fourth man, Jagan, is a hard criminal: going after him is dangerous for her family. Jagan visits Charles and learns that it is \"the mom\" (Devki) who is retaliating. He goes after DK and discovers that Devki is on a holiday at a snow cottage in Kufri. He kills DK and goes after Devki. Matthew discovers a hidden camera in DK’s sunglasses and hurries to save Devki.\n\nJagan cuts power at the cottage and shoots Anand. There is a scuffle and Arya runs out into the snow. Jagan pursues her and Devki tries to save her. As Jagan is about to kill Devki, Matthew intercepts and tackles Jagan. There is a standoff: Devki points a gun at Jagan and Matthew attempts to talk her down by telling her that Anand is alive and in the hospital and if she shoots him, she’ll go to jail. Arya, in the bushes, overhears Jagan when he angrily relates how Devki finished off the other attackers. Devki knows if Jagan is left alive he will come after her again. At this point, Matthew hands her his gun and urges her to kill him. Devki hesitates but when an overwhelmed Arya acknowledges Devki as \"‘Mom’\" for the first time, Devki shoots Jagan dead.\n\n\nIt was announced in early 2016 that Sridevi would be starring next in Boney Kapoor's woman-centric home-production titled \"Mom\" to be directed by Ravi Udyawar. Nawazuddin Siddiqui was cast to play an important role in the film and the actor revealed that it was a dream come true for him to work with Sridevi. Subsequently, Akshaye Khanna and actors Sajal Ali and Adnan Siddiqui were cast in crucial roles. A. R. Rahman was signed to compose the music of \"Mom\".\n\nThe first spell of film was shot in New Delhi in March 2016 around locations of Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi University and Noida Film City. Following this, \"Mom\" was shot in an extensive schedule in Mestia, Georgia. The crew shot in freezing conditions of minus seven degrees for over two months. Despite the challenging climactic environment, the schedule was successfully wrapped up. Shooting resumed once more in March 2017 and the last leg of the film was completed in Bangkok.\n\nThe First Look of \"Mom\" was unveiled at the Zee Cine Awards 2017 by Salman Khan who hailed Sridevi on stage as \"a bigger star than the Khans\". The actress made the First Look public on Twitter which went viral. Subsequently, the Teaser of \"Mom\" acquired 1.2 million views on YouTube on the first day itself.

{"id": "827336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=827336", "title": "Monica Geller", "text": "Monica Geller\n\nMonica E. Geller is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appears on the American sitcom \"Friends\" (1994–2004). Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and portrayed by actress Courteney Cox, Monica appears in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere on September 24, 1994, to its finale on May 6, 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature, Monica is the younger sister of Ross Geller and best friend of Rachel Green, the latter of whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters spend several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend Chandler Bing, whom she marries. Unable to conceive children on their own, the couple eventually adopts twins and moves out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.\n\nThe creators' first choice for the role of Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had originally been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox' co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before \"Friends\" aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.\n\nSeveral months before \"Friends\" premiered, NBC had conducted a research report, the results of which determined that Monica was the only character to have been remotely well received by test audiences. When \"Friends\" first aired, critics initially perceived Monica – who was immediately established as the show's \"mother hen\" – and Cox as the series' main character and star, respectively. Critics have been largely receptive towards both Cox and her character; the \"Los Angeles Times\" holds Cox's acting responsible for disproving the stigma that attractive women are incapable of delivering comedic performances. Revered as a television icon, Monica famously addressed several topics that were rarely discussed in prime time television at the time, including safe sex, casual sex, and age disparity in relationships. Despite garnering positive reviews for her performance, Cox is the only main cast member to have never been nominated for an Emmy Award during \"Friends\" ten-year run.\n\nHardworking chefMonica is introduced in the pilot as one of five close-knit friends who live in New York City, including her older brother Ross (David Schwimmer), neighbors Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), and former roommate Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). When her privileged, inexperienced childhood best friend Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), with whom she had long lost contact, suddenly arrives in her neighborhood unannounced as a runaway bride after abandoning her own wedding, Monica allows her to move in with her while she attempts to reorganize her life, and the two reconnect.\n\nMonica begins dating Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), an older man who is also one of her father's best friends and 21 years her senior. However, the couple mutually agrees to end their long-running relationship after realizing that Richard does not want children, while Monica aspires to eventually raise a family of her own one day. While in England attending Ross' second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially supposed to have been a casual, one-time thing which grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but attempt to conceal it from their friends for as long as possible. After finally revealing their relationship to their friends, who are delighted by the news, Monica and Chandler marry.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to conceive a child of their own, Monica and Chandler discover that they are both infertile, and ultimately settle upon adoption as an alternative, deciding to adopt the yet-to-be-born child of expectant single mother Erica (Anna Faris). The couple is very much surprised when Erica gives birth to twins, and name the boy Jack after Monica's father, and the girl Erica after her birth mother.\n\nTelevision writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman originally pitched \"Friends\" as a show about \"that special time in your life when your friends are your family\" to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield shortly after their short-lived sitcom \"Family Album\" was canceled by CBS. Inspired by their own experiences as young adults living in New York City, the writers loosely based the six main characters on some of their own friends and family; Monica is based on Kauffman herself. Observing that each main character was originally written as a \"one-note stereotype\", Jonathan Bernstein of \"The Daily Telegraph\" identified Monica as the group's \"uptight fun-killer\". When \"Friends\" first aired, the majority of its earliest episodes revolved around Monica, via whom each character appears to be interconnected; \"Friends\" stars the character's brother, her best friend, her former roommate and her two neighbors socializing in Monica's apartment.\n\nIn the pilot, Monica is dumped almost immediately after sleeping with her new date Paul on the night of their first date. Monica is tricked into bed with him after Paul lies to her about his sex life, falsely alleging that he has not slept with anyone in the two years since his wife left him. At first, NBC executives worried that audiences would react to Monica's role unfavorably, thus they decided to survey the studio audience and ask them whether or not they thought that having Monica sleep with someone on their first date made her character too promiscuous. Don Ohlmeyer, then-president of NBC's west coast division, was particularly adamant about his stance against Monica's role in the pilot, which he considered \"casual sex\", and created a \"stacked\" questionnaire asking audience members if they thought Monica was a whore. Kauffman recalled Ohlmeyer specifically expressing that Monica deserved to be dumped, a statement by which the writer was greatly offended, dismissing Ohlmeyer as a misogynist. Ultimately, the results returned in favor of Monica; audiences liked the character nonetheless, and the episode aired unchanged.\n\nEarly in the series, Monica's apartment is established as one of the show's two primary locations. In the pilot, the apartment number is 5, which was changed to 20 in subsequent episodes after the writers determined that Monica actually lived on a much higher floor. Season three's \"The One Where No One's Ready\" takes place entirely in Monica's apartment because the show's budget was not large enough to accommodate additional sets or guest stars at that time. In the series finale, Phoebe certifies that each character shared Monica's apartment at least one point during their lives.\n\nAndrew Harrison of \"The New Republic\" believes that the writers deliberately broke up any main character who was approaching a borderline life-changing relationship because \"The ones the Friends were really meant to be with were, after all, the other Friends\". Because Monica and Joey were initially conceived as the show's two most sexual characters, Crane and Kauffman had originally intended for them to be the show's main couple, before ultimately replacing them with Ross and Rachel. The idea of Monica and Joey was abandoned once the role of Joey was cast; actor Matt LeBlanc approached his character using much more of a \"big brother vibe\" in terms of Joey's relationship with Cox's character as opposed to a romantic one, which the writers ultimately preferred. According to Allison Piwowarski of Bustle, Monica and Joey's relationship would have greatly altered the trajectory of the entire series, having life-changing effects on its characters. Summarizing the role of Monica in the series, Martin Gitlin wrote in his book \"The Greatest Sitcoms of All Time\" that while her friends \"were ... just out to make the most of their social lives\", Monica \"sought to keep the others in line\" while searching for \"Mr. Right\", who surprisingly turns out to be close friend Chandler. Several years before Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, Cox once joked in an interview that if her character were to ever have sex with another main character, it would most likely be Chandler. Crane and Kauffman had never intended to pair off Monica and Chandler with each other, and only decided to expand upon the idea of a relationship between the two friends upon realizing that viewers had \"fallen in love\" with the notion of Monica and Chandler as a couple. According to Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\", \"Their affair came out of the blue and was supposed to quickly return there — but something in the relationship clicked with viewers.\" The idea of Monica and Chandler's romantic arc originally surfaced much earlier in the series from writers Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan, who first observed the characters' chemistry in the season two episode \"The One Where Ross Finds Out\", in which an idle and unemployed Monica is temporarily acting as Chandler's personal trainer. However, Silveri's suggestion was initially vetoed by the other writers, who felt that it was simply too soon to introduce another main couple to \"Friends\" having just recently paired off Ross and Rachel. Following Ross and Rachel's break up in season three, the writers felt that the timing was just about right to officially introduce Monica and Chandler as a couple, deciding that \"Friends\" \"can't simply rest on this one [Ross and Rachel] relationship\", while believing that Monica and Chandler's would ultimately provide a fun opportunity for the writers to explore brand new storylines.\n\nSilveri and Goldberg-Meehan deliberately intended to keep Monica and Chandler's union \"low-key\" in order to further differentiate it from Ross and Rachel's, which had been very public. In order to get an idea how audiences would react to Monica and Chandler hooking up at Ross and Emily's wedding in London, the scene in which a clearly nude Monica suddenly emerges from under the sheets of Chandler's hotel bed was filmed in front of three separate test audiences, each of whom responded very enthusiastically to the surprise, several months before the episode was actually taped. Despite the warm reception received from the audience, Silveri and Goldberg-Meehan were at first uncertain as to whether or not they should continue expanding upon their relationship even further, and proceeded with caution by having Monica and Chandler initially keep their relationship hidden from their peers. Protective of their characters, Cox and Perry shared similar hesitations at first, but ultimately grew to accept Monica and Chandler as a couple. The characters' relationship is eventually revealed to their friends in the episode \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\". While each character very much approves of their union, Monica's parents initially resent their daughter's feelings for Chandler due to an age-old misunderstanding involving Chandler.\n\nBianco observed that \"On most shows, linking two main characters like Monica and Chandler would have been an act of desperation.\" However, \"On \"Friends\", it was a stroke of genius that made both characters more appealing while providing a needed diversion from the show's central task: Retaining a romantic equilibrium between Ross and Rachel.\" Monica and Chandler's relationship is the antithesis of Ross and Rachel's because it remained \"healthy and strong until the series ended\", while the other couple was relentlessly on-and-off. \"Encyclopedia of Television\" author Horace Newcomb believes that Monica's feelings for Chandler are responsible for curing the latter's fear of commitment. Similarly, \"Slate\" writer Ruth Graham observed that \"Chandler is painted as a self-loathing loser with women, until he finally snags Monica at the end of Season 4.\" Meanwhile, Silveri believes that \"Friends\" ultimately ran as long as it did due in part to Monica and Chandler's romance, explaining, \"if the center of \"Friends\" had remained Ross and Rachel, you would've seen a much shorter shelf life for the show\"; Monica and Chandler's arc is believed to have extended the series by approximately three years. Crane and Kauffman had always intended to give Monica and Chandler a child. When it finally came time for them to write the finale, the idea of the couple adopting newborn twins was conceived at the last minute simply \"for fun\". The birth of Monica and Chandler's twins serves as one of the finale's main plots. They were named Jack and Erica – after Monica's father and their birth mother, respectively. – The twins are born three minutes and forty-six seconds apart. Although the surprise addition of Monica and Chandler's twins was generally well received, critics questioned the fact that the babies are brought home from the hospital the same day as their delivery\n\nMonica is portrayed by American actress Courteney Cox. Crane and Kauffman had originally written the role of Monica for comedian Janeane Garofalo, their first choice, because they were attracted to her \"edgier and snarkier\" voice. However, Garofalo ultimately turned down the offer. Actress Jami Gertz was also offered the role but declined, while actress Leah Remini auditioned for Monica before ultimately being cast as Carrie Heffernan in the sitcom \"The King of Queens\" in 1998; Remini would eventually guest star in an episode of \"Friends\". Before being cast as Monica in \"Friends\", Cox was best known for appearing in singer Bruce Springsteen's \"Dancing in the Dark\" music video; within the television industry for her recurring role as Lauren Miller, Alex P. Keaton's girlfriend, on the sitcom \"Family Ties\"; and Melissa Robinson in the comedy film \"\" (1994), opposite Jim Carrey. After guest starring on the sitcom \"Seinfeld\" as Meryl, main character Jerry Seinfeld's girlfriend, the producers offered Cox the role of Monica's spoiled best friend Rachel because the actress \"had this cheery, upbeat energy\", which was significantly different than how they had envisioned Monica at the time. Feeling she was not \"quirky\" enough to portray Rachel, Cox lobbied in favor of playing Monica instead because she was drawn to the character's \"strong\" personality, but the producers feared that she was not \"tough\" enough for the role, which was offered to actress Jennifer Aniston, alongside whom Cox would eventually co-star. Meanwhile, a close competitor for the role was actress Nancy McKeon; Littlefield recalled having greatly enjoyed both actress' auditions equally, and left the final decision up to Crane and Kauffman. Ultimately, Cox won the role over McKeon because the creators noticed \"something fresh\" in her audition; Kauffman elaborated that Cox ultimately \"brought a whole bunch of other colors\" to Monica than what they had first envisioned back when they were considering Garofalo for the part. Meanwhile, Aniston ultimately won the role of Rachel.\nEach main cast member auditioned for \"Friends\" having had some degree of prior sitcom experience. Before finally being cast in \"Friends\", Cox's burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her physical appearance. Unlike her previous roles in projects such as \"Family Ties\" and \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\", the \"Los Angeles Times\" Steve Weinstein believes that Monica was the first major role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty. Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom \"The Trouble with Larry\", which she considers to be the first time she played a character who \"was the funny one\", which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for \"Friends\" following its cancellation. When \"Friends\" premiered, Cox was the show's most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show's star, despite Crane and Kauffman's efforts to promote \"Friends\" as an ensemble comedy. According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work together as a team. As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other's ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her \"If I could do anything funnier\". Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member. Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode. At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied, temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts. The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode, making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.\n\nCox was 30 years old at the time she was cast, making her the show's second oldest main cast member, and was 39 by the beginning of \"Friends\" final season. Additionally, this distinction makes Cox older than her on-screen brother, actor David Schwimmer, who portrays her older brother Ross, who is one year her senior. The actress would deliver Monica's lines emphatically. Although each character is depicted as an avid coffee drinker, spending much of their free time in a coffee house, Cox herself does not drink coffee, and was only pretending to drink it out of mugs on the show. Kauffman believes that Cox's own cleanliness closely resembles her character's; at times the actress would clean her co-stars' dressing rooms. Cox also shares the character's motherly nature. The actress enjoyed portraying Monica she was able to \"bring more of my own personality to her, and I've never really been able to do that before.\" Starpulse.com observed that \"As Monica, Cox never quite enjoyed the sort of watercooler storylines that co-star ... Jennifer Aniston had with David Schwimmer as the on-again, off-again Rachel and Ross.\" At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to accept the role of Monica over Rachel due to the character's lack of strong storylines; she eventually relented once Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, thus her character's storylines gradually began to improve.\n\nCox married actor David Arquette in 1999 while the show was on hiatus between seasons five and six, hence the actress legally changed her full name to Courteney Cox Arquette. The opening credits of the season six premiere \"The One After Vegas\" features an inside joke in which Cox's new surname \"Arquette\" is attached to the surnames of each cast and crew member. The episode is dedicated to Cox and Arquette, reading, \"For Courteney and David, who did get married.\" Before marrying Cox, Arquette had guest starred in an episode of \"Friends\" as Phoebe's love interest. During season 10, Cox got pregnant with her and Arquette's child. At that same time, her character and on-screen husband were going through the process of adopting a child. Like Monica and Chandler, Cox and Arquette had also struggled with conceiving in real life. Although Kudrow's real-life pregnancy had successfully been written into the show, the same could not have been done for Cox because \"Friends\" had already long-established that Monica is incapable of having children. Therefore, the crew attempted to conceal Cox's pregnancy using a combination of baggy, loose-fitting costumes and props instead. However, at times the actress' growing belly was still detectable by viewers in spite of the crew's best efforts.\n\nAt the beginning of season one, Monica is 25 years old. Rita Loiacono of SheKnows Media believes that Monica is the show's most fully realized character from the very beginning of the series because her \"quirks were developed to a tee.\" Like several strong female sitcom characters who were popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Monica possesses a natural maternal instinct, constantly \"vocalising a desire for motherhood.\" As the group's \"unofficial den mother,\" Monica occupies the role of their mother hen, and is thus often perceived as the most level-headed member of the sextet, with Ken Parish Perkins of the \"Chicago Tribune\" identifying Monica as the show's most grounded character. Jill O'Rourke of Crushable described her as \"the glue that held the group together.\" Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" believes that Monica serves as \"the solid center in a circle of wacky pals\" due to her \"sunny\" personality, combined with the fact that she maintains a secure job while appearing to possess the most common sense. Furthermore, Tucker identified Monica as the show's \"straight woman.\" Writing for \"The New York Times\", John J. O'Connor believes that Monica exhibits \"the strongest ties to reality\" as the sitcom's most realistically portrayed character. Bustle's James Tison agreed that Monica is the show's most relatable character. Referring to Monica as one-half of the series' \"head friends,\" the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's\" Robert Bianco described the character as sensible, explaining that both her and brother Ross represent \"the relatively stable centers around which the other friends rotate.\" Describing her as \"ultra-competent,\" \"Natural Living Today\"s Emily Nussbaum likened Monica to the fairy tale character Snow White, on whose homemaking skills the five other main characters heavily rely, similar to the relationship between Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Although Monica began \"Friends\" as the show's straight person, the writers eventually made her funnier by incorporating aspects of Cox's own personality into the character, in addition to writing wittier material for her. \n\nIdentified by Ayn Bernos of \"Thought Catalog\" as \"the epitome of a ... control freak\", Refinery29's Kelsey Miller summarized Monica's personality as funny, uptight, loving, and competitive. A very organized character with a signature Type A personality who enjoys being in charge, Monica is known for being a \"neat freak\" obsessed with cleanliness – especially when it comes to maintaining the impeccable condition of her apartment – neurotic, extremely obsessive-compulsive, and competitive in nature, personality traits that are exaggerated for humor and comic relief; the writers did not begin to take full comedic advantage of Monica's neuroses until the show's first Thanksgiving episode. The character is also the loudest of her friends. In her book \"Writing With Emotion, Tension, and Conflict: Techniques for Crafting an Expressive and Compelling Novel\", author Cheryl St. John wrote that Monica exhibits qualities commonly associated with perfectionism and bossiness. James Tison of Bustle wrote that Monica's cleanliness and bossiness often relinquishes her to being \"the lame one\" among her friends, although \"she proved that sometimes rules and responsibility were important\". However, the \"Los Angeles Times\"'s Steve Weinstein observed that Monica's actions often tend to contradict her \"Miss Perfect\" image and reputation, explaining that the character frequently \"makes a fool of herself\" in addition to being \"so compulsively neat that just her facial expressions of discomfort at one of her friends' messing things up in her apartment is enough to provoke genuine chuckles.\" Although several of Monica's personality traits and mannerisms make the character a strong candidate for obsessive-compulsive disorder, they are treated as \"quirky and amusing\" as opposed to a disability or disease; her friends either ignore or find humor in her peculiarities.\n\nAs creator and writer, Kauffman confirmed that Monica's extremely organized personality is based on her own, explaining, \"I have a lot of Monica in me, in terms of everything having to be a certain way.\" Writing about the development of Monica's personality in \"USA Today\", Robert Bianco observed that the character gradually evolves from \"the caring, nurturing mother figure ... into a slightly off-the-beam benevolent monarch.\" By the show's final season, Monica's personality has been \"exacerbated for comedy\" to the point of which she becomes borderline \"cartoonish.\"\n\nMonica has a complicated relationship with her parents Jack (Elliot Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles), more-so with her mother. \"Entertainment Weekly\" referred to the character's relationship with her parents as \"esteem-sucking.\" In fact, the majority of \"Friends\" main characters have \"strained relationships\" with their parents. Described as \"hypercritical,\" Judy enjoys constantly criticizing her daughter's appearance, career, and love life, while acting much kinder towards her son, whom she favors. Chelsea Mize of Bustle wrote that Monica and Ross' \"wacky quirks become all the more understandable after ... seeing them with their parents.\" \"Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010\" author Vincent Terrance believes that Monica's competitiveness originates from having grown up with Ross as a brother, against whom she often competed as a child. Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive described Monica and Ross' relationship as \"A blend of love and sibling jealousy with an urge to irritate each other to the deepest core of existence\", with Ross often making fun of his sister's weight and Monica teasing him about his several failed marriages in return. In terms of ethnicity, Crane confirmed that both Monica and Ross are half-Jewish, with their father being Jewish and their mother being of non-Jewish European ancestry. However, \"Television's Changing Image of American Jews\" categorized Monica as a \"masked\" Jew, explaining that \"the smart, funny, and insecure Ross seems more Jewish\" than Monica, who the author dismissed as \"china-doll like\" in appearance and demeanor. In his book \"Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1\", author Stephen Harlan Norwood agrees that, unlike the show's male Jews, Monica's Jewish \"markers\" have been virtually removed.\n\nAlthough Monica and Rachel have remained best friends since high school, they are very much opposites. While both characters share similar economic backgrounds, they grew up on \"different ends of the high school social order,\" with Rachel being a popular cheerleader and Monica \"deal[ing] with body and control issues due to being an overweight child and teen.\" Sabienna Bowman of This Was TV observed that \"Monica’s struggles ultimately left her more confident than Rachel, as well as more prepared for adulthood.\" Among her defining qualities, Monica has had a passion for cooking ever since childhood, stemming from when she received her first Easy-Bake Oven. A chef, the character has had several cooking-related jobs throughout the series, having worked at five different restaurants, a trend that nearly coincides with her constant rotation of boyfriends in an ongoing search for the \"perfect match\". Michael Hogan of \"The Guardian\" believes that the character's \"competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her ideally suited to a career as a chef.\" However, her love of cooking and food is also responsible for her having been extremely overweight as a child, throughout high school and college. The running gag of an overweight Monica is often used as a recurring backstory for the character throughout the series, first explored in the second-season episode \"The One With the Prom Video\" via flashback. One of the character's childhood nicknames was \"Big Fat Goalie\" when she played field hockey. While overweight, Monica is depicted as having very low self-esteem, binge eating often, and constantly seeking attention. While in college, Monica is embarrassed into losing weight permanently after overhearing her then-crush Chandler make fun of her appearance. \"Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection: Cosmetic Surgery, Weight Loss and Beauty in Popular Culture\" author Dr. Deborah Harris-Moore believes that Monica's tendency to come off as a control freak originates from her childhood struggles with weight gain, explaining that the character ate excessively in order \"to cope with her emotions.\"\n\nPossessing a very strong will, the character tends to exhibit outstanding perseverance when it comes to what she expects out of her relationships, jobs, and life in general, oftentimes refusing to settle for anything less than what satisfies her. Early in the series, Monica develops a reputation for experiencing bad luck and encountering rather unfortunate circumstances when it comes to dating, romantic relationships, and her love life. Nick at Nite joked that the character \"likes to keep things tidy in her home and love life, although the latter is a bit more difficult.\" This motif is frequently explored as a source of comic relief; the character's friends would often \"pick apart\" her new dates and boyfriends. In his review of the series, David Hiltbrand of \"People\" referred to the character as \"an unlucky-in-love codependent,\" while the \"Chicago Tribune\"s Ken Parish Perkins observed that Monica \"often misfires when shooting for Mr. Right.\" According to Mike D'Avria of Splitsider, Monica \"never shied away from jumping into the sac with both random guys and people she worked with\" – among them a high school senior, an old high school crush, and an alcoholic – prior to dating Chandler, and of the show's six main characters maintains the highest total of serious relationships. Cox described Monica as goofy, angry, and sarcastic, while referring to her as the show's most sexually active character despite her \"goody two shoes\" image.\n\nOut of \"Friends\"' female characters, Monica's style took the longest to establish. \"InStyle\" wrote that Monica's combination of short, wavy hair and dark lipstick evoked \"a '90s take on '40s style.\" Ashley Hoffman of \"Styleite\" believes that character initially \"dressed like a tourist trying to look like a New Yorker,\" frequently sporting jeans, overalls, and cargo shorts. With a wardrobe comprised almost equally of dresses and pants, Monica's fashion sense, much like Rachel and Phoebe's, \"was a little bit normcore, a little bit corporate-casual.\"\n\nFour months before its premiere, \"Friends\" failed NBC's confidential research report, which cited the unlikeability of its six main characters as a possible factor. Although the report acknowledged Monica as the only character with whom test audiences identified somewhat positively, NBC admitted that reception towards the character was \"well below desirable levels for a lead\" nonetheless. In retrospect, \"The New Republic's\" Andrew Harrison believes that although Monica and her friends \"were superficial, self-absorbed and at first difficult to like ... in their solipsism and neurosis they reflected and sent up the world emerging around them ... far more accurately than any conventional gooey-hearted family sitcom\", ultimately \"creat[ing] a coffee-scented cocoon that millions wanted to enter\". Reviews gradually improved; an early critical evaluation of \"Friends\", which had pegged Cox as the show's star, read, \"As Monica, [Cox] came across as charming, attractive, confident, and motivated – the leader of the group\". While men found the actress attractive, women appreciated her sense of humor.\n\nWhen \"Friends\" premiered in September 1994, critics initially perceived Monica as the show's main character; \"Entertainment Weekly's\" Ken Tucker attributes this to the fact that Cox was the show's most famous cast member at the time. The actress has garnered largely positive reviews for her performance, with Tucker concluding that Cox successfully \"plays straight woman ... with alluring modesty\". Tony Scott of \"Variety\" commended the entire cast for \"appear[ing] resourceful and display[ing] sharp sitcom skills ... especially Cox\", while \"The Baltimore Sun's\" David Zurawik described her acting as \"terrific\". John Kiesewetter of \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" praised Cox's ability to \"deliver both verbal and physical comedy\". Contactmusic.com's Sophie Miskiw commended Cox for portraying Monica with \"endearing neurosis\". As a character, Lifetime described Monica as \"neurotic yet lovable\". Bustle's Emma Lord wrote, \"I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't want to be Monica Geller\", describing her as a \"smart\" and \"savvy\" character. Admitting that Monica is \"probably not our favourite character\", TalkTalk described the character as \"wonderfully neurotic\", while Nick at Nite reviewed her as \"just as lovable as she is neurotic\" despite her overbearing personality. Howard Rosenberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was receptive towards the entire cast, especially Cox and her character, both of whom he described as \"strong\" and \"likable and funny\". Also writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", Glenn Whipp lauded Cox's tenure on \"Friends\", enthusing that the actress successfully \"took a character loaded with obsessive-compulsive quirks and a goofy, overly competitive nature and fashioned a flesh-and-blood woman\". Describing the actress' comic timing as \"impeccable\", Whipp went on to write that Cox \"brought out Monica's insecurities in a way that turned self-deprecation into an art form\". Jenna Mullins of E! dubbed Cox \"a fantastic comedic actress\". Alec Harvey of \"The Birmingham News\" described Monica as a \"very, very funny\" character. Kayla Upadhyaya of \"The Michigan Daily\" appreciated the fact that \"Cox brought moments of sincerity and severity to Monica\". However, \"The Washington Post\" panned Cox's performance as \"degrading\", while Mike Ryan of ScreenCrush dismissed Monica as a \"fairly normal, but boring\" character.\n\nIn 1999, Cox was nominated for an American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Female Performer in a TV Series. Although continuously praised for her performance, Cox never received an Emmy Award nomination for her role on \"Friends\" during its entire run, although each of her five co-stars did. Both female castmates Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston remain the show's only main cast members to have won the award, whose multiple nominations Cox especially \"had a hard time not taking ... personally\", admitting to having been \"hurt\" by the snub. A number of media outlets cite Cox among several successful television actors whom they believe deserve but are yet to win an Emmy Award. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences' failure to acknowledge Cox prompted Jenna Mullins of E! to ask \"if Hollywood has something against honoring a fantastic comedic actress like Cox.\" In 2014, SheKnows Media published an article explaining five reasons author Rita Loiacono believes Monica is \"the best character on \"Friends\"\", citing her cleanliness, bluntness and role as \"the heart of the group\", among others. Loiacono enthused that Monica \"didn't just have one defining aspect; she had many, and they were all equally hilarious. Not to mention, her ambition and vulnerability resulted in some of the show's most touching and heartbreaking moments\". Additionally, Loiacono dismissed the fact that Cox has never received an Emmy Award nomination for her performance as Monica as \"downright criminal\". In 2015, HitFix wrote a similar article entitled \"5 Reasons Monica Geller is the Best \"Friends\" Friend\", published in tandem with Cox's 51 birthday. An article in \"The Birmingham News\" cited \"The One Where it All Began\", \"The One With Two Parts: Part 2\", \"The One with the Prom Video\", \"The One with Chandler in a Box\", \"The One with the Embryos\", \"The One with All the Thanksgivings\", \"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\", \"The One On the Last Night\", \"The One with the Proposal\", \"The One with Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" and \"The Last One\" among Monica's best episodes; Cox herself acknowledged \"The One with the Embryos\" as her personal favorite. Meanwhile, BDCwire ranked \"The One with the Routine\", \"The One with the Cheap Wedding Dress\", \"The One with Monica's Boots\", \"The One with the Jellyfish\" and \"The One Where Monica Sings\" among the character's best.\n\nDespite consistently warm reception towards Cox and her character, some aspects of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode \"The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies\" sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment in order to have sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book \"Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice\", author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego \"Fat Monica\" has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as \"a standard TV trope\", the \"New Statesman's\" Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica \"always struck a weird note\" with the writer despite the show's efforts \"to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character\". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, \"What does this mean for the girls like me who never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist.\" Emma Tarver of Feminspire reflected that Fat Monica \"made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at.\" Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as \"proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too\". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.\n\nWhile each main character eventually evolved into household names the longer \"Friends\" ran, the once-obscure actors by whom they were portrayed gradually established themselves as celebrities. According to \"Elle\", the combined popularity of Monica and Cox established them both as television icons during the 1990s. Additionally, baby name books now commonly associate the name \"Monica\" with the character. As the role in which Cox \"found fame\", Monica remains the actress' most iconic role to-date, as well as the part for which she remains best known. \"Us Weekly\" believes that Cox \"made television history during her 10 year stint playing Monica\". Meanwhile, Steve Weinstein of the \"Los Angeles Times\" credits Cox's comedic performance with helping disprove the stereotype that \"Pretty women aren't supposed to be funny\". In 1995, one year after \"Friends\" premiered, Cox appeared on the cover of \"People's\" \"50 Most Beautiful People\". According to \"Alabama Biographical Dictionary\" author Jan Onofrio, Monica helped \"put [Cox] in the television spotlight and provided offers for more desirable roles.\" The \"Daily News\" referred to Cox as \"one of the more successful 'Friends' since the show ended\" thanks in part to her subsequent television and film roles. According to Reed Tucker of the \"New York Post\", \"Cox has diversified perhaps more than her former co-stars\" by founding her own production company Coquette Productions, exploring directing and obtaining a real estate license. However, the actress has also been criticized for failing to venture into roles that differ from Monica. By both starring in and producing the sitcom \"Cougar Town\", which has been reviewed as the actress' \"best gig since\" ... Friends\"\", Cox became the only \"Friends\" main cast member to accomplish significant television success post-\"Friends\".\n\nAccording to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Hollywood professionals voted Monica the 47th best fictional female character. ChaCha collectively ranked Phoebe, Rachel and Monica the 11th, 12th and 13th best female television characters of all-time, respectively. Maria Tallarico of \"Cosmopolitan\" observed that a number of Monica's storylines, specifically one in which the character unintentionally has sex with a high school senior, \"probably wouldn't fly on TV today\". Writing for Mic.com, Samantha Allen believes that Monica helped \"set the standard for how sitcoms could and would talk about sex\" by both engaging in casual sex and dating a much older man. According to Dustin Levy of \"The Diamondback\", Monica inspired \"any ensemble cast in a sitcom with a female character who is bossy or neurotic,\" citing \"Scrubs\"’ Elliot Reid and \"Happy Endings\"’ Jane Kerkovich-Williams as examples of Monica's influence. Additionally, Levy identified Claire Dunphy from the sitcom \"Modern Family\" as Monica's modern-day equivalent, explaining that the character \"acts like Monica plus children\". In spring 2015, \"TV Guide\" published an article entitled \"22 Spring Cleaning Tips From Monica Geller\" in recognition of the character's cleanliness. In her article \"5 Signs You’re A Real-Life Monica Geller\", Ayn Bernos of \"Thought Catalog\" wrote that the character's personality is the reason \"all perfectionist fans of this iconic TV show have asked themselves this question at least once in their life: 'Oh my god, am I a Monica Geller?!'\" Emma Lord of \"Bustle\" expounded in her article \"13 Signs You Are The Monica Of Your Friend Group\" \"that isn't to say life is easy for the Real Life Monicas of the world. First, there's all the name calling: 'neat freak' and 'sore loser', to name a few. Second, all of your elaborate, carefully-laid plans inevitably go haywire when people around you don't respect the obvious beauty and rightness of them.\"\n\"Friends\" female characters had a profound influence on women's fashion during the 1990s, becoming household names as well as fashion icons. Monica, Rachel and Phoebe each \"became style icons for a generation of young women.\" According to Desiree Tolentino of \"Verge Campus\", \"Rachel and Monica were THE fashion icons back in the day\", writing, \"Monica Geller’s vivacious style and sex appeal inspires every girl to care just a little bit more about what they wear, even if it’s moving boxes from one apartment to the other.\" Describing Monica's wardrobe as \"classic and elegant\", \"Stylist\" observed that the character's first season bob cut was imitated by several woman, although its popularity paled in comparison to that of Aniston's iconic \"Rachel\" haircut, the widespread success of which Cox was jealous. However, \"Cosmopolitan\" identified Monica's hairstyle as \"Iconic in its own right\", including in its list of \"20 iconic Friends hairstyles\". Monica also became well known for accessorizing sweaters using scarves; on Cox's 51 birthday in 2015, \"Cosmopolitan\" published an article celebrating her character's best sweaters. BuzzFeed ranked Monica's wedding dress seventh on the website's list of the \"28 TV Show Wedding Dresses You’ll Always Envy\", while \"Brides\" ranked it the ninth greatest wedding dress in television history. \"Us Weekly\" included it on their list of \"Celebrity Wedding Dresses: TV & Movies\". Meanwhile, \"The Daily Telegraph\" cited several of Monica's outfits and hairstyles among the newspaper's list of \"Friends best fashion moments\". According to Patricia Murphy of the \"Irish Independent\", Monica \"is most definitely one of the most famous fictional telly chefs,\" expounding, \"her OCD combined with her continuous strive for perfection making her a thoroughly enjoyable watch.\" \"The Guardian\" ranked Monica fifth on the newspaper's list of \"The 10 best fictional chefs\", while \"People\" ranked the character eighth, with author Grace Gavilanes writing, \"She's the best kind of chef – neurotic in the most entertaining/productive way, and \"always\" cleans up the mess in her kitchen.\"\n\n\"USA Today\"'s Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler's relationship and their wedding in the episode \"The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding\" with saving \"Friends\". Prior to the episode, the show had \"appeared to be in serious danger of out-staying its welcome.\" Although admitting that the overall episode \"is not one of \"Friends\"' best\", Bianco explained that \"The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion.\" While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest \"Friends\" couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, \"It's hard to imagine a time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be.\" Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica's best boyfriend, awarding him an 'A' grade. Gerstenberger penned, \"I would not be able to face myself every day if I did not rank Chandler the best of Monica’s boyfriends from \"Friends.\" The two ended up getting married, which just goes to show that some one night stands are meant to last.\" Monica and Ross' relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters \"provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find a best friend in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship.\" PopSugar ranked Monica and Ross fifth on the website's list of \"The 9 Best Sibling Relationships From '90s TV\"\n\nImmediately established as one of the show's primary settings, Monica's large Greenwich Village apartment has since become one of the most famous and iconic television sets in history. Steffani Cameron of BuildDirect wrote that Monica's \"apartment was unlike anything else on TV. It was full of color, clutter, and personality. It was a space cobbled together of kitsch and class, and it was just magic\", citing its windows, color and openness among her favourite things about the apartment. \"Harper's Bazaar\" magazine ranked it among the \"12 Best Apartments on TV\". Chloe Daley of Refinery29 joked that the apartment serves as both \"a lesson in how to decorate with purple\" and \"a lesson in how \"not\" to\". Based on its total number of bedrooms, open kitchen concept, large living space and balcony, real estate agent Sydney Blumstein estimates that the apartment would be worth approximately 2.3 million in 2015. In terms of its size and affordability, the apartment has frequently been the subject of scrutiny; critics constantly question how Monica, a chef, and Rachel, a waitress, were able to afford such a luxurious home based on their relatively low incomes, often dismissing the show's explanation that this is due to an illegal sublet courtesy of Monica's grandmother who moved to Florida. Hollywood.com's Abbey Stone ranked it television's 10th \"most ridiculous\" apartment, while \"The Village Voice\" placed it at number four in a similar article.\n\n"}

The museum collection must be preserved, but it also needs to be made accessible to the public. Climate control may be very important for the objects in the collection.\n\nAn early example of architecture for a purpose-built museum is the Museum of the History of Science building in Oxford, England, originally built to house the Ashmolean Museum.\n\nIn the 20th century, museums have been combined with war memorials to serve multiple purposes. The Australian War Memorial in Canberra, for example, is a place of commemoration as well as for collection and display. It contains a museum, an archive and a shrine. It was designed by Emil Sodersten and John Crust in a contemporary neoclassical style reminiscent of Lutyens with detailing influenced by Art Deco.\n\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, USA (opened in 1959), by Frank Lloyd Wright is an important architectural landmark and icon of the 20th century. Another classic 20th century example of iconic museum architecture is the titanium-covered Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain by Frank Gehry (opened in 1997). Gehry has undertaken many major museum architecture projects, including the Experience Music Project in Seattle, USA, the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, USA, the Vitra Design Museum and MARTa Museum in Germany, and the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSuccessful examples of modern architecture being married with existing museum buildings include the Louvre Pyramid by I. M. Pei in Paris, France (1989), and more recently the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court by Norman Foster at the British Museum, London, England (2000).\n\nDavid Chipperfield designed many notable museums, including the award-winning River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, England, in 1997. This won in 1999 the RIBA \"Architecture in Arts and Leisure Award\" and the Royal Fine Art Commission Trust/British Sky Broadcasting \"Best Building Award (England)\". Chipperfield also designed the Figge Art Museum in Davenport, Iowa, USA (2005), the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany (2006), and the reconstructed Neues Museum in Berlin, Germany (2009).\n\nMuseum architecture sometimes involves the conversion of old buildings that have outlived their usefulness but that are still of historic interest. A notable example is the Dalí Theatre and Museum or the conversion of the Bankside Power Station designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott into the Tate Modern in 2000, based on design by Herzog & de Meuron. Information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary \"Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building & Tate Modern\".\n\nFinegold Alexander + Associates Inc, an architecture firm based in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, established in 1962, has undertaken museum architecture projects including Ellis Island National Monument and Museum (Associated Architects with Beyer Blinder Belle Architects) and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (Associated Architects with Pei Cobb Freed & Partners).\n\nAs well as the architects mentioned above, other architects notable for their contributions to museum architecture include:\n\n"}
{"id": "17465014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17465014", "title": "Music librarianship", "text": "Music librarianship\n\nMusic librarianship is the area of librarianship that pertains to music collections and their development, cataloging, preservation and maintenance, as well as reference issues connected with musical works and music literature. Music librarians usually have degrees in both music and librarianship (typically, a Master of Library and Information Science and at least a college-level music degree). Music librarians deal with standard librarianship duties such as cataloging and reference, but the addition of music scores and recordings to collections complicates these tasks. Therefore, music librarians generally read music and have at least a basic understanding of both music theory and music history to aid in their duties.\n\nMost early written classical music was predominantly sacred; collections of written music and literature were held by monasteries, cathedrals, and other religious establishments, such as church music societies, offices, and seminaries. As universities emerged in the 12th century, libraries formed throughout Europe, and obtained donations or gifts from monasteries and private collectors. The advent of national and centralized libraries two centuries later allowed for greater attention to special materials like music collections. Up to the end of the 15th century, music collections had been limited to religious organizations, private collectors, or small areas of university libraries. Public collections grew with the development of printing at the end of the 15th century and the surge of scholarly and artistic endeavors of the Renaissance.\n\nMusic librarianship since the Renaissance has grown alongside modern librarianship, but with more unique, dedicated facilities for materials. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the establishment of conservatories created a need for music collections that supported learning at those institutions. While the proliferation of classification schemes has given music a niche in modern public and academic collections, other institutions maintaining music-only collections have contributed to the rise of music libraries. These include conservatories, music information centers, composers' and performing rights associations, opera houses, music publishers, and media facilities involved with broadcasting and film.\n\nIn the United States, most librarianship degrees begin at the graduate level. At the undergraduate level, potential music librarians study music at any number of schools and programs (theory, history, performance, production, business and education). Following the coupling of an MLS and undergraduate music degree, many music librarians also elect to study music at the graduate level. Additionally, doctorate programs are available in both music and library science. In Masters level degrees of library science, typical music-oriented offerings examine the different materials of music collections, such as music-specific dictionaries, encyclopedias, bibliographies, indexes, and other music literature. Music librarianship offerings may also address music reference, cataloging issues, collection development and maintenance, binding and repair, preservation, evaluation methods of antiquarian material appraisal, and music librarianship education (teaching methods). Certain music librarianship areas of practice do not require a library degree- performance library management, for example.\n\nIn 1974, Music Library Association published a set of qualifications for music librarians. The “minimum qualifications expected of a beginning music librarian” were restricted to knowledge of materials and resources of the music library, general librarianship skills, and general music knowledge which states that candidates for music librarian positions should have music degrees preferably a bachelor’s and a master's degree; a master’s in library science; courses in music librarianship and/or experience working in a music library; familiarity with foreign languages, and a commitment to continued growth and education as seen through work in professional organizations, such as the Music Library Association.\n\nLibrarians usually receive on-the-job training to become familiar with the inner workings of their collections. This may include training in a particular classification scheme (such as Library of Congress Classification or ANSCR), binding procedures, or protocols regarding patron usage of materials. Additionally, many librarians elect to participate in continuing education classes and programs available through professional organizations and other outlets. For example, music librarians preparing for a large scale cataloging project might take a cataloging workshop focusing on a particular scheme or music cataloging issue. Librarians training for a position that involves a new technology might apply to classes offered by external companies in specific software or hardware.\n\nThe ultimate goal of music library education is to engender core competencies in students preparing to enter the field.\n\nThe Music Library Association maintains a list of library and information science schools that teach music librarianship or accept music credits as part of their library degree programs. Note: this list is current as of November 2011. \"Directory of Library School Offerings in Music Librarianship\"\n\n\"See Music library\"\n\nMusic librarians work with collections in a variety of settings. Music libraries take several forms, and often are maintained as a part of a larger collection or institution. \nThe nature of a music library facility depends heavily on the role of the music library within its parent institution. At academic institutions dedicated to music (such as a music conservatory), the music library may be the main library collection of the school. In colleges or universities where music is only one aspect of academic focus, the music collection may be integrated into the greater library system, or a separate collection from the main library. \nPerformance music libraries serve a unique function and are often housed with performance spaces. Entirely digital music collections require server space and proper housing of digitization equipment, although many music libraries in the process of digitization have facilities for such services. Other factors influencing facilities include the types of materials in the collection, the users who will access those materials, and budget constraints related to implementation, acquisition, maintenance, and service.\n\nMost music librarians have an array of tasks to perform, depending on the nature of their collection and position. General duties include cataloging and reference, acquisition and collection development. It is common to specialize in one or more areas of music librarianship, particularly for work in special collections.\n\nMusic materials require different cataloging methods than other fields. While music literature can be classified and cataloged following general cataloging rules that apply to all subjects, music scores and sound recordings present unique challenges of both description and access. Examples include uniform titles, responsibility (composer versus performer), and how to classify sound recordings (by genre, composer, etc.).\n\nMusic reference requires knowledge of music history, the ability to read music and have at least a basic understanding of music theory, and a strong grasp of music reference literature: dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, bibliographies and discographies, and music score formats.\nReference also necessitates adeptness with electronic resources and tools. Reading ability in German and Romance languages are practical skills to possess when working closely with western classical music. When working with non-western music, an ethnomusicology background may be essential.\n\nIn order to grow their collections, music librarians purchase books and music reference materials, subscribe to serials, order music scores and sound recordings, and buy or license electronic resources. This involves not only contact with publishers and other agencies that provide music materials, but also budgetary management of library funds.\n\nPreservation of music is the maintenance of musical compositions and preventing music from extinction.\nMusic collections require certain conditions for the preservation of printed materials. Appropriate air regulation prevents the accumulation of moisture, and materials should be protected from the possibility of water or fire damage. Music scores often need new binding either because of weak publisher bindings or due to age. Although binding is done mainly for preservation, it also to provide uniformity (binding music allows for uniform barcode or call number placement, for example). Music library staff usually allocate part of their duties to managing binding and processing of scores. Some music libraries outsource binding to professional companies, and a few music libraries have dedicated binding staff and resources.\n\nSound recordings present another level of preservation. Light protection, temperature and humidity control, and particular shelving, packaging, and cleaning procedures must be followed for proper storage for preserving physical materials. Electronic files (documents and sound recordings) require preservation, too. Migration, replication, emulation, and metadata attachment aid in preservation of digital documents.\n\n\"See Digital Preservation\"\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance music librarians act as support for performing groups by acquiring printed music and preparing it for performance. Preparation involves managing multiple parts, collating and creating folders of music for each player, and usually marking specific notes or edits in the music, such as bowing directions for string instruments. Performance libraries then store the music for future performance or return it (if the music has been rented).\n\nProduction\n\n\"See Production Music\"\n\nProduction music librarians maintain collections that own licensed music. This music is distributed on license to other institutions or performing groups for profit.\n\nAntiquarian and Rare Collections\n\nAntiquarian music collections are usually housed in very large music libraries, institutional special collections archives, or in private collections. The antiquarian trade often involves purchasing materials from private collections at auctions. Antiquarian and rare materials require extra care in handling and preservation. The age of materials can reach back several hundred years and can have considerable value.\n\nDigital Collections\n\n\"See Digital library\"\n\nDigitization is the process by which printed music or literature is converted to digital formats by a scanner. Digitization is also the process of transferring audio formats (for example, converting music on an LP record to mp3). Materials may also be born-digital; that is, created originally as a digital document or file. Many music librarians dedicate part of their duties to digitizing elements of their collection. Some libraries are entirely digital collections, and may not have physical access at all. These are usually hosted on the Internet or a network, and most often electronic access is limited to specific user groups (sometimes by subscription). Digital libraries deal with digital decay, security and access, and copyright issues involved with distributing and/or copying data to users.\n\nBecause of the nature of the materials in a music library, music librarians employ technologies related to audio delivery, access to digital material, and print music preservation and presentation.\n\nAudio collections require dependable audio-delivery systems, including headphones, receivers, and audio players (CD, DAT, phonograph, etc.). Attention is paid in particular to where listening stations are located in the library, to accommodate for noise, access to audio materials, and access to other technology like computers (especially if audio is streamed through a computer from an online digital collection). Some libraries may opt for listening stations or rooms separate from the main library area.\n\nMusic libraries that digitize parts of their collection require scanners for printed materials, and devices for transferring analog audio to digital formats. Computers are needed to control, convert, stream, store, preserve, or otherwise manipulate digitized material. Entirely digital collections involve technology for connecting users to electronic materials, usually hosted on the Internet. Information professionals involved with these projects deal with issues such as streaming, security and access, copy protection and copyright, and database management.\n\nProfessional organizations related to music librarianship include:\n\n\nAdditionally, music librarians will find support from academic and corporate institutions that offer grants, continuing education, inter-institutional cooperation (such as interlibrary loan or out-sourced services like digitization), and resources aiding in the completion of tasks in the field.\n\nCataloging concerns remain constant topics for debate in music librarianship. Digitization problems and electronic bibliographic, reference and archival tools are also at the front lines of the field as library technology moves forward. Efficiency of digitization has been increasing as library storage space has been diminishing, so more libraries are turning toward digitization not only to preserve materials in electronic formats, but also to save space. The open access movement is having an effect on music libraries, notably in subscription- or fee-based electronic services versus freely accessible electronic services.\n\nCopyright is another major issue in this field. As a score travels from the pen of a composer to the music stand of a performer, it changes many hands. Composers may copyright and even distribute their own work, but it might also be distributed by a corporate publisher. Music libraries pay for copies of works, but sometimes only rent the work through a license. Because music copyright is an intricate issue, music librarians must carefully abide by copyright guidelines, such as those noted on the Music Library Association website.\n\nMajor field publications such as \"Notes\" (the MLA's quarterly journal), as well as email listservs, forums, and presentations at meetings of professional organizations, highlight and analyze key trends in music librarianship.\n\n\n\nThis is a bibliography of resources available on music librarianship, organized by areas of practice.\n\nGeneral\n\nJones, Malcolm.

{"id": "103033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103033", "title": "Norma Rae", "text": "Norma Rae\n\nNorma Rae is a 1979 American drama film directed by Martin Ritt from a screenplay written by Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch. Based on the true story of Crystal Lee Sutton, which was told in the 1975 book \"Crystal Lee, a Woman of Inheritance\" by \"New York Times\" reporter Henry P. Leifermann, \nthe film stars Sally Field in the titular role. Beau Bridges, Ron Leibman, Pat Hingle, Barbara Baxley and Gail Strickland are featured in supporting roles.\nThe film's narrative follows Norma Rae, a factory worker from a small town in North Carolina who becomes involved in the labor union activities at the textile factory where she works after the health of her and her co-workers is compromised.\n\n\"Norma Rae\" premiered at the 32nd Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d'Or, while Field received the Prix d'interprétation féminine. The film was released theatrically on March 2, 1979, and upon its release was a critical and commercial success with critics appreciating the film's direction, screenplay, message and performances (in particular of Field's), while the film grossed $22 million on a production budget of $4.5 million.\n\nIt received six Academy Award nominations at the 52nd Academy Awards including for Best Picture, and won two: Best Actress (Field) and Best Original Song for its theme song, \"It Goes Like It Goes.\" The film was selected for preservation at the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 2011, deemed as being \"culturally, aesthetically or historically significant\".\n\nNorma Rae Wilson is a worker in a cotton mill that has taken too much of a toll on the health of her family for her to ignore their poor working conditions. She is also a single mother with two children by different fathers, one dead and the other negligent, and frequently has flings with other men to alleviate her loneliness and boredom. Initially, management tries to divert her frequent protests by promoting her to \"spot checker,\" where she is responsible for making sure other workers are fulfilling work quotas. She reluctantly takes the job for the pay hike, but when fellow employees, including her own father, shun her for effectively being a \"fink\" to the bosses, she demands to be fired. Instead, she is demoted back to the line.\n\nTwo men enter her life that change her perspective. A former co-worker, Sonny Webster, asks her out after earlier causing trouble for her at the mill. Divorced with a daughter, he proposes marriage after a short courtship; recognizing how long it has been since she met a non-selfish man to keep company with, she accepts his offer. And after a few charged encounters with a New York union organizer, Reuben Warshowsky, Norma Rae listens to him deliver a speech that spurs her to join the effort to unionize her shop. This causes conflict at home when Sonny observes she's not spending enough time in the home and is frequently exhausted when she is present. When her father drops dead at the mill, a death that could have been averted had he been allowed to leave his post early instead of wait for his allotted break, she is more determined to continue the fight.\n\nManagement retaliates against the organization efforts, first by rearranging shifts so that workers are doing more work at less pay, and then by posting fliers with racial invective in the hope of dividing white and black workers and diluting the momentum. Warshowsky demands she copy down the racist flier word for word in order to use it as evidence for government sanctions against her mill. When she attempts to transcribe the flier, management attempts to stop her, then fire her on grounds of creating a disturbance, and call the police to remove her from the plant. While awaiting the sheriff, Norma Rae takes a piece of cardboard, writes the word \"UNION\" on it, stands on her work table, and slowly turns to show the sign around the room. One by one, the other workers stop their mill machines, and eventually, the entire room becomes silent. After all the machines have been switched off, Norma Rae is taken to jail but is freed by Reuben.\n\nUpon returning home to her family, Norma decides to talk to her children and tell them the story of her life, their questionable parentage, and recent arrest, so that they are prepared for any smears that may come from those hoping to discredit her efforts. After a tense exchange with Reuben, Sonny asks her if they have been intimate; she says no, but acknowledges \"he's in my head.\" Sonny, in turn, tells her there's no other woman in his head and he will always remain with her.\n\nAn election to unionize the factory takes place, with Norma and Reuben listening as best as possible from outside the mill as reporters and TV cameras observe the vote count. With a difference shy of 100 votes, the result is a victory for the union. Shortly after, Reuben says goodbye to Norma; despite his being smitten with her throughout the movie, they only shake hands because he knows she is married and loves her husband, and Reuben heads back to New York.\n\nThe story is based on Crystal Lee Sutton's life as a textile worker in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, where the battle for the workers' union took place against a J.P. Stevens Textiles mill. Her actual protest in the mill is the scene in the film where she writes the sign \"UNION\" and stands on her worktable until all machines are silent. Although Sutton was fired from her job, the mill was unionized, and she later went to work as an organizer for the textile union.\n\n\"Norma Rae\" was filmed on location in Opelika, Alabama. The mill scenes were shot at the Opelika Manufacturing Corp., and the motel scenes were filmed at The Golden Cherry Motel.\n\nThe film \"Norma Rae\" won Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Sally Field) and Best Original Song (David Shire and Norman Gimbel for \"It Goes Like It Goes\"). It was also nominated for Best Picture and for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. The film was also nominated to the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and Field was awarded Best Actress, in Cannes, for her performance.\n\nIn 2011, \"Norma Rae\" was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\n\"Norma Rae\" was released on VHS in December 1996, on DVD in December 2006, and Blu-ray in April 2014.\n\nIn December 2017, it was announced that \"Norma Rae\" is being adapted into a stage musical. Rosanne Cash is set to compose the score.\n\n"}

{"id": "20538779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20538779", "title": "Phunk Studio", "text": "Phunk Studio\n\nPHUNK is a Singapore-based contemporary art and design collective. PHUNK was founded in 1994 by four esteemed Singaporean artists/designers of various art practices: Alvin Tan, Melvin Chee, Jackson Tan, and William Chan, who met as fellow design students at LASALLE College of the Arts.\n\nUnlike other contemporary collectives or artists, PHUNK prides itself in blurring the lines between creative processes in their works of fine art and commercial design. Strongly believing in not differentiating between art and design, PHUNK explores, expresses and communicates its ideas through different mediums. With their multitude of projects, exhibitions, and collaborations spanning across art, design, publishing, fashion, music, film and interactive art pieces, they more often than not also intentionally blur the lines and challenge conventional boundaries that separate art and design, creativity and commerce, craft and technology, east and west, fantasy and reality, control and chaos, love and hate, friendship and partnership, and audio and visual works. PHUNK designs and artworks always been greatly influenced by popular culture. The artists believe that popular culture influences and informs consumers daily and has its own unique and comprehensive visual language and iconography. Utilising popular culture's ever-evolving series of metaphors, codes, symbols and icons that are widely recognised and embraced by the masses, PHUNK prides itself in experimenting with contexts and visual symbols in their works to create a unique visual language and system.\n\nPHUNK's main access of inspiration and outlet of work is through visuals, information and cultural influences within our their collective interests and backgrounds. As kids, the artists started out as avid collectors and junkies of popular culture paraphernalia, the influences of which have since been a recurring theme in their work. Always returning to and remembering their roots, the artists were born in the '70s, the golden era of television, movies and pop culture. Even in their current works, allusions to influences kids, they grew up having grown up watching plenty of film and television, including popular Hong Kong kung fu movies, Cantonese TV series, Japanese cartoon animes, and American TV programmes. It was also the beginning of the Hollywood blockbuster era. They also read a lot of comic books ranging from Japanese manga, and American Superhero comics from DC and Marvel. As teenagers in the '80s, they were fascinated by British indie pop and new wave music, as well as American rock music and MTV. Upon entering art college in the '90s, they were heavily influenced by various art and design movements such as the Bauhaus, Fluxus, Situationism, Pop Art, Swiss Modernist and Postmodernist design. Nowadays, they are influenced and informed by travels to different parts of the world and meeting fellow creatives who share their interests and love for everything pop culture.\n\nPHUNK was founded in 1994 but first and foremost born of friendship and common loves. Alvin, Melvin, Jackson, and William met as fellow design students studying Visual Communications at LASALLE College of the Arts in Singapore. \n\nIn 1995 to 1997, the artists served their time doing National Service. The four served the mandatory two years as full-time Military Policemen under the Singapore Armed Forces. It was also during these years that they found time to experiment, jam, and create visual works in Jack's home over the weekends. Having realised they shared many common interests, ranging from old Hong Kong kungfu TV serials, Chinese mythology and Japanese manga, to British indie music, American pop culture, pretty girls, alcohol, and parties, the group started out trying to start a band. Their musical ventures were discontinued shortly after, but soon other modes of artistic expressions were born. The artists then proceeded to create visuals and graphics on the iMac in Jackson’s bedroom and sent these graphics out to friends and family. It was in these years too that they founded 'Guerilla Fonts' to create original digital typeface designs. These typeface designs were then sent to David Carson's Garage Fonts, Del Mar, California. Shortly after, in 1998 Garage Fonts officially distributed Guerilla Fonts' original typeface designs worldwide. PHUNK was then invited to write the introduction for the book, 'New Typographics 2', published by Japanese publishers, PIE books. Thereafter, the artists founded and launched 'Trigger' Magazine, of which 20,000 copies snapped out within a week. PHUNK also begun organising themed parties with Zouk, and the launch of ‘Trigger’ was cited as one of the top 10 Zouk parties of all time. PHUNK started long-standing working relationship with MTV Asia in 1999, and many of their works went on to win awards in various award shows. In the design sphere, PHUNK also created Phiz dingbats, marking the start of the collective's unique illustration style.\n\n2000 marked the start of a series of milestones for PHUNK. PHUNK has bagged numerous design awards and recognitions both locally and internationally such as: Finalist, Macromedia International Type Design (1998), Finalist, Apple Design Competition (1998), Selected, American Center of Design - The 100 Show (2000), Finalist, D&AD (2001), Finalist, One Show (2001), Finalist, Creative Circle Awards (2002), Merit, Singapore Design Awards (2002), Best of Show, Singapore Design Awards (2004), Best Visual Arts & Best Of Show, Singapore StreetStyle Awards (2005). PHUNK has repeatedly been awarded by PROMAX ASIA, emerging with Gold and Silver medals in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. PHUNK was also awarded the ‘Designer of the Year’ at the President’s Design Awards 2017 in Singapore, making history as the youngest ever recipient of the award, the highest Singapore design accolade that can be attained. \n\n2011 marked a new era for the collective after a disastrous fire occurred during the moving of PHUNK's studio from Lasalle to Tanjong Katong destroyed everything in the studio. Initially identified as ':phunk', or 'Phunk Studio', the collective then officially changed its name to what we now still know as 'PHUNK'.\n\nThe collective subsequently went on to participate in various art shows locally, regionally, and internationally, as well as make their mark in the international design community through various collaborations and art shows.\nPHUNK's body of work includes visual art and design pieces as well as installations. It involves the use of various mediums ranging from silkscreen prints, mixed media pieces and sculptures to the use of acrylic, wood, and vinyl figurines.\n\nPHUNK has worked with brands such as Nike, Nokia, MTV, Daimler Chrysler, Comme des Garçons, Levi's, and Tiger Beer. One of their artworks, \"Electricity\", was cited in the book \"Graphic Design, A New History\" as \"Instances of truly global graphic design.\" They were awarded \"Designer of the Year\" in 2007 at the Singapore President's Design Award, the nation's highest accolade, for their significant achievements and contributions to design.\n\nThe Singapore History Museum hosted their 10-year retrospective exhibition, \"A Decade of Decadence\", in 2005. PHUNK is a regular contributor of Singapore's ARTSTAGE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5210080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5210080", "title": "Post-postmodernism", "text": "Post-postmodernism\n\nPost-postmodernism is a wide-ranging set of developments in critical theory, philosophy, architecture, art, literature, and culture which are emerging from and reacting to postmodernism. Another similar recent term is metamodernism.\n\nMost scholars would agree that modernism began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century. Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on \"radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness\" as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.\n\nPostmodernism arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with totalitarianism or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of Jorge Luis Borges. However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s. Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels, a metaphysical skepticism or nihilism towards a \"grand narrative\" of Western culture, a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes) and a \"waning of affect\" on the part of the subject, who is caught up in the free interplay of virtual, endlessly reproducible signs inducing a state of consciousness similar to schizophrenia.\n\nSince the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism \"has gone out of fashion.\" However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.\n\nConsensus on what constitutes an era can not be easily achieved while that era is still in its early stages. However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern irony. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.\n\nIn 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner Tom Turner issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning. Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of “anything goes” and suggests that “the built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.” In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect Christopher Alexander, gestalt psychology and the psychoanalyst Carl Jung’s concept of archetypes. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to “embrace post-Postmodernism – and pray for a better name.”\n\nIn his 1999 book on Russian postmodernism the Russian-American Slavist Mikhail Epstein suggested that postmodernism “is […] part of a much larger historical formation,” which he calls “postmodernity.” Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix \"trans-\":\nAs an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet Timur Kibirov.\n\nThe term \"post-millennialism\" was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist Eric Gans to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with \"victimary thinking,\" which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of Auschwitz and Hiroshima. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to \"non-victimary dialogue\" that will \"diminish […] the amount of resentment in the world.\" Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet \"Chronicles of Love and Resentment\" and the term is allied closely with his theory of generative anthropology and his scenic concept of history.\n\nIn his 2006 paper The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond, the British scholar Alan Kirby formulated a socio-cultural assessment of post-postmodernism that he calls “pseudo-modernism.” Kirby associates pseudo-modernism with the triteness and shallowness resulting from the instantaneous, direct, and superficial participation in culture made possible by the internet, mobile phones, interactive television and similar means: \"In pseudo-modernism one phones, clicks, presses, surfs, chooses, moves, downloads.\"\n\nPseudo-modernism's \"typical intellectual states\" are furthermore described as being \"ignorance, fanaticism and anxiety\" and it is said to produce a \"trance-like state\" in those participating in it. The net result of this media-induced shallowness and instantaneous participation in trivial events is a \"silent autism\" superseding \"the neurosis of modernism and the narcissism of postmodernism.\" Kirby sees no aesthetically valuable works coming out of \"pseudo-modernism.\" As examples of its triteness he cites reality TV, interactive news programs, \"the drivel found […] on some Wikipedia pages\", docu-soaps, and the essayistic cinema of Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock. In a book published in September 2009 titled \"Digimodernism: How New Technologies Dismantle the Postmodern and Reconfigure our Culture\", Kirby developed further and nuanced his views on culture and textuality in the aftermath of postmodernism.\n\nIn 2010 the cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker introduced the term metamodernism as an intervention in the post-postmodernism debate. In their article 'Notes on metamodernism' they assert that the 2000s are characterized by the emergence of a sensibility that oscillates between, and must be situated beyond, modern positions and postmodern strategies. As examples of the metamodern sensibility Vermeulen and van den Akker cite the 'informed naivety', 'pragmatic idealism' and 'moderate fanaticism' of the various cultural responses to, among others, climate change, the financial crisis, and (geo)political instability.\n\nThe prefix 'meta' here refers not to some reflective stance or repeated rumination, but to Plato's \"metaxy\", which intends a movement between opposite poles as well as beyond.\n\n\n"}

Her parents had six relationships between them, which gave her four sisters and five brothers, including fellow actresses Holly Davidson and Jade Davidson; primary school teacher Jessi Frost, brothers called Gabriel Jupiter and Tobias Vaughan; and a sister named Sunshine Purple Tara Velvet.\n\nFrost appeared in a Jelly Tots advertisement in 1968 at age three and appeared with Morecambe and Wise in 1970 at age five. She attained a scholarship to the Italia Conti Academy, but after an early eating disorder, she gave up acting at 13 and attended Hampstead School instead. On graduation, she left home to escape her parents, and in 1984, at age 19, she appeared in the play \"Mumbo Jumbo\" at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, directed by Nicholas Hytner.\n\nAs an actress, Frost has performed in \"Press Gang\" and \"Casualty\". Her first film role was in \"Empire State\" (1987), although her most memorable film appearance is as vampire Lucy Westenra in Francis Ford Coppola's \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\" (1992). She earned her living mainly through appearing in music videos, including for Pulp's song \"Common People\", Planet Perfecto featuring Grace's \"Not Over Yet '99\", and various productions for Spandau Ballet, where she met first husband Gary Kemp. Frost and Kemp appeared together in the film \"The Krays\" (1990). They appeared in two more films together. One of these films, \"Magic Hunter\" (1994), required them to participate in a love scene, although they were separated at the time.\n\nFrost took a role opposite Jude Law in Paul W. S. Anderson's directorial debut \"Shopping\". After marrying Law and having three children with him, she cut down on her acting commitments in the late 1990s, and moved into producing and co-founding the production company Natural Nylon.\n\nIn 1999, Frost co-founded the fashion label Frost French with her friend Jemima French. The label started in lingerie and expanded into clothing collections. Frost French won \"Elle\"s Designers of the Year Award 2004. In 2004, she wrote, presented, and produced a short-lived series \"What Sadie did next...\" for E4, and in 2005 appeared in \"Eating with...Sadie Frost\" on BBC2. In March 2006, Frost flew to South Africa to part-fund an orphanage for the \"Homes of Hope\" project. In September 2006, aged 41, she posed nude for Canadian photographer Bryan Adams for a PETA anti-fur advert to coincide with London Fashion Week. In 2009, she made her West End debut in \"Touched ... For the Very First Time\", a new one-woman show by Zoë Lewis, directed by Douglas Rintoul and produced by Imogen Lloyd Webber.\n\nIn January 2010, Frost starred in the play \"Fool for Love\" alongside Carl Barat, formerly of The Libertines.

The lion in the foreground is part of the traditional iconography of St. Jerome, and near it is a sleeping dog, an animal found frequently in Dürer's works, symbolizing loyalty. Both creatures are part of Jerome's story in the \"Golden Legend\" (c. 1260), which contained fanciful hagiographies of saints.\n\n\"St. Jerome in His Study\" is often considered as part of a group of three Dürer engravings, the other two being the well-known \"Melencolia I\" (1514) and \"Knight, Death and the Devil\" (1513). Together they have been viewed as representing the three spheres of activity recognized in medieval times: \"Knight, Death, and the Devil\" belongs to the moral sphere and the \"active life\"; \"Melencolia I\" represents the intellectual; and \"St. Jerome\" the theological and contemplative life.\n\nThe composition is intimate, but the viewer has difficulty locating himself in relation to the picture's space. Thomas Puttfarken suggests that while the scene is very close to the observer, Dürer did not intend the viewer to feel present: \"the intimacy is not ours, but the saint's as he is engrossed in study and meditation\" (94). Art historian Erwin Panofsky comments on the perspective:\n\nThe position of the sight point, quite far off centre, strengthens the impression of a representation determined not by the objective law of the architecture but by the subjective standpoint of the spectator who is just entering – a representation which owes to precisely this perspective arrangement a large part of its peculiarly 'intimate' effect. (Qtd. in Puttfarken, 94)\n\nUsing a dried gourd hanging from the rafters, Dürer memorializes Jerome's courage, in the face of a long brewing philological controversy with St. Augustine in his preference for Greek over Latin nomenclature for the fast-growing plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון (qiyqayown) encountered only this once, in the Book of Jonah. The Old Testament text closes abruptly () with an epistolary warning based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized widely in certain collections of Aesop's fables such as The Gourd and the Palm-tree. Jerome elected to use Hedera (from the Greek, meaning ivy) over the more common Latin cucurbita from which the related English plant name \"cucumber\" is derived, perhaps to avoid confusion while making a more perfect analogy to the typology of Christ . In fact Augustine's view had already prevailed by Dürer's time.\n\n"}

It notes that most of the women had never been in industry before, and were unfamiliar with the terminology and mores common to the plant. Each thing had to be broken down and explained in detail. The film also reminds men that women of the day have been at work in things like knitting and sewing, and that these skills could be appropriated for war work. In a short vignette the foreman returns home to his wife, complaining about all the women asking for time off. His wife then tells him she had to cook, clean, and take care of the children all day, at which point the foreman realizes that women really work two jobs, one in the factory and the other at home.\n\nIn another vignette a foremen gets into an argument about a woman not wearing a protective hat, and it is shown that he has to explain to her why the protective cap was necessary. Finally, there are four basic rules to supervising women workers:\n\nList of Allied propaganda films of World War II\n\n"}

Influenced by Avicenna's works, he wrote this book presenting the basic theories of Philosophy. In this book, he explained in detail about what philosophy is and described basic entities like judgement, concept, premise, and logic. Al-Ghazali stated that one must be well versed in the ideas of the philosophers before setting out to refute their ideas. He also stated that he did not find other branches of philosophy including physics, logic, astronomy or mathematics problematic.\nAfter writing \"Maqasid al Falasifa\", he wrote another book Tahāfut al-Falāsifa, criticizing the Avicennian school of early Islamic philosophy.\n\nThis book was influential in Europe and was one of the first to be translated from Arabic to Latin (12th century). The book is also translated into Hebrew and English.\n\n"}

The Romanesque apse, chancel and nave formed the original building while the tower and porch were added in the Late-Gothic period and the north wing was completed in 1656.\n\nThe church was dedicated to St Peter, probably in 1345. King Christopher of Bavaria transferred ownership to Maribo Abbey as first documented in 1451. That ownership remained after the Reformation when Maribo became a convent for women. After a period of ownership by Christian IV's Sorø Academy until its closure in 1665, the church came under the Crown until 1687. It was then transferred to Eggert Christopher von Knuth (1643-1697). As a result, it came under the County of Knuthenborg on its formation in 1714 where it remained until it became independent in 1911. In 1881, Bandholm Parish was separated from Østofte after a new church was built in Bandholm.\n\nThe apse, chancel and nave of this red-brick church were built in the Romanesque period, while the tower with its pyramidal spire and the porch were added at the beginning of the 15th century in the Gothic style. The north wing was completed in 1656. The Romanesque sections are decorated with corner lesenes and are topped with saw-tooth friezes. The round-arched windows have either been enlarged or bricked in. Thin vertical blank windows decorate the top of the tower.\n\nIn the 14th century, star-shaped vaults were completed in the chancel and nave while the apse retained its half dome. The altarpiece, dated 1674, is rather unsophisticated baroque although the scenes in the central panel of the Last Supper and the Resurrection are somewhat earlier. The pulpit in the auricular style (c. 1650) presents cartouches of Faith, Hope and Charity.\n\nInvestigations in 1908 revealed frescos in the chancel and apsis from two periods, c. 1300 and c. 1400. The latter are mostly well preserved with scenes from the Creation including images of Adam and Eve, the Judgment of Christ as well as several dragons.\n\n"}
