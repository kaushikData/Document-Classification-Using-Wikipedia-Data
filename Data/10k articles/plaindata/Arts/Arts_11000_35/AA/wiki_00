This consumption includes streaming and song downloads in addition to traditional album sales. The album-equivalent unit was introduced in the mid-2010s as an answer to the drop of album sales in the 21st century. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry. For instance, the only albums that went platinum in the United States in 2014 were the \"Frozen\" soundtrack and Taylor Swift's \"1989\", whereas several artists did in 2013.\n\nThe usage of the album-equivalent units revolutionized the charts from the \"best-selling albums\" ranking into the \"most popular albums\" ranking. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) have used album-equivalent unit to measure their Global Recording Artist of the Year since 2013.\n\nBeginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart revised its ranking methodology with album-equivalent unit instead of pure album sales. With this overhaul, the \"Billboard\" 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by Nielsen SoundScan) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play and Xbox Music. Known as TEA (track equivalent album) and SEA (streaming equivalent album) when originally implemented, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album were treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. \"Billboard\" continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called Top Album Sales, that maintains the traditional \"Billboard\" 200 methodology, based exclusively on Nielsen SoundScan's sales data. Taylor Swift's \"1989\" was the first album to top the chart with this methodology, generating 339,000 album-equivalent units (281,000 units came from pure album sales). On the February 8, 2015 issue, \"Now That's What I Call Music! 53\" became the first album in history to miss the top position of the \"Billboard\" 200 despite being the best-selling album of the week. \n\nIn July 2018, Billboard and Nielsen revised the ratios used for streaming equivalent album units to account for the relative value of streams on paid music services like Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited versus ad-supported music and video platforms such as Spotify's free tier and YouTube. Under the updated album equivalent ratios, 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams are equal to one album unit.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Official Charts Company has included streaming into the UK Albums Chart since March 2015. The change was decided after the massive growth of streaming; the number of tracks streamed in the UK in a year doubled from 7.5 billion in 2013 to just under 15 billion in 2014. Under the new methodology, Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed tracks from an album, with the top two songs being given lesser weight so that the figure will reflect the popularity of the album as a whole rather than of one or two successful singles. The adjusted total is divided by 1000 and added to the album sales figure. Sam Smith's \"In the Lonely Hour\" was the first album to top the chart with this rule. Out of its 41,000 album-equivalent units, 2,900 units came from streaming and the rest were pure sales. By the end of 2017, The BPI reported that streaming now accounts for over half of music consumption in the UK (50.4%).\n\nIn Germany, streaming began to be included on the albums chart since February 2016. Nevertheless, German Albums Chart is used to ranking the albums based on weekly revenue, instead of units. Hence, only paid streaming is counted and should be played at least 30 seconds. At least 6 tracks of one album have to be streamed to make streams count for the album, with 12 tracks being the maximum counted. Similar to the UK chart rule, the actual streams of the top-two songs are not counted, but instead the average of the following tracks.\n\nIn Forbes.com, Hugh McIntyre noted that the usage of album equivalent units has made artists release albums with excessive track lists. Brian Josephs from \"Spin\" said: \"If you’re a thirsty pop artist of note, you can theoretically game the system by packing as many as 20 tracks into an album, in the process rolling up more album-equivalent units—and thus album \"sales\"—as listeners check the album out.\" He also criticized Chris Brown's album \"Heartbreak on a Full Moon\" which contains over 40 songs.\n\n"}

Lundin began writing title cards when title cards first came to Sweden in 1919, several years after using title cards became common practice in the Hollywood film industry. Lundin has been regarded as a leader in the writing of title cards.\n\nBorn in Kvillinge, Östergötland in 1889, Lundin moved to Stockholm after the death of her father. From 1904 to 1906, Lundin attended the female section of Tekniska Skolan, later renamed the University College of Arts, Crafts, and Design, where she studied a variety of drawing and design techniques. This was during a time when attending art school as a woman in Sweden was an accepted but uncommon occurrence. Following her studies, Lundin worked as an illustrator and calligrapher at AB Hasse W. Tullberg. It is likely here that she would have met Sven Lundin, who she married in 1915. After their marriage, the couple started their own business called Lundins Ritbyrå (Lundin’s Drawing Company). Sven worked as the administrator while Alva worked as the artist.\n\nThe transition to the use of title cards has been regarded as what ultimately elevated films from the status of primitivity, contributing what Katherine Nagels called \"key visuotextual elements\". Lundin's career as a title card writer (1919-1960) has been identified as beginning with the film \"Sir Arne's Treasure\" (\"Herr Arnes pengar\") in 1919 with Svensk Filmindustri. Her success in that role lead to her continuance with Svensk Filmindustri with increased responsibilities in the making of the 1920 film \"Erotikon\". Lundin's title cards followed the popularly used sequence for title cards of the time, and yet her work has been regarded as prolific, and she herself as the \"Nestor of Swedish film calligraphers\". The effectiveness of Lundin's title cards have been regarded as contributing significantly to the viewers understanding, while simultaneously enhancing the humour of the film. In 1924, \"Filmnyheter\" proclaimed Lundin to be \"the only [Swedish] film title specialist\", a remarkable title to hold as a woman during a period when her presence in the industry was an anomaly. Women artists in Sweden who were able to support themselves with their art were generally illustrators for children's books.\n\nIn 1927 Lundin began signing her cards AL. Over her forty year career, Lundin was credited as the title designer for 16 films, and contributed to nearly 500 films overall. \n"}

The nonfiction book recounts a double murder on Palmyra Atoll; the subsequent arrest, trial and conviction of Duane (\"Buck\") Walker; and the acquittal of his girlfriend, Stephanie Stearns, whom Bugliosi and Leonard Weinglass defended. The book went to No. 1 on \"The New York Times\" hardcover bestseller list in March 1991 and is still in print as a trade paperback and ebook.\n\nIn 1974, a yachting couple from San Diego, California, Malcolm \"Mac\" Graham III, 43, and Eleanor LaVerne \"Muff\" Graham, 40, sailed a 38-foot ketch to Palmyra Atoll — 1,200 miles south of Honolulu — hoping to find it deserted and to pass an idyllic year or more there. The wealthy Grahams overcame their disappointment at finding other sailors already on Palmyra, including two male Canadian scientists. The couple found the two men amiable and intelligent, and stayed.\n\nAlso on Palmyra were Wesley G. Walker (a.k.a. Buck Walker) and Stephanie Stearns (referred to as \"Jennifer Jenkins\" in the book), who had sailed there together from Hawaii on Stearns' sailing vessel \"Iola\", a deteriorating, patched-together wooden sloop that lacked a reliable auxiliary engine. In contrast, the Grahams' ketch, the \"Sea Wind\", was beautifully finished and impeccably outfitted, with an onboard machine shop equipped with a lathe and acetylene welding torch.\n\nWalker was an ex-convict fleeing a drug possession charge and had come up with the idea of growing cannabis on Palmyra to support himself. The Grahams were a happily married couple touring the world, and Mr. Graham ran his business remotely. The Grahams had brought more than a year's supply of food for their voyage, but Walker and Stearns quickly consumed their own meager supplies and resorted to harvesting the island's few coconuts, often by chopping down entire trees, leaving scars on the island habitat. As Walker's method of farming became unsustainable, he and Stearns were forced to plan a voyage in the rickety \"Iola\", against prevailing winds and currents, to Fanning (Tabuaeran), a nearby atoll in Kiribati, to restock — a voyage that was somewhere between difficult and impossible without a working auxiliary engine.\n\nAccording to Stearns, the Grahams disappeared sometime between August 28 and August 30, 1974, and the young couple found the Grahams' Zodiac rigid inflatable dinghy upside down. On September 11, 1974, after days of searching and waiting for the Grahams to return to their boat, Stearns said she and Walker scuttled the \"Iola\" and sailed for Hawaii on the \"Sea Wind\". Once in Hawaii, the couple had the \"Sea Wind\" repainted and also renamed it, which according to boating superstition brings bad luck. This act aroused suspicion; acquaintances of the Grahams easily recognized the distinctive \"Sea Wind\" despite its new paint job. Stearns was arrested in the lower level of the Hawaii Yacht Club for the theft of the \"Sea Wind\", but Walker was able to escape and avoid capture by using a motorized dinghy to race up the \"400 row\" of the Ala Wai Harbor. It was believed he fled on foot after leaving the dinghy at the loading dock near the Ilikai Hotel.\n\nEarly one morning in 1981, other visitors to Palmyra, sailors Robert and Sharon Jordan, from Durban, South Africa, found Muff Graham's skull and other skeletal remains in the surf near a large metal container. The remains showed signs of dismemberment and burning (possibly by Mac Graham's acetylene welding torch), and the body appeared to have been concealed underwater in the container.\n\nBuck Walker was tried and convicted of Muff Graham's murder. He was incarcerated at United States Penitentiary, Victorville, in California. Although Walker never testified, the defense claimed that he and Stearns were attempting to return the \"Sea Wind\" to Hawaii with the \"Iola\" in tow, but the \"Iola\" ran aground on the reef as they exited the lagoon and had to be abandoned. During the voyage back to Hawaii, it was claimed that a large swordfish damaged the \"Sea Wind\"s hull below the waterline, necessitating her repair and subsequent repainting and renaming.\n\nStephanie Stearns was tried separately in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco. After Bugliosi argued that Buck Walker had committed the Palmyra murders himself without Stearns' participation or knowledge, and following her testimony at the trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.\n\nThe book was adapted into the 1991 television film \"And the Sea Will Tell\", directed by Tommy Lee Wallace which aired on CBS As a 4-hour film (Part 1 aired on February 24, and Part 2 was aired 2 days later on the 26th that month.)\n\nThe trial lawyer who represented Walker, Earle Partington, sued Bugliosi for defamation, claiming that both the book and the docudrama portrayed Partington in a negative light. The court found for Bugliosi, ruling that this was his protected opinion.\n\nWalker was released on parole in September 2007 at the age of 69, after serving 22 years of a life sentence, and died of a stroke on April 26, 2010 at the age of 72. Prior to his death, Walker had been living in a trailer home in Willits, California. Walker (writing as Wesley G. Walker), claimed in a book about that case that he had been seduced by Mrs. Graham and, in the midst of lovemaking, had been caught by Mr. Graham, who shot his wife and attempted to shoot Walker.\n\nMalcolm Graham's body has never been found.\n\n"}

Howard S. Becker describes it as \"the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for\" (Becker, 1982). In her book, \"Seven Days in the Art World\", Sarah Thornton describes it as \"a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but cluster in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin.\" Other cities sometimes called \"art capitals\" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.\n\nThe notion of the singular \"art world\" is problematic, since Becker and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no \"center\" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the \"net art world\" (referring to network-aided art or net art), Amy Alexander states \"net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes. This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution.\" \nArt worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. \n\nThe one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.\n\n\"Whitehot Magazine\" artist/publisher Noah Becker has published over 3500 articles about the Art World.\"\n\n\"New York Magazine\" art critic Jerry Saltz has referred to William Powhida's and Jade Townsend's drawing \"Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville\" as \"a great big art-world stinkbomb.\"\n\n\n"}

He also notes that its octagonal form is like the baptistery of Saint John in Florence, of the Arian baptistery of Ravenna, and of the Lateran baptistery in Rome built by Constantine.\n\nThe baptistery's first restoration came prior to the 9th century, with interventions following in the 10th and 11th centuries as shown in the triangular decorations and the framing of the principal entrance. Most recently, the interior of the baptistery was restored in 2006.\n\nThe baptistery is constructed of large, square blocks of travertine, some of which were taken from earlier structures. Visible at the base of the eastern side are the remains of a Roman wall. It is a freestanding structure with a massive, square base containing entrances on two sides. The \"tiburio\" (the upper part of the structure designed to shape and protect the cupola within) is octagonal in shape, decorated with four small windows, and crowned with a square lantern, also containing windows to allow light inside. Each side of the \"tiburio\" is decorated with a blind arcade containing three round arches, with exception of the east facing side which contains a pair of arcades with only two arches each. All of these arcades were added during the 12th century.\nThe original monument had three entrances symbolizing the Holy Trinity as well as the Three Churches: \"the church militant\", composed of all the baptized faithful to Christ and the Pope; \"the church penitent\", which includes all the souls in purgatory that are being prepared for heaven; and \"the church triumphant\", comprising the saints and angels. Today the baptistery has two entrances. The main entrance, found on piazza Arringo, is flanked by two recessed rectangular forms, and the architrave above is decorated with three recessed triangles, one large triangle in the center which is marked by a wide horizontal slit, and two small ones on the sides. The other entrance faces the cathedral door known as the \"La porta della Musa\", and contains stone work from various periods, including Romanesque capitals and an bas-relief architrave that contains a knotted cord (a type of decoration that was very diffuse around the year 1000).\n\nThe interior of the baptistery has an irregular, octagonal shape, typically Roman, with niches that correspond to the angles of the square base. The octagonal walls measure about 5,5 meters each; the dimensions of the interiore are 9,14 x 9 meters. Inside at the center of the floor, directly below the oculus of the cupola, is a slightly raised circular pool, dated to the 5th or 6th century but rediscovered only in 1839, that was used by Christians for baptism by immersion. This unique spot was used for the baptism of both men and women who were assisted, respectively, by deacons and deaconesses. On the right side is a baptismal font from the 14th or 15th century, set on top of a twisted column. On the altar is a painting of the \"Baptism of Christ\", a 16th-century oil on canvas, attributed to Venceslao Corrigioli di Reggio.\n\nThe historian Mario Sabatucci has attributed a symbolic reading to the form of Ascoli's baptistery according to Christian doctrine. According to his interpretation, the square base represents the earth and its four elements (air, earth, fire, and water), the four points of the compass, the four seasons, and the four periods of a human life-span. The octagonal \"tiburio\" calls to mind baptism as described by St. Peter in his first letter: \"« while God patiently waited to receive them, in Noah's time when the ark was being built. In it only a few, that is eight souls, were saved through water. It is the baptism corresponding to this water which saves you now ... »\" The round cupola, like a circle or a sphere, represents eternity and paradise.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18544577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18544577", "title": "Attitude (heraldry)", "text": "Attitude (heraldry)\n\nIn heraldry, an attitude is the \"position\" in which an animal, bird, fish, human or human-like being is emblazoned as a charge, supporter or crest. Many attitudes apply only to predatory beasts and are exemplified by the beast most frequently found in heraldry—the lion. Some other terms apply only to docile animals, such as the doe (usually blazoned as \"hind\"). Other attitudes, such as \"volant\", describe the positions of birds, mostly exemplified by the bird most frequently found in heraldry—the eagle. The term \"naiant\" (swimming), however, is usually reserved for fish but may also apply to swans, ducks or geese. Birds are often further described by the exact position of their wings. The term \"segreant\" is usually applied to the griffin, but this approximation of \"rampant\" which is more appropriate for them has also been applied to the dragon.\n\nAdditionally, there are positions applying to direction, to indicate variations from the presumed position of any charge. Animals and animal-like creatures are presumed to be shown in profile, facing dexter (the viewer's left), and humans and human-like beings are presumed to be shown \"affronté\" (facing the viewer), unless otherwise specified in the blazon.\n\nAnimals and animal-like creatures are presumed to be shown in profile facing \"dexter\". This attitude is standard unless otherwise stated in the blazon. As a warrior will usually carry a shield in the left hand, the animal shown on the shield will then face toward the knight's body. Humans and human-like beings are presumed to be shown \"affronté\". \nNote that the heraldic terms \"dexter\" ('right') and \"sinister\" ('left') represent the shield bearer's perspective, not the viewer's.\n\nMany attitudes commonly met with in heraldic rolls apply specifically to predatory beasts, while others may be better suited to the docile animals. These will each be discussed in detail below. Also worth note is that a lion or other beast may additionally be described in terms of the position of its head, differently coloured parts (such as teeth, claws, tongue, etc.), or by the shape or position of its tail. A beast may be \"armed\" (horns, teeth and claws) or \"langued\" (tongue) of a tincture, while a stag may be \"attired\" (antlers) or \"unguled\" (hooves) of a tincture. The tail may be forked (\"queue fourchée\") or doubled (\"double-queued\"). In addition to the below, there may be rare or arguably, not entirely standard attitudes, such as \"a snorting bison\".\n\nA beast rampant (Old French: \"rearing up\") is depicted in profile standing erect with forepaws raised. The position of the hind legs varies according to local custom: the lion may stand on both hind legs, braced wide apart, or on only one, with the other also raised to strike; the word \"rampant\" is sometimes omitted, especially in early blazon, as this is the most usual position of a carnivorous quadruped.\n\"Note:\" the term \"segreant\" denotes the same position, but implies a particular wing position and is only used in reference to winged quadrupeds such as griffins and dragons.\nRampant is the most frequent attitude of quadrupeds, and as supporters they are rarely seen in any other attitude.\nForcené is the term for this position when applied to horses or unicorns.\n\nA beast passant (Old French: \"striding\") walks toward dexter (the viewer's left) with the right forepaw raised and all others on the ground. Early heralds held that any lion in a walking position must necessarily be a \"leopard\", and this distinction persists in French heraldry; however, this use of the term \"leopard\" has long since been abandoned by English heralds. A \"Lion of England\" denotes a \"lion passant guardant Or\", used as an augmentation. The Welsh flag features a dragon passant. For stags and other deer-like beasts of chase, the term trippant is used instead of passant.\n\nA beast sejant or sejeant (Middle French: \"seant\", \"sitting\") sits on his haunches, with both forepaws on the ground.\n\nA beast sejant erect is seated on its haunches, but with its body erect and both forepaws raised in the \"rampant\" position (this is sometimes termed \"sejant-rampant\").\n\nA beast couchant (Old French: \"lying down\") is lying down, but with the head raised. Lodged is the term for this position when applied to the 'docile' (\"i.e.\" herbivorous) animals.\n\nA beast courant (also at speed or in full chase) is running, depicted at full stride with all four legs in the air.\n\nA lion coward carries the tail between its hind legs.\n\nA beast dormant (French: \"sleeping\") is lying down with his head lowered, resting upon the forepaws, as if asleep. (However, perhaps counterintuitively, some sources would have the lion dormant with the eyes open.)\n\nA beast salient (Latin: \"saliēns\", \"leaping\") (also springing) is leaping, with both hind legs together on the ground and both forelegs together in the air. This is a very rare position for a lion, but is also used of other heraldic beasts. The stag and other docile animals in this position are often termed springing. Certain smaller animals are sometimes blazoned as saltant rather than salient.\n\nA beast statant (Old French: \"standing\") is \"standing\" (in profile toward dexter), all four feet on the ground, usually with the forepaws together. This posture is more frequent in crests than in charges on shields. In certain animals, such as bears, this may refer to an upright, bipedal position (though this position may also be referred to as statant erect), though bears blazoned as 'statant' can also be found with all four feet firmly on the ground (\"e.g.\" in the arms of the former borough council of Berwick-upon-Tweed). While \"statant\" is used in reference to predatory beasts, the more docile animals when in this position may be called at bay, while such creatures \"statant guardant\" are said to be at gaze. This is particularly true of stags (harts).\n\nCattle and rhinoceros can be shown as \"pascuant\"; that is, \"grazing,\" with head lowered to the same level as their four legs, as the head of a cow would be when eating grass.\n\nSome attitudes describe the positioning of birds. The eagle is so often found \"displayed\" in early heraldry that this position came to be presumed of the eagle unless some other attitude is specified in the blazon.\n\nThe terms \"Expanded\" and \"Elevated\" or \"Abaissé\" and \"Inverted\" are similar terms often used interchangeably in heraldry but have specific meanings. There is also sometimes confusion between a \"Rising\" bird with \"Displayed\" wings and a \"Displayed\" bird. The difference is that \"Rising\" birds face either to the \"dexter\" or \"in trian aspect\" and have their feet on the ground. \"Displayed\" birds face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.\n\nSeveral terms refer to the particular position of the wings, rather than the attitude of the bird itself. A bird in nearly any attitude, except \"overt\", may have its wings \"displayed\" or \"addorsed\".\n\nA bird displayed is shown \"affronté\" with its head turned to dexter and wings spread to the sides to fill the area of the field. This position is presumed of the eagle, and the symbolic use of eagles in this position was well established even before the development of heraldry, going back to Charlemagne.\n\nA bird Overt (\"closed\") or close, the bird's equivalent of \"Statant\", is shown in profile and at rest with its feet flat on the ground and its wings folded at its sides. Trussed is the term used for domestic or game birds, implying the bird is tied up or caught in a net respectively, and is not applied to predator birds like the Eagle and Hawk. Perched is \"Overt\" while sitting atop a Charge.\n\nA bird rising, rizant or rousant faces dexter with its head upturned, wings raised, and standing on the tips of its feet as if about to take flight. A bird rising may have its wings described as either \"displayed\" or \"addorsed\", and the wings may be further described as \"elevated\" or \"inverted\".\n\nA bird volant faces the \"dexter\" with its wings spread in flight (usually shown \"addorsed\" and \"elevated\") and its legs tucked under its body. Volant En Arrière is when the bird is shown from a top-down perspective with the head facing straight ahead, its back to the viewer, and the wings spread in flight (usually shown \"displayed\" and \"inverted\"). A bird \"volant\" is considered \"in bend\" (\"diagonal\") as it is flying from the lower \"sinister\" to the upper \"dexter\" of the field.\n\nAn eagle or hawk shown \"regardant\", like it was looking back while circling for prey. May be used for other gliding predator birds like owls.\n\nA crane standing on one leg (usually with a stone held in the other foot) may be called vigilant or \"in its vigilance\" (\"e.g.\" Waverley Borough Council's \"Crane in its vigilance\"). A stone is usually shown held in the claw of the raised leg. This is as per the Bestiary myth that Cranes stayed awake by doing so. If it dozed, the Crane would supposedly drop the rock, waking itself up.\n\nOne peculiar attitude reserved only to the pelican, is the pelican in her piety. The heraldic pelican, one of the few female beasts in heraldry, is shown with a sharp stork-like beak, which it uses to \"vuln\" (\"pierce or wound\") her own breast. This is per the bestiary myth that a female pelican wounded herself thus to feed her chicks. This symbol of sacrifice carries a particular religious meaning (usually a reference to Christ's sacrifice), and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position. A distinction is sometimes observed, however, between a pelican \"vulning herself\" (alone, piercing her breast) and \"in her piety\" (surrounded by and feeding her chicks). The Pelican is shown exclusively in profile perched in her nest with her wings either \"Addorsed\" and \"Inverted\" (because it is not going to fly away) or \"Overt\".\n\nFew attitudes are reserved to the rarer classes of creatures, but these include \"segreant\", a term which can only apply to winged quadrupeds; \"naiant\" and \"hauriant\", terms applying principally to fish; \"glissant\" and \"nowed\", terms applying to serpents. Serpents also sometimes appear in a circular form, biting their own tail, but this symbol, called an Ouroboros, was imported ready-made into heraldry, and so it needs no term of attitude to describe it.\n\nA creature \"segreant\" has both forelegs raised in the air, as a beast \"rampant\", with wings \"addorsed\" and \"elevated\". This term is reserved to winged quadrupeds (such as griffins and dragons).\n\nCreatures combatant are shown in profile facing each other in the \"rampant\" or \"segreant\" position, always paired and never appearing singly. Nearly any creature can be rendered combatant, although this term is usually applied to predatory beasts and mythical creatures; herbivorous animals in such a position are typically blazoned as respectant.\n\nCreatures or objects addorsed or endorsed are shown facing \"away from\" each other. As with \"combatant\", charges addorsed can only appear in pairs. One also frequently finds keys addorsed (placed in parallel, wards facing outward).\n\nAn animal or creature naiant is swimming. This term is typically applied to fish (when shown in a horizontal position), but may also apply to other sea creatures and, occasionally, water fowl (\"i.e.\" swans, ducks or geese shown without legs). A dolphin blazoned as naiant is always shown as embowed, unlike any other sea creature or monster, even though the blazon may not specify this.\n\nA fish, dolphin, or other sea creature hauriant is in a vertical position with its head up.\n\nA fish, dolphin, or other sea creature urinant is in a vertical position with its head down.\n\nA serpent glissant is gliding horizontally in an undulant posture.\n\nSerpents, and the tails of other beasts and monsters, may be nowed or knotted—often in a figure-eight knot.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4431", "title": "Beauty", "text": "Beauty\n\nBeauty is a property or characteristic of an animal, idea, object, person or place that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction. Beauty is studied as part of aesthetics, culture, social psychology, philosophy and sociology. An \"ideal beauty\" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.\n\nUgliness is considered to be the opposite of beauty.\n\nThe experience of \"beauty\" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and harmony with nature, which may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being. Because this can be a subjective experience, it is often said that \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\" However, given the empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful often aligning with the aforementioned nature and health thereof, beauty has been stated to have levels of objectivity as well.\n\nThere is also evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by natural selection; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.\n\nThe classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\" was κάλλος, \"kallos\", and the adjective was καλός, \"kalos\". However, \"kalos\" may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, \"kallos\" was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.\n\nThe Koine Greek word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, \"hōraios\", an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, \"hōra\", meaning \"hour\". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with \"being of one's hour\". Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, \"hōraios\" had many meanings, including \"youthful\" and \"ripe old age\".\n\nThe earliest Western theory of beauty can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the pre-Socratic period, such as Pythagoras. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between mathematics and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the golden ratio seemed more attractive. Ancient Greek architecture is based on this view of symmetry and proportion.\n\nPlato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas. Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (\"to kalon\") and virtue, arguing that \"Virtue aims at the beautiful.\"\n\nClassical philosophy and sculptures of men and women produced according to the Greek philosophers' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in Renaissance Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a \"classical ideal\". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose appearance conforms to these tenets is still called a \"classical beauty\" or said to possess a \"classical beauty\", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization. During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, Renaissance and Humanist thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as Giorgio Vasari in his \"Lives of Artists\") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of Gothic art lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Catholic philosophers like Thomas Aquinas included beauty among the transcendental attributes of being. In his Summa Theologica, Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (Wholeness), consonantia (harmony), claritas (radiance of form)\n\nIn the Gothic Architecture of the High and Late Middle Ages, light was considered the most beautiful revelation of God, which was heralded in design. Examples are the stained glass of Gothic Cathedrals including Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartes Cathedral.\n\nThe Age of Reason saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher Francis Hutcheson argued that beauty is \"unity in variety and variety in unity\". The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the nature of beauty, with John Keats arguing in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" that\n\nIn the Romantic period, Edmund Burke postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the sublime. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and Kant, suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.\n\nThe 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in postmodernism's anti-aesthetics. This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, Friedrich Nietzsche, who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.\n\nIn the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher Guy Sircello proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept. Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.\n\nBeauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of experimental aesthetics and neuroesthetics respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of pleasure. Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing. Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.\n\nThe characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of \"inner beauty\", which includes psychological factors such as personality, intelligence, grace, politeness, charisma, integrity, congruence and elegance, and \"outer beauty\" (i.e. physical attractiveness) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.\n\nStandards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.\n\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\". When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images. Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces. It is argued that it is evolutionarily advantageous that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features, because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects. There is also evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy, and is probably innate,\nand that the rules by which attractiveness is established are similar across different genders and cultures.\n\nA feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a waist–hip ratio of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with hourglass figures are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates. However, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal. For instance, in some non-Western cultures in which women have to do work such as finding food, men tend to have preferences for higher waist-hip ratios.\n\nBeauty standards are rooted in cultural norms crafted by societies and media over centuries. Globally, it is argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a Eurocentric concept of beauty, breeding cultures that assign inferiority to women of color. Thus, societies and cultures across the globe struggle to diminish the longstanding internalized racism. The black is beautifulcultural movement sought to dispel this notion in the 1960s.\n\nExposure to the thin ideal in mass media, such as fashion magazines, directly correlates with body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and the development of eating disorders among female viewers.Further, the widening gap between individual body sizes and societal ideals continues to breed anxiety among young girls as they grow, highlighting the dangerous nature of beauty standards in society.\n\nThe concept of beauty in men is known as 'bishōnen' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly feminine features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their pop culture idols. A multibillion-dollar industry of Japanese Aesthetic Salons exists for this reason. However, different nations have varying male beauty ideals; Eurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity; thus, these features are idolized through American media, such as in Hollywood films and magazine covers.\n\nThe prevailing eurocentric concept of beauty has varying effects on different cultures. Primarily, adherence to this standard among African American women has bred a lack of positive reification of African beauty, and philosopher Cornel West elaborates that, \"much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair.\" These insecurities can be traced back to global idealization of women with light skin, green or blue eyes, and long straight or wavy hair in magazines and media that starkly contrast with the natural features of African women.\n\nSimilarly, internalized colorism is rooted in Indian culture, in which prevailing value placed on fairer skin tones fuels the skin whitening industry; products like Fair & Lovely thrive in India, with endorsement from Bollywood celebrities, as well as a general idealization of fair women throughout the film, media, and advertising industries. Thus, such Eurocentric beauty standards are maintained through Indian culture, and encourage women to artificially change their appearances to adhere to beauty norms and ideals. Further, a societal divide exists between the northern and southern regions of India, as fairer complexioned North Indians are culturally associated with beauty, intelligence, and wealth, based merely on adherence to Eurocentric beauty ideals.\n\nIn East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals; professor and scholar Stephanie Wong's experimental study concluded that expecting that men in Asian culture didn't like women who look “fragile” impacted the lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices made by Asian American women. In addition to the male gaze, media portrayals of Asian women as petite and the portrayal of beautiful women in American media as fair complexioned and slim-figured induce anxiety and depressive symptoms among Asian American women who don't fit either of these beauty ideals. Further, the high status associated with fairer skin can be attributed to Asian societal history; upper-class people hired workers to perform outdoor, manual labor, cultivating a visual divide overtime between lighter complexioned, wealthier families and sun tanned, darker laborers. This along with the Eurocentric beauty ideals embedded in Asian culture has made skin lightening creams, rhinoplasty, and blepharoplasty (an eyelid surgery meant to give Asians a more European, \"double-eyelid\" appearance) commonplace among Asian women, illuminating the insecurity that results from cultural beauty standards.\n\nBeauty presents a standard of comparison, and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the \"beauty ideal\" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom \"Ugly Betty\" portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In \"Malèna\", a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may \"woo\" their husbands. The documentary \"Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld\" explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.\n\nResearchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance. Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive \"defendants\" are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime). Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author, Eva Ritvo, show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.\n\nHow much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good looking. In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default. In the marriage market, women's looks are at a premium, but men's looks do not matter much.\n\nConversely, being very unattractive increases the individual's propensity for criminal activity for a number of crimes ranging from burglary to theft to selling illicit drugs.\n\nDiscrimination against others based on their appearance is known as lookism.\n\nSt. Augustine said of beauty \"Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.\" \n\nPhilosopher and novelist Umberto Eco wrote \"On Beauty: A history of a Western idea\" (2004) and \"On Ugliness\" (2007). A character in his novel \"The Name of the Rose\" declares: \"three things concur in creating beauty: first of all integrity or perfection, and for this reason we consider ugly all incomplete things; then proper proportion or consonance; and finally clarity and light\", before going on to say \"the sight of the beautiful implies peace\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6558", "title": "Cello", "text": "Cello\n\nThe cello ( ; plural cellos or celli) or violoncello ( ; ) is a string instrument. It is played by bowing or plucking its four strings, which are usually tuned in perfect fifths an octave lower than the viola: from low to high, C, G, D and A. It is the bass member of the violin family, which also includes the violin, viola and the double bass, which doubles the bass line an octave lower than the cello in much of the orchestral repertoire. After the double bass, it is the second-largest and second lowest (in pitch) bowed string instrument in the modern symphony orchestra. The cello is used as a solo instrument, as well as in chamber music ensembles (e.g., string quartet), string orchestras, as a member of the string section of symphony orchestras, most modern Chinese orchestras, and some types of rock bands. \n\nMusic for the cello is generally written in the bass clef, but both tenor clef and treble clef are used for higher-range parts, both in orchestral/chamber music parts and in solo cello works. A person who plays the cello is called a \"cellist\" or \"violoncellist\". In a small classical ensemble, such as a string quartet, the cello typically plays the bass part, the lowest-pitched musical line of the piece. In an orchestra of the Baroque era (ca. 1600–1750) and Classical period (ca. 1725–1800), the cello typically plays the bass part, generally doubled an octave lower by the double basses. In Baroque-era music, the cello is often used to play the basso continuo bassline, typically along with a keyboard instrument (e.g., pipe organ or harpsichord) or a fretted, plucked stringed instrument (e.g., lute or theorbo). In such a Baroque performance, the cello player might be joined or replaced by other bass instruments, playing bassoon, double bass, viol or other low-register instruments.\n\nThe name \"cello\" is derived from the ending of the Italian \"violoncello\", which means \"little violone\". The violone (\"big viol\") was the lowest-pitched instrument of the viol family, the group of stringed instruments that went out of fashion around the end of the 17th century in most countries except France, where they survived another half-century before the louder violin family came into greater favour in that country as well. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the double bass is the largest). Thus, the name \"violoncello\" contained both the augmentative \"-one\" (\"big\") and the diminutive \"-cello\" (\"little\"). By the turn of the 20th century, it had become common to shorten the name to 'cello, with the apostrophe indicating the missing stem. It is now customary to use \"cello\" without apostrophe as the full designation. \"Viol\" is derived from the root \"viola\", which was derived from Medieval Latin \"vitula\", meaning stringed instrument.\n\nCellos are tuned in fifths, starting with C (two octaves below middle C), followed by G, D, and then A. It is tuned in the same intervals as the viola, but an octave lower. Unlike the violin or viola but similar to the double bass, the cello has an endpin that rests on the floor to support the instrument's weight. The cello is most closely associated with European classical music, and has been described as the closest sounding instrument to the human voice. The instrument is a part of the standard orchestra, as part of the string section, and is the bass voice of the string quartet (although many composers give it a melodic role as well), as well as being part of many other chamber groups.\n\nAmong the most well-known Baroque works for the cello are Johann Sebastian Bach's six unaccompanied Suites. The cello possibly figures as a member of the basso continuo group in chamber works by Francesca Caccini (1587–1641), Barbara Strozzi (1619–1677) with pieces such as \"Il primo libro di madrigali, per 2–5 voci e basso continuo, op. 1\" and Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre (1665–1729) who wrote six sonatas for violin and basso continuo.\n\nFrom the Classical era, the two concertos by Joseph Haydn in C major and D major stand out, as do the five sonatas for cello and pianoforte of Ludwig van Beethoven, which span the important three periods of his compositional evolution. A \"Divertimento for Piano, Clarinet, Viola and Cello\" is among the surviving works by Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1739–1807).\n\nA review of compositions for cello in the Romantic era must include the German composer Fanny Mendelssohn (1805–1847) who wrote the Fantasy in G minor for cello and piano and a Capriccio in A-flat for cello. Other well-known works of the era include the Robert Schumann Concerto, the Antonín Dvořák Concerto as well as the two sonatas and the Double Concerto by Johannes Brahms.\n\nCompositions from the late-19th and early 20th century include three cello sonatas (including the Cello Sonata in C Minor written in 1880) by Dame Ethel Smyth (1858–1944), Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto in E minor, Claude Debussy's Sonata for Cello and Piano, and unaccompanied cello sonatas by Zoltán Kodály and Paul Hindemith. Pieces including cello were written by American Music Cente founder Marion Bauer (1882–1955) (two trio sonatas for flute, cello and piano) and Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901–1953) (Diaphonic suite No. 2 for bassoon and cello).\n\nPolish composer Grażyna Bacewicz (1909–1969) was writing for cello in the mid 20th century with Concerto No. 1 for Cello and Orchestra (1951), Concerto No. 2 for Cello and Orchestra (1963) and in 1964 composed her Quartet for four cellos. The cello's versatility made it popular with many male composers in this era as well, such as Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten, György Ligeti, Witold Lutoslawski and Henri Dutilleux.\n\nWell-known cellists include Jacqueline du Pre, Raya Garbousova, Zara Nelsova, Hildur Gudnadottir, Han-Na Chang, Mstislav Rostropovich and Beatrice Harrison. Others include Anner Bylsma, Yo-Yo Ma, Pablo Casals, Julian Lloyd Webber, Alfred Wallenstein, Mischa Maisky and Gregor Piatigorsky. See the comprehensive list of cellists here.\n\nIn the 2010s, the instrument is found in popular music, but was more commonly used in 1970s pop and disco music. Today it is sometimes featured in pop and rock recordings, examples of which are noted later in this article. The cello has also recently appeared in major hip-hop and R & B performances, such as singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo's performance at the American Music Awards. The instrument has also been modified for Indian classical music by Nancy Lesh and Saskia Rao-de Haas.\n\nThe violin family, including cello-sized instruments, emerged c. 1500 as family of instruments distinct from the viola da gamba family. The earliest depictions of the violin family, from northern Italy c. 1530, show three sizes of instruments, roughly corresponding to what we now call violins, violas, and cellos. Contrary to a popular misconception, the cello did not evolve from the viola da gamba, but existed alongside it for about two and a half centuries. The violin family is also known as the viola da braccio (meaning viola of the arm) family, a reference to the primary way the members of the family are held. This is to distinguish it from the viola da gamba (meaning viola of the leg) family, in which all the members are all held with the legs. The likely predecessors of the violin family include the lira da braccio and the rebec. The earliest surviving cellos are made by Andrea Amati, the first known member of the celebrated Amati family of luthiers.\n\nThe direct ancestor to the violoncello was the bass violin. Monteverdi referred to the instrument as \"basso de viola da braccio\" in \"Orfeo\" (1607). Although the first bass violin, possibly invented as early as 1538, was most likely inspired by the viol, it was created to be used in consort with the violin. The bass violin was actually often referred to as a \"violone\", or \"large viola\", as were the viols of the same period. Instruments that share features with both the bass violin and the \"viola da gamba\" appear in Italian art of the early 16th century.\n\nThe invention of wire-wound strings (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in Bologna, allowed for a finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument and the fact that the smaller size made it easier to play virtuosic passages. This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by organ, theorbo or violone.\n\nAround 1700, Italian players popularized the cello in northern Europe, although the bass violin (basse de violon) continued to be used for another two decades in France. Many existing bass violins were literally cut down in size to convert them into cellos according to the smaller pattern developed by Stradivarius, who also made a number of old pattern large cellos (the 'Servais'). The sizes, names, and tunings of the cello varied widely by geography and time. The size was not standardized until around 1750.\n\nDespite similarities to the viola da gamba, the cello is actually part of the viola da braccio family, meaning \"viol of the arm\", which includes, among others, the violin and viola. Though paintings like Bruegel's \"The Rustic Wedding\", and Jambe de Fer in his \"Epitome Musical\" suggest that the bass violin had alternate playing positions, these were short-lived and the more practical and ergonomic \"a gamba\" position eventually replaced them entirely.\nBaroque-era cellos differed from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings wire-wound. Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make it much easier to tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.\n\nFew educational works specifically devoted to the cello existed before the 18th century, and those that do exist contain little value to the performer beyond simple accounts of instrumental technique. One of the earliest cello manuals is Michel Corrette's \"Méthode, thèorique et pratique pour apprendre en peu de temps le violoncelle dans sa perfection\" (Paris, 1741).\n\nCellos are part of the standard symphony orchestra, which usually includes eight to twelve cello players. The cello section, in standard orchestral seating, is located on stage left (the audience's right) in the front, opposite the first violin section. However, some orchestras and conductors prefer switching the positioning of the viola and cello sections. The \"principal\" cellist is the section leader, determining bowings for the section in conjunction with other string principals, playing solos and leading entrances (when the section begins to play its part). Principal players always sit closest to the audience.\n\nThe cellos are a critical part of orchestral music; all symphonic works involve the cello section, and many pieces require cello soli or solos. Much of the time, cellos provide part of the low-register harmony for the orchestra. Often, the cello section plays the melody for a brief period, before returning to the harmony role. There are also cello concertos, which are orchestral pieces that feature a solo cellist accompanied by an entire orchestra.\n\nThere are numerous cello concertos – where a solo cello is accompanied by an orchestra – notably 25 by Vivaldi, 12 by Boccherini, at least 3 by Haydn, 3 by C. P. E. Bach, 2 by Saint-Saëns, 2 by Dvořák, and one each by Robert Schumann], Lalo, and Elgar. There were also some cellists who, while not otherwise composers, did write cello-specific repertoire, such as Nikolaus Kraft who wrote six cello concertos. Beethoven's Triple Concerto for Cello, Violin and Piano and Brahms' Double Concerto for Cello and Violin are also part of the concertante repertoire although in both cases the cello shares solo duties with at least one other instrument. Moreover, several composers wrote large-scale pieces for cello and orchestra, which are concertos in all but name. Some familiar \"concertos\" are Richard Strauss' tone poem \"Don Quixote\", Tchaikovsky's \"Variations on a Rococo Theme\", Bloch's \"Schelomo\" and Bruch's \"Kol Nidrei\".\n\nIn the 20th century, the cello repertoire grew immensely. This was partly due to the influence of virtuoso cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who inspired, commissioned and premiered dozens of new works. Among these, Prokofiev's \"Symphony-Concerto\", Britten's \"Cello Symphony\", the concertos of Shostakovich and Lutosławski as well as Dutilleux's \"Tout un monde lointain...\" have already become part of the standard repertoire. Other major composers who wrote concertante works for him include Messiaen, Jolivet, Berio and Penderecki. In addition, Arnold, Barber, Glass, Hindemith, Honegger, Ligeti, Myaskovsky, Penderecki, Rodrigo, Villa-Lobos and Walton also wrote major concertos for other cellists, notably for Gaspar Cassadó, Aldo Parisot, Gregor Piatigorsky, Siegfried Palm and Julian Lloyd Webber.\n\nThere are also many sonatas for cello and piano. Those written by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Brahms, Grieg, Rachmaninoff, Debussy, Fauré, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Poulenc, Carter, and Britten are particularly well known.\n\nOther important pieces for cello and piano include Schumann's five \"Stücke im Volkston\" and transcriptions like Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata (originally for arpeggione and piano), César Franck's Cello Sonata (originally a violin sonata, transcribed by Jules Delsart with the composer's approval), Stravinsky's \"Suite italienne\" (transcribed by the composer – with Gregor Piatigorsky – from his ballet \"Pulcinella\") and Bartók's first rhapsody (also transcribed by the composer, originally for violin and piano).\n\nThere are pieces for cello solo, J. S. Bach's six Suites for Cello (which are among the best-known solo cello pieces), Kodály's Sonata for Solo Cello and Britten's three Cello Suites. Other notable examples include Hindemith's and Ysaÿe's Sonatas for Solo Cello, Dutilleux's \"Trois Strophes sur le Nom de Sacher\", Berio's \"Les Mots Sont Allés\", Cassadó's Suite for Solo Cello, Ligeti's Solo Sonata, Carter's two \"Figment\"s and Xenakis' \"Nomos Alpha\" and \"Kottos\".\n\nThe cello is a member of the traditional string quartet as well as string quintets, sextet or trios and other mixed ensembles.\nThere are also pieces written for two, three, four or more cellos; this type of ensemble is also called a \"cello choir\" and its sound is familiar from the introduction to Rossini's William Tell Overture as well as Zaccharia's prayer scene in Verdi's Nabucco. Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture also starts with a cello ensemble, with four cellos playing the top lines and two violas playing the bass lines. As a self-sufficient ensemble, its most famous repertoire is Villa-Lobos' first of his Bachianas Brasileiras for cello ensemble (the fifth is for soprano and 8 cellos). Other examples are Offenbach's cello duets, quartet, and sextet, Pärt's Fratres for 8 cellos and Boulez' \"Messagesquisse\" for 7 cellos, or even Villa-Lobos' rarely played \"Fantasia Concertante\" (1958) for 32 cellos. The 12 cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (or \"the Twelve\" as they have since taken to being called) specialize in this repertoire and have commissioned many works, including arrangements of well-known popular songs.\n\nThe cello is less common in popular music than in classical music. Several bands feature a cello in their standard line-up, e.g. Joe Kwon of The Avett Brothers. The more common use in pop and rock is to bring the instrument in for a particular song. In the 1960s, artists such as the Beatles and Cher used the cello in popular music, in songs such as The Beatles' \"Yesterday\", \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", and Cher's \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\". \"Good Vibrations\" by the Beach Boys includes the cello in its instrumental ensemble, which includes a number of instruments unusual for this sort of music. Bass guitarist Jack Bruce, who had originally studied music on a performance scholarship for cello, played a prominent cello part in \"As You Said\" on Cream's \"Wheels of Fire\" studio album (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, the Electric Light Orchestra enjoyed great commercial success taking inspiration from so-called \"Beatlesque\" arrangements, adding the cello (and violin) to the standard rock combo line-up and in 1978 the UK based rock band, Colosseum II, collaborated with cellist Julian Lloyd Webber on the recording \"Variations\". Most notably, Pink Floyd included a cello solo in their 1970 epic instrumental \"Atom Heart Mother\". Bass guitarist Mike Rutherford of Genesis was originally a cellist and included some cello parts in their \"Foxtrot\" album.\n\nEstablished non-traditional cello groups include Apocalyptica, a group of Finnish cellists best known for their versions of Metallica songs, Rasputina, a group of cellists committed to an intricate cello style intermingled with Gothic music, the Massive Violins, an ensemble of seven singing cellists known for their arrangements of rock, pop and classical hits, Von Cello, a cello fronted rock power trio, Break of Reality who mix elements of classical music with the more modern rock and metal genre, Cello Fury, a cello rock band that performs original rock/classical crossover music, and Jelloslave, a Minneapolis-based Cello duo with two percussionists. These groups are examples of a style that has become known as cello rock. The crossover string quartet bond also includes a cellist. Silenzium and Cellissimo Quartet are Russian (Novosibirsk) groups playing rock and metal and having more and more popularity in Siberia. Cold Fairyland from Shanghai, China is using a cello along a Pipa as the main solo instrument to create East meets West progressive (folk) rock.\n\nMore recent bands using the cello are Aerosmith, The Auteurs, Nirvana, Oasis, Smashing Pumpkins, James, Talk Talk, Phillip Phillips, OneRepublic, and the baroque rock band Arcade Fire. An Atlanta-based trio, King Richard's Sunday Best, also uses a cellist in their lineup. So-called \"chamber pop\" artists like Kronos Quartet, The Vitamin String Quartet and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's have also recently made cello common in modern alternative rock. Heavy metal band System of a Down has also made use of the cello's rich sound. The indie rock band The Stiletto Formal are known for using a cello as a major staple of their sound, similarly, the indie rock band Canada employs two cello players in their lineup. The orch-rock group, The Polyphonic Spree, which has pioneered the use of stringed and symphonic instruments, employs the cello in very creative ways for many of their \"psychedelic-esque\" melodies. The first wave screamo band \"I Would Set Myself On Fire For You\" featured a cello as well as a viola to create a more folk-oriented sound. The band, Panic! at the Disco uses a cello in their song, \"Build God, Then We'll Talk\". The lead vocalist of the band, Brendon Urie, also did the recording of the cello solo. The Lumineers added cellist Nela Pekarek to the band in 2010. She plays cello, sings harmony and duets.\n\nIn jazz, bassists Oscar Pettiford and Harry Babasin were among the first to use the cello as a solo instrument; both tuned their instrument in fourths, an octave above the double bass. Fred Katz (who was not a bassist) was one of the first notable jazz cellists to use the instrument's standard tuning and arco technique. Contemporary jazz cellists include Abdul Wadud, Diedre Murray, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, David Darling, Lucio Amanti, Akua Dixon, Ernst Reijseger, Fred Lonberg-Holm, Tom Cora and Erik Friedlander. Modern musical theatre pieces like Jason Robert Brown's The Last Five Years, Duncan Sheik's Spring Awakening, Adam Guettel's Floyd Collins, and Ricky Ian Gordon's My Life with Albertine use small string ensembles (including solo cellos) to a prominent extent.\n\nIn Indian Classical music Saskia Rao-de Haas is a well established soloist as well as playing duets with her sitarist husband Pt. Shubhendra Rao. Other cellists performing Indian classical music are: Nancy Lesh (Dhrupad) and Anup Biswas. Both Rao and Lesh play the cello sitting cross-legged on the floor.\n\nThe cello can also be used in bluegrass and folk music, with notable players including Ben Sollee of the Sparrow Quartet and the \"Cajun cellist\" Sean Grissom, as well as Vyvienne Long who, in addition to her own projects, has played for those of Damien Rice. Cellists such as Natalie Haas, Abby Newton and Liz Davis Maxfield have contributed significantly to the use of cello playing in Celtic folk music, often with the cello featured as a primary melodic instrument and employing the skills and techniques of traditional fiddle playing. Lindsay Mac is becoming well known for playing the cello like a guitar, with her cover of The Beatles' \"Blackbird\".\n\nThe cello is typically made from carved wood, although other materials such as carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as poplar or willow, are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood. Laminated cellos are widely used in elementary and secondary school orchestras and youth orchestras, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., they are less likely to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.\n\nThe top and back are traditionally hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, are made by heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the bridge and F holes just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has decorative border inlay known as purfling. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at the rim of the instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.\n\nCello manufacturer Luis & Clark constructs cellos from carbon fibre. Carbon fibre instruments are particularly suitable for outdoor playing because of the strength of the material and its resistance to humidity and temperature fluctuations. Luis & Clark has produced over 1000 cellos, some of which are owned by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma and Josephine van Lier. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) as well as German luthier G.A. Pfretzschner produced an unknown number of aluminum cellos (in addition to aluminum double basses and violins).\n\nAbove the main body is the carved neck. The neck has a curved cross-section on its underside, which is where the player's thumb runs along the neck during playing. The neck which leads to a pegbox and the scroll. The neck, pegbox, and scroll are normally carved out of a single piece of wood, usually maple. The fingerboard is glued to the neck and extends over the body of the instrument. The fingerboard is given a curved shape, matching the curve on the bridge. Both the fingerboard and bridge need to be curved so that the performer can bow individual strings. If the cello were to have a flat fingerboard and bridge, as with a typical guitar, the performer would only be able to bow the \"outer\" two strings or bow all the strings. The performer would not be able to play the \"inner\" two strings alone.\n\nThe nut is a raised piece of wood, fitted where the fingerboard meets the pegbox, in which the strings rest in shallow slots or grooves to keep them the correct distance apart. The pegbox houses four tapered tuning pegs, one for each string. The pegs are used to tune the cello by either tightening or loosening the string. The pegs are called \"friction pegs\", because they maintain their position by friction. The scroll is a traditional ornamental part of the cello and a feature of all other members of the violin family. Ebony is usually used for the tuning pegs, fingerboard, and nut, but other hardwoods, such as boxwood or rosewood, can be used. Black fittings on low-cost instruments are often made from inexpensive wood that has been blackened or \"ebonized\" to look like ebony, which is much harder and more expensive. Ebonised parts such as tuning pegs may crack or split, and the black surface of the fingerboard will eventually wear down to reveal the lighter wood underneath.\n\nHistorically, cello strings had cores made out of catgut, which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat intestines which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like aluminum, titanium and chromium. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning (scordatura) is specified by the composer. Some composers (e.g. Ottorino Respighi in the final movement of ‘’The Pines of Rome’’) ask that the low C be tuned down to a B or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.\n\nThe tailpiece and endpin are found in the lower part of the cello. The tailpiece is the part of the cello to which the \"ball ends\" of the strings are attached by passing them through holes. The tailpiece is attached to the bottom of the cello. The tailpiece is traditionally made of ebony or another hard wood, but can also be made of plastic or steel on lower-cost instruments. It attaches the strings to the lower end of the cello, and can have one or more fine tuners. The fine tuners are used to make smaller adjustments to the pitch of the string. The fine tuners can increase the tension of each string (raising the pitch) or decrease the tension of the string (lowering the pitch). When the performer is putting on a new string, the fine tuner for that string is normally reset to a middle position, and then the peg is turned to bring the string up to pitch. The fine turners are used for subtle, minor adjustments to pitch, such as tuning a cello to the oboe's 440 Hz A note or to tune the cello to a piano.\n\nThe endpin or spike is made of wood, metal or rigid carbon fibre and supports the cello in playing position. The endpin can be retracted into the hollow body of the instrument when the cello is being transported in its case. This makes the cello easier to move about. When the performer wishes to play the cello, the endpin is pulled out to lengthen it. The endpin is locked into the player's preferred length with a screw mechanism. The adjustable nature of endpins enables performers of different ages and body sizes to adjust the endpin length to suit them. In the Baroque period the cello was held between the calves, as there was no endpin at that time. The endpin was \"introduced by Adrien Servais 1845 to give the instrument greater stability\". Modern endpins are retractable and adjustable; older ones were removed when not in use. (The word \"endpin\" sometimes also refers to the button of wood located at this place in all instruments in the violin family, but this is usually called \"tailpin\".) The sharp tip of the cello's endpin is sometimes capped with a rubber tip that protects the tip from dulling and prevents the cello from slipping on the floor. Many cellists use a rubber pad with a metal cup to keep the tip from slipping on the floor. A number of accessories to keep the endpin from slipping; these include ropes which attach to the chair leg and other devices.\n\nThe bridge holds the strings above the cello and transfers their vibrations to the top of the instrument and the soundpost inside (see below). The bridge is not glued, but rather held in place by the tension of the strings. The bridge is usually positioned by the cross point of the \"f-hole\" (i.e., where the horizontal line occurs in the \"f\"). The f-holes, named for their shape, are located on either side of the bridge, and allow air to move in and out of the instrument as part of the sound-production process. They probably actually stand for an old style medial S, for words related to Sound. The f-holes also act as access points to the interior of the cello for repairs or maintenance. Sometimes a small length of rubber hose containing a water-soaked sponge, called a Dampit, is inserted through the f-holes, and serves as a humidifier. This keeps the wood components of the cello from drying out.\n\nInternally, the cello has two important features: a bass bar, which is glued to the underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden sound post, a solid wooden cylinder which is wedged between the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument's sound.\n\nCellos are constructed and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs call for the removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks side-to-side, the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular wood glue, because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a luthier.\n\nTraditionally, bows are made from pernambuco or brazilwood. Both come from the same species of tree (\"Caesalpinia echinata\"), but pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings to produce the cello's characteristic tone. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair. The tension on the bow is released when the instrument is not being used. The amount of tension a cellist puts on the bow hair depends on the preferences of the player, the style of music being played, and for students, the preferences of their teacher.\n\nBows are also made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and fiberglass (often used to make inexpensive, lower-quality student bows). An average cello bow is long (shorter than a violin or viola bow) high (from the frog to the stick) and wide. The frog of a cello bow typically has a rounded corner like that of a viola bow, but is wider. A cello bow is roughly heavier than a viola bow, which in turn is roughly heavier than a violin bow. \n\nBow hair is traditionally horsehair, though synthetic hair, in varying colors, is also used. Prior to playing, the musician tightens the bow by turning a screw to pull the frog (the part of the bow under the hand) back, and increase the tension of the hair. Rosin is applied by the player to make the hairs sticky. Bows need to be re-haired periodically. Baroque style (1600–1750) cello bows were much thicker and were formed with a larger outward arch when compared to modern cello bows. The inward arch of a modern cello bow produces greater tension, which in turn gives off a louder sound.\n\nThe cello bow has also been used to play electric guitars. Jimmy Page pioneered its application on tracks such as \"Dazed and Confused\". The post-rock Icelandic band Sigur Rós's lead singer often plays a guitar using a cello bow.\n\nIn 1989, the German cellist Michael Bach began developing a curved bow, encouraged by John Cage, Dieter Schnebel, Mstislav Rostropovich and Luigi Colani: and since then many pieces have been composed especially for it. This curved bow (\"BACH.Bow\") is a convex curved bow which, unlike the ordinary bow, renders possible polyphonic playing on the various strings of the instrument. The solo repertoire for violin and cello by J. S. Bach the BACH.Bow is particularly suited to it: and it was developed with this in mind, polyphonic playing being required, as well as monophonic.\n\nWhen a string is bowed or plucked, it vibrates and moves the air around it, producing sound waves. Because the string is quite thin, not much air is moved by the string itself, and consequently if the string was not mounted on a hollow body, the sound would be weak. In acoustic stringed instruments such as the cello, this lack of volume is solved by mounting the vibrating string on a larger hollow wooden body. The vibrations are transmitted to the larger body, which can move more air and produce a louder sound. Different designs of the instrument produces variations in the instrument’s vibrational patterns and thus changes the character of the sound produced. A string’s fundamental pitch can be adjusted by changing its stiffness, which depends on tension and length. Tightening a string stiffens it by increasing both the outward forces along its length and the net forces it experiences during a distortion. A cello can be tuned by adjusting the tension of its strings, by turning the tuning pegs mounted on its pegbox, and tension adjusters (fine tuners) on the tail piece.\n\nA string’s length also affects its fundamental pitch. Shortening a string stiffens it by increasing its curvature during a distortion and subjecting it to larger net forces. Shortening the string also reduces its mass, but does not alter the mass per unit length, and it is the latter ratio rather than the total mass which governs the frequency. The string vibrates in a standing wave whose speed of propagation is given by , where \"T\" is the tension and \"m\" is the mass per unit length; there is a node at either end of the vibrating length, and thus the vibrating length \"l\" is half a wavelength. Since the frequency of any wave is equal to the speed divided by the wavelength, we have frequency = . (Note that some writers, including Muncaster (cited below) use the Greek letter \"μ\" in place of \"m\".) Thus shortening a string increases the frequency, and thus the pitch. Because of this effect, you can raise and change the pitch of a string by pressing it against the fingerboard in the cello’s neck and effectively shortening it. Likewise strings with less mass per unit length, if under the same tension, will have a higher frequency and thus higher pitch than more massive strings. This is a prime reason why the different strings on all string instruments have different fundamental pitches, with the lightest strings having the highest pitches.\n\nA played note of E or F has a frequency which is often very close to the natural resonating frequency of the body of the instrument, and if the problem is not addressed this can set the body into near resonance. This may cause an unpleasant sudden amplification of this pitch, and additionally a loud beating sound results from the interference produced between these nearby frequencies; this is known as the “wolf tone” because it is an unpleasant growling sound. The wood resonance appears to be split into two frequencies by the driving force of the sounding string. These two periodic resonances beat with each other. This wolf tone must be eliminated or significantly reduced for the cello to play the nearby notes with a pleasant tone. This can be accomplished by modifying the cello front plate, attaching a wolf eliminator (a metal cylinder or a rubber cylinder encased in metal), or moving the sound post.\nWhen a string is bowed or plucked to produce a note, the fundamental note is accompanied by higher frequency overtones. Each sound has a particular recipe of frequencies that combine to make the total sound.\n\nPlaying the cello is done while seated with the instrument supported on the floor by the endpin. The left hand fingertips stop the strings on the fingerboard, determining the pitch of the fingered note. The right hand plucks or bows the strings to sound the notes. The left hand fingertips stop the strings along their length, determining the pitch of each fingered note. Stopping the string closer to the bridge results in higher-pitched sound, because the vibrating string length has been shortened. In the \"neck\" positions (which use just less than half of the fingerboard, nearest the top of the instrument), the thumb rests on the back of the neck; in \"thumb position\" (a general name for notes on the remainder of the fingerboard) the thumb usually rests alongside the fingers on the string and the side of the thumb is used to play notes. The fingers are normally held curved with each knuckle bent, with the fingertips in contact with the string. If a finger is required on two (or more) strings at once to play perfect fifths (in double stops or chords) it is used flat. In slower, or more expressive playing, the contact point can move slightly away from the nail to the pad of the finger, allowing a fuller vibrato.\n\nVibrato is a small oscillation in the pitch of a note, usually considered expressive. Harmonics played on the cello fall into two classes; natural and artificial. Natural harmonics are produced by lightly touching (but not depressing) the string with the finger at certain places, and then bowing (or, rarely, plucking) the string. For example, the halfway point of the string will produce a harmonic that is one octave above the unfingered (open) string. Natural harmonics only produce notes that are part of the harmonic series on a particular string. Artificial harmonics (also called false harmonics or stopped harmonics), in which the player depresses the string fully with one finger while touching the same string lightly with another finger, can produce any note above middle C. \nGlissando (Italian for \"sliding\") is an effect played by sliding the finger up or down the fingerboard without releasing the string. This causes the pitch to rise and fall smoothly, without separate, discernible steps.\n\nIn cello playing, the bow is much like the breath of a wind instrument player. Arguably, it is the major determinant in the expressiveness of the playing. The right hand holds the bow and controls the duration and character of the notes. The bow is drawn across the strings roughly halfway between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge, in a direction perpendicular to the strings. The bow is held with all five fingers of the right hand, the thumb opposite the fingers and closer to the cellist's body. Tone production and volume of sound depend on a combination of several factors. The three most important ones are: bow speed, weight applied to the string, and point of contact of the bow hair with the string.\n\nDouble stops involve the playing of two notes at the same time. Two strings are fingered simultaneously, and the bow is drawn so as to sound them both at once. In pizzicato playing, the string is plucked directly with the fingers or thumb. Pizzicato is often abbreviated as \"Pizz.\". Position of the hand is slightly over the finger board and away from the bridge.\n\nA player using the col legno technique strikes or rubs the strings with the wood of the bow rather than the hair. In spiccato playing, the strings are not \"drawn\" by the bow hair but struck by it, while still retaining some horizontal motion, to generate a more percussive, crisp sound. In staccato, the player moves the bow a small distance and stops it on the string, making a short sound, the rest of the written duration being taken up by silence. \nLegato is a technique where the notes are smoothly connected without accents or breaks. It is noted by a slur (curved line) above or below – depending on their position on the staff – the notes of the passage that is to be played legato.\n\n\"Sul ponticello\" (\"on the bridge\") refers to bowing closer to the bridge, while \"sul tasto\" (\"on the fingerboard\") calls for bowing nearer the end of the fingerboard. Sul tasto produces a more flute-like sound, with more emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the note, and softer overtones.\n\nStandard-sized cellos are referred to as \"full-size\" or \"\" but are also made in smaller (fractional) sizes (e.g. , , , , , , ). The fractions refer to volume rather than length, so a 1/2 size cello is much longer than half the length of a full size. The smaller cellos are identical to standard cellos in construction, range, and usage, but are simply scaled-down for the benefit of children and shorter adults.\n\nCellos in sizes larger than do exist, and cellists with unusually large hands may require such a non-standard instrument. Cellos made before approximately 1700 tended to be considerably larger than those made and commonly played today. Around 1680, changes in string-making technology made it possible to play lower-pitched notes on shorter strings. The cellos of Stradivari, for example, can be clearly divided into two models: the style made before 1702, characterized by larger instruments (of which only three exist in their original size and configuration), and the style made during and after 1707, when Stradivari began making smaller cellos. This later model is the design most commonly used by modern luthiers. The scale length of a cello is about . The new size offered fuller tonal projection and greater range of expression. The instrument in this form was able to contribute to more pieces musically and offered the possibility of greater physical dexterity for the player to develop technique.\n\nThere are many accessories for the cello.\n\n\n\nCellos are made by luthiers, specialists in building and repairing stringed instruments, ranging from guitars to violins. The following luthiers are notable for the cellos they have produced:\n\nA person who plays the cello is called a \"cellist\". For a list of notable cellists, see the list of cellists and .\n\nCareers in cello vary widely by genre and by region or country. Most cellists earn their living from a mixture of performance and teaching jobs. The first step to getting most performance jobs is by playing at an audition. In some styles of music, cellists may be asked to sight read printed music or perform standard repertoire with an ensemble.\n\nIn classical music, cellists audition for playing jobs in orchestras and for admission into university or Conservatory programs or degrees. At a classical cello audition, the performer typically plays a movement from a Bach suite or a movement from a concerto and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the Concertmaster, the Principal cellist and other principal players.\n\nThe most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a \"test week\", in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting.\n\nPerformance jobs include playing as a freelancer in small groups, playing in a chamber music group, large ensembles, or performing solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting (\"subbing\") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players to be able to find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.\n\nTeaching work for cellists includes giving private lessons in the home or at colleges and universities; coaching cellists who are preparing for recordings or auditions; doing group coaching at music camps or for youth ensembles; and working as a high school music teacher. Due to the limited number of full-time orchestral jobs, many classical cellists are not able to find full-time work with a single orchestra. Some cellists increase their employ-ability by learning several different styles, such as folk or pop.\n\nIn some cases, cellists supplement their performing and teaching income with other related music jobs, such as working as a stringed instrument repairer (luthier); as a contractor who hires musicians for orchestras or big bands, composing music, songwriting, conducting, or organizing festivals (e.g., Julian Armour).\n\nSpecific instruments are famous (or become famous) for a variety of reasons. An instrument's notability may arise from its age, the fame of its maker, its physical appearance, its acoustic properties, and its use by notable performers. The most famous instruments are generally known for all of these things. The most highly prized instruments are now collector's items, and are priced beyond the reach of most musicians. These instruments are typically owned by some kind of organization or investment group, which may loan the instrument to a notable performer. (For example, the Davidov Stradivarius, which is currently in the possession of one of the most widely known living cellists, Yo-Yo Ma, is actually owned by the Vuitton Foundation.)\n\nSome notable cellos:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While driving, they see three men chasing a prostitute down the street. She begs them to save her by letting her into the car, but Paul locks the doors and drives away as the three men savagely beat her, leaving her unconscious in the street. He refuses to let Hélène phone an ambulance, afraid of being charged with not helping a person in danger (which is a crime in France).\n\nHélène cannot forget the incident, and the next day she goes to the hospital, where she finds the prostitute, Noémie, in a coma. Moved, Hélène stops work and leaves her family responsibilities to stay with Noémie throughout her recovery, aiding her as she regains mobility and helping her to communicate since she can't yet speak. When one of the pimps returns to threaten and beat Noémie again into submission, Hélène follows him out of the hospital, knocks him unconscious with a wooden plank, and leaves him for the police to find.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul and Hélène's son Fabrice, a university student, is cheating on his girlfriend with another girl, who is pregnant. When his girlfriend discovers the truth, she destroys his apartment. He moves into Paul's apartment just as Hélène moves out, and the two girls follow him, much to Paul's chagrin.\n\nWhen Hélène returns home for a day, one of Noémie's pimps goes to the hospital with a friend and removes Noémie under the pretense that they are relatives taking her for a walk. Noémie, who still cannot speak, is unable to protest. Realising what has happened, she accosts the pimps on the street and takes Noémie to Paul's mother's house. There, Noémie recovers her ability to talk, and explains her life story:\n\nHer name is actually Malika, and she is a child of poor French-Algerian immigrants. At 17, her father attempted to sell her into an arrange marriage and she fled. She was picked up by a pimp, named Touki, on the street and he subsequently sold her into sexual slavery and had her hooked on heroin. She convinced Touki to move to Paris to speak to her step-mother and retrieve her passport. Her family kicked her out, and she formed plans to leave her life of forced prostitution behind. She sobered up and opened up an account with her sister, Zora's passport to put some money behind. She tried going to SOS Racism for help, but she was dismissed. She moved to Geneva and seduced a rich man and conned him into giving her all of his money and jewelry, just before he died. She and Touki returned to Paris with the money. However, the rich man's family went to the press with claims that their money was stolen from the bank. Her pimps found out that she laundered the money for herself and beat her into signing a proxy. She escaped, with Touki and the other two pimps chasing after her, which was when Hélène and her husband came across her in their car at the beginning.\n\nThe two women plan Malika's freedom and revenge on her abusers. Hélène tells Malika that her husband was the one who locked the doors of their car during her attack, but Malika doesn't care. Later, she manages to distract Paul at the Basel airport, who looking for his Hélène, and has sex with him. All three manage to get on the same flight back to Paris, with Malika keeping her distance, in order to avoid the police. Hélène finally stands up to the selfishness of her husband and son. Paul falls madly in love with Malika, going insane when she doesn't call. Fabrice also meets and falls in love with her.\n\nHélène and Malika set up the pimps and their gang to be arrested by the police. Touki is shot after trying to escape. Malika returns to her estranged family and tells her sister, Zora, that she will be forced into marriage as soon as she's old enough, just as Malika was at her age. To save her from a life of patriarchal misery, she begs her sister to come with her to live in freedom, but she refuses, saying she loves them.\n\nMalika meets up with Paul again and she takes him to his mother's house. When Zora is beaten by her sexist brothers, her father reveals that she will indeed be married to an older man soon. Malika and Hélène rush to Marseilles and stop Malika's father from sending Zora off to a forced marriage. Her father curses her and she replies that it is the first time he has ever given her anything. The film ends with Malika, Hélène, Zora and Paul's mother sitting on a bench gazing at the sun.\n\n\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 52 reviews. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the film a score of 81 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"gripping feminist fable with a savage comic edge\".\n\n"}
{"id": "52847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52847", "title": "Children's literature", "text": "Children's literature\n\nChildren's literature or juvenile literature includes stories, books, magazines, and poems that are enjoyed by children. Modern children's literature is classified in two different ways: genre or the intended age of the reader.\n\nChildren's literature can be traced to stories and songs, part of a wider oral tradition, that adults shared with children before publishing existed. The development of early children's literature, before printing was invented, is difficult to trace. Even after printing became widespread, many classic \"children's\" tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience. Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children, often with a moral or religious message. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is known as the \"Golden Age of Children's Literature\", because many classic children's books were published then.\n\nThere is no single or widely used definition of children's literature. It can be broadly defined as anything that children read or more specifically defined as fiction, non-fiction, poetry, or drama intended for and used by children and young people. One writer on children's literature defines it as \"all books written for children, excluding works such as comic books, joke books, cartoon books, and non-fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference materials\". However, others would argue that comics should also be included: \"Children's Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children\".\n\nThe \"International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\" notes that \"the boundaries of genre ... are not fixed but blurred\". Sometimes, no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children. Some works defy easy categorization. J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series was written and marketed for young adults, but it is also popular among adults. The series' extreme popularity led \"The New York Times\" to create a separate best-seller list for children's books.\n\nDespite the widespread association of children's literature with picture books, spoken narratives existed before printing, and the root of many children's tales go back to ancient storytellers. Seth Lerer, in the opening of \"Children's Literature: A Reader's History from Aesop to Harry Potter\", says, \"This book presents a history of what children have heard and read ... The history I write of is a history of \"reception\".\"\n\nEarly children's literature consisted of spoken stories, songs, and poems that were used to educate, instruct, and entertain children.\nIt was only in the eighteenth century, with the development of the concept of childhood, that a separate genre of children's literature began to emerge, with its own divisions, expectations, and canon. The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs--often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters. \n\nIn 1962, French historian Philippe Ariès argues in his book \"Centuries of Childhood\" that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times. He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment. As evidence for this position, he notes that, apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by clerics like the Venerable Bede and Ælfric of Eynsham, there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the 18th century.\n\nOther scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values, attitudes, and information necessary for children within their cultures, such as the \"Play of Daniel\" from the 12th century. Pre-modern children's literature, therefore, tended to be of a didactic and moralistic nature, with the purpose of conveying conduct-related, educational and religious lessons.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them. The English philosopher John Locke developed his theory of the tabula rasa in his 1690 \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\". In Locke's philosophy, \"tabula rasa\" was the theory that the (human) mind is at birth a \"blank slate\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with \"easy pleasant books\" to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them; \"children may be cozen'd into a knowledge of the letters; be taught to read, without perceiving it to be anything but a sport, and play themselves into that which others are whipp'd for.\" He also suggested that picture books be created for children.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, a few children's titles became famous as classroom reading texts. Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults's 1697 \"Tales of Mother Goose\". The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals. \n\nAnother influence on this shift in attitudes came from Puritanism, which stressed the importance of individual salvation. Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children, and there was a large growth in the publication of \"good godly books\" aimed squarely at children. Some of the most popular works were by James Janeway, but the most enduring book from this movement, still read today, especially In modernised versions, is \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" (1678) by John Bunyan.\n\nChapbooks, pocket-sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched, were published in Britain; illustrated by woodblock printing, these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular ballads, historical re-tellings, and folk tales. Though not specifically published for children at this time, young people enjoyed the booklets as well. Johanna Bradley says, in \"From Chapbooks to Plum Cake\", that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict Puritan influence of the time.\n\nHornbooks also appeared in England during this time, teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the Lord's Prayer. These were brought from England to the American colonies in the mid-17th century. The first such book was a catechism for children written in verse by the Puritan John Cotton. Known as \"Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes\", it was published in 1646, appearing both in England and Boston. Another early book, \"The New England Primer\", was in print by 1691 and used in schools for 100 years. The primer begins, \"In Adam's fall We sinned all ...\", and continues through the alphabet. It also contained religious maxims, acronyms, spelling help and other educational items, all decorated by woodcuts.\n\nIn 1634, the \"Pentamerone\" from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales. Charles Perrault began recording fairy tales in France, publishing his first collection in 1697. They were not well received among the French literary society, who saw them as only fit for old people and children. In 1658, Jan Ámos Comenius in Bohemia published the informative illustrated \"Orbis Pictus\", for children under six learning to read. It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children.\n\nThe first Danish children's book was \"The Child's Mirror\" by Niels Bredal in 1568, an adaptation of a Courtesy book by the Dutch priest Erasmus. \"A Pretty and Splendid Maiden's Mirror\", an adaptation of a German book for young women, became the first Swedish children's book upon its 1591 publication. Sweden published fables and a children's magazine by 1766.\n\nIn Italy, Giovanni Francesco Straparola released \"The Facetious Nights of Straparola\" in the 1550s. Called the first European storybook to contain fairy-tales, it eventually had 75 separate stories and written for an adult audience. Giulio Cesare Croce also borrowed from stories children enjoyed for his books.\n\nRussia's earliest children's books, primers, appeared in the late 16th century. An early example is \"ABC-Book\", an alphabet book published by Ivan Fyodorov in 1571. The first picture book published in Russia, Karion Istomin's \"The Illustrated Primer\", appeared in 1694. Peter the Great's interest in modernizing his country through Westernization helped Western children's literature dominate the field through the 18th century. Catherine the Great wrote allegories for children, and during her reign, Nikolai Novikov started the first juvenile magazine in Russia.\n\nThe modern children's book emerged in mid-18th-century England. A growing polite middle-class and the influence of Lockean theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept. \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\", written and published by John Newbery, is widely considered the first modern children's book, published in 1744. It was a landmark as the first children's publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children, containing a mixture of rhymes, picture stories and games for pleasure. Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children's good behavior than physical discipline, and the child was to record his or her behavior daily.\n\nThe book was child–sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children—something new in the publishing industry. Known as gift books, these early books became the precursors to the toy books popular in the 19th century. Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre. According to the journal \"The Lion and the Unicorn\", \"Newbery's genius was in developing the fairly new product category, children's books, through his frequent advertisements ... and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children's books.\"\n\nThe improvement in the quality of books for children, as well as the diversity of topics he published, helped make Newbery the leading producer of children's books in his time. He published his own books as well as those by authors such as Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith; the latter may have written \"The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes\", Newbery's most popular book.\n\nAnother philosopher who influenced the development of children's literature was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously. His idea of appealing to a children's natural interests took hold among writers for children. Popular examples included Thomas Day's \"The History of Sandford and Merton\", four volumes that embody Rousseau's theories. Furthermore, Maria and Richard Lovell Edgeworth's \"Practical Education: The History of Harry and Lucy\" (1780) urged children to teach themselves.\n\nRousseau's ideas also had great influence in Germany, especially on German Philanthropism, a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children. Its founder, Johann Bernhard Basedow, authored \"Elementarwerk\" as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by Daniel Chodowiecki. Another follower, Joachim Heinrich Campe, created an adaptation of \"Robinson Crusoe\" that went into over 100 printings. He became Germany's \"outstanding and most modern\" writer for children. According to Hans-Heino Ewers in \"The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\", \"It can be argued that from this time, the history of European children's literature was largely written in Germany.\"\n\nThe Brothers Grimm preserved and published the traditional tales told in Germany. They were so popular in their home country that modern, realistic children's literature began to be looked down on there. This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century. The Grimms's contribution to children's literature goes beyond their collection of stories, as great as that is. As professors, they had a scholarly interest in the stories, striving to preserve them and their variations accurately, recording their sources. \n\nA similar project was carried out by the Norwegian scholars Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as \"Norwegian Folktales\", often referred to as \"Asbjørnsen and Moe\". By compiling these stories, they preserved Norway's literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language.\n\nDanish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen traveled through Europe and gathered many well-known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre. \n\nIn Switzerland, Johann David Wyss published \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" in 1812, with the aim of teaching children about family values, good husbandry, the uses of the natural world and self-reliance. The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by Isabelle de Montolieu.\n\nE. T. A. Hoffmann's tale \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" was published in 1816 in a German collection of stories for children, \"Kinder-Märchen\". It is the first modern short story to introduce bizarre, odd and grotesque elements in children's literature and thereby anticipates Lewis Carroll's tale, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". There are not only parallels concerning the content (the weird adventures of a young girl in a fantasy land), but also the origin of the tales as both are dedicated and given to a daughter of the author's friends.\n\nThe shift to a modern genre of children's literature occurred in the mid-19th century; didacticism of a previous age began to make way for more humorous, child-oriented books, more attuned to the child's imagination. The availability of children's literature greatly increased as well, as paper and printing became widely available and affordable, the population grew and literacy rates improved.\n\n\"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes appeared in 1857, and is considered to be the founding book in the school story tradition. However, it was Lewis Carroll's fantasy, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", published in 1865 in England, that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one. Regarded as the first \"English masterpiece written for children\" and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature, its publication opened the \"First Golden Age\" of children's literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early 1900s. Another important book of that decade was \"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\", by Reverend Charles Kingsley (1862), which became extremely popular in England, and remains a classic of British children's literature.\n\nIn 1883, Carlo Collodi wrote the first Italian fantasy novel, \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\", which was translated many times. In that same year, Emilio Salgari, the man who would become \"the adventure writer par excellence for the young in Italy\" first published his legendary character \"Sandokan\". In Britain, \"The Princess and the Goblin\" and its sequel \"The Princess and Curdie\", by George MacDonald, appeared in 1872 and 1883, and the adventure stories \"Treasure Island\" and \"Kidnapped\", both by Robert Louis Stevenson, were extremely popular in the 1880s. Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book\" was first published in 1894, and J. M. Barrie told the story of Peter Pan in the novel \"Peter and Wendy\" in 1911. Johanna Spyri's two-part novel \"Heidi\" was published in Switzerland in 1880 and 1881. In the US, children's publishing entered a period of growth after the American Civil War in 1865. Boys' book writer Oliver Optic published over 100 books. In 1868, the \"epoch-making book\" \"Little Women\", the fictionalized autobiography of Louisa May Alcott, was published. This \"coming of age\" story established the genre of realistic family books in the United States. Mark Twain released \"Tom Sawyer\" in 1876, and in 1880 another bestseller, \"\", a collection of African American folk tales adapted and compiled by Joel Chandler Harris, appeared.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a plethora of children's novels began featuring realistic, non-magical plotlines. Certain titles received international success such as Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" (1883), L.M. Montgomery's \"Anne of Green Gables\" (1908), and Louisa May Alcott's \"Little Women\" (1869) \n\nThe Chinese Revolution of 1911 and World War II brought political and social change that revolutionized children's literature in China. Western science, technology, and literature became fashionable. China's first modern publishing firm, Commercial Press, established several children's magazines, which included \"Youth Magazine\", and \"Educational Pictures for Children\". The first Chinese children's writer was Sun Yuxiu, an editor of Commercial Press, whose story \"The Kingdom Without a Cat\" was written in the language of the time instead of the classical style used previously. Yuxiu encouraged novelist Shen Dehong to write for children as well. Dehong went on to rewrite 28 stories based on classical Chinese literature specifically for children. In 1932, Zhang Tianyi published \"Big Lin and Little Lin\", the first full-length Chinese novel for children.\n\nThe Chinese Revolution of 1949 changed children's literature again. Many children's writers were denounced, but Tianyi and Ye Shengtao continued to write for children and created works that aligned with Maoist ideology. The 1976 death of Mao Zedong provoked more changes that swept China. Many writers from the early part of the century were brought back, and their work became available again. In 1990, \"General Anthology of Modern Children's Literature of China\", a fifteen-volume anthology of children's literature since the 1920s, was released.\n\nLiterature for children developed as a separate category of literature especially in the Victorian era. Some works became internationally known, such as those of Lewis Carroll, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865) and its sequel \"Through the Looking-Glass\". At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, Beatrix Potter was an author and illustrator, best known for her children's books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published \"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\" in 1902. Potter eventually went on to publish 23 children's books and become a wealthy woman. Michael O. Tunnell and James S. Jacobs, professors of children’s literature at Brigham Young University, write, \"Potter was the first to use pictures as well as words to tell the story, incorporating coloured illustration with text, page for page.\" Another classic of the period is Anna Sewell's animal novel \"Black Beauty\" (1877).\n\nIn the latter years of the 19th century, precursors of the modern picture book were illustrated books of poems and short stories produced by English illustrators Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, and Kate Greenaway. These had a larger proportion of pictures to words than earlier books, and many of their pictures were in colour. Some British artists made their living illustrating novels and children's books; among them were Arthur Rackham, Cicely Mary Barker, W. Heath Robinson, Henry J. Ford, John Leech, and George Cruikshank.\n\nThe Kailyard school of Scottish writers, notably J. M. Barrie, creator of \"Peter Pan\" (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, Kenneth Grahame wrote the children's classic \"The Wind in the Willows\" and the Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell's first book \"Scouting for Boys\" was published. Inspiration for Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel \"The Secret Garden\" (1910) was the Great Maytham Hall Garden in Kent. In 1920 Hugh Lofting created the character Doctor Dolittle who appears in a series of twelve books.\n\nThe Golden Age of Children's Literature ended with World War I in Great Britain and Europe, and the period before World War II was much slower in children's publishing. The main exceptions in England were the publications of \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" by A. A. Milne in 1926, the first \"Mary Poppins\" book by P. L. Travers in 1934, \"The Hobbit\" by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1937, and the Arthurian novel \"The Sword in the Stone\" by T. H. White in 1938.\n\nChildren's paperback books were first released in England in 1940 under the Puffin Books imprint, and their lower prices helped make book buying possible for children during World War II.\n\nEnid Blyton's books have been among the world's best-sellers since the 1930s, selling more than 600 million copies. Blyton's books are still enormously popular, and have been translated into almost 90 languages. She wrote on a wide range of topics including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives and is best remembered today for her Noddy, The Famous Five, The Secret Seven, and The Adventure Series. The first of these children's stories, \"Five on a Treasure Island\", was published in 1942.\n\nIn the 1950s, the book market in Europe began recovering from the effects of two world wars. An informal literary discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the \"Inklings\". Its leading members were the major fantasy novelists; C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. C. S. Lewis published the first installment of \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series in 1950 while Tolkien is best known in addition to \"The Hobbit\" as the author of \"The Lord of the Rings\". (1954) Another significant writer of fantasy stories is Alan Garner author of \"Elidor\" (1965), and \"The Owl Service\" (1967). The latter work is an adaptation of the myth of Blodeuwedd from the \"Mabinogion\", set in modern Wales, and for it Garner won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British author.\n\nMary Norton wrote \"The Borrowers\" (1952), featuring tiny people who borrow from humans. Dodie Smith's \"The Hundred and One Dalmatians\" was published in 1956. Philippa Pearce's \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" (1958) has him opening the garden door at night and entering into a different age. The heroine of \"Charlotte Sometimes\" by Penelope Farmer (1969) is already shaken by her arrival in a girls' boarding school when she finds herself waking as another girl in the same bed, but decades earlier. Closer to reality, Jenny in \"No One Must Know\" (1962) by Barbara Sleigh is a newcomer in the street who faces a landlord's pet ban. She needs urgent help from nearby children to hide her cat and kittens.\n\nRoald Dahl rose to prominence with his children's fantasy novels, often inspired from experiences from his childhood, with often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour. Dahl was inspired to write \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964), featuring the eccentric candymaker Willy Wonka, having grown up near two chocolate makers in England who often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies into the other's factory. His other works include \"James and the Giant Peach\" (1961), \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (1971), \"The Witches\" (1983), and \"Matilda\" (1988). Starting in 1958, Michael Bond published humorous stories about Paddington Bear.\n\nBoarding schools in literature are centred on older pre-adolescent and adolescent school life, and are most commonly set in English boarding schools. Popular school stories from this period include Ronald Searle's \"St Trinian's\" (1949–53) and his illustrations for Geoffrey Willans's \"Molesworth\" series, Jill Murphy's \"The Worst Witch\" and the \"Jennings\" series by Anthony Buckeridge.\n\nRuth Manning-Sanders collected and retold fairy tales, and her first work \"A Book of Giants\" contains a number of famous giants, notably \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". Susan Cooper's \"The Dark Is Rising\" is a five-volume fantasy saga set in England and Wales. Raymond Briggs' children's picture book \"The Snowman\" (1978) has been adapted as an animation, shown every Christmas on British television, and for the stage as a musical. The Reverend. W. Awdry and son Christopher's \"The Railway Series\" features \"Thomas the Tank Engine\". Margery Sharp's series \"The Rescuers\" is based on a heroic mouse organisation. The third Children's Laureate Michael Morpurgo published \"War Horse\" in 1982. The prolific children's author Dick King-Smith's novels include \"The Sheep-Pig\" (1984), and \"The Water Horse\". Diana Wynne Jones wrote the young adult fantasy novel \"Howl's Moving Castle\" in 1986. Anthony Horowitz's \"Alex Rider\" series begins with \"Stormbreaker\" (2000). Cressida Cowell's \"How to Train Your Dragon\" series were published between 2003 and 2015.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" fantasy series is a sequence of seven novels that chronicle the adventures of the adolescent wizard Harry Potter. The series began with \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" in 1997 and ended with the seventh and final book \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" in 2007; becoming the best selling book-series in history. The series has been translated into 67 languages, placing Rowling among the most translated authors in history.\n\nAdventure stories written specifically for children began in the 19th century. Early examples include Johann David Wyss' \"The Swiss Family Robinson\" (1812), Frederick Marryat's \"The Children of the New Forest\" (1847) and Harriet Martineau's \"The Peasant and the Prince\" (1856).\n\nThe Victorian era saw the development of the genre, with W.H.G. Kingston, R. M. Ballantyne and G. A. Henty specializing in the production of adventure fiction for boys. This inspired writers who normally catered to adult audiences to write for children, and an example is Robert Louis Stevenson's (1850–94) classic pirate story \"Treasure Island\" (1883).\n\nIn the years after the First World War, writers such as Arthur Ransome (1884–1967) developed the adventure genre by setting the adventure in Britain rather than distant countries. Ransome began publishing in 1930 his Swallows and Amazons series of children's books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the English Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. Many of the books involve sailing; fishing and camping are other common subjects. Biggles was a popular series of adventure books for young boys, about James Bigglesworth, a fictional pilot and adventurer, by W. E. Johns. Biggles made his first appearance in the story \"The White Fokker\", published in the first issue of \"Popular Flying\" magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, \"The Camels Are Coming\" (both 1932). Johns continued to write Biggles books until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time. These included novels about a woman pilot in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), Flight Officer Joan Worralson, better known as \"Worrals\".\n\nGeoffrey Trease and Rosemary Sutcliff brought a new sophistication to the historical adventure novel. Philip Pullman in the Sally Lockhart novels and Julia Golding in the Cat Royal series have continued the tradition of the historical adventure.\n\nAn important aspect of British children's literature has been comic books and magazines. Amongst the most popular comics have been \"The Dandy\" and \"The Beano\". Important early magazines or story papers for older children were the \"Boys Own Paper\", which was published from 1879 to 1967 and \"The Girl's Own Paper\" published from 1880 until 1956. Other story papers for older boys were \"The Hotspur\" (1933 to 1959) and \"The Rover\"–which started in 1922 and was absorbed into \"Adventure\" in 1961 and \"The Wizard\" in 1963, and eventually folded in 1973.\n\nMany prominent authors contributed to the \"Boys Own Paper\": cricketer W.G. Grace wrote for several issues, along with authors Arthur Conan Doyle, Jules Verne and R.M. Ballantyne, as well as Robert Baden-Powell, the inspiration for the Scout Movement, Between 1941–61 there was 60 issues with stories about Biggles by W. E. Johns, and in the 1960s occasional contributors included Isaac Asimov and the respected astronomer Patrick Moore.\n\nMany contributors to \"The Girls Own Paper\" were not known outside the paper's pages but they also included Noel Streatfeild, Eleanor Hoyt Brainerd, Rosa Nouchette Carey, Sarah Doudney (1841–1926), Angela Brazil, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Richmal Crompton, Fanny Fern, and Baroness Orczy. Between 1940–47 Captain W. E. Johns contributed sixty stories featuring the female pilot Worrals.\n\nThe \"Eagle\" was a popular British comic for boys, launched in 1950 by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, \"Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future\", created with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included \"Riders of the Range\" and \"P.C. 49\". \"Eagle\" also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale. It was first published from 1950 to 1969, and relaunched from 1982 to 1994.\n\nChildren's literature has been a part of American culture since Europeans first settled in America. The earliest books were used as tools to instill self-control in children and preach a life of morality in Puritan society. 18th-century American youth began to shift away from the social upbringing of its European counterpart, bringing about a change in children's literature. It was in this time that \"A Little Book for Little Children\" was written by T.W. in 1712. It includes what is thought to be the earliest nursery rhyme and one of the earliest examples of a text book approaching education from the child's point of view, rather than the adult's.\n\nOne of the most famous books of American children's literature is L. Frank Baum's fantasy novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\", published in 1900. \"By combining the English fondness for word play with the American appetite for outdoor adventure\", Connie Epstein in \"International Companion Encyclopedia Of Children's Literature\" says Baum \"developed an original style and form that stands alone\". Baum wrote fourteen more Oz novels, and other writers continued the Oz series into the twenty-first century.\n\nDemand continued to grow in North America between World War I and World War II, helped by the growth of libraries in both Canada and the United States. Children's reading rooms in libraries, staffed by specially trained librarians, helped create demand for classic juvenile books. Reviews of children's releases began appearing regularly in \"Publishers Weekly\" and in \"The Bookman\" magazine began to regularly publish reviews of children's releases, and the first Children's Book Week was launched in 1919. In that same year, Louise Seaman Bechtel became the first person to head a juvenile book publishing department in the country. She was followed by May Massee in 1922, and Alice Dalgliesh in 1934.\n\nThe American Library Association began awarding the Newbery Medal, the first children's book award, in 1922. The Caldecott Medal for illustration followed in 1938. The first book by Laura Ingalls Wilder about her life on the American frontier, \"Little House in the Big Woods\" appeared in 1932. In 1937 Dr. Seuss published his first book, entitled, \"And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street\". The young adult book market developed during this period, thanks to sports books by popular writer John R. Tunis', the novel \"Seventeenth Summer\" by Maureen Daly, and the \"Sue Barton\" nurse book series by Helen Dore Boylston.\n\nThe already vigorous growth in children's books became a boom in the 1950s, and children's publishing became big business. In 1952, American journalist E. B. White published \"Charlotte's Web\", which was described as \"one of the very few books for young children that face, squarely, the subject of death\". Maurice Sendak illustrated more than two dozen books during the decade, which established him as an innovator in book illustration. The Sputnik crisis that began in 1957, provided increased interest and government money for schools and libraries to buy science and math books and the non-fiction book market \"seemed to materialize overnight\".\n\nThe 1960s saw an age of new realism in children's books emerge. Given the atmosphere of social revolution in 1960s America, authors and illustrators began to break previously established taboos in children's literature. Controversial subjects dealing with alcoholism, death, divorce, and child abuse were now being published in stories for children. Maurice Sendak's \"Where the Wild Things Are\" in 1963 and Louise Fitzhugh's \"Harriet the Spy\" in 1964 are often considered the first stories published in this new age of realism.\n\nEsther Forbes in \"Johnny Tremain\" (1943) and Mildred D. Taylor in \"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\" (1976) continued the tradition of the historical adventure in an American setting. The modern children's adventure novel sometimes deals with controversial issues like terrorism, as in Robert Cormier's \"After the First Death\" in 1979, and warfare in the Third World, as in Peter Dickinson's \"AK\" in 1990.\n\nIn books for a younger age group, Bill Martin and John Archambault's \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" (1979) presented a new spin on the alphabet book. Laura Numeroff published \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" in 1985 and went on to create a series of similarly named books that is still popular for children and adults to read together.\n\nLloyd Alexander's The Chronicles of Prydain (1964-1968) was set in a fictionalized version of medieval Britain.\n\nThe period from 1890 until World War I is considered the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Scandinavia. Erik Werenskiold, Theodor Kittelsen, and Dikken Zwilgmeyer were especially popular, writing folk and fairy tales as well as realistic fiction. The 1859 translation into English by George Webbe Dasent helped increase the stories' influence. One of the most influential and internationally most successful Scandinavian children's books from this period is Selma Lagerlöfs \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\". Astrid Lindgren (\"Pippi Longstocking\") and Jostein Gaarder (\"Sophie's World\") are two of the best-known Scandinavian writers internationally.\n\nThe interwar period saw a slow-down in output similar to Britain, although \"one of the first mysteries written specifically for children,\" \"Emil and the Detectives\" by Erich Kästner, was published in Germany in 1930. German writers Michael Ende (\"The Neverending Story\") and Cornelia Funke (\"Inkheart\") achieved international success with their fantasy books.\n\nThe period during and following World War II became the Classical Age of the picture book in Switzerland, with works by Alois Carigiet, Felix Hoffmann, and Hans Fischer. 1963 was the first year of the Bologna Children's Book Fair in Italy, which was described as \"the most important international event dedicated to the children's publishing\". For four days it brings together writers, illustrators, publishers, and book buyers from around the world.\n\nSwiss author Marcus Pfister's \"Rainbow Fish\" series has received international acclaim since 1992.\n\nRussian folktales were collected by Aleksandr Afanasyev in his three volume \"Narodnye russkie skazki\", and a selection of these were published in \"Русские детские сказки\" (Russian Children's Fairy Tales) in 1871. By the 1860s, literary realism and non-fiction dominated children's literature. More schools were started, using books by writers like Konstantin Ushinsky and Leo Tolstoy, whose \"Russian Reader\" included an assortment of stories, fairy tales, and fables. Books written specifically for girls developed in the 1870s and 1880s. Publisher and journalist Evgenia Tur wrote about the daughters of well-to-do landowners, while Alexandra Nikitichna Annenskaya's stories told of middle-class girls working to support themselves. Vera Zhelikhovsky, Elizaveta Kondrashova, and Nadezhda Lukhmanova also wrote for girls during this period.\n\nChildren's non-fiction gained great importance in Russia at the beginning of the century. A ten-volume children's encyclopedia was published between 1913 and 1914. Vasily Avenarius wrote fictionalized biographies of important people like Nikolai Gogol and Alexander Pushkin around the same time, and scientists wrote for books and magazines for children. Children's magazines flourished, and by the end of the century there were 61. Lidia Charskaya and continued the popularity of girls' fiction. Realism took a gloomy turn by frequently showing the maltreatment of children from lower classes. The most popular boys' material was Sherlock Holmes, and similar stories from detective magazines.\n\nThe state took control of children's literature during the October Revolution. Maksim Gorky edited the first children's, \"Northern Lights\", under Soviet rule. People often label the 1920s as the Golden Age of Children's Literature in Russia. Samuil Marshak led that literary decade as the \"founder of (Soviet) children's literature\". As head of the children's section of the State Publishing House and editor of several children's magazines, Marshak exercised enormous influence by recruiting Boris Pasternak and Osip Mandelstam to write for children.\n\nIn 1932, professional writers in the Soviet Union formed the USSR Union of Writers, which served as the writer's organization of the Communist Party. With a children's branch, the official oversight of the professional organization brought children's writers under the control of the state and the police. Communist principles like collectivism and solidarity became important themes in children's literature. Authors wrote biographies about revolutionaries like Lenin and Pavlik Morozov. Alexander Belyayev, who wrote in the 1920s and 1930s, became Russia's first science fiction writer. According to Ben Hellman in the \"International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\", \"war was to occupy a prominent place in juvenile reading, partly compensating for the lack of adventure stories\", during the Soviet Period. More political changes in Russia after World War II brought further change in children's literature. Today, the field is in a state of flux because some older authors are being rediscovered and others are being abandoned.\n\nIn Brazil, Monteiro Lobato wrote a series of 23 books for children known as Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (The Yellow Woodpecker Ranch), between 1920 and 1940. The series is considered representative of Brazilian children's literature and the Brazilian equivalent to children's classics such as C. S. Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. The concept was introduced in Monteiro Lobato's 1920 short story \"A Menina do Narizinho Arrebitado\", and was later republished as the first chapter of \"Reinações de Narizinho\", which is the first novel of the series. The main setting is the \"Sítio do Picapau Amarelo\", where a boy (Pedrinho), a girl (Narizinho) and their living and thinking anthropomorphic toys enjoy exploring adventures in fantasy, discovery and learning. On several occasions, they leave the ranch to explore other worlds such as Neverland, the mythological Ancient Greece, an underwater world known as \"Reino das Águas Claras\" (Clear Waters Kingdom), and even the outer space. The \"Sítio\" is often symbolized by the character of Emília, Lobato's most famous creation.\n\nChristian missionaries first established the Calcutta School-Book Society in the 19th century, creating a separate genre for children's literature in that country. Magazines and books for children in native languages soon appeared. In the latter half of the century, Raja Shivprasad wrote several well-known books in Hindustani. A number of respected Bengali writers began producing Bengali literature for children including Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, who translated some stories and wrote others himself. Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore wrote plays, stories, and poems for children, including one work illustrated by painter Nandalal Bose. They worked from the end of the 19th century into the beginning of the 20th century. Tagore's work was later translated into English, with Bose's pictures. Behari Lal Puri was the earliest writer for children in Punjabi. His stories were didactic in nature.\n\nThe first full-length children's book was \"Khar Khar Mahadev\" by Narain Dixit, which was serialized in one of the popular children's magazines in 1957. Other writers include Premchand, and poet Sohan Lal Dwivedi. In 1919, Sukumar Ray wrote and illustrated nonsense rhymes in the Bengali language, and children's writer and artist Abanindranath Tagore finished \"Barngtarbratn\". Bengali children's literature flourished in the later part of the twentieth century. Educator Gijubhai Badheka published over 200 books in the Children's literature in Gujarati language, and many of them are still popular. Other popular Gujarati children's authors were Ramanlal Soni and Jivram Joshi. In 1957, political cartoonist K. Shankar Pillai founded the Children's Book Trust publishing company. The firm became known for high quality children's books, and many of them were released in several languages. One of the most distinguished writers is Pandit Krushna Chandra Kar in Oriya literature, who wrote many good books for children, including \"Pari Raija\", \"Kuhuka Raija\", \"Panchatantra\", and \"Adi Jugara Galpa Mala\". He wrote biographies of many historical personalities, such as \"Kapila Deva\". In 1978, the firm organized a writers' competition to encourage quality children's writing. The following year, the Children's Book Trust began a writing workshop and organized the First International Children's Book Fair in New Delhi. Children's magazines, available in many languages, were widespread throughout India during this century.\n\nOne of the pioneering children's writer in Persian was Mehdi Azar-Yazdi. His award-winning work, \"Good Stories for Good Children\", is a collection of stories derived from the stories in Classical Persian literature re-written for children.\n\nOriginally, for centuries, stories were told by Africans in their native languages, many being told during social gatherings. Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom. These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally. Since its Independence in 1960, Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children's literature by its people, the past three decades contributing the most to the genre. Most children's books depict the African culture and lifestyle, and trace their roots to traditional folktales, riddles, and proverbs. Authors who have produced such works include Chinua Achebe, Cyprian Ekwensi, Amos Tutuola, Flora Nwapa, and Buchi Emecheta. Publishing companies also aided in the development of children's literature.\n\nChildren's literature can be divided into categories, either according to genre or the intended age of the reader.\nA literary genre is a category of literary compositions. Genres may be determined by technique, tone, content, or length. According to Anderson, there are six categories of children's literature (with some significant subgenres):\n\nThe criteria for these divisions are vague, and books near a borderline may be classified either way. Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language, use large print, and have many illustrations. Books for older children use increasingly complex language, normal print, and fewer (if any) illustrations. The categories with an age range are listed below:\n\nPictures have always accompanied children's stories. A papyrus from Byzantine Egypt, shows illustrations accompanied by the story of Hercules' labors. Modern children's books are illustrated in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature, except in graphic novels. Generally, artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers (especially pre-literate children). Children's picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children. Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations, they continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books.\n\nAccording to Joyce Whalley in \"The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children's Literature\", \"an illustrated book differs from a book with illustrations in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text.\" Using this definition, the first illustrated children's book is considered to be \"Orbis Pictus\" which was published in 1658 by the Moravian author Comenius. Acting as a kind of encyclopedia,\"Orbis Pictus\" had a picture on every page, followed by the name of the object in Latin and German. It was translated into English in 1659 and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for years.\n\nEarly children's books, such as \"Orbis Pictus\", were illustrated by woodcut, and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story. Newer processes, including copper and steel engraving were first used in the 1830s. One of the first uses of Chromolithography (a way of making multi-colored prints) in a children's book was demonstrated in \"Struwwelpeter\", published in Germany in 1845. English illustrator Walter Crane refined its use in children's books in the late 19th century. \n\nAnother method of creating illustrations for children's books was etching, used by George Cruikshank in the 1850s. By the 1860s, top artists were illustrating for children, including Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and John Tenniel. Most pictures were still black-and-white, and many color pictures were hand colored, often by children. \"The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators\" credits Caldecott with \"The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization\".\n\nTwentieth-century artists such as Kay Nielson, Edmund Dulac, and Arthur Rackham produced illustrations that are still reprinted today. Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children's books. After World War II, offset lithography became more refined, and painter-style illustrations, such as Brian Wildsmith's were common by the 1950s.\n\nProfessional organizations, dedicated publications, individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children's literature. Scholarship in children's literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields: literary studies/cultural studies (literature and language departments and humanities), library and information science, and education. (Wolf, et al., 2011).\n\nTypically, children's literature scholars from literature departments in universities (English, German, Spanish, etc. departments), cultural studies, or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books. This literary criticism may focus on an author, a thematic or topical concern, genre, period, or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances (poststructural, postcolonial, New Criticism, psychoanalytic, new historicism, etc.). Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals.\n\nThe field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children's literature.\n\nMost educational researchers studying children's literature explore issues related to the use of children's literature in classroom settings. They may also study topics such as home use, children's out-of-school reading, or parents' use of children's books. Teachers typically use children's literature to augment classroom instruction.\n\nControversies often emerge around the content and characters of prominent children’s books. Well-known classics that remain popular throughout decades commonly become criticized by critics and readers as the values of contemporary culture change. Critical analysis of children’s literature is common through children's literary journals as well as published collections of essays contributed to by psychoanalysts, scholars and various literary critics such as Peter Hunt.\n\nPopular classics such as \"The Secret Garden\", \"Pippi Longstocking\", \"Peter Pan\", \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" have been criticized for their racial stereotyping.\n\nThe academic journal \"Children’s Literature Review\" provides critical analysis of many well known children’s books. In its 114th volume, the journal discuses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist Herge’s \"Tintin\" series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo.\n\nAfter the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of 1881 and 1914 there was a large production of children's literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent. This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources. Resulting in a new age of books which put a “gloss” on imperialism and its teachings at the time. Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals, savages and un human like. Therefor needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals. Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves.  Examples of these books include:\n\n\n\"The Five Chinese Brothers\", written by Claire Huchet Bishop and illustrated by Kurt Wiese has been criticized for its stereotypical caricatures of Chinese people. Helen Bannerman’s \"The Story of Little Black Sambo\" and Florence Kate Upton’s \"The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg\" have also been noted for their racist and controversial depictions. The term \"sambo\", a racial slur from the American South caused a widespread banning of Bannerman's book. Author Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney revised the story as \"Sam and the Tigers: A New Telling of Little Black Sambo\", making its content more appropriate and empowering for ethnic minority children. Feminist theologian Dr. Eske Wollrad claimed Astrid Lindgren's \"Pippi Longstocking\" novels \"have colonial racist stereotypes\", urging parents to skip specific offensive passages when reading to their children. Criticisms of the 1911 novel \"The Secret Garden\" by author Frances Hodgson Burnett claim endorsement of racist attitudes toward black people through the dialogue of main character Mary Lennox. Hugh Lofting's The Story of Doctor Dolittle has been accused of \"white racial superiority\", by implying through its underlying message that an ethnic minority person is less than human.\n\nThe picture book \"The Snowy Day\", written and illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats was published in 1962 and is known as the first picture book to portray an African-American child as a protagonist. Middle Eastern and Central American protagonists still remain underrepresented in North American picture books. According to the Cooperative Children's Books Center (CCBC) at University of Wisconsin Madison, which has been keeping statistics on children's books since the 1980s, in 2016, out of 3,400 children's books received by the CCBC that year, only 278 were about Africans or African Americans. Additionally, only 92 of the books were written by Africans or African Americans. In his interview in the book \"Ways of Telling: Conversations on the Art of the Picture Book\", Jerry Pinkney mentioned how difficult it was to find children's books with black children as characters. In the literary journal \"The Black Scholar\", Bettye I. Latimer has criticized popular children’s books for their renditions of people as almost exclusively white, and notes that \"Dr. Seuss\" books contain few ethnic minority people. The popular school readers \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" which ran from the 1930s until the 1970s, are known for their whitewashed renditions of the North American nuclear family as well as their highly gendered stereotypes. The first black family didn't appear in the series until the 1960s, thirty years into its run.\n\nWriter Mary Renck Jalongo In \"Young Children and Picture Books\" discusses damaging stereotypes of Native Americans in children's literature, stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the 1800s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today. The depictions of Native American people in Laura Ingalls Wilder’s \"Little House on the Prairie\" and J.M. Barrie’s \"Peter Pan\" are widely discussed among critics. Wilder’s novel, based on her childhood in America’s midwest in the late 1800s, portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms. In her essay, \"Somewhere Outside the Forest: Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook\", writer M. Lynn Byrd describes how the natives of Neverland in \"Peter Pan\" are depicted as \"uncivilized,\" valiant fighters unafraid of death and are referred to as \"redskins\", which is now considered a racial slur.\n\nThe presence of empire as well as pro-colonialist and imperialist themes in children’s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children’s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nIn the French illustrator Jean de Brunhoff’s 1931 picture book \"Histoire de Babar, le petit elephant (The Story of Babar, The Little Elephant)\", prominent themes of imperialism and colonialism have been noted and identified as propaganda. An allegory for French colonialism, Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle. It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization. H. A. Rey and Margret Rey’s \"Curious George\" first published in 1941 has been criticized for its blatant slave and colonialist narratives. Critics claim the man with the yellow hat represents a colonialist poacher of European descent who kidnaps George, a monkey from Africa, and sends him on a ship to America. Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George's lack of tail are points in this argument. In an article, \"The Wall Street Journal\" interprets it as a \"barely disguised slave narrative.\" Rudyard Kipling, the author of \"Just So Stories\" and \"The Jungle Book\" has also been accused of colonial prejudice attitudes. Literary critic Jean Webb, among others, has pointed out the presence of British imperialist ideas in \"The Secret Garden\". Colonialist ideology has been identified as a prominent element in Peter Pan by critics.\n\nSome of the earliest children’s stories that contain feminist themes are Louisa May Alcott’s \"Little Women\" and Frank L. Baum’s \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". With many women of this period being represented in children’s books as doing housework, these two books deviated from this pattern. Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement. \"Little Women\", a story about four sisters, is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature. The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement. It has been suggested that the feminist themes in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" result from influence of Baum's mother-in law, Matilda Gage, an important figure in the suffragist movement. Baum's significant political commentary on capitalism, and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage's influence. Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist, Dorothy who is punished by being made to do housework. Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author Tove Jansson's Moomin series which features strong and individualized female characters. In recent years, there has been a surge in the production and availability of feminist children's literature as well as a rise in gender neutrality in children's literature.\n\nIn addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls, children's books frequently lack female characters entirely, or include them only as minor or unimportant characters. In the book \"Boys and Girls Forever: Reflections on Children's Classics\", scholar Alison Lurie says most adventure novels of the 20th century, with few exceptions, contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by Dr. Seuss, would typically be assigned the gender-specific roles of receptionists and nurses. The \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" characters written by A. A. Milne, are primarily male, with the exception of the character Kanga, who is a mother to Roo. Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children's books. The near-absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children's literature.\n\nOn the one hand \"Growing up with Dick and Jane\" highlights the heterosexual, nuclear family and also points out the gender-specific duties of the mother, father, brother and sister, while \"Young Children and Picture Books\", on the other hand, encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children’s books that have repressive and sexist stereotypes for women.\n\nIn her book \"Children’s Literature: From the fin de siècle to the new millennium\", professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children's books prominently until the 1990s. She also says that capitalism encourages gender-specific marketing of books and toys. For example, adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls. Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls, but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls; therefore, a story that features male characters is expected to sell better. The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards, which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys. Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour, identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children’s literature. She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood. Conversely, boys are prepared for leadership roles and war. During the 20th century, more than 5,000 children's picture books were published in the U.S; during that time, male characters outnumbered female characters by more than 3 to 2, and male animals outnumbered female animals by 3 to 1. No children's picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters.\n\n\"I’m Glad I’m a Boy! I’m Glad I’m a Girl!\" (1970) by Whitney Darrow Jr. was criticized for its narrow depictions of careers for both boys and girls. The book informs the reader that boys are doctors, policemen, pilots, and Presidents while girls are nurses, meter maids, stewardesses and First Ladies.\n\nIn his article, entitled “Gender Equality: A Case Study of Janaki Sooriyarachichi’s Picture Book \"The Flying Train\",” Dr. Mehdi Ghasemi draws attention to the ways Janaki Sooriyarachchi – the writer and illustrator of \"The Flying Train\" – validates feminine and masculine voices and visions and balances gender issues both in the story book's narratives and illustrations.\n\nA widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children’s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content, specifically racial stereotypes, should be changed upon the printing of new editions. Some question if certain books should be banned while others believe original content should remain but publishers should make additions that guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story. Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved. In \"The Children’s Culture Reader\", scholar Henry Jenkins references Herbert Kohl’s essay \"Should We Burn Babar?\" which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes. Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments.\n\nSome books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen, such as illustrator Richard Scarry’s book \"Best Word Book Ever\". and Roald Dahl’s book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators. Several versions of \"Little Black Sambo\" have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice.\n\nBruno Bettelheim in \"The Uses of Enchantment\", uses psychoanalysis to examine the impact that fairy tales have on the developing child. Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story, which shape their perception and guides their development. Likewise, author and illustrator Anthony Browne contends the early viewing of an image in a picture book leaves an important and lasting impression on a child. According to research, a child’s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years. Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world.\n\nChildren’s literature critic Peter Hunt argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an ideology of the culture it comes from. Critics discuss how an author’s ethnicity, gender and social class inform their work. Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language, children are imbedded with the values of that society. Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept, Reynolds states that it is through children’s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should, according to the expectations of their culture. She also attributes capitalism, in certain societies, as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave. The \"image of childhood\" is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children \"at their most susceptible age\". Kate Greenaway’s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave. In Roberta Seelinger Trites's book \"Disturbing the Universe: Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature\", she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature. In the study \"The First R: How Children Learn About Race and Racism\", researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi-ethnic daycare centres. Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world. She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life.\n\nMany noted awards for children's literature exist in various countries:\n\nInternational awards also exist as forms of global recognition. These include the Hans Christian Andersen Award, the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, Ilustrarte Bienale for illustration, and the BolognaRagazzi Award for art work and design. Additionally, bloggers with expertise on children's and young adult books give a major series of online book awards called The Cybils Awards, or, Children's and Young Adult Bloggers' Literary Awards.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5921", "title": "Color", "text": "Color\n\nColor (American English), or colour (Commonwealth English), is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \"categories\", with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.\n\nBy defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the International Commission on Illumination. The RGB color space for instance is a color space corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm (\"red\"); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm (\"green\"); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm (\"blue\"). There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the CMYK color model, wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's colorfulness).\n\nThe photo-receptivity of the \"eyes\" of other species also varies considerably from that of humans and so results in correspondingly different \"color\" perceptions that cannot readily be compared to one another. Honeybees and bumblebees for instance have trichromatic color vision sensitive to ultraviolet but is insensitive to red. Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision. The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.\n\nThe science of color is sometimes called chromatics, colorimetry, or simply color science. It includes the study of the perception of color by the human eye and brain, the origin of color in materials, color theory in art, and the physics of electromagnetic radiation in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as \"light\").\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is characterized by its wavelength (or frequency) and its intensity. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390 nm to 700 nm), it is known as \"visible light\".\n\nMost light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's \"spectrum\" is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called \"metamers\" of the color in question.\n\nThe familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum—named using the Latin word for \"appearance\" or \"apparition\" by Isaac Newton in 1671—include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only, the \"pure spectral\" or \"monochromatic\" colors. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in terahertz) and wavelengths (in nanometers) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or vacuum (see refractive index).\n\nThe color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list—the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors linguistically is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to \"perceive\" colors in the same way). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today is known as cyan, and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported at the time.\n\nThe \"intensity\" of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is brown, and a low-intensity yellow-green is olive green.\n\nThe color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contributes to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the spectrum of the light leaving its surface, but also on a host of contextual cues, so that color differences between objects can be discerned mostly independent of the lighting spectrum, viewing angle, etc. This effect is known as color constancy.\n\nSome generalizations of the physics can be drawn, neglecting perceptual effects for now:\n\nTo summarize, the color of an object is a complex result of its surface properties, its transmission properties, and its emission properties, all of which contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of the object. The perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of the ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby, and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.\n\nAlthough Aristotle and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and color vision, it was not until Newton that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, Goethe published his comprehensive \"Theory of Colors\" in which he ascribed physiological effects to color that are now understood as psychological.\n\nIn 1801 Thomas Young proposed his trichromatic theory, based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz. As Helmholtz puts it, \"the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it.\"\n\nAt the same time as Helmholtz, Ewald Hering developed the opponent process theory of color, noting that color blindness and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus corresponds to the opponent theory.\n\nIn 1931, an international group of experts known as the \"Commission internationale de l'éclairage\" (CIE) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.\n\nThe ability of the human eye to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the retina to light of different wavelengths. Humans are trichromatic—the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or cones. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 nm; cones of this type are sometimes called \"short-wavelength cones\", \"S cones\", or \"blue cones\". The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: \"middle-wavelength cones\", \"M cones\", or \"green cones\" are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540 nm, while the \"long-wavelength cones\", \"L cones\", or \"red cones\", are most sensitive to light is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570  nm.\n\nLight, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the principle of univariance, which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called \"tristimulus values\".\n\nThe response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate \"only\" the mid-wavelength (so-called \"green\") cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human \"color space\". It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.\n\nThe other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the rod, has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all. On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a colorless response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the \"red\" range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the Kruithof curve, that describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function of temperature and intensity.\n\nWhile the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three opponent processes, or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red–green channel, a blue–yellow channel, and a black–white \"luminance\" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a \"reddish green\" or \"yellowish blue\", and it predicts the color wheel: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.\n\nThe exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our \"perception\" of the world – a type of qualia – is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.\n\nIf one or more types of a person's color-sensing cones are missing or less responsive than normal to incoming light, that person can distinguish fewer colors and is said to be \"color deficient\" or \"color blind\" (though this latter term can be misleading; almost all color deficient individuals can distinguish at least some colors). Some kinds of color deficiency are caused by anomalies in the number or nature of cones in the retina. Others (like \"central\" or \"cortical\" \"achromatopsia\") are caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.\n\nWhile most humans are \"trichromatic\" (having three types of color receptors), many animals, known as \"tetrachromats\", have four types. These include some species of spiders, most marsupials, birds, reptiles, and many species of fish. Other species are sensitive to only two axes of color or do not perceive color at all; these are called \"dichromats\" and \"monochromats\" respectively. A distinction is made between \"retinal tetrachromacy\" (having four pigments in cone cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and \"functional tetrachromacy\" (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference). As many as half of all women are retinal tetrachromats. The phenomenon arises when an individual receives two slightly different copies of the gene for either the medium- or long-wavelength cones, which are carried on the X chromosome. To have two different genes, a person must have two X chromosomes, which is why the phenomenon only occurs in women. There is one scholarly report that confirms the existence of a functional tetrachromat.\n\nIn certain forms of synesthesia/ideasthesia, perceiving letters and numbers (grapheme–color synesthesia) or hearing musical sounds (music–color synesthesia) will lead to the unusual additional experiences of seeing colors. Behavioral and functional neuroimaging experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route.\n\nAfter exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, photoreceptors of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of afterimages, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a complementary color.\n\nAfterimage effects have also been utilized by artists, including Vincent van Gogh.\n\nWhen an artist uses a limited color palette, the eye tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.\n\nThe trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by Edwin Land in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of color constancy.\n\nBoth phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. CIECAM02, iCAM). There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.\n\nColors vary in several different ways, including hue (shades of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet), saturation, brightness, and gloss. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as \"orange\" or \"salmon\", while others are abstract, like \"red\".\n\nIn the 1969 study \"\", Brent Berlin and Paul Kay describe a pattern in naming \"basic\" colors (like \"red\" but not \"red-orange\" or \"dark red\" or \"blood red\", which are \"shades\" of red). All languages that have two \"basic\" color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six \"basic\" colors include black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and azure (distinct from blue in Russian and Italian, but not English).\n\nIndividual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as national colors (in general described in individual color articles and color symbolism). The field of color psychology attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. Chromotherapy is a form of alternative medicine attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.\n\nDifferent colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition. For example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men.\n\nMost light sources are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. Many such sources can still effectively produce a spectral color, as the eye cannot distinguish them from single-wavelength sources. For example, most computer displays reproduce the spectral color orange as a combination of red and green light; it appears orange because the red and green are mixed in the right proportions to allow the eye's cones to respond the way they do to the spectral color orange.\n\nA useful concept in understanding the perceived color of a non-monochromatic light source is the dominant wavelength, which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the light source. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to hue.\n\nThere are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to desaturation or because they are purples (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as pink, tan, and magenta.\n\nTwo different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the human eye will be perceived as the same color. They are metamers of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although reflected colors from objects can look different. (This is often exploited; for example, to make fruit or tomatoes look more intensely red.)\n\nSimilarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called \"primaries\". This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or color spaces for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.\n\nNo mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530 nm) and blue light (460 nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485 nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.\n\nBecause of this, and because the \"primaries\" in color printing systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the gamut. The CIE chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.\n\nAnother problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the acquisition devices, like cameras or scanners. The characteristics of the color sensors in the devices are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the human eye. In effect, acquisition of colors can be relatively poor if they have special, often very \"jagged\", spectra caused for example by unusual lighting of the photographed scene.\nA color reproduction system \"tuned\" to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other observers.\n\nThe different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, color management techniques, such as those based on ICC profiles, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.\n\nAdditive color is light created by mixing together light of two or more different colors. Red, green, and blue are the additive primary colors normally used in additive color systems such as projectors and computer terminals.\n\nSubtractive coloring uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or \"subtracted\" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.\n\nIf the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. Red paint, viewed under blue light, may appear black. Red paint is red because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object.\n\nStructural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's wavelength. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce Tyndall effect colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case air molecules), the luster of opals, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a diffraction grating: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to interference phenomena, separating mixed \"white\" light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.\n\nStructural color is studied in the field of thin-film optics. The most ordered or the most changeable structural colors are iridescent. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in peacock feathers, soap bubbles, films of oil, and mother of pearl, because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, electron micrography has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as \"photonic\" cosmetics.\n\n\n\n"}

Common Sense Media has also developed a set of ratings that are intended to gauge the educational value of videos, games, and apps. The nonprofit's \"Learning Ratings\" attempt to assess different types of learning qualities within various forms of media. The new rating system was funded in part by SCEFDN's US$10 million learning initiative program.\n\nDonations from foundations and individuals and fees from media partners finance Common Sense Media. Today, the organization distributes its content to more than 100 million US homes via partnerships with a variety of traditional and online media companies. Common Sense Media describes itself as \"the nation’s largest membership organization dedicated to improving kids’ media lives\". By 2016, the organization had over 65 million unique users and worked with more than 275,000 educators across the United States. In 2016, Charlie Rose reported that Common Sense Media was the United States largest non-profit dedicated to children's issues.\n\nIn addition to its English language services, Common Sense Media also offers resources in Spanish.\n\nAfter founding JP Kids, an educational media company for children, and Children Now, a national child advocacy and media group, Jim Steyer founded Common Sense Media in 2003. In an interview with the New York Times, Steyer said he intended to “create a huge constituency for parents and kids in the same way that Mothers Against Drunk Driving or the AARP has done.\" The group received $500,000 in seed money from a group of donors including Charles Schwab, George Roberts, and James Coulter.\n\nTo assess parents’ concern about their children’s media habits, Common Sense Media commissioned a poll, which found that “64 percent [of parents with children 2-17] believed that media products in general were inappropriate for their families. It said that 81 percent expressed concern that the media in general were encouraging violent or antisocial behavior in children.” The polling firm, Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, said that “only one out of five interviewed ‘fully trusted'’ the separate industry-controlled ratings systems for music, movies, video games and television.”\n\nCommon Sense Media reviews thousands of movies, TV shows, music, video games, apps, web sites and books. Based on developmental criteria, the reviews provide guidance regarding each title’s age appropriateness, as well as a “content grid” that rates particular aspects of the title including educational value, violence, sex, gender messages and role models, and more. For each title, Common Sense Media indicates the age for which a title is either appropriate or most relevant. An overall five-star quality rating is also included, as are discussion questions to help families talk about their entertainment. In addition to Common Sense Media's traditional rating system, they also offer a set of learning based ratings, which are designed to determine complex educational values.\n\nCommon Sense Media partners with a number of media companies that distribute the organization’s free content to more than 100 million homes in the United States. According to Common Sense Media’s website, the organization has content distribution contracts with Road Runner, TiVo, Yahoo!, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, DIRECTV, Disney, NBC Universal, Netflix, Best Buy, Google, AOL/Huffington Post, Fandango, Trend Micro, Verizon Foundation, Nickelodeon, Bing, Cox Communications, Kaleidescape, AT&T, and NCM.\nThe organization’s current rating system differs from the system used by the Motion Picture Association of America and the Entertainment Software Rating Board. It has received positive support from parents, and was singled out by US President Barack Obama as a model for using technology to empower parents. Common Sense Media began allowing studios to use their ratings and endorsements in order to promote family-friendly movies in 2014. The first film to use the endorsement was Disney’s \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\".\n\nCommon Sense Media has played a role in influencing billions of dollars in government spending on education-related technologies including classroom broadband access and various learning apps. In April 2015, they launched the national advocacy effort, Common Sense Kids Action, to push for certain state and federal efforts to bolster education for children. As of 2016, the Common Sense Education program had grown to include over 300,000 member teachers in approximately 100,000 schools.\n\nIn 2009, CSM partnered with Harvard University and the organization Global Kids to organize a three-way communication with parents, teenagers, and educators about issues faced in the online world.\n\nCommon Sense has 2 free education programs for schools and other organizations to use with students and parents. The goal of these resources is to help young people learn how to think critically, behave safely, and participate responsibly in today's ever-changing digital media world. More than 75,000 schools and over 158,000 educators around the world are using these resources.\n\nThe first product is a Parent Media and Technology Education Program that was launched in late 2008. The program includes a comprehensive library of resources, like tip sheets, workshop slides and script, videos, and discussion guides that educators can use to engage and educate parents about technology issues ranging from media violence and commercialism to cyberbullying and cellphone etiquette.\n\nThe second product, launched in 2009, is a K-12 Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum consisting of more than 60 lesson plans, student handouts, videos and interactive components that span three topic areas: Safety and Security, Digital Citizenship, and Research and Information Literacy. The curriculum was informed by research done by Howard Gardner's GoodPlay Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.\n\nThe resources were developed with support from many foundations, including the Sherwood, MacArthur, and Hewlett Foundations, which enables Common Sense to offer these products to educators for free.\n\nCSM has also teamed with MTV's \"A Thin Line\" campaign, the Family Violence Prevention Fund, and Yahoo! Safely to conduct a series of town hall meetings for teenagers and parents to discuss online issues that they face; the first was held in Omaha, Nebraska on December 6, 2010, the second took place in Chicago on October 25, 2011. The third town hall meeting will be moderated by MTV News anchor Sway Calloway and is scheduled to take place on October 2 in New York City.\n\nIn 2012, CSM released its \"Digital Passport,\" an online curriculum designed to teach children how to safely and responsibly navigate the Internet. The courses can be accessed for free by classroom teachers, who are then able to monitor their students' progress. Digital passport lessons are presented as games that reward progress with badges.\n\nIn 2013 CSM launched Graphite, an online resource for teachers that allows them to review and rate educational technology. The project is supported by Chicago philanthropist Susan Crown and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' bgC3.\n\nCommon Sense Media supported the U.S. Department of Commerce's creation of an \"online privacy policy\", which would include a \"Privacy Bill of Rights\" and would make clear which types of personal information companies are allowed to keep on clients. It has also called for updates to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) rules to ensure that they keep pace with changes in technology since the law was passed in 1998 – as documented by Common Sense Media in a report to the Federal Trade Commission as part of a review of the law.\n\nThe organization also helped Massachusetts Representative Edward Markey and Texas Representative Joe Barton draft legislation that required websites aimed at children under 13 to obtain parental permission before collecting personal information. According to the Wall Street Journal, the group also wanted websites to feature an \"eraser button\" that would allow children and teens to delete information that they’ve posted online about themselves. The group also favored a ban on \"behavioral marketing\" to kids—ads targeted at children based on their online activities.\n\nIn 2004, CSM pushed for the passing of California’s “Eraser Bill.” As of June 2006, social media websites must allow California children under age 18 to remove their own postings. The same year, they advocated the passing of California Senate Bill 1177, which prohibits the sale and disclosure of schools' online student data. The bill also forbids targeted ads based on school information and the creation of student profiles when not used for education purposes.\n\nCommon Sense Media played a major role in the passage of the 2005 California law criminalizing the sale of violent video games to minors. The organization submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court regarding the case \"Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association\" (formerly \"Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association\"). They published a survey, conducted by Zogby International, which asked 2100 parents whether or not they supported the \"video game ban bill\" – CA Law AB 1793; results showed that 72% of the respondents expressed support for the bill, and another 75% held negative views of the video game industry when it comes to how they protect kids from violent video games.\n\nOn August 12, 2006, Common Sense Media protested to the Federal Trade Commission about the ESRB's rating downgrade of a revised version of \"Manhunt 2\" from \"Adults Only\" to \"Mature\". It protested on the basis that the revised version of the game, which was censored to prevent the game from remaining banned in both countries, was still banned in the UK via the ratings given by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). They also noted that players could still play a \"leaked uncensored version\" of \"Manhunt 2\" on modded PlayStation 2, as Take-Two Interactive mentioned. The organization asked the FTC to launch a federal investigation into the ESRB rating process, citing the wide availability of the leaked version and the damage to children that the censored version still had.\n\nQuestioning whether CSM media had begun functioning as a lobbying group rather than advocacy group the \"Los Angeles Times\" called Common Sense Media \"one of the most zealous voices when it comes to encouraging state legislation limiting the sale of ultra-violent games to minors and was \"splitting hairs\" regarding the difference between lobbying and advocacy in its efforts.\n\nCommon Sense Media participated in the FCC's Child Obesity Taskforce in April 2006 and hosted \"Beyond Primetime\", a panel discussion and conference on issues related to kids and media, featuring lead executives from the nation’s top media.\n\nIn June 2006, Common Sense Media and The Department of Clinical Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health released a white paper, which outlines the ways that media exposure can impact children's health. The paper evaluated 173 media-related studies from the past 28 years and concluded that \"In 80% of the studies, greater media exposure is associated with negative health outcomes for children and adolescents.\"\n\nIn October 2006, Common Sense Media released a white paper compiled from existing research on body image perceptions in kids and teens. The paper states more than half of boys as young as 6 to 8 think their ideal weight is thinner than their current size and that children with parents who are dissatisfied with their bodies are more likely to feel that way about their own.\n\nIn September 2017, Common Sense Media released a study which it developed in collaboration with the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism focused on families in both Japan and America and technology use. Surveys of families in the United States were compared to surveys of Japanese families and found that both countries struggle with the impact of technology on family life and relationships.\nCommon Sense Media released a PSA with Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in 2017 called Device Free Dinner which featured Will Ferrell as a distracted dad at the dinner table, in order to raise awareness for responsible technology and media usage.\n\nCommon Sense Media's Program for the Study of Media and Children provides data relating to the developmental influence of technology on children.\n\nCommon Sense Media's study, titled \"Social Media, Social Life: How Teens View Their Digital Lives\", was released in June 2012. The study's findings were based on data from 1,030 surveys that were given to adolescents ages thirteen to seventeen. Among the teens surveyed, 49% reported that their preferred method of communication was talking in person, whereas 33% chose texting and 7% chose social media.\n\nIn October 2006, Common Sense Media published a study titled \"Zero to Eight: Children's Media Use in America\", which was conducted to \"understand the patterns of media use among young American children.\" Data for the study was derived from surveys taken by 1,384 parents of children ages zero to eight between April to August 2006. The study reported that over 50% of children under eight years of age have had regular access to a mobile device and that children under two \"spend twice as much time watching TV and videos (53 minutes) as they do reading books (23 minutes).\" The study also highlighted the influence of the digital divide on young children.\n\nIn October 2013, Common Sense Media published its new study, \"Zero to Eight: Children’s Media Use in America, 2013\". The 2013 data was based on a survey of 1,463 parents. The study reported that 38% of children under two had used a mobile device. The report also stated that seven out of ten children under age eight have used mobile devices.\n\nIn June 2017, Common Sense Media released the report “Watching Gender: How Stereotypes in Movies and on TV Impact Kids’ Development” based on a survey of approximately 1,000 parents across the United States about how media affected their children and the evaluation of 150 articles from academic journals. The findings focused on gender roles and their portrayal in media, which can shape career choices and self-image in children. As a result, Common Sense Media developed a testing system to rate movies and television shows based on their usage and portrayal of traditional gender stereotypes. The company agreed to lease its ratings to cable companies to raise awareness.\n"}

The best known is the stage play \"The Laramie Project\", which was adapted into an HBO movie of the same name. Matthew Wayne Shepard was an openly gay university student who was brutally attacked near Laramie, Wyoming, in October 1998 and left for dead by his attackers.\n\nPeople in the entertainment industry expressed outrage and responded in various ways to the attack, and Ellen DeGeneres spoke at Shepard's memorial services in Washington, D.C. Three narrative films were made about the Shepard story: \"The Laramie Project\" (2000, based on the play of the same name), \"The Matthew Shepard Story\" (2002), and \"Anatomy of a Hate Crime\" (2001). \"The Laramie Project\" and \"The Matthew Shepard Story\" both won numerous awards. The documentary film \"Laramie Inside Out\" (2004) focuses on the murder's effect on the Laramie community in the aftermath of the murder.\n\n\"The Meaning of Matthew: My Son's Murder in Laramie, and a World Transformed\" by Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother (2010), details Matthew's life from birth to death, the aftermath, trial, media coverage and Judy's work with the Matthew Shepard Foundation.\n\n\"October Mourning\" by Lesléa Newman, a novel in verse about Matthew's murder, was published in 2012.\n\n\"The Book of Matt\" by Stephen Jimenez was published by Steerforth in 2013. It details the life of Matt in the Laramie drug scene, and portrays the murder to be about drugs and money. Because it downplays the homophobic aspect of the crime, the book has been condemned by many gay rights activists.\n\n\"Blood & Tears: Poems for Matthew Shepard\" edited by Scott Gibson and published by Painted Leaf Press, is a collection of poems by seventy-five different poets. Some of the poems were written in direct response to Shepard's death while others are offered in his memory. Among the contributors are John Ashbery, Mark Bibbins, Rafael Campo, Marilyn Hacker, Rachel Hadas, Gerrit Henry, Anselm Hollo, Patricia Spears Jones, Bernadette Mayer, W.S. Merwin, Eileen Myles, Eugene Richie, Paul Schmidt, David Trinidad, Jean Valentine, Anne Waldman and Rosanne Wasserman.\n\n\"The Laramie Project\" is a 2002 drama film written and directed by Moisés Kaufman, and based on his own play of the same name mentioned below. The film featured an all-star cast. It premiered at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival and was first broadcast on HBO on March 9, 2002. The film was praised by \"TV Guide\"s Matt Roush for its emotional range, its examination of homophobia, and the unique investigation at its center, saying that viewers would be \"enlightened\" by it.\n\n\"The Matthew Shepard Story\" is a television film about the trial of the killers of Matthew Shepard. It premiered on NBC on March 9, 2002, the same night as HBO's \"The Laramie Project\". It starred Shane Meier as Matthew Shepard, and depicting his parents were Sam Waterston as Dennis Shepard and Stockard Channing as Judy Shepard. The film won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2002 in the category of \"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie\" for Stockard Channing's performance as Judy Shepard. The film's cast also includes Kristen Thomson, Joseph Ziegler, Makyla Smith, Damien Atkins, and Wendy Crewson. The ending featured Elton John's song about Shepard, \"American Triangle\", from his album \"Songs from the West Coast\".\n\nThe film seeks to illuminate the decisions Judy and Dennis Shepard had to make as to whether the death penalty should be sought for their son's killer. Throughout the movie there are several flashbacks of Matthew's life. It also shows the experiences and hardships Matthew endured throughout his life from junior high through college, including his first kiss, his first boyfriend and a rape scene.\n\nMatt Roush of \"TV Guide\" criticized the film as unoriginal, and NBC for scheduling it on the same night as HBO's \"The Laramie Project\", which Roush felt was the far superior effort. Roush opined that although \"The Matthew Shepard Story\" had some merit, and that some might even be moved by it, its decision to open with a depiction of Shepard's murder was \"grotesque\", and that overall, it did not possess the depth of \"Project\".\n\n\"Dear Jesse\" is a 1998 documentary film about the U.S. Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC). It was released theatrically by Cowboy Pictures and on DVD by Sovereign Entertainment in 2007. Written and directed by Tim Kirkman, the film won many awards and was nominated for the Emmy Award for writing (nonfiction feature film) in 2000 after airing on the HBO/Cinemax \"Reel Life\" series. An interview with Matthew Shepard appears as a postscript in the first-person narrative at a political rally at Catawba College in Salisbury, NC, a small liberal arts school Shepard attended briefly in 1996.\n\n\"Laramie Inside Out\" is a 2004 documentary that explores the repercussions of Matthew Shepard's murder on the town of Laramie, Wyoming in the year following his death. Filmmaker Beverly Seckinger, who grew up in Laramie, was compelled to return to her hometown to see how this event affected the site of her own closeted adolescence. Along the way she confronts \"God-hates-fags\" Westboro Baptist Church Reverend Fred Phelps, who condemns Shepard and all homosexuals to a merciless eternity in hell. Through Seckinger we also meet grieving students, teachers, parents, and clergy, working to make the community a safer place, speaking out and taking action.\n\n\"Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine\" is a 2012 documentary directed by Michele Josue, a former friend of Matthew Shepard, which documents the personal life of Matthew Shepard through interviews with friends and family members. In an interview with the \"Gay Times\", Michele commented that Matthew Shepard \"became this icon of the LGBT community but in the process he was being stripped away. I had this obligation to tell the world what he was like as a human being and share his story in an honest way. The only way to do that was to make my film.\" \"Matt Shepard Is a Friend of Mine\" premiered simultaneously at both the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Washington National Cathedral on October 4, 2013.\n\nAn anthology of poemteeds by seventy five poets in tribute to Matthew Shepard. The poets include John Ashbery, W. S. Merwin, and Harold Norse: \n\nSpoken word poet Andrea Gibson recorded their poem \"Dive\" about Matthew Shepard on their 2004 album \"Swarm.\"\n\n\"Book of Statues\", a poem about Matthew Shepard by Richie Hofmann, was Academy of American Poets Poem-a Day on October 12, 2016. Actor Matt Bomer recited the poem in a video for \"The New York Times\" in 2018.\n\n\n\n\"The Laramie Project\" is a play by Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project about the reaction to the murder of Shepard. The play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members' own journal entries and published news reports ranging from a few months after the attack to a few years after. The play is designed to display the town's reaction to the crime.\n\nIt premiered at The Ricketson Theatre by the Denver Center Theatre Company (Denver) (part of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts) in February 2000 and was then performed in the Union Square Theater in New York City before a November 2002 performance in Laramie, Wyoming. The play has also been performed by high schools, colleges, and community theaters across the country, as well as professional playhouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nAlmost a decade later, Tectonic Theater Project created a second play, titled \"The Laramie Project: 10 Years Later\", based on interviews with members of the town, Shepard's mother, and his incarcerated murderer.\n\nIn the \"Six Feet Under\" episode \"A Private Life\", on HBO, a gay man is brutally murdered in a way that mirrors Matthew Shepard's death.\n\nShepard's manner of death is mentioned in \"United States of Tara\", when Marshall is cautioned about his relationship with another character.\n\nThe Matthew Shepard incident and the subsequent introduction of the Matthew Shepard Act inspired a story arc which spanned several episodes in the first season of \"The West Wing\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6339612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6339612", "title": "Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)", "text": "Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)\n\nDeclaration of Independence is a oil-on-canvas painting by American John Trumbull depicting the presentation of the draft of the Declaration of Independence to Congress. It was based on a much smaller version of the same scene, presently held by the Yale University Art Gallery. \nTrumbull painted many of the figures in the picture from life, and visited Independence Hall to depict the chamber where the Second Continental Congress met. The oil-on-canvas work was commissioned in 1817, purchased in 1819, and placed in the United States Capitol rotunda in 1826.\n\nThe painting is sometimes incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The painting shows the five-man drafting committee presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Congress, an event that took place on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.\n\nThe painting shows 42 of the 56 signers of the Declaration; Trumbull originally intended to include all 56 signers but was unable to obtain likenesses for all of them. He also depicted several participants in the debate who did not sign the document, including John Dickinson, who declined to sign. Trumbull had no portrait of Benjamin Harrison V to work with, but his son Benjamin Harrison VI was said to resemble his father, so Trumbull painted him instead. As the Declaration was debated and signed over a period of time when membership in Congress changed, the men featured in the painting never were in the same room at the same time.\n\nIn the painting, Thomas Jefferson appears to be stepping on John Adams' foot in the painting, which many thought was supposed to symbolize their relationship as political enemies. However, upon closer examination of the painting, it can be seen that their feet are merely close together. This part of the image was correctly depicted on the two-dollar bill version.\n\nThe following key to the figures in the painting follows the numbering used by the U.S. government publication \"Art of the Capitol\" (in the illustration of the key shown in this section) but provides a different (hopefully clearer) description of which figure is where in the painting, so numbers are not entirely in order.\n\nKey to figures (in each group, listed from left to right):\n\nFour men seated on the far left:\n\nSeated at the table on the left:\n\nSeated together to the right of Harrison and in front of the standing figures:\n\nFive figures standing together on the left:\n\nThree seated figures in the back between the two sets of standing figures:\n\nSet of three figures standing together in the back:\n\nTen figures seated:\n\nFive figures standing in front (the Committee of Five):\n\nFour background figures seated together near the right corner of the room:\n\nTwo figures standing in the right corner of the room:\n\nTwo foreground figures at the central table:\n\nThree figures standing at right:\n\nTwo figures seated at far right:\nThere were 14 signers of the Declaration who did not appear in the painting:\n\nTrumbull's \"Declaration of Independence\" signing scene painting has been depicted several times on United States currency and postage stamps. It was first used on the reverse side of the $100 National Bank Note that was issued in 1863. The depiction was engraved by Frederick Girsch of the American Bank Note Company. The same steel engraving was used on the 24¢ stamp issued six years later as part of the 1869 pictorial series of definitive U.S. postage stamps. \n\nTrumbull's painting is presently depicted on the reverse of the two-dollar bill. Featured in it are 40 of the 47 figures from Trumbull's painting. Cut out from the scene are: the farthest four figures on the left—George Wythe, William Whipple, Josiah Bartlett, and Thomas Lynch, Jr.; the farthest two figures on the right—Thomas McKean and Philip Livingston; and one of three figures seated in the left rear—George Walton. Additionally, two unrecognized figures were added: one in between Samuel Chase and Lewis Morris and another between James Wilson and Francis Hopkinson, bringing the total number of figures shown in this presentation scene to 42.\n\nTrumbull painted a smaller version (only ) entitled \"The Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776\" (1786–1820) that is now on view at the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\n\n"}

It is traditionally associated with Saint Patrick, who was thought to have had it in his possession at one point.\n\nDomhnach Airgid comprises two separate main elements: an outer casket or box and the fragments of a 6th-9th century manuscript it was built to hold. The wooden oblong box is heavily inscribed, with lettering running right around the outer borders, and it is covered by silver and bronze panels which contain fragments of vellum manuscript of the Gospels written in Latin. Thirty-nine pages of the manuscript survive, each about nine inches in height.\n\nThe shrine was redesigned c 1350, when the much of the extant metalwork and relief plaques on the cover were added. The work is thus a mixture of the non-contemporary Insular art and International Gothic styles.\n\nDomhnach Airgid's casket was designed to hold relics and consists of three covers, with the center one being made of wood, probably from yew. Another is made from copper, plated with silver. The outer cover, pictured above, is of the highest quality, and lined with silver and decorated by gilding. The cover contains a series of elevated carving centered on a representation of Jesus on the cross surrounded by eleven smaller sized figures, including a grouping of three apostles, probably James, Peter and Paul, the panel showing the Archangel Michael and the Virgin and Child, a panel with a grouping of Saint Colmcille, St. Brigid and Patrick, while with the saint at the lower right is thought to represent of Patrick presenting a cumdach to St. Macartan. The corners of the frontispiece contain a series of running animals or grotesques placed on small mounts. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.\n\nThe figures are ornately and delicately carved. The cover was built to hold a number of relics, by legend associated with Patrick. In this tradition, the shrine was thought to have been in his possession and was sanctified by him before he gave it to St. Macartan. It thus became a significant and prized object that was widely venerated.\nThe case was significantly remodeled around 1350 (a dating established by George Petrie) by the goldsmith John O’Bardan, during work commissioned by John O’Carbri, abbot of Clones. O’Bardan, whose signature appears on the object and is known to have lived in Drogheda, modernised the appearance of the shrine in the contemporary International Gothic style, and added the figures of Jesus and the saints. O’Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The Normans sought to undermine the established order, in part by undermining and reforming Irish Christianity, while seeking to detach it from its Celtic basis. In response, some clerics fought back by refurbishing and restoring early medieval sacred objects in order to reinforce the island's cultural identity.\n\nDue to its age, the Domhnach Airgid is not in good condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, giving it its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues.\n\nThe manuscript is of the Cathach (literally \"Battle Book\") style, indicating an apocryphal use as a rallying cry or protector in battle. There are 39 surviving leaves, with text written in the Irish majuscule script. The manuscript leaves are very worn down, and some have become detached from their casing.\n\n"}

Before the “event,” man was the center of all things. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”\n\n[U]p until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form.

The play bears a notable resemblance to \"The Atonement of Gosta Berling.\" Attacking the Catholic doctrine of celibacy for priests and the denial of burial for suicides, the play was and remains very controversial.\n\nJenbach also worked on the screenplay to Hugo Bettauer’s 1924 dystopian satire, \"Die Stadt ohne Juden\" (\"The City without Jews\"). This novel was prescient. It imagined a city that expelled the Jews and confiscated their wealth. It was meant to show the ridiculousness of anti-Semitism. It was Bettauer’s most famous and best selling novel, and was translated into numerous languages. It was also his undoing. The novel angered the Nazis. A year later, Nazi party member Otto Rothstock murdered Bettauer. When the film version opened, members of the National Socialist party tossed stink bombs into the cinemas, and cinema owners often cut parts of the film out. This film was the first important role for German film star Hans Moser. In 1933, some in the German press said that this film speaks for itself as an indictment against Hitler.\n\nDuring the Third Reich, Jenbach was sent to the Ghetto at Minsk.

He painted in the Pre-Raphaelite style, and was one of the most prominent portrait painters of his generation. Both his marriages were to daughters of Thomas Henry Huxley. He studied painting at the Munich Academy starting in 1875.\n\nCollier was from a talented and successful family. His grandfather, John Collier, was a Quaker merchant who became a Member of Parliament. His father, Robert, (who was a Member of Parliament, Attorney General and, for many years, a full-time judge of the Privy Council) was created the first Lord Monkswell. He was also a member of the Royal Society of British Artists. John Collier's elder brother, the second Lord Monkswell, was Under-Secretary of State for War and Chairman of the London County Council.\n\nIn due course, Collier became an integral part of the family of Thomas Henry Huxley PC, President of the Royal Society from 1883 to 1885. Collier married two of Huxley's daughters and was \"on terms of intimate friendship\" with his son, the writer Leonard Huxley. Collier's first wife, in 1879, was Marian (Mady) Huxley. She was a painter who studied, like her husband, at the Slade and exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. After the birth of their only child, a daughter, she suffered severe post-natal depression and was taken to Paris for treatment where, however, she contracted pneumonia and died in 1887. Collier's daughter by his first marriage, Joyce, was a portrait miniaturist, and a member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters. \n\nIn 1889 Collier married Mady's younger sister Ethel Huxley. Until the Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907 such a marriage was not possible in England, so the ceremony took place in Norway. By his second wife he had a daughter and a son, Sir Laurence Collier, who was the British Ambassador to Norway 1941–51.\n\nCollier's range of portrait subjects was broad. In 1893, for example, his subjects included Lovelace Stamer, Bishop of Shrewsbury; Sir John Lubbock FRS; A N Hornby (Captain of the Lancashire Eleven); Edward Augustus Inglefield (Admiral and Arctic explorer).\n\nHis commissioned portrait of the Duke of York (later George V) as Master of Trinity House in 1901, and the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) were his major royal portraits. The latter work was hung in Durbar Hall, Jodhpur, Rajputana.\n\nOther subjects included two Lord Chancellors (the Earl of Selborne in 1882 and the Earl of Halsbury) in 1897; The Speaker of the House of Commons, William Gully, (1897); senior legal figures the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone (1912) and the Master of the Rolls Sir George Jessel (1881).\n\nRudyard Kipling (1891); the painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1884); the actors J.L. Toole (1887) and Madge Kendal, Ellen Terry and Herbert Beerbohm Tree (in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\") (1904); heads of educational institutions such as the Master of Balliol Edward Caird (1904), the Warden of Wadham G.E. Thorley (1889) and the Provost of Eton (1897). Soldiers such as Field Marshal Lord Kitchener of Khartoum (1911) and Field Marshal Sir Frederick Haines (1891); two Indian maharajahs, including the Maharajah of Nepal (1910); and scientists including Charles Darwin (1882), the artist's father-in-law Professor Huxley (1891), William Kingdom Clifford, James Prescott Joule and Sir Michael Foster (1907). Clark reports a total of \"thirty-two\" Huxley family portraits during the half-century after his first marriage.\n\nA photocopy of John Collier's \"Sitters Book\" (made in 1962 from the original in the possession of the artist's son) can be consulted in the Heinz Archive and Library, National Portrait Gallery. This is the artist's own handwritten record of all his portraits, including name of subject, date, fee charged, and details of any major exhibitions of the picture in question.\n\nCollier died in 1934. His entry in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" (volume for 1931–40, published 1949) compares his work to that of Frank Holl because of its solemnity. This is only true, however, of his many portraits of distinguished old men — his portraits of younger men, women and children, and his so-called \"problem pictures\", covering scenes of ordinary life, are often very bright and fresh.\n\nHis entry in the \"Dictionary of Art\" (1996 vol 7, p569), by Geoffrey Ashton, refers to the invisibility of his brush strokes as a \"rather unexciting and flat use of paint\" but contrasts that with \"Collier's strong and surprising sense of colour\" which \"created a disconcerting verisimilitude in both mood and appearance\".\n\nThe \"Dictionary of Portrait Painters in Britain up to 1920\" (1997) describes his portraits as \"painterly works with a fresh use of light and colour\".\n\nSixteen of John Collier's paintings are now in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London, and two are in the Tate Gallery. Four of the National Portrait Gallery paintings were in December 1997 on display: John Burns, Sir William Huggins, Thomas Huxley (the artist's father in law) and Charles Darwin (copies of the last two are also prominently displayed at the top of the staircase at the Athenaeum Club in London).\n\nA 1907 self-portrait has been preserved in the Uffizi in Florence which presumably commissioned it as part of its celebrated collection of artists’ self-portraits.\n\nOther pictures may be seen in houses and institutions open to the public: a large and striking painting of the murderess Clytemnestra is in the Guildhall Gallery of the City of London. The \"Death Sentence\" was given by the widow of the artist to Wolverhampton Art Gallery. His portrait of the Earl of Onslow (1903), is at Clandon Park, Surrey (National Trust). His full-length portrait of Sir Charles Tertius Mander, first baronet, is at Owlpen Manor, Gloucestershire, with another version in the collection of the National Trust at Wightwick Manor, and his \"Lady Godiva\" is in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.\n\nReproductions of many others, from various collections, may be consulted in the John Collier box in the National Portrait Gallery Heinz Archive and Library, and a good selection is published in \"The Art of the Honourable John Collier\" by W.H. Pollock (1914). His work was also included in the Great Victorian Pictures exhibition mounted by the Arts Council in 1978 (catalogue, p27).\n\nCollier's views on religion and ethics are interesting for their comparison with the views of Thomas and Julian Huxley, both of whom gave Romanes lectures on that subject. In \"The religion of an artist\" (1926) Collier explains \"It [the book] is mostly concerned with ethics apart from religion... I am looking forward to a time when ethics will have taken the place of religion... My religion is really negative. [The benefits of religion] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain on upon the reasoning faculties.\" On secular morality: \"My standard is frankly utilitarian. As far as morality is intuitive, I think it may be reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens.\" His views on ethics, then, were very close to the agnosticism of T.H. Huxley and the humanism of Julian Huxley.\n\nOn the idea of God: \"People may claim without much exaggeration that the belief in God is universal. They omit to add that superstition, often of the most degraded kind, is just as universal.\" And \"An omnipotent Deity who sentences even the vilest of his creatures to eternal torture is infinitely more cruel than the cruellest man.\" And on the Church: \"To me, as to most Englishmen, the triumph of Roman Catholicism would mean an unspeakable disaster to the cause of civilization.\" And on non-conformists: \"They have a superstitious belief in the actual words of the Bible which is very dangerous\".\n\n\n\n"}

It ran for five issues and disbanded one year after its first printing, but in that time it published many prints and engravings by influential artists of the time, including Henri Rousseau.\n\nJarry, a French playwright and artist, and Gourmont, a novelist and poet of the same nationality, had worked in woodcuttings for many years before they joined together to form the magazine, although both men were so poor at times that they were forced to experiment with other mediums, such as linoleum and soap for their cuttings. Jarry had also been fascinated with the editorial aspects of publication since he, Francois Coulon and Louis Lormel had collaborated on \"L’Art Litteraire\" in 1893–94, which Jarry contributed to and Lormel edited. Jarry and Gourmont founded their own magazine in 1894 with a modest fortune, thus giving them a venue through which they would have complete artistic control over the expression and presentation of both their art and their interests.\n\nJarry wrote in \"L’Ymagier\" of the power of the direct and archetypal symbol, and set about comparing those symbols, such as the Passion and the Virgin Mary to the deliberately primitive pieces of Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard, as well as many of his own works. The theme of the universal, primitive, and often childish forces at work in art and society was one that both Jarry and Gourmont would revisit often in their own writing and artwork, particularly in Jarry’s most famous play \"Ubu Roi.\" The two also attempted to impress in their magazine the rejection of an optical reality, and instead tried to return art to a place of cult and ritual, hence the heavy religious imagery which peppered several of the issues.\n\nThe first issue was published in October 1894, and was entitled \"The Passion\" as it contained many woodcuttings depicting the Passion of Christ. It was filled with elaborate and striking religious imagery, yet it was followed shortly by the shockingly graphic and unusual issue \"Monsters\" in January 1895. Following that was an issue in April 1895 entitled \"The Virgin and Christ Child\" and then a revisiting of \"The Passion\" in July of the same year. The final issue, published in October 1895 was the most sparse of all. It was entitled \"Gingerbread Figures\" and contained only five pictures, four published under the name Alain Jans, Jarry’s nom-de-plume, and one which was unsigned. Shortly after this issue Jarry and Gourmont separated and the magazine quietly died out.\n\nAside from Jarry and Gourmont, \"L'Ymagier\" published engravings from Gauguin, Bernard, Francois Georgin, a renowned woodcutter of the day, and Henri Rousseau who developed the status of cult artist due to his work in the magazine and was consistently one of its most popular contributors.\n\nFollowing his father’s death in 1895 Jarry used his inheritance to found \"Perhinderion\", a journal whose title is a Breton word for pilgrimage. The journal was dedicated to juxtaposing conflicting elements often seen separately in art, such as intellectuality and naiveté, as well as presenting the complete works of Albrecht Dürer, a 15th-century painter and printmaker from Germany. Special attention was paid to Dürer’s \"Saint Catherine\" which is highly symbolist in the way it moves between the formal and the hallucinatory. Jarry declared in the first issue of \"Perhinderion\" that the reproductions of the woodcuts would be photoengraved ... without reducing their size, and struck ... on laid paper, which is the most similar to the original paper.\" This, along with the lavish format, led production costs to be so high that publication was discontinued after only two issues.\nThough short lived, Jarry and Gourmont’s work in \"L’Ymagier\" and the magazine’s highly symbolist style influenced many artists and writers of the early 20th century, notably Pablo Picasso and Max Jacob, who would build on Jarry and Gourmont’s work in symbolism through Surrealism and Dadaism in the 1900s.\n\nStabenow, Cornelia. “Henri Rousseau, 1844-1910.” Taschen, 2001.\n\"L’Ymagier\" from the Remy de Gourmont web page.\n\"L’Ymagier\" exhibit at the University of Kansas’s Spencer Museum of Art.\nArrivé, Michel. \"Les Langages de Jarry\".

Photogrammetry by English Heritage was followed by excavation led by the Somerset County Council archaeologist. They exposed and documented the mosaic in three weeks. It was then covered with sand and soil to preserve it. The work was recognised with the award of the Tarmac Finders Award (for non professionals) at the British Archaeological Awards in 2002. The stones used for the mosaic are Blue Lias from the surrounding hills. The fragments which were discovered in the surrounding soil were used to create a new mosaic, including a picture of a dolphin, using methods which would have been available in Roman times. It is now displayed in All Saints Church.\n\nA further mosaic was found in an adjoining room, which probably extended beyond the area excavated, which was about 4.5 metres square. The main mosaic is almost 7 metres square and has a complicated geometrical design, including some stylized figurative elements such as leaves, cups and dolphins. It was probably laid by a putative specialist workshop based at Cirencester, known as the \"Saltire school\" for their fondness for saltires in designs, which is seen here. The walls of these rooms were probably also painted on plaster, but no traces survive here. The suite probably functioned as a dining room\n"}

He drew audiences first at provincial towns such as Bath, then moving his venue to London. His theatre (dubbed \"Punch's Opera\" or \"Punch's Theatre\") established itself in early 1710 at its first location, at the north end of St. Martin's Street intersected by Litchfield St., not quite in Covent Garden. But by 1711 he relocated the theatre to the galleries of Covent Garden, at Little Piazza, opposite St. Paul's Church.\n\nHe has been credited with establishing the stock form of the Punch and Judy plays. Charles Magnin, the learned author of the \"Histoire des Marionnettes en Europe\", calls the years of Powell's pre-eminence \"the golden age of marionettes in England.\" It has been commented \"Powell is described as a deformed cripple but his powers of satire were considerable,\" to the extent that the ministry recruited Powell to lampoon the French prophets to diminish their influence among the populace. He not only narrated (spoke the lengthy prologues), with a wand in hand, but was a puppeteer himself, and he is thought to have built his own puppet figures and written the plays himself.\n\nA 20th-century scholar assesses the period of Powell's prominent activity to be 1709–1720, the popularity of his puppetry having waned in the latter years, \"his son briefly carried on the tradition in the [1720s]\", and he died 1729.\n\nIn Bath (1709), Powell had his success with, e.g., \"The Creation of the World\", which in its Noah's Flood segment featured \"Punch and his wife dancing in the Ark.\" \"The Creation of the World,\" was also later put on by Powell at Bartholomew Fair. This puppet show was not exclusive to Powell at the time, and a puppeteer known as \"Crawley\" staged it at Southwark Fair in 1695, and later at Bartholomew Fair in 1727.\n\n\nOnce in London, in an escalated rivalry with Her Majesty's Theatre in Haymarket (i.e., with serious dramas and operas), he arranged various puppet operas, including:\n\nOne contemporary observer who often wrote following Martin Powell's career was Richard Steele, as an editor of the 1709–1710 journal \"Tatler, or the Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff\" and later of the 1711 journal \"Spectator\". In the \"Tatler\", Steele assumed the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff, Esquire, writing a (feigned) affront that Powell was mocking Bickerstaff through the puppet Punch. Not much here can be taken at face value, since the venom against Powell is in jest (characterized \"bantering allusions\"), the purported letter written by Powell to the editor is a \"fictitious\" fabrication, and in the subtext it is really about a veiled defense of his friend Benjamin Hoadly in his church and state dispute against Ofspring Blackall, Bishop of Exeter.\n\nFollowing up the bantering allusions to Powell in the \"Tatler\", Richard Steele, in the \"Spectator\" (No. 14), made the under-sexton of St. Paul's, Covent Garden, write to complain that his congregation took the warning of his bell, morning and evening, to go to a puppet show set forth by one Powell under the piazzas. \"I have placed my son at the piazzas to acquaint the ladies that the bell rings for church, and that it stands on the other side of the garden; but they only laugh at the child.\" Another correspondent writes describing Powell's show, which he compares favourably with the opera at the Haymarket; \"for whereas the living properties at the Haymarket were ill trained, Powell has so well disciplined his pig that in the first scene he and Punch dance a minuet together\".\n\nWhen the fanatics called French prophets were creating disturbances in Moorfields, the ministry ordered Powell to make Punch turn prophet, which he did so well that it soon put an end to the prophets and their prophecies. In 1710, says Lord Chesterfield, the French prophets were totally extinguished by a puppet show.\n\nOn 20 April 1710 Luttrell mentions that four Indian sachems who were visiting London went to see Powell's entertainment. In the \"Groans of Great Britain\" (1711), formerly considered to be Daniel Defoe's work, Charles Gildon (d. 1724) complains of Powell's popularity, and states that his wealth was sufficient to buy up all the poets of England. \"He seldom goes out without his chair, and thrives on this incredible folly to that degree that, were he a freeman, he might hope that some future puppet show might celebrate his being Lord Mayor as he hath done Dick Whittington.\" Steele, who saw Powell as late as 1729, states that he made a generous use of his money.\n\nMartin Powell's shows lost popularity in within a matter of few years, and dropped out into obscurity after a mention in the anonlymous pamphleteer ballad, \"Bartholomew Fair: An Heroi-Comical Poem\" (1717).\n\nIn 1715, Thomas Burnet wrote a brief biography entitled \"A Second Tale of a Tub, or History of Robert Powell the Puppet Showman.\" The substitution of Robert for Powell's real name, Martin, was made to render the obvious satire upon Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford more effective.\n\n\n"}

Over the years, the studio incorporated many schools of thought and techniques from around the world.\n\nThe Studio attributes its existence to the Group Theatre. In 1931, Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Strasberg founded the Group Theatre in New York, beginning a watershed period in American Theater. The Group Theatre brought together Elia Kazan, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, Frances Farmer, Clifford Odets, Irwin Shaw, and John Garfield (among many others). Their creative commune introduced America to the revolutionary teachings of Stanislavski, and it set in motion new schools of thought that would dominate acting for the rest of the century. The Group Theatre closed its doors in 1941, and its visionary members set out in new directions.\n\nIn 1942, Howard joined the Neighborhood Playhouse as a scholarship student under Sanford Meisner. Howard vigorously pursued his studies and absorbed everything Meisner had to impart. Howard then served in World War II as a parachutist, and upon returning, joined Equity in 1947. Strasberg invited Howard to study with him, and soon he was asked to become a member of the Actors Studio. Howard began a long career of hundreds of roles on stage and screen, including Odets' \"The Country Girl\" on Broadway and the film \"The Men\" with Marlon Brando. Acting led to directing and, in 1952, to teaching, when Sidney Lumet asked Howard to replace him at the High School of Performing Arts. The next year, in 1953, a group of actors asked Howard to lead their sessions, and Michael Howard Studios was born.\n\nOver the next five decades, Howard's teachings expanded to the Yale School of Drama, the Juilliard School, the American Conservatory Theatre, and Boston University while continuing his master classes at the Michael Howard Studios.\n\nThe studio is now in its 55th year in continuous operation making it the longest running private acting studio in New York. In honor of the 55th anniversary of the studio, the studio received an official proclamation from Mayor Michael Bloomberg, declaring May 4, 2009, Michael Howard Studios Day \"in honor of the studio's contribution to New York's rich theatrical history\".\n\n\n"}

Established by the husband and wife team Tio Tek Djien and Miss Riboet, the company travelled throughout the Indies and performed various acts, particularly those with action scenes. It was disbanded in 1942, having lost much of its popularity due to competition with Dardanella.\n\nIn the late 19th century various forms of popular theatre, inspired by Western techniques and formats, began to develop in the Dutch East Indies, a colony of the Netherlands. The earliest were the Malayan \"bangsawan\" troupes, who traveled to Sumatra and Java beginning in the 1880s. The \"Komedi Stamboel\" developed in the Indies in the 1890s, inspired by these \"bangsawan\" troupes. By 1910 various organisations run by the ethnic Chinese had begun holding stage performances, which they termed \"operas\", as fundraisers; these troupes eventually developed into professional ones, acting for profit.\n\nIn 1925 Tio Tek Djien (1895–1975), an ethnic Chinese businessman from East Java, established Orion Opera together with his wife, Miss Riboet ( 1900–1965), who took the lead role. Though Tio drew on the earlier \"bangsawan\" and \"komedi stamboel\", as with his contemporaries such as Tengku Katan's Union Dahlia, he introduced several changes. Stories selected were shorter ones, with shorter scenes, which could be completed in a single night. No longer were the characters introduced before the performance, and the number of scenes with singing and dancing was drastically reduced, limited only to inter-act performances. Orion's repertoire was likewise different: instead of traditional tales, such as those based on the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", Orion tended to perform original stories, though it also produced some adaptations of Western works.\n\nInitially the troupe's original stories were written by Tio himself. By the late 1920s he had hired Njoo Cheong Seng, a journalist and writer, to help produce original scripts. Works by Njoo which the troupe performed included \"Kiamat\" (\"Apocalypse\"), \"Tengkorak\" (\"Skull\"), and \"Tueng Balah\", while Tio wrote such works as \"R.A. Soemantri\". These stories were most often filled with action, and, though written in detail, left room for improvisation. When Miss Riboet proved highly popular as a swordfighter in these plays, as well as a \"kroncong\" singer, the troupe was named after her.\nThough initially limited to an amusement park in Central Java, the troupe quickly proved popular and travelled from city to city. They sold gramophone records to supplement their income, and Miss Riboet became the first recording star of the Indies. Stores sold Miss Riboet brand merchandise, including wristwatches. In 1927 the company attempted to make a film. Tio asked Nelson Wong to first record the troupe's performances, a task which Wong did using a simple camera. Hoping to create a profitable fiction film, Tio asked Wong to direct, a request Wong accept as long as Tio would help bring Wong's brothers from China. When the brothers arrived in the Indies, Tio bought an old tapioca flour factory in Bandung for them to use as a studio. Nelson and Tio began plans to make a film starring Miss Riboet, but these were cancelled after discovering that Riboet's face was \"not photogenic\".\n\nIn 1926 another theatrical troupe, Dardanella, was established by Willy A. Piedro. As with Miss Riboet's Orion, Dardanella quickly became known for its action-themed plays, a repertoire which included several stories about Zorro and an adaptation of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" in Batavia; such was the troupe's popularity that its leading man, Tan Tjeng Bok, was soon styled the \"Douglas Fairbanks of Java\". By 1931 the competition from Dardanella had led to an advertising war between the two troupes, each focusing on their best-received works: \"Gagak Solo\" from Miss Riboet's Orion and \"Dr Samsi\" from Dardanella.\n\nIn 1934 Njoo and his wife, the actress Fifi Young, migrated to Dardanella. Though Orion continued to perform, it was unable to compete with Dardanella. It was disbanded during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942–1945). After 1950 Tio attempted to reunite the troupe, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIndonesian literary scholar Jakob Sumardjo writes that Miss Riboet's Orion laid the basis for modern theatre in Indonesia, a feat he attributes to both Tio and Njoo having been well educated (as opposed to earlier, business-oriented, theatre patrons). Contemporary critic Tzu You, writing in 1939, considered Miss Riboet's Orion to have had the potential to create high quality, literary, stage plays, but that said potential was wasted as Tio focused only on following the public's tastes. An anonymous review in \"De Indische Courant\" recommended the opera company as a good one, particularly praising Miss Riboet's singing and acting.\n\nA stageplay put on by Miss Riboet's, entitled \"Pembalesan Siti Akbari\", was reprinted by the Lontar Foundation in 2006 using the Perfected Spelling System. The play is an adaptation of Lie Kim Hok's 1884 poem \"Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari\".\n\n"}

The organisation develops exhibitions of visual arts by artists from Australia and around the world. Platform primarily consists of 3 separate spaces, all located in and under the busy Flinders Lane precinct in the heart of Melbourne city.\n\nMost of the activities of Platform are located in the Campbell Arcade subway under Flinders Street in Melbourne. A pedestrian poll conducted in 2005 by Connex estimated that more than 35,000 people a week pass through the Platform exhibition sites, making it one of the most visible sites for public art in Melbourne.\n\nPlatform provides support for many young artists by enabling them to present solo exhibitions and the organisation often debuts artists to the general public. In its 23 years of operation, Platform has presented new work from more than 2,500 artists. Many have established successful art careers and have become well-respected professional artists. Many exhibiting artists are now featured in major Australian and international public art collections and several have represented Australia at the Venice Biennale.\n\nFounded in 1990 by artists Andrew Seward and Richard Holt, Platform's first location was a collection of glass display cases in the old Spencer Street station pedestrian underpass. In 1995, the City of Melbourne offered the group another underground space, Campbell Arcade, a subway located under Flinders Street and connecting Flinders Street station to Degraves Street. The late Art deco-style arcade was opened on 31 August 1955 and features black marble columns and pink-tiled walls lined with glass display cases. Platform expanded the exhibition program into this second space, running group and solo exhibitions at both the city's major train stations.\n\nIn 2000, Platform Artists Group further expanded the organisation into a subway shop they named Sticky. Promoting and selling Artist books and Zines, Sticky has since become an independent organisation and one of Australia's largest sellers of zines, stocking work from the United States, UK, Germany, France, China, Japan and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2004, the Spencer Street site was destroyed as part of the redevelopment of the station. Platform continues to deliver an ambitious contemporary art program at Campbell Arcade, Flinders Street Station under the new title, Platform Public Contemporary Art Spaces. In 2010, Platform marked its 20th Anniversary by publishing the book, \"What Art, Which Public?\".\n\n"}

His style evolved to become more Indian as his career went on – he painted Mughal emperors and drew particularly Indian heads, using similar techniques. His work has been proposed as evidence of a cultural exchange between 17th-century Iranian artists and Golconda artists from the same time period. A total of 25 paintings have been attributed to Shaykh 'Abbasi, including illuminations from manuscripts and miniatures featuring, among other subjects, the Safavid emperors and the Madonna and Child, colored in pale, transparent tones. Given the activities of contemporaneous artists, it is highly likely that he also painted on objects made from papier-mâché that was lacquered. He trained his two sons, 'Ali Naqi and Muhammad Taqi, in the same style.\n"}

{"id": "32578637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32578637", "title": "The Nature of Mind", "text": "The Nature of Mind\n\n\"The Nature of Mind\" is a philosophical essay by David Armstrong, originally published in \"The Nature of Mind and Other Essays\" in 1980. In this essay, Armstrong outlines a philosophical account of the mind that is compatible with the Materialist scientific view of the mind. He arrives at a theory of Central-State Materialism, a synthesis between Descartes' dualism (the thesis) and Gilbert Ryle's dispositional behaviourism (the antithesis).\n\nThe essay begins with the simple assertion that \"men have minds\", and Armstrong suggests that modern science may be the best tool with which to investigate the nature of the mind. He says that it seems that scientific consensus is converging on an explanation of the mind in \"purely physico-chemical terms\". He acknowledges some disagreement on the matter, but says that dissent tends to be on primarily non-scientific grounds. Armstrong writes that the purpose of his essay is to outline a Materialist account of the nature of the mind - one that is compatible with the scientific view of an entirely physico-chemical mind.\n\nArmstrong states that science can achieve consensus among experts on controversial matters after prolonged investigation. This, he says, makes science the authority on the nature of the mind and other matters. It is recognized that science can make mistakes, and that some claim that science has a limited sphere of inquiry. He puts forward science as the best hope we have in understanding the mind.\n\nReturning to the search for a Materialist account of the mind, Armstrong considers Behaviourism, which holds that the mind \"is not something behind the behaviour of the body, it [is] simply part of that physical behaviour\". While Behaviourism fits nicely with a Materialist view of the mind, it has significant flaws - it is possible to feel or think something without acting on this feeling or thought. For instance, one can feel angry but not express anger. \n\nArmstrong looks at Gilbert Ryle's refinement of Behaviourism, Dispositional Behaviourism. Armstrong illustrates Ryle's idea with a description of glass - brittleness is the disposition of materials such as glass to shatter under certain circumstances. Whether or not the glass shatters in a particular instance, it has the disposition to do so. In the same way, a mind can have a disposition towards anger, but it may only express this anger under certain circumstances. Armstrong quotes Ryle's \"The Concept of Mind\": \nWhile this dispositionalism quite successfully deals with the objection that one can feel or think one thing and do another, it is not enough - \"it seems obvious as anything is obvious that there is something actually going on in me that constitutes my thought\". Ryle's Dispositional Behaviourism denies this, and so Armstrong declares it to be \"unsatisfactory as a theory of mind\". Though he rejects Behaviourism, Armstrong suggests that it is useful to say that the mind and mental states are \"logically tied to behaviour\". He says that \"thought is not speech under suitable circumstances, rather it is something within the person that, in suitable circumstances, brings about speech.\" He thinks this view is compatible with a Materialist view of the mind, though it is also compatible with non-Materialist views, such as Descartes'.\n\nArmstrong modifies Ryle's Behaviourism by suggesting that the mind's dispositions may be explainable by science in Materialist terms, in the same way that glass's brittleness can be explained in terms of molecular structure. Armstrong offers this view as a true account of the mind. It is more fully developed in \"Belief, Truth and Knowledge\" (1973), ch. 2, sect. 2.\n\nArmstrong brings together two earlier conclusions: that the mind is \"that which stands behind and brings about our complex behaviour\"; and that the Behaviourist's dispositions are \"states that underlie behaviour and, under certain circumstances, bring about behaviour\", and reaches \"a conception of a mental state as a state of the person apt for producing certain ranges of behaviour\".\n\nArmstrong now addresses what he calls 'the problem of consciousness': how can the personal experience of consciousness be explained by his Materialist theory of the mind? Armstrong considers times when the brain goes on 'auto-pilot' - during long drives without breaks, one might suddenly 'come to' and realize that while one has stayed on the road, stopped at red lights and operated the clutch, one was completely unaware of doing so. This shows that it is possible for mental processes to take place without conscious experience.\n\nBefore considering how this can be the case, Armstrong describes a method by which a psychologist may determine whether an animal can distinguish between two colours by training it to perform a task that requires this perception. The animal's behaviour would indicate its perception of the colours. While a Behaviourist would say that the animal's behaviour \"was\" its perception, Armstrong describes the perception as a state of the animal's mind. It is implied that one could test for consciousness using a similar method.\n\nFurther illustrating his idea, Armstrong gives an analogy in which perception is a key to a door, the door being action. The unlocking of the door, and therefore action, is optional, but one cannot open the door without the key. A blind man, for instance, lacks certain keys. As a result, he cannot operate in an environment in the same way that a sighted man can.\n\nUsing this conception of perception as a state, Armstrong characterizes consciousness as \"perception or awareness of the state of our own mind\", or \"a self-scanning system in the central nervous system\". He sees consciousness not as an external construct that interacts with the body and brain, but a self-aware state of the physical brain.\n\n\n"}

Originally named the Théâtre Impérial du Châtelet, it has undergone remodeling and name changes over the years. Currently it seats 2,500 people.\n\nThe theatre is one of two apparent twins constructed along the quays of the Seine, facing each other across the open Place du Châtelet. The other is the Théâtre de la Ville. Their external architecture is essentially Palladian entrances under arcades, although their interior layouts differ considerably. At the centre of the plaza is an ornate, sphinx-endowed fountain, erected in 1808, which commemorates Napoleon's victory in Egypt.\n\nThe Théâtre Impérial du Châtelet was built for Hippolyte Hostein's equestrian company, the Théâtre Impérial du Cirque, whose previous theatre, the Cirque Olympique on the Boulevard du Temple, was slated for demolition by Baron Haussmann to allow the construction of the Boulevard du Prince-Eugène (now the Boulevard Voltaire).\n\nThe site for the new theatre was acquired by the City of Paris in October 1859, and construction took place between 1860 and 1862. The interior designers included Eugène Carrières and Armand Cambon, and the curtain was created by Charles Cambon.\n\nThe theatre originally seated 2,200 people, although Haussmann claimed it held 3,600. The repertory, fixed by a decree of 20 September 1862, included military works and \"féeries\" in one or several acts, as well as dramas and \"vaudevilles\".\n\nHostein left as director in September 1868. Nestor Roqueplan ran the theatre from 1 July 1869 to April 1870.\n\nThe theatre was closed from September 1870 to July 1871 due to the Franco-Prussian War. The war brought about the fall of the Second French Empire, and under the succeeding French Third Republic, the appellation \"impérial\" was dropped. Hippolyte Hostein returned as the theatre's director in 1873–1874.\n\nNotably, beginning in April 1876, the stage version of Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days, adapted by Verne and Adolphe d'Ennery, began a run spanning sixty-four years and 2,195 performances (although not continuously). It was only the Nazi occupation of Paris in May 1940 that closed this production permanently.\n\nInto the 20th Century, the theatre was used for operettas, variety and ballet performances, for classical and popular music concerts. It was also, for a time, a cinema. Regular seasons of opera and ballet were presented by a variety of impresarios, among them Gabriel Astruc, who introduced Diaghilev's Ballets Russes here. Igor Stravinsky’s \"Petrouchka\" received its premiere in the theatre on 13 June 1911, as did Erik Satie and Jean Cocteau’s \"Parade\" on 18 May 1917. In addition, many foreign composers and conductors made appearances in the theatre, including Tchaikovsky, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss.\n\nSince 1979, it has been operated by the City of Paris, and, after undergoing a major restoration, re-opened under the name of Théâtre Musical de Paris in 1980. It was acoustically re-modeled again in 1989 and reverted to the Théâtre du Châtelet name. It is currently mainly used for opera performances and concerts.\n\nUnder the direction of Stéphane Lissner for four years from 1995, the theatre received additional improvements in acoustics and sightlines.\n\nIn recent years, the theatre has become the home of the Orchestre de Paris and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France. Since 1993 the Philharmonia Orchestra of London has an annual residency period. Shirley Horn recorded her 1992 live album \"I Love You, Paris\" at the Théâtre du Châtelet.\n\n\n"}
