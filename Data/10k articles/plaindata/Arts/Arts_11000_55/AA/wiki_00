{"id": "1330877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1330877", "title": "A Dirty Shame", "text": "A Dirty Shame\n\nA Dirty Shame is a 2004 American satirical sex comedy film written and directed by John Waters and starring Tracey Ullman, Johnny Knoxville, Selma Blair, Chris Isaak, Suzanne Shepherd, and Mink Stole.\n\n, this is Waters' most recent directorial effort. He cites the film's poor box office returns as keeping his future projects from being green-lit, though he has indicated that he would be willing to make another film if sufficient funding were secured.\n\nThe people of Harford Road are firmly divided into two camps: neuters, the puritanical residents who despise anything even remotely carnal; and the perverts, a group of sex addicts whose unique fetishes have all been brought to the fore by accidental concussions.\n\nRepressed Sylvia Stickles finds herself firmly entrenched in the former camp. One day, after leaving her promiscuous daughter Caprice (nicknamed Ursula Udders because of gargantuan breasts and a penchant for indecent exposure while dancing at a local dive bar) locked up over the garage, under house arrest \"for her own good\", Sylvia is smacked on the head by a passing car and meets Ray-Ray Perkins, a local mechanic and self-styled \"sex saint\" who opens her mind to a whole new world of sensual pleasure, as he and his followers search for the ultimate sex act.\n\nEventually, through a series of bizarre head knockings, everyone in the Harford Road area of Baltimore becomes a sex addict, as Ray-Ray shoots semen out of his head, and becomes the messiah of \"Let's Go Sexin'!\".\n\nJohn Waters decided to make the film after discovering several sexual slang terms and branches existed on the internet, explaining the groups and terminology found in the film.\n\nAccording to Waters, when he asked the MPAA what he would need to cut in order for them to give his film an R rating, they replied that \"after a while, we just stopped taking notes\", and if everything they objected to was cut, only ten minutes could be distributed. They decided to simply release it with an NC-17 rating.\n\nIt was shot entirely on-location in Baltimore on Harford Road which is prominently featured in the film.\n\nIn a featurette that accompanied the film's DVD release, veteran stage actress Suzanne Shepherd recalled that when she was cast as Big Ethel, she was completely unfamiliar with Waters' work, and she had no idea what to expect when she showed up for the first script review. Horrified by what she was reading, she became so distraught that she began to cry. She tried to quit the project, but Waters and her cast mates managed to persuade her to stay.\n\n\"A Dirty Shame\" received a mixed response from critics; some have lauded its unashamed vulgarity, while others have lampooned it for the same reason. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 53% based on 117 reviews, and an average rating of 5.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nOne of the more positive reviews came from Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\", who wrote:\"A gross-out pioneer, Waters has always had more on his mind than delirious, sex-crazed silliness. By allowing people to speak freely about their sexual urges and practices with a bluntness that is jaw-droppingly hilarious, Waters has drawn deeply upon comedy's liberating power. The more the sex addicts talk about their hang-ups the more comically harmless they seem, and thus it's all the more absurd for the puritanical to try to punish them for their various pursuits of pleasure.\n\nWaters has always harnessed poor taste to lampoon attempts to limit freedom of expression. This raucously gritty and high-spirited film could scarcely be bluer in terms of the language, but from Waters it comes as a gust of fresh air.\"\n\nAlso enthusiastic was Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\":\"\"A Dirty Shame\" is Waters unleashed, and wicked, kinky fun for anyone except the twits who rated it NC-17...You may even shed a tear when Sylvia bonds with her daughter by confessing, \"I'm a cunnilingus bottom.\" OK, the jokes are hit-and-miss and the plot is nonexistent, but the Waters spirit stays consistently and sweetly twisted. When the cast takes to the streets singing, \"Let's go sexin',\" you want to cheer them on.\"\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum was Roger Ebert, who gave the film one star out of a possible four:\"There is in show biz something known as \"a bad laugh.\" That's the laugh you don't want to get, because it indicates not amusement but incredulity, nervousness or disapproval. John Waters' \"A Dirty Shame\" is the only comedy I can think of that gets more bad laughs than good ones...We go to a Waters film expecting bad taste, but we also expect to laugh, and \"A Dirty Shame\" is monotonous, repetitive and sometimes wildly wrong in what it hopes is funny.\"\n\n\"A Dirty Shame\" opened on September 17, 2004 on one Baltimore screen to $29,384. The next weekend, it expanded to 133 venues, where it grossed $448,914 ($3,375 per screen). It ended its North American run with $1,339,668 (as of November 7, 2004).\n\nOverseas, the film earned an additional $574,498 (as of July 14, 2005), making its global box office total come to $1,914,166.\n\nThere is both a full uncensored version and an edited, R-rated cut sold through Blockbuster, Wal-Mart, and Best Buy as well as Target dubbed \"The Neuter Version\". The R-rated version is heavily censored and removes most of the profanities including altered dialogue such as \"sex toy\". Additionally, a scene in which two characters stand naked in their doorway is replaced by one in which the characters are clothed. In an interview, Waters stated that this version is \"essentially for brainless people and 'really weird collectors'.\"\n\nNetflix proclaims to stream the NC-17 version of the film, but for a time, it was actually the censored version. It has since replaced it with the uncensored cut. A heavily censored version aired on LOGO, a cable channel for gay interest.\n\nDespite several internet sites and even the spine of the DVD stating that it is \"The Neuter Version\", the Australian release of the film is the NC-17 version with all profanity and nudity intact. It is rated R18+ for \"sexual references and adult themes\".\n\n"}

{"id": "56483227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56483227", "title": "Antoñita Singla", "text": "Antoñita Singla\n\nAntoñita Singla (born 1948), is a Spanish flamenco dancer and actress. She often went by the stage name Antoñita La Singla or simply \"La Singla\" but sometimes its written as Antonia Singla.\n\nShe was born as Antonia Singla Contreras in 1948 in the neighborhood Somorrostro de la Barceloneta, in Barcelona.\n\nA few days after her birth she was in pain so her mother took her to many hospitals in order to see different doctors. Despite the examinations, no accurate medical diagnosis was found. It was thought that the pain was caused by severe meningitis, however, the little girl was left deaf as a result of the pain she suffered during her first months. In 1968, she made a partial recovery from her medical condition. \n\nWhile she was growing up, La Singla learned to dance rumba, fandango, bulerías and flamenco with considerable skill. Singla began to dance by watching her mother clapping, absorbing the rhythm and turning it into a really remarkable dance full of emotions. It is said that she did not speak fluently until the age of 16.\n\nSingla began her career at the early age of 12, dancing in some taverns in Barcelona. Her mastery of dance took her to the top, arriving to perform at the Olympia in Paris, in Berlin and in Stuttgart, among other cities. She was known for wearing pants when performing dramatic dancing.\nIn 1960, she launched her artistic career to the top by participating in the group project Festival Flamenco Gitano in which personalities such as Paco de Lucía, Camarón de la Isla, and El Faraón, among others, participated. This 1965 event was the brainchild of German organizers of Blues and Gospel festivals, who decided to invest in flamenco, later participating in numerous television programs. In addition, the Festival Flamenco Gitano toured Europe and the American continent. The first performance took place in the German capital, Berlin. It is worth noting the fact that La Singla was more famous internationally than in Spain.\n\nIn 1963, she performed as an actress and dancer in the film Los Tarantos, directed by Francisco Rovira-Beleta. The film is based on a play by Alfredo Mañas and tells the story of the fierce confrontation between two gypsy families in Barcelona: \"Los Tarantos\" and \"Los Zorongos\". At a wedding, Rafael, Taranto, meets Juana, La Zoronga. The two young people, wrapped by the magic of the party, swear eternal love with a pact of blood, and after a night of love, they discover with desperation that they belong to the two rival families. Rafael's mother, seduced by the spell of Juana's dance, overcomes the ancestral hatred, but Juana's father refuses to accept the union. Antoñita La Singla participated in the film as 'Sole', one of the dancers of the clan, along with Sara Lezana, Daniel Martín, Antonio Gades, Antonio Prieto, José Manuel Martín, Margarita Lozano, Juan Manuel Soriano. In addition, thanks to the filming of the movie La Singla was able to meet Carmen Amaya, with whom she was compared too. The film, Los Tarantos was nominated for an Academy Award in 1964 for \"Best Foreign Language Film\". At present, the film serves as a documentary of the now defunct Somorrostro district.\n\nAnother important milestone in the career of Antoñita Singla was her performance in the flamenco club Los Califas, a 1964 flamenco club whose tablao flamenco was inaugurated on October 15, 1965. The club owners heard about her through the artistic manager Antonio Fernández, who assured them that Singla had the blessing of the great Salvador Dalí and his wife Gala as well as the support of Vicente Escudero. A few days later she traveled to Madrid ready to debut in \"Los Califas\". Obviously, it was not easy to accompany \"La Singla\", not having the hearing and the speech needed, however she maintained the performance in its entirety. She danced by pure instinct, she did not hear the guitar or the flamenco singer. It was commented that she was going her own way, she was totally independent, and it was the others who had to follow her to give the performance the feeling of unity. This unexpected situation created such a high expectation that the flamenco club ‘’Los Califas’’ was entirely filled with professionals from the flamenco dance community and Singla exceeded all expectations.\n\nToday, Singla lives in Santa Coloma de Gramenet, in Catalonia, Spain far from the tablaos. \n\nOn April 15, 2017, one of the brothers of the artist, Juan José Singla Contreras, and his partner, Santiago Parra, opened a flamenco tablao in Barcelona with the name of La Singla to pay tribute. The location of La Singla is located in front of La Monumental bullring, and it is the first flamenco establishment that opened in the city in 30 years.\n\n"}

Three quarters of all Arab movies are produced in Egypt.\n\nThere is increased interest in films originating in the Arab world. For example, films from Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, the Palestine, Syria and Tunisia are making wider and more frequent rounds than ever before in local film festivals and repertoire theaters.\n\nThere are numerous film festivals that have historically been and are held in various parts of the Arab world to both honor and showcase films from the Arab regions, as well as international standouts.\n\nSince 1976, Cairo has held the annual Cairo International Film Festival, which has been accredited by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations. There is also another festival held in Alexandria. Of the more than 4,000 short- and feature-length films made in Arabic-speaking countries since 1908, more than three-quarters were Egyptian.\n\nIn 1987, the inaugural Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis) was held, bringing together an array of prominent filmmakers and movie experts from across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as Asia and Europe. Held annually in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, the film festival was organized by the Somali Film Agency, the nation's film regulatory body.\n\nThe International Film Festival of Marrakech (FIFM) is an international film festival held annually in Marrakech, Morocco. Since its inaugural year in 2000, the FIFM has been one of the biggest events devoted to Moroccan cinema. It is also the site of the principal photography of many international productions.

The Muhr Award for Excellence in Arab Cinema was launched in 2006, with the aim of recognizing Arab filmmakers both regionally and internationally. In 2008, the Muhr Awards for Excellence were expanded to include two separate competitions, the Arab Muhr Award, and the AsiaAfrica Muhr Award. It also introduced a new program segment dedicated exclusively to Animation.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Film Festival (ADFF) is another key international film festival in the larger Arab region. Created in 2007, the ceremony is held annually in October in Abu Dhabi, UAE by the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage (ADACH), under the patronage of Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of the ADACH. The ADFF aims to encourage and foster the growth of filmmaking in the Arab world by showcasing movies from the region alongside standout productions from prominent international filmmakers. The first festival debuted with 152 movies and 186 screenings shown in five Abu Dhabi venues. A total of 76 feature films and 34 short films from over 35 countries competed for the Black Pearl Awards.\n\nThe Doha Tribeca Film Festival (DTFF) is an annual five-day film festival founded in 2009 to promote Arab and international film, and to develop a sustainable film industry in Qatar.

It forms part of the Bath Spa University whose main campus is located a few miles from the City at Newton Park, between Newton St Loe and Corston, in North Somerset, just outside the city of Bath. The present Executive Dean is Professor Anita Taylor.\n\nThe school was founded as Bath School of Art in 1852 following The Great Exhibition of 1851. The Bath Directory for 1856 shows its location at Weymouth House (roughly the rear of the present Marks and Spencers store) and its Master as Anthony Carey Stannus, an Irish painter noted for marine scenes and who later helped establish a society which evolved into the Royal Ulster Academy. By the 1858 edition he had been succeeded by John J. Drummond, who by 1860 had set up his own Mr Drummond's School of Art at 3 Bladud Buildings, and later (1862) at 5 Princes Buildings almost opposite.\n\nThe original School moved to Hetling House, Westgate Buildings, an ancient building which George Newenham Wright in his \"Historic Guide to Bath\" (1864) says had been garrisoned for the Royalists in the Civil War, adding that \"the School of Design now occupies the principal and older part\". The Master for a few years was John Hill, who later continued as a private tutor and artist at his home in Combe Down until about 1884. The School's syllabus was \"in connection with Marlborough House\", which meant the Government School of Design and Practical Art.\nBy 1866 the School was at 33 Paragon, opposite The Star Inn, and the Master was Robert Campbell Puckett, PhD, whose 1871 work \"Sciography, or radial projection of shadows\" was published by Chapman & Hall of London. The tuition fee was one guinea per quarter according to the school's prospectus published as a one-page advertisement in the annual Directories. Courses were \"in connection with the Science and Art Department, South Kensington\". A branch was opened at The Corridor for evening classes. Later Head Masters were William Harbutt (1874), the inventor of Plasticine, John Charles Swallow (1878), and Charles M. Hodges (1880). By 1884 William Harbutt was teaching at The Paragon Art Studio, 15 Bladud Buildings.\n\nBy 1894 the School had come under the umbrella of the Bath Technical Schools and in April 1896 these occupied the new north extension of the Guildhall, including the retitled School of Art, Art Crafts and Design. The new Head Art Master was Frank Griffin ARCA who had won bronze and silver medals, replaced by Nathaniel Heard ARCA by 1906. By 1912 the Master was Henry Wilkinson ARCA who had been taught by Ruskin and whose son (also Henry) became a well-known engraver. Successors were D.S. (probably Douglas) Andrews ARCA (1920) and Arthur Payne ARCA (1922).\n\nThe Technical Schools evolved into the Municipal Bath Technical College which moved to the building in Beau Street vacated by the Royal United Hospital when it moved to Combe Park. The process was overseen by the new head art master, the artist Paul Fripp (1934–37). Then came the important appointment of the long serving Clifford Ellis (1937–1972). The School of Art moved to 7 and 8 Green Park early in World War II, when the Beau Street building was taken over by the Admiralty. This new home was totally destroyed by bombs in April 1942, and temporary refuge was found at the home of the artist Walter Sickert at Bathampton. Sickert had been a part-time teacher at the School but had died in January 1942. Clifford Ellis is said to have cut the lettering on Sickert's headstone.\n\nIn November 1942 the School began its association with 99 Sydney Place. A note in the local history section of Bath Central Library records the opening of the new premises by Sir Kenneth Clark, then Director of the National Gallery and Surveyor of the King's Pictures. After the war the process began of transforming into Bath Academy of Art-based mainly at Corsham Court, Corsham, and with an initial emphasis on training teachers of art. The nascent City of Bath Training College was first based in another house at Sydney Place before its move to Newton Park, meaning that by 1947 (along with Bath College of Domestic Science then still at Brougham Hayes) all the major components of the future Bath Spa University were now in existence.\n\nThe 1983/4 prospectus contained a short history stating that from 1946 the Academy ran two courses at Corsham, one for teacher training and the other a National Diploma in Design with a small intake, with interaction between the two being seen as a particular asset. The Robbins report of 1963 led to more standardised teacher training provision, and the Academy's course was phased out by 1968. The introduction of Art Foundation courses from 1963 onwards led the Academy to begin such a course, based at the Sydney Place site which had been retained for part-time classes for the general public. In 1974 control of the institution passed to the new Avon County Council and from 1 September 1983 the Academy became part of Bath College of Higher Education.\n\nIn 1985/6 the Art and Design courses, now of bachelor's degree status, began the process of moving from Corsham to newly converted premises at Sion Hill, Bath, largely vacated by the switch of Home Economics and related courses to new premises at Newton Park.\nIn 2016 Bath Spa University purchased the former Herman Miller factory on Locksbrook Road, on the River Avon in the west of the City of Bath, a 1970s listed building designed by Farrell & Grimshaw, to become the main home for an expanded and consolidated Bath School of Art and Design. The School and its courses are to be based across just two buildings, Sion Hill and at Locksbrook Road, rather than up to seven.\n\nCourses at the School include Graphic Communication, Creative Art, Fine Art, Digital Design, Fashion and Textile Design, Ceramics and MA Design (Interaction Design, Ceramics, Brand Development or Textiles), Master of Fine Art.\n\nThe School prides itself on the teaching of traditional techniques, while embracing new technologies, and encouraging co-creation across disciplines. The new facilities planned from academic year 2019-20 include spaces specifically to encourage such inter-disciplinary creation.\n\nVisiting artists and tutors have included Kenneth Armitage, William Scott, Terry Frost, Peter Lanyon, Sir Herbert Read, Adrian Heath, Bernard Meadows, Howard Hodgkin, Anthony Fry, Martin Froy, John Colbeck, John Furnival, Gillian Ayres, Peter Potworowski, Claes Oldenburg, James Greaves, Peter Kinley, James Tower, John Hoskin, Mark Lancaster, Michael Craig-Martin, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Richard Hamilton, Roger Clarke, Jim Dine, Tom Phillips, Jeremy Gardiner and Morton Feldman.\n\n\n"}

The name is derived from a Common Kartvelian root \"ber\" (ბერ), meaning \"a child\". The scenes of Berikaoba range from those of explicitly erotic nature to political satire and social protest. \n\nBerikaoba typically involves several men, the berika, who are mostly disguised as animals. The costumes and masks for the mystery are made of animal hide. Animal skulls, tails, feathers, horns, pumpkins, ribbons and bells are used to add colorfulness to the scene. The festivity begins with a gathering of villagers who chose actors for the mystery. The procession of berikas – accompanied by sounds of bagpipes (stviri) – move door-to-door to pick wine, honey, floor, meat and other victuals served by hosts. The main characters in the procession are a \"bride\" called Kekela (კეკელა) and a groom who, after a series of attempts, persuades Kekela to marry her. The wedding is then disrupted by an appearance of a \"Tatar\", a reference to the centuries of invasions from neighboring Muslim powers. The groom is killed and the people console Kekela, promising her a better husband. As berikas try to resuscitate the groom with help of healing water, herbs and minerals, the news spreads about the abduction of Kekela. This brings the groom back to life. He chases the kidnappers and relieves her bride. The performance finishes with a lengthy feast, \"supra\". \n\nThe similar tradition, \"keenoba\" (ყეენობა, from \"the Khan\"), satirizing the foreign invaders of Georgia and later the Imperial Russian officialdom, enjoyed particular popularity in the 19th-century Tbilisi and its environs.

Formerly the residence of Nashville's Cheek family, the Georgian-style mansion was opened as a museum in 1960.\n\nChristopher Cheek founded a wholesale grocery business in Nashville in the 1880s. His son, Leslie Cheek, joined him as a partner, and by 1915 was president of the family-owned company. Leslie's wife, Mabel Wood, was a member of a prominent Clarksville, Tennessee, family. Meanwhile, Joel Owsley Cheek, Leslie's cousin, had developed an acclaimed blend of coffee that was marketed through Nashville's finest hotel, the Maxwell House Hotel. Cheek's extended family, including Leslie and Mabel Cheek, were investors. In 1928, the Postum Cereals Company (now General Foods) purchased Maxwell House's parent company, Cheek-Neal Coffee, for more than $40 million.\n\nAfter the sale of the family business, Leslie Cheek bought of woodland in West Nashville for a country estate. He hired New York residential and landscape architect Bryant Fleming to design the house and gardens, and gave him full control over every detail of the project, including interior furnishings. The resulting limestone mansion and extensive formal gardens were completed in 1932. The estate design was inspired by the grand English manors of the 18th century.\n\nLeslie Cheek died just two years after moving into the mansion. Mabel Cheek and their daughter, Huldah Cheek Sharp, lived at Cheekwood until the 1950s, when Huldah Sharp and her husband offered the property as a site for a botanical garden and art museum. The Exchange Club of Nashville, the Horticultural Society of Middle Tennessee and other civic groups led the redevelopment of the property aided by funds raised from the sale of the former building of the defunct Nashville Museum of Art. The new Cheekwood museum opened in 1960.\n\nCheekwood's art collection was founded in 1959 upon the holdings of the former Nashville Museum of Art and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The core holdings include broad collections of American art; American and British decorative arts; contemporary art, especially outdoor sculpture acquired for the Woodland Sculpture Trail.\n\nCheekwood's American art collection includes 600 paintings and 5,000 prints, drawings and photographs. The collection, assembled in the 1980s and early 1990s through a multimillion-dollar bequest, spans the history of American art. Its strength centers on The Eight. Other strengths include the world's largest collection of sculptures of William Edmondson, photographs by Louise Dahl-Wolfe, and a vast variety of post-Second World War prints. Recently, the Museum has pursued a consciously focused acquisition process, having added paintings by James Hamilton, William Bradford, and new contemporary sculpture for the Trail.\n\nThe core holdings of the decorative arts collection include the third-largest Worcester porcelain in the United States, and a 650-piece silver collection, spanning the 18th-20th centuries.\n\nThe Cheek Mansion is itself considered part of the collection. A year-long renovation, completed in June 2017, restored much of the original building, which revealed authentic features (wood and marble floors that had been carpeted), and conserved historical architectural motifs, such as the illusionist murals that line the main corridor.\n\nThe Contemporary Art collection, housed in the galleries created out of the estate's original garage and stables, is small but of high quality, including paintings by Larry Rivers, Andy Warhol, Robert Ryman, Red Grooms, and Marylyn Dintenfass. Additionally, seven small galleries were created in the old horse stable stalls to enable Cheekwood to display installation art.\n\nThe Carrell Woodland Sculpture Trail, a collection of fifteen sculptures by international artists, extends the contemporary art collection into nature, focusing on a kind of intimate, outdoor art not commonly found in American museums.\n\nExtending across the grounds from the Museum of Art, the Botanical Garden encompasses the entire site with an emphasis on display, education, and study. The plant collections include boxwood, conifer, crape myrtle, daffodil, daylily, dogwood, fern, herb, holly, hosta, hydrangea, Japanese maple, magnolia, Southeastern US natives, redbud, and trillium.\n\nIn addition to the Museum and the Botanical Garden, Cheekwood operates a nick-nack shop, and a restaurant called the Pineapple Room which overlooks the west lawn.\n\n\n"}

She was introduced as a love-interest for Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), but was killed off in 1995 on Duffett's request.\n\nDebbie first appears in Walford in May 1993 as a friend of Tracey the barmaid (Jane Slaughter). She becomes a love interest for Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) when she meets him at his birthday party. Debbie and her daughter Clare (Gemma Bissix) move nearby to escape Debbie's former ex-husband Liam Tyler (Francis Magee), who has been abusing her. Liam eventually tracks Debbie down and makes several attempts to break up Nigel and Debbie but is unsuccessful, and Debbie and Clare both move to Walford to live with Nigel.\n\nIn July 1994, Debbie marries Nigel and they are content in marriage. She starts working at the local bookmakers but her boss, Stan Dougan (Jack Chissick), constantly tries to flirt with her, which she dislikes. She keeps this a secret from Nigel but when Stan makes a move on her she quickly rejects him and quits her job. Nigel is suspicious of Debbie suddenly quitting but eventually finds out Stan has been harassing her, so he punches Stan.\n\nTragedy strikes soon after when Debbie is killed in a hit-and-run accident in June 1995. Police tell Nigel that she walked out into a road and someone hit her at speed, killing her instantly. Debbie's death devastates Nigel and Clare for some time. Nigel goes on to adopt Clare after Liam returns and is unsuccessful in his attempt to gain custody of her. On the 13th anniversary of Debbie's death in 2008, Clare and Dot Branning (June Brown) visit her grave.\n\nDebbie was introduced in 1993 by executive producer Leonard Lewis as a love-interest for Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley). Debbie's actress Duffett has described Debbie as \"nice, unassuming and shy\", which she claims was in stark contrast to her own personality. Debbie's introduction storyline stemmed around a storyline focusing on spousal abuse, when it was revealed that Debbie was being abused by her estranged husband Liam Tyler (Francis Magee). Nigel and Debbie's eventual marriage was the focus of \"EastEnders\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> celebratory episode on 12 July 1994, which marked the show's 1000th episode. \"EastEnders\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> writer Colin Brake has selected it as 1994's episode of the year. Off-screen the show's Series Producer Barbara Emile decided to mark the 1000th episode with a celebration and the wedding of Nigel and Debbie was chosen as the event. It was scripted to be a happy occasion in the soap, with Debbie and Nigel's ceremony going ahead despite threats of intrusion from Liam.\n\nDuffett grew weary of playing Debbie saying she became too boring and drippy, and asked the producers of \"EastEnders\" to kill her character off in 1995, which they did; Debbie was killed in a hit-and-run motor accident. Duffett has commented, \"I left \"EastEnders\" of my own accord, without a shadow of a doubt. I begged to be killed. I ran to the script editor's office. Every time I see him at a party he says, 'I'll never forget you.' Because I ran in crying, 'Kill me NOW! I can't stand it.' Because the part was so boring. I played this simpering wimp, Debbie. All I did was walk into the Vic and say, 'Where's Nigel?'\" Duffett has stated that she has no regrets about leaving the role, and that she wanted her character killed so she had no opportunity to ever return as she worried about being typecast.\n"}

The EFDSS, a member-based organisation, was incorporated as a company limited by guarantee (no. 297142) in 1935 and became a registered charity (no. 305999) in England and Wales in 1963.\n\nThe Folk-Song Society, founded in London in 1898, focused on collecting and publishing, primarily folk songs of Britain and Ireland although there was no formal limitation. Participants included Lucy Broadwood, Kate Lee, Cecil Sharp, Percy Grainger, Ralph Vaughan Williams, George Butterworth, George Barnet Gardiner, Henry Hammond, Anne Gilchrist and Ella Leather.\n\nThe English Folk Dance Society was founded in 1911 by Cecil Sharp. Maud Karpeles was a leading participant. Its purpose was to preserve and promote English folk dances in their traditional forms, including Morris and sword dances, traditional social dances, and interpretations of the dances published by John Playford.\n\nOne of the greatest contributions that the EFDSS made to the folk movement, both dance and song, was the folk festival, starting with the Stratford-upon-Avon Festival in the 1940s and later festivals in Whitby, Sidmouth, Holmfirth, Chippenham and elsewhere.\n\nSince 1936 the EFDSS has published \"English Dance & Song\" at least four times a year. This has become the longest-established magazine devoted to folk music, dance and song in the country. \"English Dance & Song\" is aimed at stimulating the interest of the membership of the EFDSS, as well as the wider folk music and dance community.\n\nTheir regular scholarly publication is \"Folk Music Journal\", published annually in December, which was formerly entitled the \"Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society\" until 1965. The work continues the earlier journals of the two societies: \"Journal of the Folk-Song Society\", 1899–1931; \"Journal of the English Folk Dance Society 191431\".\n\nIn 1998, with the folk movement strongly supported by a number of other organisations and the seeds planted by EFDSS thriving, the EFDSS altered its strategy to focus on education and archiving, with its primary goal the development of the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library as the country's national archive and resource centre for folk music, dance and song. \n\nIn 2011 the society entered into a joint commission with Shrewsbury Folk Festival to create the Cecil Sharp Project, a multi-artist residential commission to create new works based on the life and collecting of Cecil Sharp. The project took place in March 2011, the artists involved being: Steve Knightley, Andy Cutting, Leonard Podolak, Jim Moray, Jackie Oates, Caroline Herring, Kathryn Roberts and Patsy Reid.\n\nIn 2013, EFDSS launched The Full English, an ongoing archive project supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Folklore Society, the National Folk Music Fund and the English Miscellany Folk Dance Group. This free and searchable resource of 44,000 records and over 58,000 digitised images is the world's biggest digital archive of traditional music and dance tunes.\n\nAs well as folk music, the EFDSS is home to a number of performance artists, providing a regular performance platform for acts including the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, the Massive Violins and the Swingle Singers.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the last surviving monuments of Portuguese colonial rule in the Persian Gulf.\nOrmuz (or Hormuz) was an important maritime city and a small kingdom near the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The original site of the city was on the north shore of the Gulf, about 30 miles east of the current Bandar Abbas. Around 1300, apparently in response to attacks from the Tartars, it moved to the small island of Gerun, which can be identified as the Organa of Nearcho, about 12 miles west and 5 miles from the coast. \n\nConstructed on reddish stone on a rocky promontory at the far north of the island, the castle was originally cut off from the rest of the island by a moat, traces of which still remain. Although most of the roof caved in long ago, much of the lower part of the very substantial outer walls is intact, with the remains lying on different levels of the site.\n\nThe building of the castle was ordered by Portuguese commander Afonso de Albuquerque in 1507, when his forces seized the island for a short time, being then named \"Fort of Our Lady of Victory\" (\"Forte de Nossa Senhora da Vitória\"). Engaging his men of all ranks in the building works, Albuquerque faced a revolt and had to retreat. He came back and reconquered the island in 1515, when he completed and renamed the fort. The Persian Safavid king, Abbas I of Persia (1587–1629), wanted to end Portuguese rule in the south and eventually managed to convince the British East India Company to allow its ships to cooperate with his land forces to seize the island from the Portuguese in 1622.\n\nA number of other Portuguese castles are found in the Persian Gulf islands, including the castle in Qeshm.\n\nDuring the Habsburg Dynasty (1581–1640), the Portuguese built a fortress in Dibba Al-Hisn and a wall around the city. In August 1648, the Arabs besieged Muscat, Oman, and on 31 October 1648 a treaty was signed between the two opponents. The terms were as follows: the Portuguese should build the fortress of Kuriyat, Dibba Al-Hisn and Matrah (Oman).\n\n"}

{"id": "385946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=385946", "title": "Hierarchy of genres", "text": "Hierarchy of genres\n\nA hierarchy of genres is any formalization which ranks different genres in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.\n\nIn literature, the epic was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by Samuel Johnson in his \"Life of John Milton\": \"By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions.\" Below that came lyric poetry, and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for drama. The novel took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.\n\nIn music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the Baroque period, and opera retained a superior status for much longer. The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.\n\nThe hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century. These were formalized and promoted by the academies in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French Académie de peinture et de sculpture, which held a central role in Academic art. The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:\n\n\nThe hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to \"render visible the universal essence of things\" (\"imitare\" in Italian) and that which merely consisted of \"mechanical copying of particular appearances\" (\"ritrarre\"). Idealism was privileged over realism in line with Renaissance Neo-Platonist philosophy.\n\nThe term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the High Renaissance onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art. This had not been the case in Medieval art and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view. The Raphael Cartoons are a clear example of the continuing status of tapestry, the most expensive form of art in the 16th century. In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century. Until the 19th century the most extravagant objets d'art remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings. Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe hierarchy grew out of the struggle to gain acceptance of painting as one of the Liberal arts, and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with architecture and sculpture. These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as Leon Battista Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, and Giorgio Vasari. Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances. In his \"De Pictura\" (\"About Painting\") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.\n\nTheorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of Michelangelo, who was strongly influenced by neoplatonism. By the time of Mannerist theorists such as Gian Paolo Lomazzo and Federico Zuccari (both also painters) this was far less of a priority. Both emphasized beauty as \"something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions\", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism. In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status. Ideas of decorum also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.\n\nDuring the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects. For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the Medici in his Medici Chapel sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort Gainsborough is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe). \n\nMany portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist Armenini claimed in 1587 that \"portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [\"maniera\"] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses\". On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.\n\nThe question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the decrees on art of the Council of Trent of 1563. Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased. Until the challenge of Caravaggio at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.\n\nThe new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class. Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of Dutch Golden Age painting and Flemish Baroque painting. However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by Karel van Mander, Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten, Gerard de Lairesse and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.\n\nThe hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as Jan Steen, Karel Dujardin and Vermeer produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell. The unhappy history of Rembrandt's last history commission, \"The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis\" (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience. In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life. Often the different elements were painted by different artists; Rubens and Frans Snyders often co-operated in this way.\n\nThe size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a \"landscape with...\", a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish world landscapes of Joachim Patinir in the early 16th century. Flemish Baroque painting was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.\n\nAn influential formulation of 1667 by André Félibien, a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes & sans mouvement ; & comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, & ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire & la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; & montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, & les mystères les plus relevez.\n\nHe who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal\".\n\nAllegorical painting was raised above other types of history painting; together they were the \"grand genre\", including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the French Revolution, history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.\n\nAfter history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: portraits, scenes of everyday life (called \"scènes de genre\", or \"genre painting\", and also \"petit genre\" to contrast it with the \"grande genre\"), landscapes, animal painting, and finally still lifes. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. \n\nThe hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes. This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental \"The Young Bull\" of the Dutch artist Paulus Potter, as well as the larger of the two \"Butchers' Shop\" canvases of Annibale Carracci. But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits. Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.\n\nThe use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later dissenting theorists, such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, held that this focus on allegory was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the Horatian dictum ut pictura poesis (\"as is painting so is poetry\").\n\nThe British painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in his \"Discourses\" of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.\n\nThough Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: \"Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of Virgil, that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to Titian; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance.\"\n\nThough European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the Grand Manner, where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. Jean-Antoine Watteau invented a genre that was called fêtes galantes, where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. \n\nClaude Lorrain practised a genre called the ideal landscape, where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term \"historical landscape\" which received official recognition in the Académie française when a Prix de Rome for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.\n\nRomanticism greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in British art and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the Style Troubadour in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American Hudson River School and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, women were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to history painting, which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy. In Britain the Pre-Raphaelite movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts. Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects. New artistic movements included the Realists and Impressionists, which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.\n\n"}
{"id": "48457488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48457488", "title": "Indies Empire style", "text": "Indies Empire style\n\nIndies Empire style (Dutch: \"Indische Empire stijl\") is an architectural style that flourished in the colonial Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) between the middle of the 18th century and the end of the 19th century. The style is an imitation of neoclassical Empire Style which was popular in mid-19th-century France. Conformed to the tropical setting of Indonesia, the style became known in the Dutch East Indies as Indies Empire style.\n\nThe development of the Indies Empire style is strongly related with the Indies culture, a society of mixed descendants which developed in the Dutch East Indies. Indies people associated themselves with high status and expressed themselves by building opulent country houses usually associated with European aristocrats. Many of these country houses appeared in the periphery of Batavia around the middle of 17th-century, the architectural style of which reached its peak when it merged completely with the Javanese local architecture, a new style known as the Old Indies style.\n\nWith the arrival of Herman Willem Daendels in early 19th-century, the development of the architectural style of these country houses took a different course. Daendels was a former colonel-general of Louis Bonaparte from France. At that time, a neoclassical architectural movement named Empire Style was popular in France. When Daendels was made the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, he made Empire Style popular in the Dutch East Indies. Conformed with the tropical architecture of Indonesia, the style became known as the Indies Empire Style.\nBy the end of 19th-century, clubhouses and playhouses were built in big cities of the Indies such as Batavia, Semarang and Surabaya; most were built following the Indies Empire style trend. City development at the end of 19th-century also influenced the form of Indies Empire style. The lack of available space in city centers required modification of typical Indies Empire styled houses. Stone columns were replaced with wooden or narrow iron columns, usually imported from the Netherlands. Also changing was the additions of corrugated steel shades supported by cast iron consoles to protect the windows and the front porch from rainwater and sun. Examples of Indies Empire style houses from this later period are the Jakarta Textile Museum and some houses in Jalan Bubutan, Surabaya.\n\nIn the 19th-century, the Indies Empire style is considered a representative of the \"uptown\" of Batavia, the area south of the \"downtown\" Kota Tua. Indies Empire Style is described as a trend in which houses were built in \"...one storey with large gardens, with front and back galleries and high and wide halls; houses with hanging roofs where shade, air and coolness were the dominant privileges...\", compared with the earlier Dutch style houses in Kota Tua, described as houses with \"...high dark rooms with the beamed ceilings, the white painted walls and the red tiled floors.\" \n\nIndies Empire style flourished until early 20th century, when the style was met with criticism. Indies Empire style in Indonesia was not a work of a professional architect, but a design of the building supervisor (\"opzichter\"). Modern academics such as architects Berlage and Moojen considered the Indies Empire style buildings to be low in quality; which led to a renaissance of architectural style which sought a new unique identity specially attributed to the culture of Dutch Indies. Later a new style emerged, known as the New Indies Style, a modern movement and a branch of Dutch Rationalism which at the end replaced the Indies Empire style.\n\nIndies Empire style is essentially Empire Style conformed into the tropical setting of the Dutch East Indies. Similar with the Empire Style, Indies Empire Style made an eclectic use of antique motifs – usually Greco-Roman – to imitate an imperial colonial dynasty. Few buildings in the Indies make reference to the Gothic style e.g. the residence of Raden Saleh. Layout is symmetrical, with high ceiling, thick walls, and marble floor. Buildings often have a front (\"voorgalerij\") and rear gallery (\"achtergalerij\"), flanked with Greek columns. This front and rear porticos are very spacious compared with its original European-style to improve cross ventilation into the interior as well as protecting it from intense tropical heat and rain – a European attempt to imitate the local pringgitan, a Javanese veranda with a bamboo bench where people may sleep during a hot noon. Furniture may be placed in the portico. An afternoon dance party or a card game are usually held in the portico, a tradition which mimics a French tradition more than a Dutch or Javanese tradition.\n\nAn Indies Empire Style building has a symmetrical layout and composition. It consists of a main building, sometimes with additional pavilions situated at both sides of the main building. The main building contains a central hall which connects both the front and rear portico as well as various rooms inside. A gallery connects the main building with a service building which contains rooms for slaves, storage, kitchen, and other service facilities. The whole compound is situated in a large piece of land with spacious gardens at the front, rear, and sides of the main building. Tropical palm trees usually decorate this landscaping.\n\nIndies Empire style buildings can still be found in major colonial cities in Indonesia such as Jakarta and Surabaya. Below are notable examples of Indies Empire style in Indonesia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1371359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1371359", "title": "Insufflation", "text": "Insufflation\n\nIn religious and magical practice, insufflation and exsufflation are ritual acts of blowing, breathing, hissing, or puffing that signify variously expulsion or renunciation of evil or of the devil (the Evil One), or infilling or blessing with good (especially, in religious use, with the Spirit or grace of God).\n\nIn historical Christian practice, such blowing appears most prominently in the liturgy, and is connected almost exclusively with baptism and other ceremonies of Christian initiation, achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or exorcistic significance, and were viewed as essential to the defeat of the devil or to the removal of the taint of original sin.\n\nRitual blowing occurs in the liturgies of catechumenate and baptism from a very early period and survives into the modern Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Maronite, and Coptic rites. Catholic liturgy post-Vatican II (the so-called \"novus ordo\" 1969) has largely done away with insufflation, except in a special rite for the consecration of chrism on Maundy Thursday. Protestant liturgies typically abandoned it very early on. The Tridentine Catholic liturgy retained both an insufflation of the baptismal water and (like the present-day Orthodox and Maronite rites) an exsufflation of the candidate for baptism, right up to the 1960s:\n\nFrom an early period, the act had two distinct but not always distinguishable meanings: it signified on the one hand the derisive repudiation or exorcism of the devil; and, on the other, purification and consecration by and inspiration with the Holy Spirit. The former is technically \"exsufflation\" (\"blowing out\") and the latter \"insufflation\" (\"blowing in\"), but ancient and medieval texts (followed by modern scholarship) make no consistent distinction in usage. For example, the texts use not only Latin \"insufflare\" ('blow in') and \"exsufflare\" ('blow out'), or their Greek or vernacular equivalents, but also the simplex \"sufflare\" ('blow'), \"halare\" ('breathe'), \"inspirare\", \"exspirare\", etc.\n\nTypical is the 8th-century \"Libellus de mysterio baptismatis\" of Magnus of Sens, one of a number of responses to a questionnaire about baptism circulated by Charlemagne. In discussing insufflation as a means of exorcising catechumens, Magnus combines a variety of mostly exsufflation-like functions≈\n\n\"Those who are to be baptised are insufflated by the priest of God, so that the Prince of Sinners [i.e. the devil] may be put to flight from out of them, and that entry for the Lord Christ might be prepared, and that by his insufflation they might be made worthy to receive the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nThis double role appears as early as Cyril of Jerusalem's 4th-century \"Mystagogic Catacheses\"; as Edward Yarnold notes, \"Cyril attributes both negative and positive effects [to insufflation]. … The rite of breathing on the [baptismal] candidate has the negative effect of blowing away the devil (exsufflation) and the positive effect of breathing in grace (insufflation).\"\n\nWhat might neutrally be called \"sufflation\" is found in some of the earliest liturgies dealing with the protracted process of initiation known as the \"catechumenate,\" which saw its heyday in the 4th and 5th centuries. The earliest extant liturgical use is possibly that of the \"Apostolic Tradition\" attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, from the 3rd or 4th century, and therefore contemporary with Cyril in the east:\n\nThose who are to be baptized should … be gathered in one place. … And [the bishop] should lay his hands on them and exorcize all alien spirits, that they may flee out of them and ever return into them. And when he has finished exorcizing them, he shall breathe on their faces; and when he has signed their foreheads, ears, and noses, he shall raise them up.\n\nThe practice entered the baptismal liturgy proper only as the catechumenate, rendered vestigial by the growth of routine infant baptism, was absorbed into the rite of baptism. Both exsufflation and insufflation are well established by the time of Augustine and in later centuries are found widely. By the Western high Middle Ages of the 12th century, sufflation was geographically widespread, and had been applied not only to sufflating catechumens and baptizands, but also to exorcism of readmitted heretics; to admission of adult converts to the catechumenate; to renunciation of the devil on the part of catechumens; to consecration and/or exorcism of the baptismal font and water; to consecration or exorcism of ashes; and to the consecration of the chrism or holy oil.\n\nMost of these variations persist in one branch or another of the hybrid Romano-Germanic rite that can be traced from 5th-century Rome through the western Middle Ages to the Council of Trent, and beyond that into modern (Tridentine) Roman Catholicism. As the 'national' rites such as the Ambrosian tradition in northern Italy and the Spanish Mozarabic rite faded away or were absorbed into international practice, it was this hybrid Roman-Gallican standard that came to dominate western Christendom, including Anglo-Saxon and medieval England, from the time of Charlemagne, and partly through his doing, through the high and late Middle Ages and into the modern period. Roman practice around the year 500 is reflected in a letter by a somewhat mysterious John the Deacon to a correspondent named Senarius. The letter discusses the exsufflation of catechumens at length. The Stowe Missal, Irish in origin but largely Gallican in form, contains a prebaptismal sufflation of unclear significance. The other Gallican rites are largely devoid of sufflation, though the so-called Missale Gothicum contains a triple exsufflation of baptismal water, and a prebaptismal insufflation of catechumens is found in the hybrid Bobbio Missal and the 10th-century Fulda sacramentary, alongside the more common baptismal exsufflation. The 11th-century North-Italian baptismal ritual in the Ambrosian Library MS. T.27.Sup. makes heavy use of the practice, requiring both insufflation and triple exsufflation of the baptismal candidates \"in modum crucis\", and insufflation of the font as well. The \"Hadrianum\" version of the Gregorian Sacramentary, sent to Charlemagne from Rome and augmented probably by Benedict of Aniane, contains an insufflation of the baptismal font, as does the mid-10th-century \"Ordo Romanus L\", the basis of the later Roman pontifical. \"Ordo Romanus L\" also contains a triple exsufflation of the candidates for baptism, immediately preceding the baptism itself.\n\nMost of the numerous Carolingian expositions of baptism treat sufflation to some extent. One anonymous 9th-century catechism is unusual in distinguishing explicitly between the exsufflation of catechumens and the insufflation of baptismal water, but most of the tracts and florilegia, when they treat both, do so without referring one to the other; most confine themselves to exsufflation and are usually content to quote extracts from authorities, especially Isidore and Alcuin. Particularly popular was Isidore's lapidary remark in the Etymologies to the effect that it is not the human being (\"God's creature\") that is exsufflated, but the Prince of Sinners to whom that person is subjected by being born in sin, a remark that echoed Augustine's arguments against the Pelagians to the effect that it was not the human infant (God's image) that was attacked in sufflation, but the infant's possessor, the devil. Particularly influential was Alcuin's brief treatment of the subject, the so-called \"Primo paganus\", which in turn depended heavily on John the Deacon. The \"Primo paganus\" formed the basis of Charlemagne's famous circular questionnaire on baptism, part of his effort to harmonize liturgical practice across his empire; and many of the seventeen extant direct or indirect responses to the questionnaire echo Alcuin, making the process a little circular and the texts a little repetitious. The burden of Alcuin's remarks, in fact, appears above in the quotation from the \"Libellus\" of Magnus of Sens, one of the respondents. The questionnaire assumed that exsufflation of or on the part of the candidate for baptism was generally practiced — it merely asks what meaning is attached to the practice:\n\n\"Concerning the renunciation of Satan and all his works and pomps, what is the renunciation? and what are the works of the devil and his pomps? why is he breathed upon? (\"cur exsufflatur?\") why is he exorcised?\"\n\nMost of the respondents answered that it was so that, with the devil sent fleeing, the entry of the Holy Spirit might be prepared for.\n\nOn the other side of the Channel, in Anglo-Saxon England, sufflation is mentioned in Bishop Wulfstan's collection of Carolingian baptismal expositions, the \"Incipit de baptisma\", and in the two vernacular (Old English) homilies based on it, the \"Quando volueris\" and the \"Sermo de baptismate\". The \"Incipit de baptisma\" reads: \"On his face let the sign of the cross be made by exsufflation, so that, the devil having been put to flight, entry for our Lord Christ might be prepared.\" Among English liturgical texts proper, the 10th-century Leofric Pontifical (and Sacramentary) dictates an insufflation of baptizands, a triple insufflation of the baptismal water, and an 'exhalation' of holy oil. In the 11th century, the \"Salisbury Pontifical\" (BL Cotton MS Tiberius C.1) and the \"Pontifical\" of Thomas of Canterbury require insufflation of the font; the \"Missal\" of Robert of Jumièges (Canterbury) has an erased rubric where it may have done likewise, as well as having an illegible rubric where it probably directed the exsufflation of catechumens, and retaining the old \"ordo ad caticuminum ex pagano faciendum,\" complete with its sufflation ceremony; and an English \"Ordo Romanus\" (BL Cotton MS Vitellius E.12) contains a triple exsufflation of baptizands. Various 12th-century texts include signing and triple exsufflation of the holy oil (Sarum), triple exsufflation of baptizands (the Ely, Magdalene, and Winton Pontificals), and insufflation of the font \"in modum crucis\" (Ely and Magdalene, followed by most later texts). Such are the origins of the late medieval sufflation rites, which were in turn retained in regularized form in post-Tridentine Catholicism.\n\nSufflation did not last long in any of the churches arising from the magisterial or radical reformations. Martin Luther's first attempt at a baptismal liturgy, the Tauffbuchlin (Taufbüchlein) of 1523 (reprinted 1524 and 1525) did retain many ceremonies from the late Medieval ritual as it was known in Germany, including a triple exsufflation of baptizands. But in an epilogue, Luther listed this ceremony among the adiaphora — i.e., the inessential features that added nothing to the meaning of the sacrament:\n\n\"The least importance attaches to these external things, namely breathing under the eyes, signing with the cross, placing salt in the mouth, putting spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and shoulders, and signing the top of the head with chrism, vesting in the christening robe, and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever else … men have added to embellish baptism. For … they are not the kind of devices that the devil shuns.\"\n\nThe Lutheran Strasbourg \"Taufbüchlein\" of June 1524, composed by Diobald Schwartz, assistant to Cathedral preacher Martin Zell, on the basis of the medieval rite used in Strasbourg combined with elements of Luther's 1523 rite, also retains baptismal exsufflation; so does Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg, in the same year.\n\nBut thereafter the practice vanished from Lutheranism, and indeed from Protestantism generally. Luther's revised edition of 1526 and its successors omit exsufflation altogether, as do the Luther-influenced early reformed rites of England (Thomas Cranmer's Prayer Book of 1549) and Sweden (the Manual of Olavus Petri), despite the former's conservative basis in the medieval Sarum ritual and the latter's strong interest in exorcism as an essential part of the baptismal ritual.\n\nSimilarly in the Swiss Reformation (the Zwinglian/Reformed tradition), only the very earliest rites retain sufflation, namely the ceremony published by Leo Jud, pastor of St. Peter's in Zurich, in the same year (1523) as Luther's first baptismal manual.\n\nThough sufflation does not appear in Protestant practice, it definitely appears in Protestant polemic, where it is usually treated as an un-Scriptural and superstitious (i.e., in the Protestant view, a typically Roman Catholic) practice, and even one reeking of enchantment or witchcraft. It appears as such, for example in the work of Henry More (the 'Cambridge Platonist') on evil. His argument essentially reverses that of Augustine. Augustine had said to the Pelagians (to paraphrase): \"you see that we exorcize and exsufflate infants before baptising them; therefore they must be tainted with sin and possessed by the devil since birth.\" More replies, in effect, \"Infants cannot be devil-possessed sinners; therefore, ceremonial exorcism and exsufflation is presumptuous, frightening, and ridiculous,\" in a word \"the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like Magick or Sorcery\":\n\"The conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized would seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes three Exsufflations upon his face, and uses an Exorcistical form for the ejecting of the foul Fiend. … And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in this approaching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be thought to have so much power over the Stygian Fiend, as to Exorcize him out of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once.\"\n\nSufflation appears in Roman Catholic anti-Protestant polemic, as well. The relative antiquity of the practice, and its strong endorsement by the Protestants' favorite Father, Augustine, made it a natural element in Catholic arguments that contrasted the Protestant with the ancient and Apostolic church. A true church, according to Roman Catholic apologists, would be:\n\n\"A Church that held the exorcismes exsufflations and renunciations, which are made in baptisme, for sacred Ceremonies, and of Apostolicall tradition... A Church which in the Ceremonies of baptisme, vsed oyle, salte, waxe, lights, exorcismes, the signe of the Cross, the word Epheta and other thinges that accompanie it; to testifie ... by exorcismes, that baptisme puts vs out of the Diuells possession.\n\nThis was argued on the grounds that some of these ceremonies were demonstrably ancient, and all of them might be.\n\n\"Sundry Ceremonies vsed in baptisme, and other Sacraments, as Exorcismes, Exsufflations, Christening, and the like mentioned by S. Augustine and by diuers other ancient Fathers ..., these being practised by the Primitiue Church (which is graunted to be the true Church) and compared to the customes of Protestants, and vs, in our Churches, will easily disclose, which of the two, they or we, do more imitate, or impugne the true Church of antiquity.\"\n\nTo which a Protestant reply was that sufflation was not ancient \"enough\", and could not be proved to be apostolic:\n\n\"It was plain then there was no clear Tradition in the Question, possibly there might be a custome in some Churches postnate to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall. But this was a suppletory device ready at hand when ever they needed it; and S. Austin confuted the Pelagians, in the Question of Original sinne, by the custome of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. Austin said came from the Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be prov'd, that he that shall affirm it, shall gaine only the reputation of a bold man and a confident.\"\n\nSufflation was judged by Protestant critics to be irrational, mysterious, and obscure, an increasingly important factor by the close of the 17th century and the dawn of the Enlightenment:\n\n\"Mystery prevail'd very little in the first Hundred or Century of Years after Christ; but in the second and third, it began to establish it self by Ceremonies. To Baptism were then added the tasting of Milk and Honey, Anointing, the Sign of the Cross, a white Garment, &c. ... But in later times there was no end of Lights, Exorcisms, Exsufflations, and many other Extravagancies of Jewish, or Heathen Original ... for there is nothing like these in the Writings of the Apostles, but they are all plainly contain'd in the Books of the Gentiles, and was the Substance of their Worship.\"\n\nIt was said to be a human invention, imposed by the arbitrary whim of a tyrannical prelate against the primitive Gospel freedom of the church:\n\n\"[Some bishop] ... taking it into his head that there ought to be a trine-immersion in baptism; another the signation of the cross; another an unction with oil; another milk and honey, and imposition of hands immediately after it; another insufflation or breathing upon the person's face to exorcise the Devil... Thus, I say, that inundation of abominable corruptions, which at present overwhelms both the Greek and Romish Churches, gradually came in at this very breech which you are now zealously maintaining, namely, the Bishop's Power to decree rites and ceremonies in the Church.\"\nTo all of which, Roman Catholic apologists replied that insufflation was not only ancient and Apostolic, but had been practiced by Christ himself:\n\n\"When he [Christ] had said this he breathed upon them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Ghost...\" When the Pastors of our Church use the Insufflation or Breathing upon any, for the like mystical Signification, you cry aloud, Superstition, Superstition, an apish mimical action, &c.\"\n\nThough liturgical sufflation is almost gone, at least from the Western churches, its revival is not inconceivable. Liturgical renewal movements always seem to look to the 'classic' catechumenate of the 4th and 5th centuries for inspiration. Insufflation has indeed been re-introduced into the Catholic \"new catechumenate.\" But many ceremonies dating from that or the medieval period have been re-imported even into Protestant rites during the last couple of decades. Perhaps even more likely is a revival in the context of the growth of the Roman Catholic Church in Africa and in Asia, where locally and culturally meaningful ceremonies have often revolutionized practice, and where the exorcistic function of baptism has taken on a new vitality. For example, a pure insufflation is apparently practiced in the Philippine Independent Church, and Spinks mentions a pre-baptismal ceremony used by the Christian Workers' Fellowship of Sri Lanka, in which the candidates are struck with a cane and their faces are breathed upon. It is not clear whether the latter represents a revival of historical sufflation, or a wholly new ceremony derived from local custom.\n\nThere were at least three kinds of association that particularly influenced how liturgical sufflation came to be understood: Biblical antecedents; liturgical setting; and extra-liturgical (cultural) analogs.\n\nThree Biblical passages recur repeatedly with reference to insufflation narrowly defined, all of them referring to some kind of life-giving divine breath. The first and most commonly cited is (echoed by and ), in which God first creates man and then breathes into him the breath of life, in order to give him (as the passage was later interpreted) a human soul. The second passage, , reinterprets the Genesis passage prophetically, in foreseeing God resurrecting the dead bones of exiled Israel by means of his life-giving breath. And finally, in , Christ is represented as conveying the Paraclete to his disciples, and so initiating the commissioned church, by breathing on them, here too, very possibly, with implicit reference to the original creation. The two passages were connected explicitly in later Christian exegesis: the same breath that created man re-created him.\n\n\"[Insufflation] signifies, To blow into, Gen. 2. 7. This sheweth mans soul not to be of the earth, as his body was, but of nothing, by the insufflation of God, and so differing from the spirit of beasts, Eccl. 3. 21. This word is used also, when Christ to make men new creatures, inspired his Apostles with the holy Ghost, Joh. 20. 21.\"\n\n\"The Lord God, saith the Text, formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living Soul. His Body made of Earth, but his Soul the Breath of God. … We must not understand it grosly; for so Breath is not attributable unto God, who is a simple and perfect Spirit; but … as a figurative expression of God's communicating unto Man that inward Principle, whereby he lives and acts, not only in common with, but in a degree above other Animals. … The Learned P. Fagius takes notice of three things in the Text of Moses, which do conclude the Immortality of the Soul of Man. I. \"Insufflatio illa Dei:\" This Inspiration from God spoken of: For he that breaths into another, contributes unto him \"aliquid de suo\" somewhat of his own: And therefore, saith he, when our B. Saviour would communicate his Spirit to his Disciples, he did it with Insufflation, breathing on them, thereby to signifie, \"se Divinum & de suo quiddam illis contribuere\" [i.e., that he was himself divine and was infusing something of his own into them].\"\n\nThe associations with creation, rebirth, initiation, and revivification created by these passages of Scripture suited insufflation for a role in baptism as it has been most commonly regarded: as figuring the waters of creation (over which the Spirit brooded); as figuring the womb of rebirth; and as figuring (in Saint Paul's metaphor) the tomb, into which the Christian joins Christ in descending, and from which the Christian likewise joins Christ in ascending, dead to the old life but made alive again in Christ.\n\nThere are also Biblical antecedents for exsufflation, properly speaking, that is, exorcistic blowing, especially the numerous Old Testament passages in which \"the breath of God\" is the vehicle or symbol not of life but of death and destruction — an expression of the wrath of God: \"by the breath of God they perish / and by the blast of his anger they are consumed\" (Job 4:9, RSV). The same power is attributed metaphorically to Christ: \"The lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of his mouth\" (2 Thessalonians 2:8, RSV). Even less obvious passages could be associated with liturgical exsufflation. Jesse of Amiens, for example, interprets Psalm 34 (Vulg. 35):5 as descriptive of the fate of exsufflated devils: \"\"Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on!\" And the apocryphal Acts of Thomas describes a baptismal ceremony which, though it does not explicitly contain a breathing ceremony, may imply one, \"Let the gift come by which, breathing upon thine enemies, thou didst make them draw back and fall headlong, and let it dwell in this oil, over which we name thy holy name.\"\n\nGod's breath can be fiery, consuming all it touches: \"I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath\" (Ezekiel 21:31, RSV). Some of the interpretations of exsufflation may reflect this. Cyril of Jerusalem, for example, when he discusses exsufflation in his catechetical sermons, interprets the liturgical practice in terms of fire:\n\n\"The breathing of the saints and the invocation of the name of God, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits.\"\n\nFire remains a theme in later liturgical exorcisms, for devils, as Nicetas is reported to have said, \"are purged by exorcisms as by fire\": \"we come against you, devil, with spiritual words and fiery speech; we ignite the hiding places in which you are concealed.\"\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, fire is physically and symbolically associated with sufflation because of the traditional placement of baptism within the Paschal vigil — a setting heavy with symbolism of light and fire: the blessing of the Paschal candle, the lighting of the \"new fire,\" and the singing of the \"Exultet\" and the \"Lumen Christi.\" The intimate connection between divine breath and divine fire appears in its most visually arresting form during the benediction of the font, in which, according to most orders, the candle is dipped in the font while the priest declares the power of the Holy Spirit to have descended into the water: the sufflation of the font in most cases directly precedes or accompanies the immersion of the candle. Their close association can again be illustrated from Wulfstan's baptismal homilies:\n\n\"By the breath that the priest breathes into the font when he blesses it, the devil is straightway driven out from it. And when the priest dips the consecrated candle in the water, then that water forthwith becomes imbued with the Holy Ghost.\"\n\nSimilar considerations bind sufflation closely to imagery of light and darkness, specifically of the movement of the baptizand from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light (a very common theme), and to the sign of the cross (a very common action), among others that could be mentioned. John the Deacon uses light-dark imagery to explain exsufflation in exorcism as a transition:\n\nSo also Augustine (\"The church exsufflates and exorcises [infants] that the power of darkness might be cast out from them\"), and Isidore (\"The power of the devil is ... exsufflated in them, so that ... being delivered from the power of darkness, [they] might be translated unto the kingdom of their Lord\").\n\nAnd as regards signation (the sign of the cross), in Western texts from as early as the Gelasian Sacramentary, the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other, and their significance is often complementary if not identical. In Raban Maur's discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back. The two signs are frequently combined, the blowing done in the form of a cross, e.g. in the Syriac Rite described by James of Edessa, in the modern Coptic rite, in the late 9th-century \"Ordo Romanus XXXI\", in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their Continental sources, in the 10th-century Ambrosian rites for catechumen and font, in the 11th-century North Italian catechumenal rites, in the 12th- through 15th-century English pontificals, in the Sarum Missal, and in the 13th-century Roman pontifical.\n\nThere are hints in some of the Church Fathers that Christians had a habit of breathing (or hissing) at evil spirits as a recognized act of revulsion or repulsion, even apart from the ceremonies of the church. Tertullian is perhaps the best witness. He seems to be talking about an extra-liturgical casting out of demons by means of exsufflation and signing when he declares that gods rejected by Christians are driven from the bodies of men \"by our touch and by our breath,\" and are thus \"carried away by the thought and vision of the fire [of judgment].\" He is talking about an ordinary gesture of aversion when he asks a Christian incense-dealer (regarded as hypocritical because he sells incense for polytheistic altars), \"with what mouth, I ask, will he spit and blow before the fuming altars for which he himself provided? with what constancy will he [thus] exorcise his foster children?\" And his remarks to his wife about the dangers of mixed marriage suggest that exsufflation was a distinctively Christian practice: \"[If you marry again, to a non-Christian,] shall you escape notice when you sign your bed or your body? when you blow away some impurity? When even by night you rise to pray?\"\n\nIf such a custom did exist, it would clarify certain remarks by other Fathers, which might otherwise seem merely metaphorical. Eusebius, for example, says of the saints that they were men \"who though they only breathed and spoke, were able to scatter the counsels of evil demons.\" Irenaeus describes the right response to Gnostic doctrine as \"reviling\" (καταφυσησαντας; literally \"exsufflantes\"). Cyril of Jerusalem, speaking of resisting temptation, not of baptism, says that \"the mere breathing of the exorcist becomes as a fire to that unseen foe.\" And Augustine's remarks about blowing on images of the emperor suggest that the significance of the gesture was well enough established to be actionable: \"Of the great crime of lese majesty ... is he held guilty, according to the laws of this world, who blows upon an image ... of the emperor.\" Even as late as Bede, we may suspect that \"exsufflate\" in the sense of \"revile\" or \"cast off\" may be a living metaphor.\n\nThe extremely influential \"Life of Saint Martin\" by Sulpicius Severus seems to have set in motion a hagiographic tradition in which saints cast out demons or repel tempting devils by blowing at them. Of Saint Pachomius, for example, it is said that \"defending his brow with the sign of the cross, he blew upon [the demon] and immediately he fled … ; blowing upon him, he said, 'depart from me, devil.'\" And of Saint Goswin that \"a demon stood before Saint Goswin saying 'surely you see that I am Christ …' and … therefore Saint Goswin exsufflated vigorously, saying 'depart foe …,' and immediately … the devil vanished.\" Saint Justina is reported to have similarly unmasked a series of increasingly subtle and powerful demons, finally melting the prince of demons himself: \"blowing upon the devil, she immediately melted him like wax and … felt herself freed from all temptation.\" And Saint Felix is said to have destroyed idols and uprooted sacred trees by like means.\n\nThe breath of the saints was credited with healing, as well as exorcistic, powers from an early period. Gregory of Nyssa says of Gregory Thaumaturgus ('Gregory the magician') that he needed to resort to \"no finicking and laborious\" magic, but \"there sufficed, for both the casting out of demons and the healing of bodily ailments, the breath of his mouth.\" Similar powers are attributed to the Irish saints: kindling lamps, curing dumbness. This theme, too, persists in later hagiographic and quasi-hagiographic texts, appearing, for example in the \"Estoire del saint graal\" as the agency by which a madman is miraculously restored. Among English texts, Felix's \"Life of Saint Guthlac\" relates that in order to give relief to a boy afflicted by madness, he \"washed him in the water of the sacred font and, breathing into his face the breath of healing [or 'spirit of salvation'], drove away from him all the power of the evil spirit,\" illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing healing from exorcism in an era in which madness was attributed to demonic possession. The miracle that Bishop John performed, according to Bede, on behalf of Herebald, is another example, since it involved a sufflation that was seemingly exorcistic, catechetical, and curative simultaneously.\n\nTertullian remarked to his wife about Christian practices: \"will you not seem to be doing magic?\" in the eyes of a non-believer.\n\nCelsus (according to Origen) reports the use of exsufflation by Egyptian magicians. Plotinus seems to attack its use by Roman ones. One of Lucian's tall tales mentions a Chaldean pest-control sorcerer who causes toads and snakes to vanish by blowing on them.\nIt is possible to see Jesus himself as a supernatural healer (Christ Jesus the son of God), in many popular events of the holy Bible, in which he is constantly healing many blind, lame, crippled, lepers, maimed, and even causing his own resurrection, just to name a few. In one instance Jesus used his spit to heal the eyes of a blind man who was born blind, caused by his parents sins;\n. However, regarding magic, in Syria, where ceremonial breathing became formalized as part of the rite of visitation of the sick. Ephraem Syrus advises that \"if medicine fails you when you are sick, the 'visitors' will help, will pray for health, and one of them will breathe in your mouth, the other will sign you [with the sign of the cross].\"\n\nIf it was either originally Christian (citation needed), Catholic or from the pagan practices, almost similar methods of healing have been reported, continuing until modern times: in Westphalia, the healing of a wound by triple signing and triple cruciform sufflation, or by exsufflation accompanied by a rhyming charm; and in Holland the alleviation of toothache by similar means. According to Drechsler, \"Illnesses were blown away by the breath. If a child had bumped himself, one would blow three times on the place and it would 'fly away.'\" Burns, and conditions that in some fashion resemble burns, such as fevers, boils, sore throats and rashes, are naturally the most common objects of blowing among modern folk-remedies, for example the Shetland cure that requires blowing on a burn three times while reciting the charm \"Here come I to cure a burnt sore. / If the dead knew what the living endure, / The burnt sore would burn no more.\" But everything from jaundice, convulsions, and colic to bad luck and evil spells can apparently be alleviated by a bit of blowing. Wolters points out that exorcistic blowing was still (in 1935) found in the custom of blowing over bread that is about to be eaten. Moreover,\n\nA Syrian blows over his child to avert the evil eye. Some stillblow three times over a strange spoon before using it, and in Alaska the medicineman blows into the nose and mouth of a patient to drive out the daemon of disease.\nFinally, in one American example of superstition clearly derived from liturgical use, it is said that if at the baptism of a baby one turns at the door and blows three times, one can successfully prevent the devil from ever coming between the baby and the altar.\n"}

From there she jumped to writing for national media such as the magazine \"Época\" and the newspaper \"ABC\", where she began to write the political column \"El contrapunto\", and where she remained from 1989 to 2000.\n\nHer first contacts with the world of television were due to Jesús Hermida, who brought her into the political tertulia of the programs he presented and hosted on Antena 3: ' (1995) and ' (1996–1997). In the 1995–1996 season she also worked for Cadena SER, both on \"\" and \"Hoy por hoy\". \n\nIn 1997, she went into public media at the request of the new RTVE director, .

The exit was framed in the context of a tough confrontation between Pedro J. Ramírez, director of the newspaper \"El Mundo\" and César Alierta, president of Telefónica, majority shareholder of the network at that time. According to the journalist herself, who worked in both media (she had joined the editorial staff of \"El Mundo\" in March 2000), she was pressured to leave the newspaper. Faced with her refusal, Antena 3 acted, in her words, \"repressing her.\"\n\nAt that moment, Luis Herrero on Cadena COPE and María Teresa Campos on television, both critics of the way in which the journalist was fired, offered her a spot on their respective political tertulias. Isabel San Sebastián was thus brought onto ' on COPE and ' on Telecinco.\n\nIn the 2004–2005 season she led the political program \"El Debate\" on Telemadrid, joining the María Teresa Campos team the following year, this time on Antena 3: first in September 2005, for the season of ', and in 2006 on the short-lived show '.\n\nThat same season of 2004, when Federico Jiménez Losantos replaced Herrero at the head of \"La Mañana\", Isabel San Sebastián opted to follow Luis del Olmo in his latest radio venture and joined the new edition of \"Protagonistas\" on .\n\nIn 2007 she participated in the political tertulias of the TVE program \"\" and Telemadrid's \"Alto y Claro\".

She was a pioneer for women in the film industry. She worked with some of the best filmmakers of the time period including D. W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille. While she started in the theater, and then had a brief stint as an actress, she ultimately dedicated her life's work to screenwriting for DeMille. She was appraised for her new level resourcefulness and attentiveness to the needs of DeMille.\n\nMacPherson was born Abbie Jean Macpherson in Boston to a wealthy family. Her parents were John S. Macpherson and Evangeline C. Tomlinson. She was a petite, spirited girl of Spanish, Scottish, and French descent. As a teenager she was sent to Mademoiselle DeJacque's school in paris but was forced to leave when her family fell on hard times. She then returned to the United States and began to look for a job.\n\nIt was back in the United States that MacPherson finished her degree from the prestigious Kenwood Institute in Chicago. It was there, in the windy city of Chicago, where she started her career as a dancer and stage performer. She began her theatrical career in the chorus of the Chicago Opera House. Over the next few years she took singing lessons and took whatever theater-related jobs that she could find. However, she quickly became infatuated with film.\n\nShe was quoted as saying, \"All I knew was that I wanted to act. Then someone told me about motion pictures, how drama was filmed. I was fascinated. I like mechanics anyway. I hunted all over New York for a studio—and couldn't find one. At last a super told me a man named Griffith was doing pictures for the Biograph Company. Mr. Griffith wasn't in. His assistant was. I told him my stage experience. He ignored it, scorned it. 'We want to know what you can do before a camera.'\"\n\nShe made her film debut in 1908 with a short film called the \"Fatal Hour\" directed by D. W. Griffith. For the next year she acted in many controversial roles in which she had to portray ethnicities other than her own for Griffith's films. MacPherson had dark hair, so she was often cast in gypsy or Spanish roles, even though she was of Scotch and French origin. From 1908 to 1917 she is accredited with 146 acting credits. She was quoted as looking back on her time with Griffith as her \"first glimmer of the possibilities in the new industry [and] from those days on [she had] seen a variety of attitudes toward the script writers.\"\n\nAfter Griffith, she went on to the old Universal Company where she was a leading lady. She got her first real opportunity here in 1913, when she wrote, directed, and starred in, \"The Tarantula\" (1913) for them. She played the role of a Spanish-Mexican girl, known as the tarantula, whom would get men to become obsessed with her and then once she had their infatuation, she would get bored of them and kill them with a tarantula bite. Due to this film she became the youngest director in motion picture history. The film concluded her directing career. She continued at the old Universal Company for two years until her health caused her to break from the company. Upon her recovery she found herself at Lasky Studios, however, she quickly sought out Cecil B. DeMille to see if she could act in his films. He told her, \"I am not interested in star Macpherson but I am in writer Macpherson\"; from that point on, she solely focused on writing.\n\nDeMille and MacPherson formed what became one of the most influential and long-lasting partnerships in the industry. She was infatuated with his perfection and force of will, while he was captivated by her high spirited courage. She penned 30 of DeMille's next 34 films. They admired each other; he would provide the crowd shots and epic sense, while she would humanize the heroine. They both loathed weakness, which they defined as a man being degraded and women, who were shallow and money-hungry, looking for a man to take care of them. They both believed in the power of people to change their ways, which many of their scripts showed.\n\nSome of their most notable works are \"Rose of the Rancho\" (1914) with Bessie Barriscale, \"The Girl of the Golden West\" with Mabel Van Buren, \"The Cheat\" (1915) with Sessue Hayakawa, \"The Golden Chance\" (1915) with Wallace Reid, \"Joan the Woman\" (1916) with Geraldine Farrar, \"A Romance of the Redwoods\" (1917) with Mary Pickford, \"The Little American\" again with Pickford, and \"The Woman God Forgot\" (1917) again with Farrar.\n\nShe thoroughly believed that as motion picture owes its psychology to D. W. Griffith, it owes its dramatic picture scenario construction to that of DeMille. Through her pen as a female scenarist she was able to give women a voice in the film writing industry. In 1927, she was one of the founding members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe outside world was very skeptical of MacPherson and DeMille's relationship, as some believed that they may be having an affair. In 1921, MacPherson told a reporter, \"I shall always be grateful for Mr. DeMille's assistance. He is a hard taskmaster and he demands that a thing shall be perfect... It was hard, but it taught me that anything worth doing at all was worth doing perfectly.\" It was later confirmed by DeMille's niece that MacPherson was in fact one of his three mistresses.\n\nShe was obsessed with flying, and would try to do so daily. She bragged about being the only woman having piloted the plane of the late Lieutenant Locklear, the world’s greatest stunt flier. He gave her the utmost confidence in her skill.\n\nIn 1946, MacPherson became ill with cancer while researching \"Unconquered\" (1947), a historical drama, and had to stop work. She died that August in Los Angeles at age 60, and was buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood. She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6150 Hollywood Blvd.\n\n"}

Her lover at the time was the American painter James Whistler, a friend of Courbet.\n\nHiffernan was the subject of a series of four portaits by Courbet entitled \"La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo)\" painted in 1865-66. The possibility that she was the model for or that she was having an affair with Courbet might explain Courbet's and Whistler's brutal separation a short while later. In spite of Hiffernan's red hair contrasting with the darker pubic hair of , the hypothesis that Hiffernan was the model continues. Redhead Jacky Colliss Harvey puts forward the idea that the woman's body-hair suggests a more obvious candidate might be the brunette painted with Hiffernan in Courbet's \"Le Sommeil\"; and that the identification with Hiffernan has been greatly influenced by the eroticised and sexualised image of the female redhead.\nIn February 2013, \"Paris Match\" reported that Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fernier had authenticated a painting of a young woman's head and shoulders as the upper section of which according to some was severed from the original work. Fernier has stated that because of the conclusions reached after two years of analysis, the head will be added to the next edition of the Courbet catalogue raisonné. The Musée d'Orsay has indicated that \"L'Origine du monde\" was not part of a larger work. \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that \"experts at the [French] art research centre CARAA (Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Archéologie) were able to align the two paintings via grooves made by the original wooden frame and lines in the canvas itself, whose grain matched.\" According to CARAA, it performed pigment analyses which were identified as classical pigments of the 2nd half of the 19th century. No other conclusions were reported by the CARAA. The claim reported by \"Paris Match\" was characterized as dubious by \"Le Monde\" art critic Philippe Dagen, indicating differences in style, and that canvas-similarities could be caused by buying from the same shop.\n\nDocumentary evidence however links the painting with Constance Quéniaux, a former dancer at the Paris Opera and a mistress of the Ottoman diplomat Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) who commisioned the painting. According to the historian Claude Schopp and the head of the French National Library's prints department, Sylvie Aubenas, the evidence is found in correspondence between Alexandre Dumas fils and George Sand. Another potential model was Marie-Anne Detourbay, who also was a mistress of Halil Şerif Pasha.\n\nHalil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) is believed to have commissioned the work shortly after he moved to Paris. Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve introduced him to Courbet and he ordered a painting to add to his personal collection of erotic pictures, which already included (\"The Turkish Bath\") from Ingres and another painting by Courbet, \"Le Sommeil\" (\"The Sleepers\"), for which it is supposed that Hiffernan was one of the models.\n\nAfter Khalil Bey's finances were ruined by gambling, the painting subsequently passed through a series of private collections. It was first bought during the sale of the Khalil Bey collection in 1868, by antique dealer Antoine de la Narde. Edmond de Goncourt hit upon it in an antique shop in 1889, hidden behind a wooden pane decorated with the painting of a castle or a church in a snowy landscape. According to Robert Fernier, who published two volumes of the Courbet catalogue raisonné and founded the Musée Courbet, Hungarian collector Baron Ferenc Hatvany bought it at the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in 1910 and took it with him to Budapest. Towards the end of the Second World War the painting was looted by Soviet troops, but later ransomed by Hatvany. Hatvany left Hungary, which was on the brink of a Communist takeover, in 1947. He was allowed to take only one art work with him, and he took to Paris.\n\nIn 1955 was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs, about 4,285 US dollars at the time. Its new owner was the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. He and his wife, actress Sylvia Bataille, installed it in their country house in Guitrancourt. Lacan asked André Masson, his stepbrother, to build a double bottom frame and draw another picture thereon. Masson painted a surrealist, allusive version of .\n\nThe New York public had the opportunity to view in 1988 during the \"Courbet Reconsidered\" show at the Brooklyn Museum; the painting was also included in the exhibition \"Gustave Courbet\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2008. After Lacan died in 1981, the French Minister of Economy and Finances agreed to settle the family's inheritance tax bill through the transfer of the work ( in French law) to the Musée d'Orsay; the transfer was finalized in 1995.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the display of the nude body underwent a revolution whose main activists were Courbet and Manet. Courbet rejected academic painting and its smooth, idealised nudes, but he also directly recriminated the hypocritical social conventions of the Second Empire, where eroticism and even pornography were acceptable in mythological or oneiric paintings.\n\nCourbet later insisted he never lied in his paintings, and his realism pushed the limits of what was considered presentable. With , he has made even more explicit the eroticism of Manet's \"Olympia\". Maxime Du Camp, in a harsh tirade, reported his visit to the work's purchaser, and his sight of a painting \"giving realism's last word\".\nBy the very nature of its realistic, graphic nudity, the painting still has the power to shock and triggers censorship.\n\nAlthough moral standards and resulting taboos regarding the artistic display of nudity have changed since Courbet, owing especially to photography and cinema, the painting remained provocative. Its arrival at the Musée d'Orsay caused high excitement. According to postcard sales, is the second most popular painting in the Musée d'Orsay, after Renoir's \"Bal du moulin de la Galette\".\n\nSome critics maintain that the body depicted is not (as has been argued) a lively erotic portray of a female but of a corpse: \"\"L’Origine\" does not represent a full female body but rather a slice of one, cut off by the frame [...]. The pallidness of the skin and the mortuary gauze surrounding the body suggest death.\"\n\nThe explicitness of the picture may have served as an inspiration, albeit with a satirical twist, for Marcel Duchamp's last major work, \"Étant donnés\" (1946–1966), a construction also featuring the image of a woman lying on her back with her legs spread.\n\nIn 1989, French artist Orlan created the cibachrome \"L'origine de la guerre\" (\"The Origin of War\"), a male version of \"L'origine du monde\" showing a penile erection.\n\nIn February 1994, the novel (\"Perpetual Adorations\") by reproduced on its cover. Police visited several French bookshops to have them withdraw the book from their windows. A few proprietors maintained the book, but others complied, and some voluntarily removed it.\n\nBrazilian artist Vik Muniz created two versions of the famous painting. \"The first [1999] is a photograph made of dust or dirt, which plays with the common moralist association between female genitalia and filth. In the second piece [2013], Muniz remakes \"L’Origine\" from an assemblage of journal clippings that are reminiscent of the anatomic and artistic procedure of cutting that produced [...] the female body.\"\n\n\"Two Origins of the World\" (2000) by Mexican artist Enrique Chagoya \"recycles \"L’Origine du monde\" as a spectral backdrop behind three solid black, blue and white squares of canvas in three of the corners of the painting. In the foreground of the bottom right corner, an indigenous man sits at a fourth canvas, this one on an easel, apparently 'interpreting' the Courbet painting.\"\n\nIn 2002, American artist Jack Daws created an homage to the painting. Entitled \"Origins of the World\", it is a collection of various photographs of vulvas, taken from pornographic magazines, and framed in montage.\n\nThe British artist Anish Kapoor created an installation in 2004 called \"L'Origine du monde\", which references Courbet's painting. The piece is in the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa in Japan.\n\nThe image is also referenced as inspiring Catherine Breillat's filming of the female genitalia in her 2004 film (\"Anatomy of Hell\").\n\nThe Serbian performance artist Tanja Ostojić parodied the work in a poster in 2005, informally called the \"EU panties\" poster. Like Courbet's painting, the poster proved controversial, and was ultimately removed from the art exhibition in which it was originally displayed.\n\nOn February 23, 2009 in Braga, Portugal, the police confiscated the book \"Pornocratie\" by Catherine Breillat, displayed in bookshops using as its cover. A great deal of controversy was sparked by the police action. The reason given was the need to maintain public order. Also, the book title incorrectly hinted at pornographic content. Portuguese law forbids public displays of pornography.\n\nIn 2010, British composer Tony Hymas composed a musical suite dedicated to the picture as well as relations between Courbet and the Paris Commune, based on texts by Courbet himself, Charles Baudelaire and Pierre Dupont.\n\nIn February 2011, Facebook censored after it was posted by Copenhagen-based artist Frode Steinicke, to illustrate his comments about a television program aired on DR2. Following the incident, many other Facebook users defiantly changed their profile pictures to the Courbet painting in an act of solidarity with Steinicke. Facebook, which originally disabled Steinicke's profile, finally re-enabled it without the picture. As the case won media attention, Facebook deleted other pages about the painting.\n\nIn October 2011, again, a complaint was lodged against Facebook with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris (Paris court of general jurisdiction) by a French Facebook user after his profile was disabled for showing a picture of . The picture was a link to a television program aired on Arte about the history of the painting. As he got no answer to his emails to Facebook, he decided to lodge a complaint for \"infringement of freedom of expression\" and against the legality of Facebook's terms which define the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, as the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all litigating claims. In February 2016, the Paris court ruled that Facebook could be sued in France. \n\nThe German-born Turkish artist Taner Ceylan has painted a work named \"1879 (From the Lost Paintings Series)\" (2011) in which a veiled Ottoman noblewoman stands before the framed canvas of \"L'Origine du monde\".\n\nOn 29 May 2014, a Luxembourg performance artist, Deborah De Robertis, sat on the floor in front of the painting and mimicked the view of the subject. This resulted in security guards closing the room and her arrest.\n\nUS artist Candice Lin recreated \"L’Origine du monde\" in a video of her an audiovisual sculpture \"Hunter Moon / Inside Out\" (2015). In it, \"Courbet’s L’Origine du monde with eyes\" \"looks back at the onlookers.\" From a feminist point of view, Lin's work challenges \"the asymmetry of power [...] between those who look and those who are seen.\"\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

The film stars Tom Hardy in the title role, the only character seen on screen, as he carries on a number of speakerphone conversations with characters voiced by Olivia Colman, Ruth Wilson, Andrew Scott, Ben Daniels, Tom Holland, and Bill Milner. \n\nThe film premiered at Broad Street in Westside, Birmingham at the 70th Venice Film Festival on 2 September 2013. The film had a limited release in the United Kingdom beginning on 18 April 2014, and grossed $5 million worldwide. \"Locke\" received critical acclaim, particularly for Hardy's performance, which won him the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor.\n\nThe evening before he must supervise a large concrete pour in Birmingham (the largest non-nuclear facility concrete pour in European history), construction foreman Ivan Locke learns that Bethan, a colleague from a job in Croydon with whom he had a one-night stand seven months before (which resulted in her becoming pregnant), has gone into premature labour. Despite his job responsibilities and although his wife and sons are eagerly awaiting his arrival home to watch an important football match, Locke decides to drive to London to be with Bethan during childbirth. Locke never forgave his father for abandoning him as a child, and he is determined not to make the same mistake, even though he has no relationship with, nor any particular feelings for, Bethan.\n\nOver the course of the two-hour drive from Birmingham to London, Locke holds a total of 36 phone calls with: his boss Gareth; his backup work colleague Donal; Katrina – his wife of 15 years – to confess his infidelity; his sons, Eddie and Sean, who call him separately with updates on the match and (eventually) the worrisome breakdown of their mother; St. Mary's maternity unit medical personnel, Sister Margaret then Dr. Gullu, who are working with Bethan through some troubling complications; the council head, Cassidy, and local police authority, PC Davids, required for the road closures needed to allow the 225+ concrete trucks to properly access the site; and with Bethan to reassure her during her labour. During these calls, he is fired from his job, banned from his house by his wife, and asked by his older son to please return home. He coaches his assistant Donal through preparing the pour despite some major setbacks, and has imaginary conversations with his dead father, whom he envisions (unseen onscreen) as a passenger in the car; he berates his father for abandoning Locke's family, and vows he will not repeat that mistake. When he is close to the hospital, Bethan calls to share the cooing of the baby, having had a successful birth.\n\nAlmost the entire film takes place within a BMW X5, which was pulled down the M6 motorway on a low flatbed trailer for most of the shoot. Shooting took place in real time, over just eight nights, with the crew only taking breaks to change the three cameras' memory cards. Ivan Locke is the only character to appear onscreen; the others are only heard on the vehicle's speakerphone, with their parts also recorded in real time (Locke's vehicle and road noise included) as they called from a conference room that served as the multiple \"locations\" of the various characters.\n\n\"Locke\" was shown out of competition at the 70th Venice International Film Festival as well as the Spotlight program in the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIt was released on 18 April 2014 in the United Kingdom, where it earned $3,264,654. On 25 April 2014 it opened in the United States and earned $1,375,769. The film was released on Blu-Ray and DVD on 12 August 2014.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports that 91% of 200 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.7/10. The critical consensus states: \"A one-man show set in a single confined location, Locke demands a powerful performance – and gets it from a never-more-compelling Tom Hardy.\" The film has a score of 81 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 37 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nOlly Richards of \"Empire\" awarded the film 4/5 stars and said: \"There are films to see on huge screens, but this is one that almost cries out for a small cinema, surrounded by total blackness. It's a daring experiment brilliantly executed, with Tom Hardy giving one of the best performances of his career\".\n\nIn his book \"How to Watch a Movie\" (2015), David Thomson singles out this film and says: \"No film I've seen in recent years is more eloquent on where we are now, and on how alone we feel. There is little left but to watch and listen.\"\n\nFor his performance, Hardy won the Best Actor Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.\n\n"}

{"id": "62131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62131", "title": "Nicolas Poussin", "text": "Nicolas Poussin\n\nNicolas Poussin (; June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was the leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscapes in his pictures. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne.\n\nDetails of Poussin's artistic training are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 he traveled to Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works he saw in the royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters—especially Raphael, who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal Francesco Barberini and the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as \"The Death of Germanicus\", \"The Massacre of the Innocents\", and the first of his two series of the \"Seven Sacraments\".\n\nHe was persuaded to return to France in 1640 to be First Painter to the King but, dissatisfied with the overwhelming workload and the court intrigues, returned permanently to Rome after a little more than a year. Among the important works from his later years are \"Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun\", \"Landscape with Hercules and Cacus\", and \"The Seasons\".\n\nNicolas Poussin's early biographer was his friend Giovanni Pietro Bellori, who relates that Poussin was born near Les Andelys in Normandy and that he received an education that included some Latin, which would stand him in good stead. Another early friend and biographer, André Félibien, reported that \"He was busy without cease filling his sketchbooks with an infinite number of different figures which only his imagination could produce.\" His early sketches attracted the notice of Quentin Varin, who passed some time in Andelys, but there is no mention by his biographers that he had a formal training in Varin's studio, though his later works showed the influence of Varin, particularly by their storytelling, accuracy of facial expression, finely painted drapery and rich colors. His parents apparently opposed a painting career for him, and In or around 1612, at the age of eighteen, he ran away to Paris.\n\nHe arrived in Paris during the regency of Marie de Medici, when art was flourishing as a result of the royal commissions given by Marie de Medici for the decoration of her palace, and by the rise of wealthy Paris merchants who bought art. There was also a substantial market for paintings in the redecoration of churches outside Paris destroyed during the French Wars of Religion, which had recently ended, and for the numerous convents in Paris and other cities. However, Poussin was not a member of the powerful guild of master painters and sculptors, which had a monopoly on most art commissions and brought lawsuits against outsiders like Poussin who tried to break into the profession. \n\nHis early sketches gained him a place in the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the Flemish painter Ferdinand Elle, who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin. He moved next to the studio of Georges Lallemand, but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin. Moreover, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, in which several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone. Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the \"valet de chambre\" of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of Giulio Romano and especially of Raphael, whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.\n\nHe first tried to travel to Rome in 1617 or 1618, but made it only as far as Florence, where, as his biographer Bellori reported, \"as a result of some sort of accident, he returned to France.\" On his return, he began making paintings for Paris churches and convents. In 1622 made another attempt to go to Rome, but went only as far as Lyon before returning. In the summer of the same year, he received his first important commission: the Order of Jesuits requested a series of six large paintings to honor the canonization of their founder, Saint Francis Xavier. The originality and energy of these paintings (since lost) brought him a series of important commissions. \n\nGiambattista Marino, the court poet to Marie de Medici, employed him to make a series of fifteen drawings, eleven illustrating Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" and four illustrating battle scenes from Roman history. The \"Marino drawings\", now at Windsor Castle, are among the earliest identifiable works of Poussin. Marino's influence led to a commission for some decoration of Marie de Medici's residence, the Luxembourg Palace, then a commission from the first Archbishop of Paris, Jean-François de Gondi, for a painting of the death of the Virgin (since lost) for the Archibishop's family chapel at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris. Marino took him into his household, and, when he returned to Rome in 1623, invited Poussin to join him. Poussin remained in Paris to finish his earlier commissions, then arrived to Rome in the spring of 1624.\n\nPoussin was thirty when he arrived in Rome in 1624. The new Pope, Urban VIII, elected in 1623, was determined to maintain the position of Rome as the artistic capital of Europe, and artists from around the world gathered there. Poussin could visit the churches and convents to study the works of Raphael and other Renaissance painters, as well as the more recent works of Carracci, Guido Reni and Caravaggio (whose work Poussin detested, saying that Caravaggio was born to destroy painting). He studied the art of painting nudes at the Academy of Domenichino, and frequented the Academy of Saint Luke, which brought together the leading painters in Rome, and whose head in 1624 was another French painter, Simon Vouet, who offered lodging to Poussin. \n\nPoussin became acquainted with other artists in Rome and tended to befriend those with classicizing artistic leanings: the French sculptor François Duquesnoy whom he lodged with in 1626; the French artist Jacques Stella; Claude Lorraine; Domenichino; Andrea Sacchi; and joined an informal academy of artists and patrons opposed to the current Baroque style that formed around Joachim von Sandrart.\nRome also offered Poussin a flourishing art market and an introduction to an important number of art patrons. Through Marino, he was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini, the brother of the new Pope, and to Cassiano dal Pozzo, the Cardinal's secretary and a passionate scholar of ancient Rome and Greece, who both later became his important patrons. The new art collectors demanded a different format of paintings; instead of large altarpieces and decoration for palaces, they wanted smaller-size religious paintings for private devotion or picturesque landscapes, mythological and history paintings.\n\nThe early years of Poussin in Rome were difficult. His patron Marino departed Rome for Naples in May 1624, shortly after Poussin arrived, and died there in 1625. His other major sponsor, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was named a papal legate to Spain and also departed soon afterwards, taking Cassiano dal Pozzo with him. Poussin became ill with syphilis, but refused to go to the hospital, where the care was extremely poor, and he was unable to paint for months. He survived by selling the paintings he had for a few ecus. Thanks to the assistance of a chef, Jacques Dughet, whose family took him in and cared for him, he largely recovered by 1629, and in 1630 he married Anne-Marie Dughet, the daughter of Dughet. His two brothers-in-law were artists, and Gaspard Dughet later took Poussin’s surname.\n\nCardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo returned to Rome in 1626, and by their patronage Poussin received two major commissions. In 1628, with a commission from Cardinal Barberini, he completed his first masterwork, \"The Death of Germanicus\" (Minneapolis Institute of Arts). It was partly inspired by the reliefs of the Meleager sarcophagus. In February 1628 he received an even more prestigious commission to paint an altarpiece, the \"Martyrdom of St. Erasmus\", for the Erasmus Chapel of the Vatican (now in the Vatican Pinacoteca). This commission was originally given to Pietro da Cortona, but when negotiations broke down between the Vatican and Guido Reni for another painting in the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, da Cortona replaced Reni and Poussin was given Holy Sacrament commission. Poussin drew upon the original design of Pietro da Cortona but painted the work in his own style.\n\nThe \"Martyrdom of St. Erasmus\" was the only Vatican commission Poussin received, but it established his reputation as a major painter. With the departure of Vouet from Rome in 1627, Poussin became the most prominent French painter in Rome. Until 1630, he had painted rapidly (\"with the fury of a demon\", Marino recorded) and produced large numbers of pictures of variable quality. Thereafter, he renounced seeking commissions for large decorative works, which were prestigious but required competitions and came with many restrictions, and concentrated instead on painting for art patrons and collectors, for whom he could work more slowly and develop his own subjects and style. In 1632 he bought a life interest in a small house on Via Paolina for his wife and himself and entered his most productive period.\n\nApart from Cardinal Barberini, his notable patrons in this period included Cassiano dal Pozzo, for whom he painted the first series of \"Sacraments\"; the Chanoine Gian Maria Roscioli, who bought several important works, including \"The Young Pyrrhus Saved\"; Cardinal Rospigliosi, for whom he painted the second version of \"The Shepherds of Arcadia\"; Cardinal Luigi Omodei, for whom he produced the \"Triumphs of Flora\" (c. 1630–32, Louvre); Vincenzo Giustiniani, for whom he painted the \"Massacre of the Innocents\", and the jewel thief and art swindler, Fabrizio Valguarnera, who bought \"The Plague at Ashdod\" and commissioned \"The Empire of Flora\". He also received his first commissions from France; first from the Marechal de Crequi, the French envoy to Italy, then a commission from Cardinal de Richelieu for a series of \"Bacchanales\".\n\nAs the work of Poussin became well-known in Rome, he received invitations to return to Paris for important royal commissions, proposed by Sublet de Noyers, the Superintendent of buildings for Louis XIII. When Poussin declined, Noyers sent his cousins, Roland Fréart de Chambray and Paul Fréart, to Rome to persuade Poussin to come home, offering him the title of First Painter to the King, plus a substantial residence at the Tuileries Palace. Poussin yielded, and in December 1640 he was back in Paris.\n\nThe correspondence of Poussin to Cassiano dal Pozzo and his other friends in Rome show that he was appreciative of the money and honors, but he was quickly overwhelmed by a large number of commissions, particularly since he had taken the habit of working slowly and carefully. His new projects included \"The Institutions of the Eurcharist\" for the chapel of the Chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and \"The Miracle of Saint Francis-Xavier\" for the altar of the church of the novitiate of the Jesuits. In addition, he was asked to the ceilings and vaults for the Grand gallery of the Louvre, and to paint a large allegorical work for the study of Cardinal Richelieu, on the theme \"Time Defending Truth from the Attacks of Harmony and Discord\", with the figure of \"Truth\" clearly standing for Cardinal Richelieu. He was also expected to provide designs for royal tapestries and the front pieces for books from the royal printing house. He was also subjected to considerable criticism from the partisans of other French painters, including his old friend Simon Vouet. He completed a painting of the \"Last Supper\" (now in the Louvre), eight cartoons for the Gobelins tapestry manufactory, drawings for a proposed series of grisaille paintings of the \"Labors of Hercules\" for the Louvre, and a painting of the \"Triumph of Truth\" for Cardinal Richelieu (now in the Louvre). He was increasingly unhappy with the court intrigues and the overwhelming number of commissions. In the autumn of 1642, when the King and court were out of Paris in Languedoc, he found a pretext to leave Paris and to return permanently to Rome.\n\nWhen he returned to Rome in 1642, he found the art world was in transition. Pope Urban VIII died in 1644, and the new Pope, Innocent X, was less interested in art patronage, and preferred Spanish over French culture. Poussin's great patrons, the Barberinis, departed Rome for France. He still had a few important patrons in Rome, including Cassiano dal Pozzo and the future Cardinal Camillo Massimi, but began to paint more frequently for the patrons he had found in Paris. Cardinal Richelieu died in 1632, and Louis XIII died in 1643, and Poussin's Paris sponsor, Sublet de Noyer, lost his position, but Richelieu's successor, Cardinal Mazarin, began to collect Poussin's works. In October 1643, Poussin sold the furnishings of his house in the Tuileries in Paris, and settled for the rest of his life in Rome.\n\nIn 1647, André Félibien, the secretary of the French Embassy in Rome, became a friend and painting student of Poussin, and published the first book devoted entirely to his work. His growing number of French patrons included the Abbé Louis Fouquet, brother of Nicolas Fouquet, the celebrated superintendent of finances of the young Louis XIV. In 1655 Fouquet obtained for Poussin official recognition of his earlier title as First Painter of the King, along with payment for his past French commissions. To thank Fouquet, Poussin made designs for the baths Fouquet was constructing at his chateau at Vaux-le-Vicomte.\n\nAnother important French patron of Poussin in this period was Paul Fréart de Chantelou, who came to Rome in 1643 and stayed there for several months. He commissioned from Poussin some of his most important works, including the second series of the \"Seven Sacraments\", painted between 1644 and 1648, and his \"Landscape with Diogenes\". In 1649 he painted the \"Vision of St Paul\" for the comic poet Paul Scarron, and in 1651 the \"Holy Family\" for the duc de Créquy. Landscapes had been a secondary feature of his early work; in his later work nature and the landscape was frequently the central element of the painting.\nHe lived an austere and comfortable life, working slowly and apparently without assistants. The painter Charles Le Brun joined him in Rome for three years, and Poussin's work had a major influence on Le Brun's style. In 1647, his patrons Chantelou and Pointel requested portraits of Poussin. He responded by making two self-portraits, completed together in 1649. \n\nHe suffered from declining health after 1650, and was troubled by a worsening tremor in his hand, evidence of which is apparent in his late drawings. Nonetheless, in his final eight years he painted some of the most ambitious and celebrated of his works, including \"The Birth of Bacchus\", \"Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun\", \"Landcape with Hercules and Cacus\", the four paintings of \"The Seasons\" and \"Apollo in love with Daphé\". \n\nHis wife Anne-Marie died in 1664, and thereafter his own health sank rapidly. On 21 September he dictated his will, and he died in Rome on 19 November 1665 and was buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina.\n\nEach one of Poussin's paintings told a story. Though he had little formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the \"affetti\", or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions. Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.\n\nReligion was the most common subject of his paintings, as the church was the most important art patron in Rome and because there was a growing demand by wealthy patrons for devotional paintings at home. He took a large part of his themes from the Old Testament, which offered more variety and the stories were often more vague and gave him more freedom to invent. He painted different versions of the stories of Eliazer and Rebecca from the Book of Genesis and made three versions of \"Moses saved from the waters\". The New Testament provided the subject of one of his most dramatic paintings, \"The Massacre of the Innocents\", where the general slaughter was reduced to a single brutal incident. In his \"Judgement of Solomon\" (1649), the story can be read in the varied facial expressions of the participants.\n\nHis religious paintings were sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ in the sky in his painting of Saint-Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of Simon Vouet for having \"Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy\". Poussin responded that \"he could not and should not imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to look him in the face\".\n\nThe most famous of his religious works were the two series called \"The Seven Sacraments\", representing the meaning of the moral laws behind each of the principal ceremonies of the church, illustrated by incidents in the life of Christ. The first series was painted in Rome by his major early patron, Cassiano dal Pozzo, and was finished in 1642. It was viewed by his later patron, Paul Fréart de Chantelou, who asked for a copy. Instead of making copies, Poussin painted an entirely new series of paintings, which was finished by 1647. The new series had less of the freshness and originality of the first series, but was striking for its simplicity and austerity in achieving its effects; the second series illustrated his mastery of the balance of the figures, the variety of expressions, and the juxtaposition of colors.\n\nClassical Greek and Roman mythology, history and literature provided the subjects for many of his paintings, particularly during his early years in Rome. His first successful painting in Rome, \"The Death of Germanicus\", was based upon a story in the \"Annals\" of Tacitus. In his early years he devoted a series of paintings, full of color, movement and sensuality, to the Bacchanals, colorful portrayals of ceremonies devoted to the god of wine Bacchus, and celebrating the goddesses Venus and Flore. Many of his mythological paintings featured gardens and floral themes; his first Roman patrons, the Barberini family, had one of largest and most famous gardens in Rome.\n\nAnother of his early major themes was the \"Rape of the Sabine Women\", recounting how the King of Rome, Romulus, wanting wives for his soldiers, invited the members of the neighboring Sabine tribe for a festival, and then, on his signal, kidnapped all of the women. He painted two versions, one in 1634, now in the Metropolitan Museum, and the other in 1637, now in the Louvre. He also painted two versions illustrating a story of Ovid in the \"Metamorphoses\" in which Venus mourning the death of Adonis after a hunting accident, transforms his blood into the color of the anemone flower.\n\nThroughout his career, Poussin frequently achieved what the art historian Willibald Sauerländer terms a \"consonance ... between the pagan and the Christian world\". An example is \"The Four Seasons\" (1660–64), in which Christian and pagan themes are mingled: \"Spring\", traditionally personified by the Roman goddess Flora, instead features Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden; \"Summer\" is symbolized not by Ceres but by the biblical Ruth.\n\nIn his later years, his mythological paintings became more somber, and often introduced the symbols of mortality and death. The last painting he was working on before his death was \"Apollo in love with Daphne\", which he presented to his patron, the future Cardinal Massimi, in 1665. The figures on the left of the canvas, around Apollo, largely represented vitality and life, while those on the right, around Daphne, were symbols of sterility and death. He was unable to complete the painting because of the trembling of his hand, and the figures on the right are unfinished.\n\nBesides classical literature and myth, he drew often from works of the romantic and heroic literature of his own time, usually subjects decided in advance with his patrons. He painted scenes from the epic poem \"Jerusalem Delivered\" by Torquato Tasso (1544–1595), published in 1581, and one of the most popular books in Poussin's lifetime. His painting \"Renaud and Armide\" illustrated the death of the Christian knight Arnaud at the hands of the magician Armide. who, when she saw his face, saw her hatred turn to love. Another poem by Tasso with a similar theme inspired \"Tancred and Hermiene\"; a woman finds a wounded knight on the road, breaks down in tears, then finds the strength through love to heal him.\n\nAllegories of death are common in Poussin's work, One of the best-known examples is \"Et in Arcadia ego\", a subject he painted in about 1630 and again in the late 1630s. Idealized shepherds examine a tomb inscribed with the title phrase, \"Even in Arcadia I exist\", reminding that death was ever-present.\n\nA fertile source for Poussin was Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, who wrote moralistic theatrical pieces which were staged at the Palace Barberini, his early patron. One of his most famous works, \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", was inspired by another Rospigliosi piece. According to his early biographers Bellori and Felibien, the four figures in the dance represent the stages of life: Poverty leads to Work, Work to Riches, and Riches to Luxury; then, following Christian doctrine, luxury leads back to poverty, and the cycle begins again. The four women who dance represent the different stages and are distinguished by their different clothing and headdresses, ranging from plain to jeweled. In the sky over the dancing figures, the chariot of Apollo passes, accompanied by the Goddess Aurora and the Hours, a symbol of passing time.\n\nPoussin is an important figure in the development of landscape painting. In his early paintings the landscape usually forms a graceful background for a group of figures, but later the landscape played a larger and larger role and dominated the figures, illustrating stories, usually tragic, taken from the Bible, mythology, ancient history or literature. His landscapes were very carefully composed, with the vertical trees and classical columns carefully balanced by the horizontal bodies of water and flat building stones, all organized to lead the eye to the often tiny figures. The foliage in his trees and bushes is very carefully painted, often showing every leaf. His skies played a particularly important part, from the blue skies and gray clouds with bright sunlit borders (a sight often called in France \"a Poussin sky\") to illustrate scenes of tranquility and the serenity of faith, such as the \"Landscape with Saint Jean at Patmos\", painted in the late 1630s before his departure for Paris; or extremely dark, turbulent and threatening, as a setting for tragic events, as in his \"Landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe\" (1651). Many of his landscapes have enigmatic elements noticeable only with closer inspection; for example, in the center of the landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe, despite the storm in the sky, the surface of the lake is perfectly calm, reflecting the trees.\n\nBetween 1650 and 1655, Poussin also painted a series of paintings now often called \"townscapes\", where classical architecture replaces trees and mountains in the background. The painting \"The Death of Saphire\" uses this setting to illustrate two stories simultaneously; in the foreground, the wife of a wealthy merchant dies after being chastised by St. Peter for not giving more money to the poor; while in the background another man, more generous, gives alms to a beggar.\n\nThroughout his life Poussin stood apart from the popular tendency toward the decorative in French art of his time. In Poussin's works a survival of the impulses of the Renaissance is coupled with conscious reference to the art of classical antiquity as the standard of excellence. Rejecting the emotionalism of Baroque artists such as Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, he emphasized the cerebral. His goal was clarity of expression achieved by \"disegno\" or ‘nobility of design’ in preference to \"colore\" or color.\n\nDuring the late 1620s and 1630s, he experimented and formulated his own style. He studied the Antique as well as works such as Titian’s Bacchanals (\"The Bacchanal of the Andrians\", \"Bacchus and Ariadne\", and \"The Worship of Venus\") at the Casino Ludovisi and the paintings of Domenichino and Guido Reni. \n\nIn contrast to the warm and atmospheric style of his early paintings, Poussin by the 1630s developed a cooler palette, a drier touch, and a more stage-like presentation of figures dispersed within a well defined space. In \"The Triumph of David\" (c. 1633–34; Dulwich College Picture Gallery), the figures enacting the scene are arranged in rows that, like the architectural facade that serves as the background, are parallel to the picture plane. The violence of \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\" (c. 1638; Louvre) has the same abstract, choreographed quality seen in \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" (1639–40).\n\nContrary to the standard studio practice of his time, Poussin did not make detailed figure drawings as preparation for painting, and he seems not to have used assistants in the execution of his paintings. He produced few drawings as independent works, aside from the series of drawings illustrating Ovid's Metamorphoses he made early in his career. His drawings, typically in pen and ink wash, include landscapes drawn from nature to be used as references for painting, and composition studies in which he blocked in his figures and their settings. To aid him in formulating his compositions he made miniature wax figures and arranged them in a box that was open on one side like a theatre stage, to serve as models for his composition sketches. Pierre Rosenberg described Poussin as \"not a brilliant, elegant, or seductive draughtsman. Far from it. His lack of virtuosity is, however, compensated for by uncompromising rigour: there is never an irrelevant mark or a superfluous line.\"\n\nIn the years following Poussin's death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to Charles LeBrun, who had studied briefly with Poussin in Rome, and who, like Poussin, became a court painter for the King and later the head of the French Academy in Rome. Poussin's work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of Jacques Stella and Sébastien Bourdon, the Italian painter Pier Francesco Mola, and the Dutch painter Gerard de Lairesse.\nA debate emerged in the art world between the advocates of Poussin's style, who said the drawing was the most important element of a painting, and the advocates of Rubens, who placed color above the drawing.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, Poussin's style was championed by Jacques-Louis David in part because the leaders of the Revolution looked to replace the frivolity of French court art with Republican severity and civic-mindedness. The influence of Poussin was evident in paintings such as \"Brutus\" and \"Death of Marat\". Benjamin West, an American painter of the 18th century who worked in Britain, found inspiration for his canvas of \"The Death of General Wolfe\" in Poussin's \"The Death of Germanicus\".\n\nThe 19th century brought a resurgence of enthusiasm for Poussin. One of his greatest admirers was Ingres, who studied in Rome and became Director of the French Academy there. Ingres wrote, \"Only great painters of history can paint a beautiful landscape. He (Poussin) was the first, and only, to capture the nature of Italy. By the character and taste of his compositions, he proved that such nature belonged to him; so much so that when facing a beautiful site, one says, and says correctly, that it is \"Poussinesque\". \n\nAnother 19th-century admirer of Poussin was Ingres' great rival, Eugène Delacroix; he wrote in 1853: \"The life of Poussin is reflected in his works; it is in perfect harmony with the beauty and nobility of his inventions...Poussin was one of the greatest innovators found in the history of painting. He arrived in the middle of the school of mannerism, where the craft was preferred to the intellectual role of art. He broke with all of that falseness\". \n\nCézanne appreciated Poussin's version of classicism. \"Imagine how Poussin entirely redid nature, that is the classicism that I mean. What I don't accept is the classicism that limits you. I want that a visit to a master will help me find myself. Every time I leave a Poussin, I know better who I am.\" Cézanne was described in 1907 by Maurice Denis as \"the Poussin of Impressionism\". Georges Seurat was another Post-Impressionist artist who admired the formal qualities of Poussin's work. \n\nIn the 20th century, some art critics suggested that the analytic Cubist experiments of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were also founded upon Poussin's example. In 1963 Picasso based a series of paintings on Poussin's \"The Rape of the Sabine Women\". André Derain, Jean Hélion, Balthus, and Jean Hugo were other modern artists who acknowledged the influence of Poussin. Markus Lüpertz made a series of paintings in 1989–90 based on Poussin's works.\n\nThe finest collection of Poussin's paintings today is at the Louvre in Paris. Other significant collections are in the National Gallery in London; the National Gallery of Scotland; the Dulwich Picture Gallery; the Musée Condé, Chantilly; the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg; and the Museo del Prado, Madrid.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term connotes that the work is unattractive or inappropriate to its surroundings—that is, it has been thoughtlessly \"plopped\" where it lies. \"Plop art\" is a play on the term pop art. According to artnet.com, \"plop art\" was coined by architect James Wines in 1969. The derisive term was eagerly taken up both by progressives (like Wines) and by conservatives. Progressives were critical of the failure of much public art to take an environmentally-oriented approach to the relationship between public art and architecture. Conservatives liked the term because it suggested something ugly, formless, and meaningless, produced without any real skill or care. The very word \"plop\" suggested something falling wetly and heavily in the manner of excrement—extruded, as it were, from the fundament of the art world, and often at public expense.\n\n\"Right now architecture and sculpture are calling to each other, and calling for response that's intelligent, not for more ghastly lumps of sculpture ... which have no sense of scale and are just plonked down in public places.\" — Anthony Caro (1924–2013), English sculptor.\n\nMore recently, defenders of public art funding have tried to reclaim the term. The book \"Plop: Recent Projects of the Public Art Fund\", celebrates the success of the Public Art Fund in financing many publicly placed works of art over the last few decades, many of which are now beloved, though they may at first have been derided as \"ploppings\". Several currents or movements in contemporary art, such as environmental sculpture, site-specific art, and land art, counterpose themselves philosophically to \"plop art,\" as well as to traditional public monumental sculpture.\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The historic site of Počitelj is located on the left bank of the river Neretva, on the main Mostar to Metković road, and it is about 30 km to the south of Mostar.\n\nThe village is built in a natural karst amphiteatre along the Neretva river. The walled town of Počitelj evolved in the period from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Architecturally, the stone-constructed parts of the town are a fortified complex, in which two stages of evolution are evident: medieval, and Ottoman.\n\nThe first recorded reference to Počitelj dates from 1444, in charters by King Alfonso V of Aragon and in 1448 by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. In the period between 1463-1471 the town housed a Hungarian garrison and was fortified into a strategic defence stronghold. In 1471, following a brief siege, the town was conquered by the Ottomans. It lost its strategic significance. It remained within the Ottoman Empire until 1878. From 1782 to 1879 Počitelj was the seat of a\"kadiluk\" (area under the jurisdiction of a qadi, or judge) and the center of the Počitelj military district from 1713 to 1835.\n\nThe significance and the town's appearance has altered during the course of its history. As far as the development of Počitelj goes, three significant periods can be distinguished: \n\nAfter the establishment of Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, Počitelj lost its strategic importance and started deteriorating rapidly. The population declined gradually. The loss of the town's strategic role assisted in the preservation of the original urban architectural ensemble, so that the town remained in its original form to present day.\n\nThe entire historic urban site of Počitelj and surrounding area suffered extensive collateral damage during the 1992-1996 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Namely, it was heavily damaged by Croatian forces during the 1993 Bosnian War. Following the bombing, Počitelj's sixteenth-century master works of Islamic art and architecture were destroyed and a large part of the town's population was displaced.\n\nAs proposed by the University of York, United Kingdom, and the University of Sarajevo, Počitelj was in 1996 named by the World Monuments Watch as one of the world's 100 most endangered cultural heritage sites.\nIn the year 2000 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government initiated the Programme of the permanent protection of Počitelj. The programme includes the protection of cultural heritage from deterioration, restoration of damaged and destroyed buildings, encouraging the return of the refugees and displaced persons to their homes and the long-term protection and revitalization of the Počitelj's historic urban area. The Programme is on-going.\n\nAs of 2008, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) expressed concern over the proposed construction of a nearby highway, Corridor Vc. Initial plans include a 1,000-meter long, 100-meter high bridge over the Neretva river. It is feared that the construction will result in a “physical, visual and ecological degradation and devastation of this cultural and historical unity and its authentic surroundings.” While a new potential location for the bridge crossing is being investigated, non-controversial sections are under construction.\n\n\nNo up-to-date data currently exists for Počitelj and its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian war. The last demographics research was conducted in 1991 and its results were as follows:\n\nPopulation Total: 905\n\n\nPočitelj represents one of the few urban ensembles in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were preserved in their integrity to the present times. It was also developed through the several phases of the history beginning with the medieval period. Its significant strategic role from the 13th to 17th century gave its inhabitants the power to build one of the most important, and best preserved ensembles within the city walls in the region. \nThe town can be compared with some of the noted world heritage sites as the old towns of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Ohrid (Republic of Macedonia), Safranbolu (Turkey), Gjirokaster (Albania). Počitelj's layout and use of building materials put it into the group of Ottoman-Mediterranean types of small settlements.\n"}

Published in 1953 by Bowes & Bowes of Cambridge, it was Murdoch's first book and the first book about Jean-Paul Sartre's work to be published in English.\n\nIn 1950 Iris Murdoch, then a tutor of philosophy at St Anne's College, Oxford, contracted with the Cambridge publishing house Bowes & Bowes to write a short book on the French existentialists. It was to have focussed on the literary works of Sartre, Albert Camus and Simone de Beauvoir. This project was not completed, but Murdoch developed the section on Sartre into the monograph \"Sartre: Romantic Rationalist\", which appeared in November 1953 as part of Bowes & Bowes's \"Studies in modern European literature and thought\" series. It was the first book devoted to the work of Sartre to be published in English, as well as being Murdoch's first published book.\n\nThe book was first published in the United States by Yale University Press, also in 1953. It was reprinted in paperback in 1967 by Collins under the Fontana Library imprint. Spanish, Turkish and Japanese editions were published in 1956, 1964 and 1968 respectively. A revised edition with a new introduction by Murdoch was published by Chatto & Windus in London in 1987 and reprinted by Penguin Books in 1989. \n\nMurdoch had met Sartre in Brussels in 1945 while she was working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and was impressed by his existentialist philosophy and by the fact that he was also a novelist and playwright. In \"Sartre: Romantic Rationalist\" she took Sartre's novels as the starting point for examining his thought, which she characterized as influenced by \"three post-Hegelian movements: the Marxist, the existentialist, and the phenomenological\", while being \"profoundly and self-consciously contemporary\". As well as \"Nausea\" and the trilogy of novels making up \"The Roads to Freedom\", she drew on his philosophical works including \"Being and Nothingness\" and \"What Is Literature?\". Among the themes she discussed were Sartre's views of freedom, interpersonal relations, and politics. She characterized him as \"more at home as a playwright than a novelist\", arguing that his \"interest in issues rather than people, while it may sometimes be appropriate for a dramatist is not appropriate for a novelist\". \n\nIn her introduction to the new edition of \"Sartre: Romantic Rationalist\", which appeared in 1987, Murdoch considered Sartre's writing since 1953, including the \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\", \"Saint Genet\", and \"The Family Idiot\", his biography of Flaubert. \n\n\"Sartre: Romantic Rationalist\" was well received and favourably reviewed. \"Books Abroad\" called it \"an interesting book\", particularly welcome for attempting \"an objective evaluation\" of Sartre, whose followers on American university campuses seemed to see him as \"the high priest of a new cult\". Writing in \"The London Magazine\", Maurice Cranston described it as \"a model of intelligent exposition\" in which Murdoch displayed \"an uncommonly wide knowledge of continental authors as well as the sharp wits of an Oxford philosophy don\".\n\nStuart Hampshire, Murdoch's fellow Oxford philosophy don, reviewed the book for the \"New Statesman and Nation\". He saw her \"main purpose\" as being \"to explain what Sartre's existentialism is, and why it has been largely ignored here, particularly by English philosophers\", a task in which \"she almost wholly succeeds.\"\n\nBoth Sissela Bok and Jay Parini reviewed the 1987 edition along with new biographies of Sartre. Bok noted that her \"perspective, rooted, as was Sartre's, in philosophy and in literature\" was necessary in order to understand Sartre's \"role and his intellectual legacy\". Similarly, Parini concluded in \"The Hudson Review\" that Murdoch \"has \"understood\" Sartre better than any other critic thus far\".\n"}

The SPT order has the following defining properties:\n\n(a) \"distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a phase transition, if the deformation preserves the symmetry\". <br>\n(b) \"however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation\".\n\nThe above definition works for both bosonic systems and fermionic systems, which leads to the notions of bosonic SPT order and fermionic SPT order.\n\nUsing the notion of quantum entanglement, we can say that SPT states\nare short-range entangled states \"with a symmetry\" (by contrast: for long-range entanglement see topological order, which is not related to the famous EPR paradox).\nSince short-range entangled states have only trivial topological orders \nwe may also refer the SPT order as Symmetry Protected \"Trivial\" order.\n\n\nSPT states are short-range entangled while topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.\nBoth intrinsic topological order, and also SPT order, can sometimes have protected gapless boundary excitations. The difference is subtle: the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic topological order can be robust against any local perturbations, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are robust only against local perturbations \"that do not break the symmetry\". So the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic topological order are topologically protected, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are \"symmetry protected\".\n\nWe also know that an intrinsic topological order has emergent fractional charge, emergent fractional statistics, and emergent gauge theory. In contrast, a SPT order has no emergent fractional charge/fractional statistics for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent gauge theory (due to its short-range entanglement). Note that the monodromy defects discussed above are not finite-energy excitations in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but defects created by modifying the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe first example of SPT order is the Haldane phase of odd-integer-spin chain. It is a SPT phase protected by SO(3) spin rotation symmetry. \nA more well known example of SPT order is the topological insulator of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by U(1) and time reversal symmetry.\n\nOn the other hand, fractional quantum Hall states are not SPT states. They are states with (intrinsic) topological order and long-range entanglements.\n\nUsing the notion of quantum entanglement, one obtains the following general picture of gapped\nphases at zero temperature. All gapped zero-temperature phases can be divided into two classes: long-range entangled phases (\"ie\" phases with intrinsic topological order) and short-range entangled phases (\"ie\" phases with no intrinsic topological order). All short-range entangled phases can be further divided into three classes: symmetry-breaking phases, SPT phases, and their mix (symmetry breaking order and SPT order can appear together).\n\nIt is well known that symmetry-breaking orders are described by group theory. For bosonic SPT phases with pure gauge anomalous boundary, it was shown that they are classified by group cohomology theory: those (d+1)D SPT states with symmetry \"G\" are labeled by the elements in group cohomology class\nformula_1.\nFor other (d+1)D SPT states \n\nFrom the above results, many new quantum states of matter are predicted, including bosonic topological insulators (the SPT states protected U(1) and time-reversal symmetry) and bosonic topological superconductors (the SPT states protected by time-reversal symmetry), as well as many other new SPT states protected by other symmetries.\n\nA list of bosonic SPT states from group cohomology formula_4 (formula_5 = time-reversal-symmetry group)\n\nThe phases before \"+\" come from formula_1. The phases after \"+\" come from formula_2.\nJust like group theory can give us 230 crystal structures in 3+1D, group cohomology theory can give us various SPT phases in any dimensions with any on-site symmetry groups.\n\nOn the other hand, the fermionic SPT orders are described by group super-cohomology theory. So the group (super-)cohomology theory allows us to construct many\nSPT orders even for interacting systems, which include interacting topological insulator/superconductor.\n\nUsing the notions of quantum entanglement and SPT order, one can obtain\na complete classification of all 1D gapped quantum phases.\n\nFirst, it is shown that there is no (intrinsic) topological order in 1D (\"ie\" all 1D gapped states\nare short-range entangled).\nThus, if the Hamiltonians have no symmetry, all their 1D gapped quantum states belong to one phase—the phase of trivial product states.\nOn the other hand, if the Hamiltonians do have a symmetry, their 1D gapped quantum states \nare either symmetry-breaking phases, SPT phases, and their mix.\n\nSuch an understanding allows one to classify all 1D gapped quantum phases: All 1D gapped phases are classified by\nthe following three mathematical objects: formula_8 , where formula_9 is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, formula_10 the symmetry group of the ground states, and formula_11 the second group cohomology class of formula_10. (Note that formula_13 classifies the projective representations of formula_14.) If there is no symmetry breaking (\"ie\" formula_15), the 1D gapped phases are classified by the projective representations of symmetry group formula_9.\n\n"}

It presents primarily new American theatre, and provides a venue for film stars to act on a very small (74-seat) stage, as well as a smaller black box theater for experimental and new works. The theater was founded by distinguished downtown theater artists: director Jim Simpson, playwright Mac Wellman, and designer Kyle Chepulis. The Flea earned early acclaim for original productions of post-9-11 play \"The Guys\" and political works by A. R. Gurney. “Since its inception in 1996, The Flea has presented over 100 plays and numerous dance and live music performances. Under Artistic Director Jim Simpson and Producing Director Carol Ostrow, The Flea is one of New York’s leading off-off-Broadway companies.\"\n\nFounded in 1996, the award-winning Flea Theater was originally formed out of the purely artistic impulse to create “a joyful hell in a small space”. \"Soon thereafter a more formal mission was born: to present distinctive work that raises the standards of Off-Off-Broadway for artists & audiences alike…Non-institutional and resolutely noncommercial, The Flea embodies the spirit of adventure and experimentation that has defined Off-Off-Broadway since its inception. Despite its tiny capacity, more than 17,000 adventurous New Yorkers make their way to The Flea each year. Because of the huge variety, the Flea draws students, uptown residents, downtown enthusiasts—in short, as diverse a group in age, interests, and ethnicity as lives in the city itself. And while its primary service area is Lower Manhattan, in recent years their burgeoning reputation has brought audiences and patrons from throughout the tri-state area.” In March of 2015, The Flea announced that Niegel Smith would be taking over for Jim Simpson as its new artistic director.\n\nProduction highlights include \"Oh the Humanity and Other Exclamations\", by Pulitzer finalist Will Eno, starring Marisa Tomei and Brian Hutchison. This transcendent collection of five short plays extended through winter 2008. Another recent Flea hit was \"Mrs. Farnsworth\", a timely political comedy written specially for The Flea by renowned playwright A.R. Gurney. Performed by the incomparable duo of Sigourney Weaver and John Lithgow, Mrs. Farnsworth won rave reviews and returned to The Flea for a special encore in the fall. For two years in a row, The New York Times named a Flea production as one of the best Off-Broadway shows of the season—\"Mrs. Farnsworth\" in 2004 and \"O Jerusalem\" in 2003. Recent productions include \"The Great Recession\", six plays commissioned by The Flea exploring the impact of the current economic crisis on the younger generation by Thomas Bradshaw, Sheila Callaghan, Erin Courtney, Will Eno, Itamar Moses and Adam Rapp, Jonathan Reynold’s \"Girls in Trouble\" and Bathsheba Doran’s \"Parents’ Evening\".\n\nThe Flea produces several original major productions each year, along with new work by the most iconoclastic, imaginative, and talented artists. Each year The Flea presents and produces dozens of new works in an environment that is professional, welcoming, and intimate. Flea artists have been honored with two OBIE Awards, an Otto Award and, in May 2004, The Flea was given a Drama Desk Award for Distinguished Achievement commending its dedication to adventurous theater. With the continued participation of its founders and an ever-growing community of diverse and creative talents, The Flea strives to represent the wide range of what is possible Off-Off-Broadway.\n\nIn 2010, The Flea was awarded the American Theatre Wing's National Theatre Company Grant.\n\nThe Bats are the resident acting company of The Flea Theater. Each year over a thousand actors audition for a place in this unique company. The Bats perform in extended runs of challenging classic and new plays. Not a school, but a repertory company, the Bats also work to support all the visiting performing artists at The Flea Theater.\n\nPast Bat productions include: \"Benten Kozo\", an Obie award winning production that played for over 6 months, \"The Great Recession\" by Thomas Bradshaw, \"These Seven Sicknesses\" by Sean Graney,\nand \"Future Anxiety\" by Laurel Haines.\n\n“The performances by the Bats, the Flea’s young resident company, are all well thought out and fresh. The Bats are most definitely a talented group of young artists.” – NYtheatre.com\n\nModeled after The Flea Theater’s successful resident company of actors, The Bats (now in its 16th season), this intensive residency program allow a small team of young directors to work, train and direct in support of The Flea’s season under the supervision of Artistic Director Jim Simpson and The Flea Theater staff. Applicants must be ready to roll up their sleeves and get involved with all aspects of theater production- dilettantes need not apply.\n\nCreated by Dominic Spillane and Stephen Stout #serials@theflea is a raucous late night play competition featuring The Bats and some of NYC’s hottest young playwrights and directors. This event, which runs Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 11pm, includes 1 FREE beer with the purchase of a ticket. All tickets are only $12.

It was finished in 1526, and is the last of his large works. It depicts the four apostles larger-than-life-size. The Bavarian Elector Maximilian I obtained \"The Four Apostles\" in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers. Since then, the painting has been in Munich and, despite all the efforts of Nuremberg since 1806, it has not been returned.\n\nWhen Dürer moved back to Nuremberg he produced many famous paintings there, including several self-portraits. He gave \"The Four Apostles\" to the town council. Saints John and Peter appear in the left panel; the figures in the right panel are Saints Mark and Paul. Mark and Paul both hold Bibles, and John and Peter are shown reading from the opening page of John's own Gospel. At the bottom of each panel, quotations from the Bible are inscribed.\n\nThe apostles are recognizable by their symbols:\n\nThey are also associated with the four temperaments.\n\n\"The Four Apostles\" was created during the Reformation, begun in 1517 and having the largest initial impact on Germany. As it was a Protestant belief that icons were contradictory to the Word of God, which was held in the utmost supremacy over Protestant ideas, the Protestant church was not a patron of any sacred art. Therefore, any Protestant artist, like Dürer became, had to commission their own works. Many aspects of the image depicted prove significant in light of the Reformation itself.\n\n"}
{"id": "15432148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15432148", "title": "The Group (novel)", "text": "The Group (novel)\n\nThe Group is the best-known novel of American writer Mary McCarthy. It made \"New York Times\" Best Seller list in 1963 and remained there for almost two years.\n\nIn 1933, eight young female friends graduate from Vassar College. The book describes these women's lives post-graduation, beginning with the marriage of one of the friends, Kay Strong, and ending with her funeral in 1940. Each character struggles with different issues, including sexism in the work place, child-rearing, financial difficulties, family crises, and sexual relationships. Nearly all the women's issues involve the men in their lives: fathers, employers, lovers, or husbands. As highly educated women from affluent backgrounds, they must strive for autonomy and independence in a time when a woman's role is still largely restricted to marriage and childbirth. The plot is influenced by the political and economic atmosphere of the time. Over the course of the book, the reader learns about the women's views on contraception, love, sex, socialism, and psychoanalysis.\n\nKay Strong: Marries Harald Petersen, who is involved in theater management and stage directing. Kay calls him a \"Yale man\", even though he did only graduate work there; this mildly offends the analytical Lakey. Harald writes plays that are not produced and is frequently unemployed. Kay has \"a ruthless hatred of poor people\", and is frustrated by their financial situation. She supports them by working at Macy's and cares greatly about her material surroundings. Her husband has multiple extramarital affairs. Their fights and his drinking escalate; finally he hits her until she threatens him with a bread knife. The next morning, he commits her to a psychiatric hospital, where Polly is working as a nurse. Kay is later released from the hospital; she divorces Harald. Her death at the end of the book is mysterious; no one knows whether she fell from the window on the twentieth floor of the Vassar Club, while airplane spotting, or whether she jumped. Her friends reunite at the end of the novel at her funeral, where they shun Harald.\n\nMary Prothero, \"Pokey\": The wealthiest of the Group. Described as a \"fat, cheerful New York society girl\", \"very rich and lazy\". Pokey says she made it through Vassar only with the help of Priss, a Phi Beta Kappa. Pokey's father gives her a plane so she is able to commute to Cornell Agricultural School; her mother, upon learning that Harald was arrested at a labor demonstration, is devastated that a \"jailbird\" once dined at the Prothero home. Pokey eventually marries. Her family has an earnest, eccentric, and observant butler named Hatton, who comes to Kay's funeral.\n\nDottie Renfrew: From a Boston family, she aims to be a welfare worker after Vassar. She goes home from Kay's wedding with Dick Brown, a poor artist, and he proceeds to take her virginity. He treats her abruptly and warns her not to fall in love with him. He tells her things can be a lot better between them (sexually) if she would go see a \"lady doctor\" (so that he wouldn't have to use withdrawal, which he did use in this instance, or condoms). He explains that he prefers diaphragms for upper-class women and condoms for lower-class women. She is fitted for a diaphragm by a woman doctor who is willing to fit unmarried as well as married women. Dick has not called her or returned her calls. She returns to Dick's apartment, but he is gone. She waits for him for hours in Washington Square Park; eventually she hides the birth control kit under a bench and goes back to Boston. Dottie eventually marries Brook Latham from Arizona. Before the wedding, she admits to her perceptive mother that she has slept with Dick and is still in love with him. Her mother suggests she postpone the wedding and see Dick to explore her feelings, but Dottie refuses and marries Brook on schedule.\n\nElinor Eastlake, \"Lakey”: From Lake Forest, Illinois. After Pokey, she is the wealthiest of the group; she is cool and aristocratic, a \"dark beauty\", with pale skin, black hair, and large green eyes. She spends most of the book in Europe, where she goes to study art history and get a doctorate. At the end of the book, she returns to America, having fled the war in Europe. The Group assembles at the pier to greet her arrival, where they find Lakey accompanied by the Baroness, who, it transpires, is her lesbian lover. The group notes that the Baroness is not terribly bright; they are conflicted over Lakey's sexual orientation.\n\nPolly Andrews: Her family suffers financial losses due to the Depression. She is pretty, with \"almost flaxen hair\", \"milk-white skin” and \"big blue eyes\". She lives in a building where most of her neighbors are socialists, and she works as a technician in a local hospital. She has an affair with Gus LeRoy, a married publisher, who is going through psychoanalysis at the request of his wife. Polly does not understand why he needs analysis, and after reading Freud, she decides that she herself needs analysis. Gus eventually leaves Polly and goes back to his wife. Polly's father, who has just gotten divorced from Polly's mother and suffers from bipolar disorder, comes to live with Polly. Her father converts to Trotskyism. In the manic phase of his disorder, he overspends their budget, forcing Polly to sell her blood at the hospital. Polly marries Dr. Jim Ridgeley, a psychiatrist, who offers her financial and moral support.\n\nPriss Hartshorn: An idealistic believer in the FDR program, she marries Dr. Sloan Crockett, a pediatrician. She has a job with the National Recovery Administration. She gives birth to Stephen, whom she has difficulty breast-feeding and potty-training. Under the hospital regimen, she sleeps apart from her son, whom she hears crying most of the nights. Her husband wishes her to feed Stephen her breast milk rather than formula, a somewhat radical notion at the time. Priss, pressured at the hospital to allow them to bottle feed the baby, also feels pressured by her husband, thinking, \"Sloan…was enamored of his own theories, which he wanted to enforce, like Prohibition, regardless of the human factor\".\n\nHelena Davison: \"A short, sandy haired girl with an appealing snub nose\", Helena was \"regarded as the droll member of the group\", because of her sense of humor. Her mother has her \"tutored in every conceivable subject\", including athletics, musical instruments, outdoor activities and crafts. Despite her Vassar education, she gets a job as a teacher at an experimental school in Cleveland, Ohio, teaching \"finger-painting\". She catches Kay's husband kissing another woman, Norine, a Vassar girl who was involved in left politics and not in The Group. She decides not to tell Kay, but agrees to go to Norine's house to talk. Norine's husband is impotent and Norine has had several affairs. Norine asks Helena how she should fix her life, and Helena makes several suggestions, including scrubbing the floor, painting the sitting room a different color, and buying \"some real food\". By the end of the novel, Helena moves to New York to pursue an art career. She is the only character who remains single.\n\nLibby MacAusland: A \"tall, pretty blonde\", who majored in English and is determined to break into the New York publishing industry. Gus LeRoy, the publisher, hires her to read book manuscripts. For five dollars apiece, she reads the manuscripts and writes a summary and opinion. Libby can read Italian, so Gus gives her an Italian manuscript to summarize. However, the book is mostly in a dialect, which she can't understand and she writes an inaccurate report. Gus fires her, telling her that \"Publishing's a man's business…. Marry a publisher, Miss MacAusland, and be his hostess.\" He later gets her a job as a literary agent's assistant and then an agent herself, becoming wealthy in the process and living well. A Norwegian baron and ski jumper, Nils Aslund, tries to seduce her by reading Marlowe's \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\". Libby tries to fend him off by quoting Sir Walter Raleigh's \"The Shepherdess Replies\". Nils replies by ripping her clothes off and attempting to rape her; he desists when she tells him she is a virgin.\n\nNorine Schmittlapp: She is Vassar '33, but not a member of The Group. Talking to Helena, she says, \"You people were the aesthetes. We were the politicals.\" Norine is interested in psychoanalysis, socialism, and anthropology. She has a dog named Nietzsche. While married to Putnam Blake, she has an affair with Harald, Kay's husband. Norine's husband, Put, suffers from impotency; according to Norine, he is only aroused by \"fallen women\". Norine helps Harald put Kay in the psychiatric ward by convincing Kay that she needs a rest. She spreads the rumor that Kay was mentally disturbed, saying to Priss, \"A lot of basic things were the matter. Sex. Competitiveness with men. An underlying Lesbian drive that was too firmly repressed. Thwarted social strivings.\" Norine later divorces Put, and marries Freddy Rogers, a wealthy banker who has suffered from anti-Jewish discrimination. She has a son, Ichabod. Priss is horrified by her choice of name and her careless manner of raising Ichabod. Norine tells Priss that her husband expects her to be a dutiful housewife, but Norine says \"Our Vassar education made it tough for me to accept my womanly role\". Norine believes that because of her education, she is \"crippled for life\".\n\nIn some aspects the novel is autobiographical, in a satirical tone. Mary McCarthy studied literature at Vassar College and graduated in 1933, which is the class year of her group of eight characters. McCarthy's classmates from Vassar accused her of basing \"The Group\" characters on them and their experiences. In addition, her first husband, Harald Johnsrud, shares the first name of the husband of the character Kay; the unusual (Nordic) spelling of the name is discussed several times in the novel. In parts of the book where McCarthy discusses sex, such as when Dottie loses her virginity, the author claims to come from her memories with past lovers, as an observer. McCarthy was also a supporter of Leon Trotsky, a political position shared by another of the characters in the novel, Polly Andrews.\n\nMary McCarthy adopted the title of \"lady-writer\" mostly given by male critics. Although her works are supposedly written for women, they are commended by feminists. However, McCarthy denies being a feminist or writing for the \"second-wave of feminism\" as she believes in equality and freedom of rights, but does not view it as a gendered issue.\n\nThe novel topped the \"New York Times\" best-seller for almost two years. It was banned in Australia, Italy, and Ireland for being offensive to public morals. The novel was reviewed critically and intensely for its vivid detail, length, and number of characters. At the time of its release, men questioned McCarthy's ability to be a professional writer. Notably, Norman Mailer for The New York Review of Books wrote that, \"her book fails as a novel by being good but not nearly good enough...she is simply not a good enough woman to write a major novel.\" \n\nWhen an editor suggested to Candace Bushnell that she write \"the modern-day version of \"The Group\", she wrote \"Sex and the City\", a collection of revealing essays that became the popular TV series and film. As Bushnell summarizes: \"The Group\" reminds us that not much has really changed\".\n\nIn 1966 United Artists released a film adaptation of McCarthy's novel directed by Sidney Lumet. The main characters were played by Candice Bergen (Lakey), Joan Hackett (Dottie), Elizabeth Hartman (Priss), Shirley Knight (Polly), Joanna Pettet (Kay), Mary-Robin Redd (Pokey), Jessica Walter (Libby), Kathleen Widdoes (Helena), Larry Hagman (Harald), James Broderick (Jim), Richard Mulligan (Dick), Carrie Nye (Norine), and Hal Holbrook (Gus). The film was exhibited in competition in the 1966 Berlinale.\n\nIn 2001, \"The Group\" was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. It was adapted by Moya O'Shea, produced/Directed by Tracey Neale, and starred Gayle Hunnicutt, Rebecca Front, Teresa Gallagher, Joanna Weir, Tara Ward, Laurel Lefkow, Lorelei King, Moya O'Shea, Mark Caven, Henry Goodman, and William Hope.\n\nThe book appears in episode ten, season three of the television series \"Mad Men\". It is also referred to in the pilot episode of the series \"American Dreams\", during a scene in which one member of a woman's book group suggests \"The Group\" as a title that might make her contemporaries re-evaluate their lives as housewives. The suggestion is quickly dismissed by the group's leader, (\"Oh! That sounds so…depressing\"), who rules in favor of Book of the Month Club's \"The Shoes of the Fisherman\". In the following episode of \"American Dreams\", one of the main characters, Helen Pryor, reads the book and she says that \"her whole world is falling apart\" because of it. \n\nIt is also mentioned in the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" short \"The Home Economics Story\" (where Joel Robinson referring to the group of college students from said short as \"The Group\") as well as the episode featuring the film \"The Sinister Urge\" (where Mike Nelson refers to a group of young women as \"Mary McCarthy's 'The Group'\"). \n\nIn the film \"The Sterile Cuckoo\", the character of Pookie Adams (Liza Minnelli) can be seen clutching a copy of \"The Group\" when she departs the bus after her first encounter with love interest Jerry Payne. Mentioned in \"A Right to Die\" by Rex Stout: Nero Wolfe \"had read two chapters and ditched it.\"\n\nIn Season 1, episode 9 of \"Gilmore Girls\", Rory is seen reading a copy of the book as she stands on line to buy tickets to a dance.\n"}
{"id": "29914209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29914209", "title": "The Magdalen Reading", "text": "The Magdalen Reading\n\nThe Magdalen Reading is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century oil-on-panel altarpiece by the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The panel, originally oak, was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the National Gallery, London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period. She is identifiable as the Magdalen from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the Magdalen was conflated with both Mary of Bethany who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil and the unnamed \"sinner\" of . Iconography of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.\n\nThe background of the painting had been overpainted with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, which shows the head of Saint Joseph, while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be Saint Catherine of Alexandria, is thought to be from the same larger work. The original altarpiece was a \"sacra conversazione\", known only through a drawing, \"Virgin and Child with Saints\", in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum, which followed a partial copy of the painting that probably dated from the late 16th century. The drawing shows that \"The Magdalen\" occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of \"The Magdalen\", which measures .\n\nAlthough internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. \"The Magdalen Reading\" can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the National Gallery, London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian Lorne Campbell as \"one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works.\"\n\nMary Magdalene as depicted in early Renaissance painting is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on Mary of Bethany, who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and \"listened to His Word\", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister Martha who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve. Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a \"chemise\" of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript \"looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible\" and is \"clearly a devotional text\". It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.\n\nVan der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings. She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden sideboard. By her feet is her usual attribute of an alabaster jar; in the Gospels she brought spices to the tomb of Jesus. The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an archer atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.\nVan der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master Robert Campin or his workshop. It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of Saint Barbara in Campin's \"Werl Altarpiece\", and also the Virgin in an \"Annunciation\" attributed to Campin in Brussels. Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white. Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue sash, while the gold brocade of her underskirt is adorned by a jewelled hem. Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a \"fallen woman\" is hinted at by the nap in the fur lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil. Darwent wrote, \"Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't.\" In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as Memling and Matsys often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she \"is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in \"The Magdalen Reading\" by Rogier van der Weyden\".\n\nThe level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as \"far exceed[ing]\" van Eyck. Her lips are painted with a shades of vermilion, white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of impasto, grid and dots of varying colour and size.\n\nMany of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary. The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal rosary beads have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with Jan van Eyck.\n\nLorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as \"small miracles of painting\", and says that \"the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding\". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position. Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and \"much too narrow and papery in effect\". A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases. The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small pitcher, possibly a reliquary. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.\n\n\"Virgin and Child with Saints\", a drawing in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum, is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden, who possibly may have been the Master of the Coburger Rundblätter. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint John the Baptist; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as John the Evangelist. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes. This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.\n\nAt an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces, possibly due to damage, although \"The Magdalen\" fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail \"it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings\". From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1 m high by 1.5 m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period. The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of Léo Lardus in Suresnes, France.\n\nThe London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist. Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear rosary beads in one hand and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon shows the head of a figure believed to be the Saint Joseph; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.\n\nThere is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at Suresnes. The figure may represent Saint Catherine of Alexandria, and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling. In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel. Some art historians, including Martin Davies and John Ward, have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is chamfered. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3 cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures , the Saint Joseph .\n\nLorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is \"obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the \"Magdalen\"\", it \"seems likely\" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that \"about half way up the right edge of this fragment [\"Catherine\"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke ... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist\". The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes.\n\nThe Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward—which combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints—is widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the \"verso\" shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a Brussels workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.\n\nVan der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany, identified by the time of Pope Gregory I as the repentant prostitute of . She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a male gaze), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer. Writing in \"The Crying Face\", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a \"pictorial formula for crying\".\n\nBy the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes. Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.\n\nThe Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance. Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer. According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in Sainte-Baume and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance. By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and \"borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth\".\n\nThe Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. She signified the \"sacrament of anointing (Chrism and Unction)\" by pouring precious spikenard on Christ's feet at his tomb.\n\nThe altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives \"before 1438\". Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by Robert Campin. He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's \"Werl Altarpiece\".\n\nBecause van der Weyden, like most of the early Netherlandish painters, was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin \"Miraflores Altarpiece\" continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved, or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain.\n\n\"The Magdalen Reading\" can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in Haarlem, when the work was already cut down. The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem. After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin in Paris, whose \"small but choice\" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the National Gallery, London by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1860; an acquisition that also included two Robert Campin portraits and panels by Simon Marmion (1425–1489). This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery. Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955. In general the \"painted surface is in very good condition\", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.\n\n\"The Magdalen Reading\" was transferred from its original oak to a mahogany panel (West Indian swietenia) by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was \"Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860\", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery. Artificial ultramarine-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830. The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels. The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin. It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish National Museum of Fine Arts in 1918.\n\n"}
{"id": "28278995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28278995", "title": "The Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture", "text": "The Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture\n\nThe Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture (SPWC) was a Toronto arts organization in existence from 1986 to 1991 that explored environmental and ecological issues from an artistic perspective in a \"quirky and innovative\" way. The SPWC was best known for three programs: a literary magazine, The Journal of Wild Culture; artist-guided walks, \"landscape readings\"; and a series of cabarets, The Café of Wild Culture.\n\nThe organization was a unique hybrid. The oxymoron \"wild culture\" tweaked the interest of contrasting types: artists, scientists and activists, and the efforts made by the organization to develop creative projects and discourse around the term were well received. It was concurrently accepted as an arts organization by artists and an environmental organization by environmentalists.\n\nThe organisation was resurrected in 2011 and is now producing an online magazine based in London and Toronto.\n\nThe style of the organization was determined by how participating artists expressed themselves around the undefined idea of \"wild culture\" (also see \"wildculture\"). While calling for new articulations of wild culture through its projects, at its height the society filled the cultural vacuum in Toronto with an eclectic kind of \"thinking man's\" fun and provided a forum for experimentation amongst performance artists. The broader public was encouraged by the SPWC to engage with questions about nature and art, while frequently congregating in the outdoors. This audience was also attracted to the organization's ability to 'soft pedal doom and gloom while partying for the planet\".\n\nDuring a landscape reading on the aboriginal history of downtown Toronto, poet M. T. Kelly offered a view of how the SPWC sought to affect its audience: \"There is a bridge between history and landscape. To get people to change their view of the environment, you can't just argue in economic terms. It's an emotional thing. People act politically when they get emotionally involved\".\n\nThe notion of \"wild culture\" grew out of multidisciplinary artist Whitney Smith's experience of \"a spiritual updraft in the art spheres\" while foraging wild foods in the Ontario forest that he sold to local chefs. From 1982 to 1985 a series of three performances, \"Fern Policy\", explored the possibilities of artistic growth in the nature-culture ecotone. In May 1985 Smith made the first public announcement on the formation of the society at a Toronto art event, \"L'Affaire 'Pataphysique\", that presented examples of 'pataphysics by local artists parodying theory and methods of modern science. Following this event Smith began recruiting artists to help develop \"The Journal of Wild Culture\".\n\nThough there were attempts by the organization to define \"wild culture\", there was never an accepted definition. Smith preferred his colleagues and audiences to find wild culture's meaning through the titles of the projects in which it appeared, where the social context was at play; that is, that there existed a serious-sounding and possibly genuine academic journal published by a preserving society with a long name, all devoted to a subject no one knew anything about. Negotiating the serious and the non-serious in a way that made sense and entertained became part of the artists' work.\n\nBefore there was Smith's recent definition of wild culture (\"the articulated ecotone between what humans do and what they can't control in nature\"), no single explanation existed around which the S.P.W.C artists\" work was done. Some said that it was the vagueness of the idea, the inability to pin it down, that made it so attractive. In the absence of concrete description, Smith offered a metaphor, which he has recently modified: On the surface of a transparent painting is the human geographic reality that is part of our everyday life, and in the background are elements of nature, seen and unseen, that are very much alive but that people aren\"t always aware of, whether out of convenience, ignorance, apathy, or any state of unconsciousness or self-centeredness that contributes to the disconnection from our primal history and our present psychic hold on the home terrain. Wild culture is the two planes, foreground and background, seen together.\n\nThe literary organ of the SPWC, its subtitle, ecology, and imagination, spoke to the notion of \"The Journal of Wild Culture\" being a platform for artists to express themselves through the lens, or mirror, of the natural world. Smith said that \"one of the things wild culture \"is\", is a tolerance for ambiguity and an acceptance that things cannot be defined\". The \"quirky and innovative\" magazine carried on its discourse in a way that influenced the way more serious themes could be delivered with a sense of play and timeliness.\n\nBorn out of the wild foods foraging of founder Whitney Smith, the magazine was conceived in 1986-1987 by an editorial team that included Smith and architect Peter Ferguson, public relations consultant Kim Obrist and filmmaker and publisher Christopher Lowry. Smith attributed his inspiration for the formation of the society to the National Geographic Society (which published its own journal) and \"FILE\" magazine, produced by the conceptual and media-based art collective, General Idea, and to the \"Utne Reader\"'s use of other published materials. The SPWC was in production in Toronto from 1986 to 1991. Graphic designer Bernard Stockl became the art director and quickly established the look of the magazine, including the characteristic contents page. Smith and Lowry assembled a photocopied \"Journal of Wild Culture\" Preview Issue that was circulated in the arts community, and a donation of $5000 \"from an anonymous angel\" followed, just enough to pay for the printing of the first issue.\n\nThe premier issue was launched on July 27, 1987 at the Wild Culture Hoedown on Toronto Island. It was described by Smith at the time as \"a cross between a literary journal and an arty comic book with ecology as its theme\". Future Wild Culture events followed the format and spirit of the Hoedown by offering down-home high-end cuisine using wild foods and made on site by Chris Klugman, a well-known local chef, and featuring artists whose personae related to nature themes: the Marquis de Sod and Mr. Potatohead were the guests of honour at the launch. Poet Christopher Dewdney, an early contributor to the magazine, said that \"half of the experience at \"The Journal of Wild Culture\" is the parties.) Volume I, Number 1 was sold for $3.95 and 3000 copies were widely distributed in Canada by Disticor, and the issue sold out; later distribution of increased numbers went into the U.S. It developed a small but devoted fan base, particularly in British Columbia. In 1990 its southwestern U.S. distributor reported that the magazine had \"a cult following in Texas\".\n\nSmith said that Stockl, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, was a significant contributor to JWC. \"Bernie's deep sense of graphic taste and design intelligence struck the right tone with the first issue: serious like an academic journal but also accessible and visually engaging. In order for the quirkiness to work we needed the credible and elegant look that his gave us\". Stockl said he modeled the JWC design after \"Harper's\" and \"Arts and Architecture\": \"The trick was to create certain effects with what was available to us. Trying to cheat our way through it without it looking like that\". The Bernard Franklin Stockl Memorial Scholarship is offered annually at the Alberta College of Design for \"creative and innovative exploration in the use of typography for the purpose of communication\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, when advertisers were slow to embrace the few existing green magazines, and particularly one which the \"Utne Reader\" editor, Eric Utne, called \"indescribable\", low ad sales made it difficult to pay the bills and meet that quarterly schedule; only seven issues were published. Two Wild Culture auctions and funding from the federal and provincials arts councils helped take up the slack, but with a low subscription base and advertising revenue, a sudden drop in grant revenue, fund-raising and marketing fatigue, Smith's reluctance to step into the role of \"a career publisher\", the magazine decided to take a sabbatical. More recently Smith commented on his own burn-out keeping the magazine and the SPWC going, the dilemma of the artist-publisher, and the difficulty of keeping cultural magazines afloat in factors relating to demise of JWC. In early 1991, on CBC radio's \"Arts Report\", it was announced that the magazine was suspending publication. The plan was to pursue a more economically feasible course by following the format of \"Granta\" magazine, offering it as a trade paperback available in bookstores. A pilot issue of selections from past JWC issues was put out by Somerville House in 1992, \"Wild Culture\", edited by Smith and Lowry, but sales were not encouraging; one explanation for this was that the book did not offer new material.\n\nAn attempt by Smith and some new colleagues in 2002 to resurrect the \"Journal of Wild Culture\" online never got off the ground. Smith said that wild culture was \"a notion with a mind of its own\" and that \"the ingredients for a re-launch in 2002 just weren't there\".\n\nLandscape Readings were public walking tours led by artists of outdoor environments that held an intellectual or personal interest for the artist. Landscape Readings were a hybrid that combined the attraction of authors reading their own works with a bracing picnic outing in a setting which combines the context for a lecture on ecology, geology, history or biography.\n\nThe readings were a project initially conceived by Smith to provide a venue for writer and poet Christopher Dewdney to share his extensive knowledge of palaeozoic geology, among other things, and his sense of humour. In July 1987 he gave the first landscape reading of Toronto's High Park Carolinian forest, which was documented in the forthcoming issue of \"The Journal of Wild Culture\".\n\nOther artist guides included Gordon Rayner, Hank Hedges, M. T. Kelly, June Callwood, Larry Zolf, Joyce Weiland, and architect Donald Schmitt. The Readings were created to \"give [SPWC participating] artists a new venue\".\n\nThe Café of Wild Culture was conceived in collaboration with bookseller and film programmer Marc Glassman, who recognized that the sense of humour that was so much a part of the 60s and 70s was missing in the 80s. The Café was performed first in Toronto at The Rivoli, and later in New York at the Village Gate and at Goddard College in Vermont. Its legitimate non-theatre style played off the vaudeville and variety revue made up of several short unrelated acts (in the Café's case, no longer than 7 minutes) that caught the wild culture spirit of thoughtful irreverence. Acts ranged from tendentious 'pataphysical lectures, authentic scientific explanations, obtuse dance works, gentlemen's shirt-ironing contests, and wild food cooking demonstrations, in which small servings were provided for the audience, and a game called StorySlide where artists improvised a performed text based on a random photographic slide show.\n\nSmith met his match when he began a project called the Great Festival of the Lakes, which was to encourage the presentation of community arts festivals in Great Lakes cities. \"I was very concerned about water quality issues at the time, and thought that the SPWC needed an activist project to sponsor. I was wrong. Organizing anything around the Great Lakes is like trying to organize Europe. I learned a lot about underestimating scale on that one, and spreading myself too thin\". The project was abandoned after a couple of years.\n\nIn 1990, the SPWC worked with an organization started by Michael Stadtlander and Jamie Kennedy, Knives and Forks, on Spring Feast, which became a precursor of future events promoting local chefs and wild and organic foods.\n\nFrom September 2011 Smith's work on the SPWC focused on the online publishing platform, The Journal of Wild Culture. The project was beta-launched in December 2012 in London as www.wildculture.com by an editorial and design team including Smith, Joe Hedges of Branding by Garden, Tom Jeffreys, Sarah Lester, Rosie Jackson and Liam Desroy, continued with Smith, Jeffreys and designer Hedges from February to October 2013, at which time Smith took over sole editorial responsibilities, in collaboration, until 2016, with board members Lisa Wilson and Richard Stursberg; Stursberg continues to participate in an advisory role. The publication has no advertising, sends out a weekly newsletter, is supported by donations and the work of a growing community of international contributors. Current editors and contributing editors under publisher/editor Smith include Chellis Glendinning, Herbert Wright, Chris Lowry, Henry Giroux and illustrator Brad Harley.\n\n"}
{"id": "35559096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35559096", "title": "Toklu Dede Mosque", "text": "Toklu Dede Mosque\n\nToklu Dede Mosque (, where \"mescit\" is the Turkish word for a small mosque), was an Ottoman mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. The building was originally a Byzantine Eastern Orthodox church of unknown dedication. It was almost completely destroyed in 1929.\n\nThe edifice lay in Istanbul, in the district of Fatih, in the neighborhood () of Ayvansaray. The only remaining part of the building – the south wall – is enclosed in a modern house at \"Toklu Ibrahim Dede Sokak\", a few meters inside the walled city, a short distance from the shore of the Golden Horn, at the junction between the Blachernae wall and the largely pulled down Golden Horn walls.\n\nThe origin of this building, which was erected at the northern foot of the sixth hill of Constantinople in the neighborhood of \"ta Karianou\", part of the Blachernae quarter, is obscure. The small shrine lay on the inner side of the Wall of Heraclius, less than 100 m west of the now demolished Gate of Küçük Ayvansaray (in Greek the Koiliomene Gate) of the Golden Horn Walls, and east of the Gate of Blachernae. The church, – in common with the nearby Atik Mustafa Pasha Mosque, also originally a Byzantine church – has been identified with Saint Thekla of the Palace of Blachernae (Greek: , \"Hagia Thekla tou Palatiou tōn Vlakhernōn\"). However, the building lay too far from the Blachernae Palace, so that this identification, based only on the similarity of the name, should be rejected. Stylistically the church belongs to the Komnenian era (middle/second half of the 11th century). At the beginning of the 14th century – in the Palaiologan era – the church underwent minor architectonic changes and its fresco decoration was renewed.\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, between the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century the church was converted into a small mosque (Mescid) by Toklu Ibrahim Dede, a former soldier of Mehmed the Conqueror, who was the custodian of the nearby \"türbe\" of Ebû Șeybet ül Hudrî, like the more famous Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (the standard bearer of Muhammad), a companion of the Prophet. Both died during the first Arab siege of Constantinople and were buried outside the wall of Heraclius. The \"türbe\" of Ebû Șeybet ül Hudrî is now placed in the citadel between the Wall of Heraclius and that of Leo the Armenian.\n\nIn 1929 the owner of the building demolished it almost completely, leaving in place only the south wall and the apse. With the demolition the paintings, whose existence was known since 1890, came again to light. The first surveying of the remains occurred in 1954. As of 2012, only the surviving south wall, enclosed in a new building, and the name of the road where it once lay remember the small edifice.\n\nThe building had a rectangular plan with external sides of 14.2 m and 6.7 m. A square single nave was surmounted by a barrel vault and covered at its center by a dome with a diameter of about 4 m. This was supported by arches carried by angular piers. The nave was preceded by an esonarthex and ended towards East with a bema and a polygonal apse adorned internally and externally with shallow niches. The plan of the building is similar on a reduced size to that of the Chora Church. The edifice's brickwork consisted of courses of rows of white stones alternating with rows of red bricks. The external wall were divided with half pillars and with lesenes surmounted by arches. The church was decorated with 14th-century frescoes, among them images of the Saints Eleuterus, Abercius, Polykarpos, Spyridon, Procopius and Nicetas, some of them framed in medallions. The barrel vault above the altar was decorated with a fresco representing the Nativity of Jesus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2820059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2820059", "title": "Urban fiction", "text": "Urban fiction\n\nUrban fiction, also known as street lit or street fiction is a literary genre set in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the socio-economic realities and culture of its characters as the urban setting. The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside of city living. Profanity, sex, and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material. Most authors of this genre draw upon their past experiences to depict their storylines.\n\nContemporary urban fiction was (and largely still is) a genre written by African Americans. In his famous essay \"The Souls of Black Folk\", W. E. B. Du Bois discussed how a veil separated the African American community from the outside world. By extension, fiction written by people outside the African American culture could not (at least with any degree of verisimilitude) depict the people, settings, and events experienced by people in that culture. Try as some might, those who grew up outside the veil (i.e., outside the urban culture) may find it difficult to write fiction grounded in inner-city and African American life.\n\nCity novels of yesteryear that depict the low-income survivalist realities of city living can also be considered urban fiction or street lit. In her book, \"The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature\" (2011), Vanessa Irvin Morris points out that titles considered canonical or \"classic\" today, could be considered the urban fiction or \"street lit\" of its day.\n\nTitles that depict historical inner-city realities include Stephen Crane's \"\" (1893), Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\" (1838), Paul Laurence Dunbar's \"The Sport of the Gods\" (1902) and Langston Hughes' The Ballad Of The Landlord (1940). In this vein, urban fiction is not just an African American or Latino phenomenon, but rather, the genre exists along a historical continuum that includes stories from diverse cultural and ethnic experiences.\n\nIn the 1970s, during the culmination of the Black Power movement, a jailed Black man named Robert Beck took the pen name Iceberg Slim and wrote \"Pimp\", a dark, gritty tale of life in the inner-city underworld. While the book contained elements of the Black Power agenda, it was most notable for its unsparing depiction of street life.\n\nIceberg Slim wrote many other novels and attained an international following. Some of the terminology he used in his books crossed over into the lexicon of Black English. Other writers included Donald Goines and, notably, Claude Brown's \"Manchild in the Promised Land\", which was published in 1965. Also published that year was \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" by Alex Haley\".\" Because Haley's non-fictional read captured the realistic nature of African American urban life for coming-of-age young men, the book has consistently served as a standard for reading among African American teenaged boys.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, urban fiction in print experienced a decline. However, one could make a cogent argument that urban tales simply moved from print to music, as hip hop music exploded in popularity. Of course, for every emcee who signed a recording contract and made the airwaves, ten more amateurs plied the streets and local clubs, much like urban bards, griots or troubadours telling urban fiction in an informal, oral manner rather than in a neat, written form.\n\nOne of the most famous emcees, Tupac Shakur, is sometimes called a ghetto prophet and an author of urban fiction in lyrical form. Shakur's early poetry was posthumously compiled into a volume entitled \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\" in 1999.\n\nModern hip-hop literature in print form is a thriving and popular genre. Many non-fiction publications from figures in the hip-hop realm such as Russell Simmons, Kevin Liles, LL Cool J, and FUBU founder Daymond John feature prominently in this genre. Karrine Steffans and shock jock Wendy Williams have written blockbuster books for this audience. Both Steffans and emcee 50 Cent have had such success with their books that they were given their own imprints to usher in similar authors, such as for 50 Cent's G-Unit Books.\n\nToward the end of the 1990s, urban fiction experienced a revival, as demand for novels authentically conveying the urban experience increased, and new business models enabled fledgling writers to more easily bring a manuscript to market and to libraries. One of the first writers in this new cycle of urban fiction was Omar Tyree, who published the novel \"Flyy Girl\" in 1996, reissued as a reprint in 1999.\n\nThe genre gained significant momentum in 1999 with Sister Souljah's bestseller \"The Coldest Winter Ever\". Teri Woods's \"True to the Game\" was also published in 1999, and became the standard from which the entrepreneurial publishing and distribution of contemporary urban fiction took note. The simultaneous publishing of these three novels created a momentum of readership for urban fiction and carried that wave for years. Thus \"The Coldest Winter Ever\", \"True to the Game\", and \"Flyy Girl\" are considered classics in the renaissance of the genre.\n\nSister Souljah describes the untapped market for urban fiction and the stereotypes that held it back in its early years:\n\nIn less than a decade, urban fiction has experienced a renaissance that boasts thousands of titles. The newest wave of street fiction is urban Latino fiction novels such as \"Devil's Mambo\" by Jerry Rodriguez, Chained by Deborah Cardona (a.k.a. Sexy) and Jeff Rivera's \"Forever My Lady\".\n\nMajor writers of contemporary urban fiction include Wahida Clark, Vickie Stringer, Nikki Turner, Kole Black, K'wan, Toy Styles, Kwame Teague, who many believed penned Teri Woods' \"Dutch\", and the writing duo Meesha Mink & De'Nesha Diamond.\n\nThere is also an unexpected literary wave of hip-hop fiction and street lit, which was sparked by Sister Souljah. Authors with a book or books in this offering include Saul Williams, Abiola Abrams, and Felicia Pride. These are hip hop lit or street lit books that take a more literary approach using metaphor, signifying and other literary devices. These books may also be used in socially redeeming or classroom capacities, while maintaining love and positivity for the music and hip hop culture.\n\nWith this new wave of renaissance, \"street lit\" was breaking new ground when it came to promotion and exposure. Aside from hand-to-hand sales, which seems to work best in a genre where word-of-mouth has proven to be worth more than any large ad campaign, the Internet has increased the authors' and publishers' ability to reach out to the genre's readers.\n\nWith Internet savvy, many self-published authors who once had no shot of recognition are now household names, such as author Rasheed Clark, who went from relatively unknown, to being honored with fourteen Infini Literary Award nominations for his first two novels, \"Stories I Wouldn't Tell Nobody But God\" and \"Cold Summer Afternoon\", both of which became instant bestsellers and proved that Clark was a fresh voice in African American fiction, and a leading African-American writer.\n\nAuthors in this genre such as K'wan Foye, Nikki Turner, Toy Styles, Kole Black, are known for bringing street teams and other musical promotion efforts to the book scene. In recent years, some of these authors have joined with hip hop artists such as 50 Cent to further promote the genre by penning the musicians' real-life stories.\n\nIn 2010, the hip hop music label, Cash Money Records, established a publishing branch to their brand, Cash Money Content. However, Cash Money Content's last book, \"Animal 3\", was published in November 2014.\n\nVickie Stringer is an urban lit author, as well as founder and CEO of her own publishing company, Triple Crown Publications, a publisher of 45 novels and 35 writers as of 2008.\n\nForums like AALBC are often used to keep track of the progressive urban fiction genre as it grows tremendously daily.\n\nEarly criticism of street lit was that books were badly edited due to lack of copy editing by independent publishers. However, in recent years the mainstream publishing industry recognized the genre's potential and signed many street lit authors to contracts, thus producing better packaged product. One such author was Treasure E.
