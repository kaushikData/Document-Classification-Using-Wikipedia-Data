The eggs were laid by Leda after mating with Zeus disguised as a swan. Had Leda not laid the egg, Helen would not have been born, so Paris could not have eloped with her, so there would have been no Trojan War.\n\nThe English literary use of the phrase comes from Horace's \"Ars Poetica\", where he describes his ideal epic poet as one who \"does not begin the Trojan War from the double egg\" (\"nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ouo\"), the absolute beginning of events, the earliest possible chronological point, but snatches the listener into the middle of things (\"in medias res\"). This advice is famously rejected in Laurence Sterne's novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.\n\nThis use is distinct from the longer phrase \"ab ovo usque ad mala\" (lit. \"from the egg to the apples\") which appears in Horace's \"Satire\" 1.3. It refers to the course of a Roman meal, which often began with eggs and ended with fruit, and is similar to the American English phrase \"soup to nuts\". Thus \"ab ovo\" can also be used to mean a complete or entire thing.\n\n"}

At the age of 27 he went into the real estate business and discovered the company VibroMeter in Villars-sur-Glâne, which developed and fabricated measuring instruments. He became the sole shareholder and CEO of the company, that from the 1960s on manufactured with great succes specialized instruments for the automobile and aviation industries and in 1990 for the heavy-lift rocket Ariane 5. In 1991 Merkle sold the majority of his share to Elektrowatt and retired from the company's management in 1998 after its sale to Meggitt PLC.. \n\nIn 2007 Merkle made a donation of 100 million Swiss Francs to the University of Fribourg for the foundation of a research institute in nanotechnology and material sciences. Subsequently, he donated a further 10 million Swiss Francs to turn the former medical clinic Garcia in Fribourg (next to the Perolles campus of the university) into the research facility that is now named after him, the Adolphe Merkle Institute. The by Swiss standards extraordinary donation was the highest private donation to a university in Switzerland to date. The \"Adolphe-Merkle-Foundation\", which he foundend, is part of the institute council and promotes in many areas the institute's support of multilingualism or scientific awards. In 2003 Merkle was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Fribourg and together with his wife honorary citizenship by the Canton of Fribourg.\n\nMerkle was married and father of a son who died in a car accident when he was young.\n\n"}
{"id": "3484432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3484432", "title": "Ageless", "text": "Ageless\n\nAgeless is an adjective describing a person or thing whose age cannot be defined, is non-existent, or appears not to change. It can also describe something that has always existed without a precise beginning or an end.\n\nAgelessness can be used as a synonym for immortality; more specifically it refers to eternal youth.\n\nAgelessness can be attributed to individuals whose physical or mental characteristics appear young for their biological age.\n\nThe Castrati singers of the Renaissance aged differently from other men due to the lack of testosterone and other hormones, which may have altered their appearance and stature. Specifically, Alessandro Moreschi (1858–1922) was described as having no facial hair and a childish voice and appearance.\n\nThe illusion of agelessness seems to be a goal for many individuals, such as Hollywood celebrities, that have been known to strive for, sometimes undergoing extensive and/or risky cosmetic surgeries. Demi Moore, Naomi Campbell, Eminem, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Madonna are particularly mentioned in the media for their alleged efforts to appear 'forever young'. Television host Dick Clark was often described as \"America's Oldest Teenager.\" Many of his viewers report difficulty in perceiving typical signs of aging since the 1960s, despite him being born in 1929. The age of Andy Milonakis is also ambiguous to many viewers since he is known to possess a hormone disorder, which allows him to perform the role of a young teenager in his shows despite being much older. Another celebrity who is commonly described as having the appearance of a teenager is the actor Eddie Redmayne, born 1982, due to his virtual lack of beard growth, causing many people to report he appears no older than 20 years of age.\n\nActor Suzanne Somers attributes her youthful appearance to the use of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Her 2006 book \"Ageless\" continues the theme of her 2004 book \"The Sexy Years\" that restoring hormones (especially sex hormones) to youthful levels is the primary key to an ageless appearance.\n\nCosmetics exist largely to supposedly aid in attempts to diminish the effects of age. The use of such cosmetics has been known to sometimes create conflicting age indicators (for example, red hair belonging to a wrinkled face), making age determination difficult.\n\nBotox, silicone implants, tummy tucks, facelifts, and nosejobs are examples of surgeries that attempt to remove the signs of aging. Sooner or later, however, the effects of the passing years do start to show on the body as it endures wear and tear. Scientists all over the world are also working on finding the reason of aging and have developed various theories, however, much more research is needed before this phenomenon can be fully understood and potentially controlled.\n\nGods and goddesses were considered eternal in many ancient mythologies, and were endowed with eternal youth. In Greek mythology, agelessness was achieved by the gods' eating ambrosia (immortality was derived from their blood, ichor); in Norse mythology, by the gods eating golden apples provided by Iðunn; and in Chinese mythology, by the gods consuming the Peaches of Immortality.\n\nAgelessness is prominent in anime, manga, cartoons, comic books, comic strips, and other illustrated media. Characters and situations are staged in an eternal present where change and causality are considered arbitrary and disposable. Ageless characters in comic books often appear as superheroes, deriving immortal or timeless properties from accelerated or supernatural healing, time travel, interdimensional origin, and other fictional devices. In comics and cartoons, agelessness is sometimes used to preserve continuity in a floating timeline or an episodic format respectively. For example, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are ageless cartoon and comic characters.\n\nLong-running series of pulp novels can develop ageless characters. The main characters in The Hardy Boys have remained 17 and 18, and have been located approximately in the \"present day\" since 1926. The same can be said for The Nancy Drew series. Nancy has remained 18 years old for many decades (although she started out at the age of 16).\n\nJames Bond is also known by many as an ageless character. Some of his ally characters, including M, Q, Miss Moneypenny, Bill Tanner and Felix Leiter also do not age throughout both the novel and film series, which began in 1953 and 1962 respectively. Ian Fleming, the creator of Bond, tinkered with details of Bond's early life and changed dates to ensure Bond was always the appropriate age for his stories, a practice called retconning.\n\nTolkien's Elves are an iconic example of creatures who are ageless. They are not subject to entropy and decay, unlike Men and the rest of the Middle-earth. Tolkien described his elves as young-looking, yet with some properties of 'wisdom' and experience in their eyes and behaviour; Tolkien also stated that Elves do experience change and aging—not by growing old, but by altering other features of their appearance. The combination of physical youth and immense mental maturity can render the perceived age of an Elf undefinable and alien by mortal standards.\n\nThe Aes Sedai of Robert Jordan's \"Wheel of Time\" series are described as ageless. A feature of their magical abilities extends life and makes their age difficult to place despite their white hair and physical frailty.\n\nOn television, the process of a character (usually a child) aging unusually fast has been a common feature in soap operas and is known as Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome or \"SORAS\". The reverse effect, where characters fail to age at the typical rate they should or in fact become younger, is known by a more recent, opposite term known as de-SORAS. On the British television show Doctor Who, which involves time travel, all of the Doctor's incarnations appear not to age, except for the First Doctor. It's also implied on Sarah Jane Adventures episode Death of the Doctor that the Doctor's first companions Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright have never aged since their travels; Also, despite the fact that 10 years of the life of the Pond-Williams passed between The Eleventh Hour and The Angels Take Manhattan, they didn't show any major traits associated with aging. Several characters on ABC's 2011 TV series \"Once Upon a Time\" do not age, either through the effects of the Dark Curse or spending time in Neverland; in the case of Hook, both are true. Other characters, such as Rumplestiltskin or Merlin and his apprentice, do not age due to the fact that they possess immortality.\n\n"}

It is a term mostly used within Hong Kong culture. The stories can be anywhere from 15 minutes to hours long.\n\nThe first radio station to offer airwave novel entertainment in Hong Kong was Radio Rediffusion. Li Ngaw is generally considered the pioneer of the Chinese story broadcast format. Though he did not begin the art in Hong Kong as he was already doing the story broadcasts in Guangzhou, China. The art form was popular in Hong Kong during the 1950s.\n\nThe term \"Airwave novel\" was first suggested by director Yam Wu-fa, when he bought the rights to Crime Doesn't Pay in 1949. The film originally started out as the airwave novel titled Flame of Lust by Li Ngaw.\n\nToday radio stations in Hong Kong continue to broadcast stories. The format largely consist of mogwai and jiangshi tales (鬼故, literally Ghost tales). A number of Hong Kong taxi drivers do tune into the shows regularly, since radio remains to be their main form of entertainment. The stories are also for people with a deep interest in urban legend type haunted stories. The format, however, is considered an older style alternative entertainment to present day internet, television etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2651880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2651880", "title": "Aromachology", "text": "Aromachology\n\nAromachology is the study of the influence of odors on human behavior and to examine the relationship between feelings and emotions. It analyzes emotions as relaxation, exhilaration, sensuality, happiness and well-being brought about by odors stimulating the olfactory pathways in the brain and, in particular, the limbic system. Different wearers are thought to have unique physiological and psychological responses to scents, especially those not manufactured synthetically but based on real scents. The word \"aromachology\" is derived from \"aroma\" and \"physio-psychology\", the latter being the study of aroma. This term was coined in 1989 by what is now the Sense of Smell Institute (SSI), a division of The Fragrance Foundation. The SSI defines aromachology as 'a concept based on systematic, scientific data collected under controlled conditions'. The term is defined as the scientifically observable influence of smell on emotions and moods. Consumers use aromachology to alleviate time pressures, for relaxation or stimulation and as a component of other activities that generate a feeling of well-being.\n\nAlthough certain plants are known through studies in aromatherapy to have stimulating or relaxing effects, research on wider scopes of application for therapeutic purposes are still at an early stage. Aromachology devotees want to find out how psychological effects are transmitted from scent to the brain, as well as how positive behavioral effects can be induced by scent. Maria Lis-Bachin, author of \"Aromatherapy Science: a Guide for Healthcare Professionals\", notes an overlap between the objectives of aromatherapy and those of aromachology. However, despite this apparent overlapping, academic authors believe that they are distinct branches of research and application, with each having its own research methods and directions.\n\nThe history of aromatherapy goes back to Ancient Egypt. People for years have used essential oils to treat their psychological and physical well-being. In Ancient Egypt, people used essential oils for cosmetic and medicinal products. Civilizations from around the globe also used aromatherapy for therapeutic purposes.\nThe term aromatherapy dates from the 20th century when French chemist Jean-Maurice Gattefosse rediscovered the healing powers of lavender's essential oil by trying to relieve a severe burn. Aromatherapy requires the incorporation of essential oils and plant-based essentials for therapeutic and holistic process assuring the well-being of the mind and body.\n\nOn the other hand, Aromachology is the term The Fragrance Foundation and the Sense of Smell Institute, both based in New York, assigned in 1989 to the concern about the scents and the psyche behavior because of odors. Aromachology is a relatively new science that explores positive feelings induced by odors far from any holistic or healing process. The term also covers, both, natural and synthetic scents. The term aromachology is sometimes mistaken by companies with several other terms such as \"essential oils\" or \"aromatherapy\" as marketing phrases. The products shouldn't be labeled other than aromachology because they do not offer healing or holistic benefits.\n\nA Journal of Society of Cosmetic Chemists of Japan in 1992 realized a study to show how humans behave based on the scent they are exposed to. On the study, the effect of odor on cardiac response patterns was investigated on human subjects during a period of two-stimulus paradigm in a simple reaction time task. \nDuring the experiment changes in the cardiac response pattern were obvious and heart rate deceleration reflecting the process of anticipation or attention. \nOlfactory stimulation was provided to the subjects with different aromatic air samples with a 5-second rest period, followed by a 20-second olfactory stimulus period. It was concluded that the odor of lemon, traditionally thought to be stimulative, had the effect of activating anticipation or attention process. The effect of activating the anticipation or attention process was stronger when the odor intensity was more concentrated. On the other hand, the rose odor initially was thought to be sedative, had the effect of suppressing that process.\n\nFrom the point of view of creating a scent for the body, a number of aromachology practitioners and small companies interested in aromachology are focused on creating bespoke perfumes for individuals who are less interested in purchasing the same fragrances that every other person is wearing and more inclined to wearing a perfume tailored precisely to their own preferences, memories and scent matches. Some cosmetic brands such as Shiseido and Décléor are devoting substantial efforts to the task of finding out the beneficial properties of aromas on our sense of well-being and health. Shiseido currently has a skincare line called \"The Skincare\" that uses aromachology in their products. \n\nBroader applications for aromachology are found in industries that introduce scent into products other than cosmetics or perfumes. Aromachology is considered to also encompass scents introduced to home fragrances, textiles, drawer liners and odor reducers for the home environment.\n\n\n"}

The \"Brown Lady\" is so named because of the brown brocade dress it is claimed she wears.\n\nAccording to legend, the \"Brown Lady of Raynham Hall\" is the ghost of Lady Dorothy Walpole (1686–1726), the sister of Robert Walpole, generally regarded as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. She was the second wife of Charles Townshend, who was notorious for his violent temper. The story says that when Townshend discovered that his wife had committed adultery with Lord Wharton he punished her by locking her in her rooms in the family home, Raynham Hall. According to Mary Wortley Montagu, Dorothy was in fact entrapped by the Countess of Wharton. She invited Dorothy over to stay for a few days knowing that her husband would never allow her to leave, not even to see her children. She remained at Raynham Hall until her death in 1726 from smallpox.\n\nThe first recorded claim of a sighting of the ghost was by Lucia C. Stone concerning a gathering at Raynham Hall in the Christmas of 1835. Stone says that Lord Charles Townshend had invited various guests to the Hall, including a Colonel Loftus, to join in the Christmas festivities. Loftus and another guest named Hawkins said they had seen the \"Brown Lady\" one night as they approached their bedrooms, noting in particular the dated brown dress she wore. The following evening Loftus claimed to have seen the \"Brown Lady\" again, later reporting that on this occasion he was drawn to the spectre's empty eye-sockets, dark in the glowing face. Loftus' sightings led to some staff permanently leaving Raynham Hall.\nThe next reported sighting of the \"Brown Lady\" was made in 1836 by Captain Frederick Marryat, a friend of novelist Charles Dickens, and the author of a series of popular sea novels. It is said that Marryat requested that he spend the night in the haunted room at Raynham Hall to prove his theory that the haunting was caused by local smugglers anxious to keep people away from the area. Writing in 1891, Florence Marryat said of her father's experience:\n\nLady Townshend reported that the \"Brown Lady\" was next seen in 1926, when her son and his friend claimed to have seen the ghost on the staircase, identifying the ghostly figure with the portrait of Lady Dorothy Walpole which then hung in the haunted room.\n\nOn September 19, 1936 Captain Hubert C. Provand, a London-based photographer working for \"Country Life\" magazine, and his assistant, Indre Shira, were taking photographs of Raynham Hall for an article. They claim that they had already taken a photograph of the Hall's main staircase and were setting up to take a second when Shira saw \"a vapoury form gradually assuming the appearance of a woman\" moving down the stairs towards them. Under Shira's direction Provand quickly took the cap off the lens while Shira pressed the trigger to activate the camera's flash. Later, when the negative was developed, the famous image of the \"Brown Lady\" was revealed. The account of Provand and Shira's ghostly experience at Raynham Hall was published in \"Country Life\" magazine on December 26, 1936 along with the photograph of the Brown Lady. The photograph and the account of its taking also appeared in the January 4, 1937 edition of \"Life\" magazine.\nShortly thereafter, the noted paranormal investigator Harry Price interviewed Provand and Shira and reported, \"I will say at once I was impressed. I was told a perfectly simple story: Mr. Indre Shira saw the apparition descending the stairs at the precise moment when Captain Provand’s head was under the black cloth. A shout – and the cap was off and the flashbulb fired, with the results which we now see. I could not shake their story, and I had no right to disbelieve them. Only collusion between the two men would account for the ghost if it is a fake. The negative is entirely innocent of any faking.\"\n\nSome critics have claimed that Shira faked the image by putting grease or a similar substance on the lens in the shape of a figure, or moved down the stairs himself during an exposure. Others claim that the image is an accidental double exposure or that light somehow got into the camera.\n\nJoe Nickell has written that a detailed examination of the photograph shows evidence of double exposure. John Fairley and Simon Welfare wrote \"there is a pale line above each stair-tread, indicating that one picture has been superimposed over the other; a patch of reflected light at the top of the right-hand banister appears twice.\"\n\nThe magician John Booth wrote the photograph could easily be duplicated by naturalistic methods. Booth had the magician Ron Wilson cover himself in a bed sheet and descend the grand staircase at The Magic Castle in Hollywood. The faked ghost image looked very similar to the Raynham Hall photograph.\n\nOther critics point out that the image of the lady very closely resembles that of a standard Virgin Mary statue as would be found in any Catholic church, the light patch covering the bottom one third of the image, resembling an inverted \"V\" shape, being very indicative, as the outer garment above it drapes down on either side at an angle. Also the head is covered and the hands appear to be together as in prayer, and the square or rectangular pedestal on which she stands is also clearly visible. This strongly suggests that the photo is a simple superimposition of the Madonna statue onto the empty staircase.\n\n\n"}

The government of Nicolae Ceaușescu claimed an uninterrupted existence of the state from Burebista to Ceaușescu himself.\n\nThe film begins with a shot of a rocky outcrop, shaped like a human head, apparently gazing out over the Carpathian Mountains. A voice-over explains that the expansion of Roman power is beginning to threaten the borders of the kingdom of Dacia under its \"enigmatic\" ruler Burebista.\n\nThe high priest Deceneus convinces the Dacian lords to swear allegiance to Burebista as king of a unified Dacia. He promises to keep Dacia free from the increasing power of Rome. A rigorous regime of military training is introduced by the king. Some refugees from Rome arrive, including Calopor, a former gladiator who had served with Spartacus. Burebista welcomes them, asking Calopor to tell him about Spartacus' exploits. Burebista also learns about the ambition of the young Julius Caesar, and his rivalry with Pompey. \n\nMessengers from Mithridates VI of Pontus and from Greece arrive to ask Burebista's help in resisting the advance of Roman forces. Burebista agrees to help. Calopor is sent to assess the situation in Greece. While there he meets his former girlfriend Lydia, who has been forced to marry the arrogant Roman aristocrat Gaius Antonius Hybrida. Hybrida demands games in his honour. Calopor takes part as a gladiator, planning to kill Hybrida. When Calopor throws a trident at him, Hybrida pulls Lydia in front of his body, and the trident kills her. Horrified, Calopor leaps up and stabs Hybrida to death, giving the signal for a general uprising. With the Romans in confusion, Burebista launches his cavalry against their retreating forces, defeating them.\n\nBurebista celebrates his victory with a festival in Dacia. He learns from a messenger that Mithridates has killed himself to avoid being captured by Pompey, but is given a letter in which the dead king encourages him to continue to resist Rome. Another letter also arrives, from Pompey. Pompey is now asking Burebista's help to curb Caesar. He ponders trouble to come.\n\nThe Boii, a Celtic tribe, raids Dacia, capturing and enslaving villagers with the help of a Dacian traitor. Burebista discovers that the raid succeeded because guards were drunk. He orders the destruction of grapevines. He attempts to negotiate with the Celts, telling them that Dacians and Celts need to cooperate to preserve independence from Rome. The Celts, influenced by their fanatical Druid Breza, refuse to negotiate. Forced to fight, Burebista is worried that the war will weaken both sides, giving Caesar an opportunity to invade. The Celts, meanwhile, threaten to kill all their Dacian captives. Deceneus tells Burebista that there will soon be a solar eclipse. Burebista decides to use this to frighten the Celts with the power of the Dacian gods. He tells them that the gods will darken the sun. The eclipse terrifies the Celts, who agree to surrender the captives. Breza flees, pursued by Calopor. When Calopor follows him into a building, Breza stabs him in the back. As he dies, Calopor reveals that he is Burebista's illegitimate son. Breza is captured and executed by being thrown into an altar pyre of the goddess Epona. \n\nWith Celtic tribes now acknowledging his rule, Burebista has created a strong kingdom. In Gaul, Caesar announces that he has conquered the country and absorbed it into the Roman empire. After he has defeated Pompey, he will proceed to absorb Dacia too. As, some time later, Burebista ponders Caesar's vow, he is told that the threat is over — Caesar has been assassinated. Deceneus speaks of the transience of life. Burebista says that all kings must die, but the unity of the nation he has created should be immortal. He gazes over the mountains, and his head fades into a merge with the rock with which the film began.\n\n\nThe film was made to coincide with celebrations of the founding of a unified state, presented as the model for modern Romania. According to Lucian Boia, Burebista was constantly compared to Ceaușescu, \n\nDoru Pop argues that Ceaușescu's \"national-communist ideology\" needed the support of claims that he \"descended from a long line of Romanian (!) historical figures, beginning with Burebista, the illusory ruler of the Dacian empire.\"\n"}

Daphne, depicted as coming from a wealthy family, is noted for her red hair, lavender heels, fashion sense, and her knack for getting into danger, hence the nickname \"Danger Prone Daphne\". Daphne has appeared in more adaptations than the other characters, aside from Shaggy Rogers and Scooby-Doo.\n\nThe Daphne character was inspired by the sophisticated and money-hungry teen character Thalia Menninger, as played by Tuesday Weld, from the late 50s/early 60s American sitcom \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\". \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\" shows her birthday to be December 25 to create a personal conflict for her regarding Christmas overshadowing her birthday.\n\nTogether with her other teenage companions, Fred Jones, Velma Dinkley, Shaggy Rogers, and Shaggy's Great Dane, Scooby-Doo, Daphne would engage in solving various mysteries. In the first series, Daphne was portrayed as the beautiful and enthusiastic but clumsy and danger-prone member of the gang (hence her nickname, \"Danger-prone Daphne\") who always follows her intuition. She serves as the damsel in distress and would occasionally get kidnapped, tied up, gagged, and then left imprisoned. But as the franchise went on, she became a stronger, more independent character, who could take care of herself.\n\nDuring the series' fourth incarnation, \"Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo\", some of the episodes focused on Daphne. In the episode, \"Shiver and Shake, That Demon's a Snake\", Daphne buys an idol which is cursed by the snake demon. On the sailboat, the snake demon attacks Daphne and demands an idol to return. In the episode, \"The Scary Sky Skeleton\", Daphne is reunited with her old friend, Wendy.\n\nIn the episode, \"I Left My Neck in San Francisco\", Daphne becomes sick and she's unable to help the gang to solve the mystery about The Lady Vampire of the Bay. Due to the vampire's look, Daphne's unseen reflection in the mirror, the bat flying around Daphne's bed and herself returning to bed a little later, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy are convinced that Daphne is a vampire. When the vampiress is revealed to be Lefty Callahan, Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy realize they made a mistake with suspecting Daphne and she is feeling well again.\n\nWhen the original Mystery Inc. group took a hiatus from the franchise in the 80s, Daphne was initially absent too, with the series focusing on the comedy antics of Scooby, Shaggy, and Scrappy. However, when the \"Whodunnit?\" aspect returned to the series with \"The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries\", Daphne returned, now an accomplished investigator assisted by Shaggy and the two dogs, investigating supernatural occurrences. She continued to help Scooby battle evil forces of the supernatural in the \"13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\" series.\n\nThe youthful Daphne portrayed in \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" would commonly call upon her butler, Jenkins, to do various tasks. The younger Daphne is shown (along with her parents) to not believe in ghost/monsters/supernatural (one of her catchphrases in that series was \"\"There is no such thing as ghosts (monsters)!\"), a trait she lacks outside the \"A Pup Named Scooby-Doo\" series.\n\nIn the movie \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\", Daphne as an adult, had a very successful investigative TV series called \"Coast to Coast with Daphne Blake\" on a fictional channel called \"Americana\", which the show had aired on for two seasons. The producer of the show was Fred Jones.\n\nThroughout the various incarnations of the character, there has been speculation that Daphne and Fred had an attraction toward each other. This is emphasized in many of the direct-to-video movies and the TV series \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\". By the time of the second season, they are shown to be actively dating, showing more of his feelings toward Daphne. In the first live-action \"Scooby-Doo\" movie, the two initially are just friends with but as the film progresses they begin to develop a romantic interest in each other and briefly kiss after saving Spooky Island. In the sequel \"\", they are in a relationship.\n\nIn \"Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!\", Daphne is portrayed as being an eccentric nonconformist, usually having a different odd obsession each episode (such as puppets, false facial hair, etc.)\n\n\nHer usual appearance in the franchise consists of a purple mini dress, pink pantyhose, purple shoes, and a green scarf. In \"Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island,\" \"Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost,\" and \"Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase\", she wore a purple and green three-piece suit with matching shoes. In \"Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders\", she wore a purple sleeveless shirt with pink shorts and purple trainers boots or shoes.\n\nAs a child, she wore a pink sweater, red skirt, and pink pantyhose with white go-go boots. In \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo\", she wore other purple and pink clothes. Some included a purple jumpsuit and a purple dress with a white belt. In \"Scooby-Doo\", she wears various outfits, but mostly a purple/pink dress with pink knee high boots.\n\nRelatives of Daphne, including her four identical sisters, shown during the series' run include:\n\nNote: Frank Welker, Kath Soucie, and Jennifer Hale voice the Blakes in \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" series, Vanessa Marshall voiced Danica in the \"What's New, Scooby-Doo?\" series and Grey DeLisle voiced Shannon in the film \"Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster\" (direct-to-DVD).

The late voice actor Don Messick voiced two of Daphne's uncles: Matthew \"Matt\" Blake on \"The Scooby-Doo Show\" and John Maxwell on \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\".\n\nDaphne was portrayed by Sarah Michelle Gellar in the film \"Scooby-Doo\" and its sequel, \"\" and voiced in the animated series \"Robot Chicken\".

Unlike the previous incarnation of the character, Gellar's version of Daphne is trained in martial arts during Mystery Inc.'s 2-year-long departure in the first film, as she is tired of being a damsel in distress on every case that she is involved in with the gang. Coincidentally, this subversion of the damsel in distress to a strong female fighter almost mirrors Gellar's widely recognized role of the title character in the TV series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". Though in the first movie, she is captured by the masked wrestler Zarkos, she beats him in a fight at the end.\n\nDaphne is portrayed by Kate Melton in the third film \"Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins\" (released as a TV movie in 2009) and its sequel \"Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster\" (which premiered on October 16, 2010). These two movies are prequels to the first two live-action movies and show how the gang met while in High School. Daphne is the president of the drama club at Coolsville High School and the lead in the school musical. It is also revealed that she is the actual owner of the Mystery Machine.\n\nSarah Jeffery will portray Daphne in the live-action film Daphne & Velma. This film will show a different origin to how Daphne met the rest of Mystery Inc. According to this movie Daphne met Velma first and the two of them started solving mysteries before meeting the other members of the gang.\n\nMembers of the fanbase of the original \"Scooby-Doo\" speculated that Daphne and Fred Jones had a romantic attraction to one another. The makers of the \"Scooby-Doo\" film originally planned to refer to the rumor by including a scene where Fred asks to stay with Daphne, using a toothbrush to imply that he wanted to stay with Daphne for the night. The scene was not included in the final version of the film.\n"}

{"id": "3443916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3443916", "title": "Design methods", "text": "Design methods\n\nDesign methods are procedures, techniques, aids, or tools for designing. They offer a number of different kinds of activities that the designer might use within an overall design process. Conventional procedures of design, such as drawing, can be regarded as design methods, but since the 1950s new procedures have been developed that are more usually grouped together under the name of 'Design Methods’. What these new methods have in common is that they \"are attempts to make public the hitherto private thinking of designers; to externalise the design process\".\n\n\"Design methodology\" is the broader study of method in design: the study of the principles, practices and procedures of designing.\nSocial, political and economic developments of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century put into motion modern benefits and constraints for living and working. Industrial and technological breakthroughs associated with this period created social and economic complexities for people and their environment. Disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, engineering and product development began to tackle new types of problem-solving past traditional artifact making. More informed and methodical approaches to designing were required.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1963 Horst Rittel was a pioneer in articulating the relationship between science and design, specifically the limitations of design processes based on the 19th century rational view of science, in his courses at Ulm School of Design in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968). Rittel proposed principles for dealing with these limitations through his seminal HfG design methods courses: cybernetics, operational analysis and communication theory. In 1963 he was recruited to Berkeley to teach design methods courses and helped found the Design Methods Group (DMG) and the DMG Journal.\n\nDesign methods in England originally drew from a 1962 conference called \"The Conference on Systematic and Intuitive Methods in Engineering, Industrial Design, Architecture and Communications.\" This event was organized by John Chris Jones, and Peter Slann who, with conference invitees, were driven by concerns about how their modern industrialized world was being manifested.\n\nConference participants countered the craftsman model of design which was rooted in turning raw materials through tried and true craft-based knowledge into finished products. They believed that a single craft-based designer producing design solutions was not compatible with addressing the evolving complexity of post-industrial societies. They stressed that designers needed to work in cross-disciplinary teams where each participant brings his/her specific body of skills, language and experiences to defining and solving problems in whatever context.\n\nThe key benefit was to find a method that suits a particular design situation. Christopher Alexander went on to write his seminal books \"A Pattern Language\" and \"A Timeless Way of Building\".\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, graduates of the Ulm School of Design in Germany (Hochschule für Gestaltung - HfG Ulm: 1953–1968). began to spread Horst Rittel's approach of design methodology across Europe and the United States in context of their professional work and teaching what became known as the 'Ulm Model'.\n\nLikewise, after the 1962 conference in England, many of the participants began to publish and to define an area of research that focused on design. Three \"camps\" seemed to emerge to develop different directions in the initial work in Design Methods:\n\nThe Design Research Society was founded in 1966 by several participants from the Conference on Design Methods. The purpose of the Society is to promote \"the study of and research into the process of designing in all its many fields\" and is an interdisciplinary group with many professions represented, but all bound by the conviction of the benefits of design research.\n\nThe Environmental Design Research Association is one of the best-known entities that strive to integrate designers and social science professionals for better built environments. EDRA was founded by Henry Sanoff in 1969. Both John Chris Jones and Christopher Alexander interacted with EDRA and other camps; both seemed at a certain point to reject their interpretations. Jones and Alexander also questioned their original theses about design methods.\n\nAn interesting shift that affected design methods and design studies was a series of 1968 lectures by Herbert A. Simon, the Nobel laureate, on \"The Sciences of the Artificial\". He proposed using scientific methods to explore the world of man-made things (hence artificial). He discussed the role of analysis (observation) and synthesis (making) as a process of creating man-made responses to the world he/she interacted with. Important to Simon's contribution were his notions of \"bounded rationality\" and \"satisficing.\" Simon's concept had a profound impact on the discourse in both design methods, and the newly emerging design studies communities in two ways. It provided an entry to using scientific ideas to overlay on design, and it also created an internal debate whether design could/should be expressed and practiced as a type of science with the reduction of emphasis on intuition.\n\nNigel Cross has been prolific in articulating the issues of design methods and design research. The discussion of the ongoing debate of what is design research and design science was, and continues to be articulated by Cross. His thesis is that design is not a science, but is an area that is searching for \"intellectual independence.\" He views the original design methods discussions of the 1960s as a way to integrate objective and rational methods in practicing design. Scientific method was borrowed as one framework, and the term design science was coined in 1966 at the conference on The Design Method focusing on a systematic approach to practicing design. Cross defined the \"science of design\" as a way to create a body of work to improve the understanding of design methods — and more importantly that design does not need to be a binary choice between science and art.\n\nNigan Bayazit published an overview of the historical development of design methods. She stated that \"Design methods people were looking at rational methods of incorporating scientific techniques and knowledge into the design process to make rational decisions to adapt to the prevailing values, something that was not always easy to achieve.\"\n\nConversations about design methods and a more systematic approach to design was not isolated to Europe. America was also a magnet for practicing design professionals to codify their successes in design practice and backing into larger theories about the dynamics of design methods.\n\nAmerican designers were much more pragmatic at articulating design methods and creating an underlying language about the practice of industrial and graphic design. They were tied to economic systems that supported design practice and therefore focused on the way design could be managed as an extension of business, rather than the European approach to design methods based on transforming engineering by design.\n\nIndustrial design was the first area that made inroads into systematizing knowledge through practice. Raymond Loewy was instrumental at elevating the visibility of industrial design through cult of personality (appearing three times on front cover of \"Time Magazine\"). Henry Dreyfuss had a profound impact on the practice of industrial design by developing a systematic process used to shape environments, transportation, products and packaging. His focus on the needs of the average consumer was most celebrated in his book \"Designing for People\", an extensive exploration of ergonomics.\n\nJay Doblin one of America's foremost industrial designers, worked for Raymond Loewy and was later an employee of Unimark International, the world’s largest global design firm during the 1960s with offices in seven countries. In 1972, Doblin formed Chicago-based Jay Doblin & Associates, a firm which managed innovative programs for Xerox Corporation and General Electric. Doblin was prolific at developing a language to describe design. One of his best articles was \"A Short, Grandiose Theory of Design\", published in the 1987 Society of Typographic Arts Design Journal. In seven pages, Doblin presents a straightforward and persuasive argument for design as a systematic process. He described the emerging landscape of systematic design:\n\nDoblin and others were responding to the increased specialization of design and the complexity of managing large design programs for corporations. It was a natural process to begin to discuss how design should move upstream to be involved with the specifications of problems, not only in the traditional mode of production which design had been practiced. Particularly since 2000, design methods and its intersection with business development have been visibly championed by numerous consultancies within design industry.\n\nThe continuity of approaches to design projects by such representative firms is the generation of inputs incited by the human condition in varied contexts. These approaches utilize a sustainable methods-based mode of making that takes into account critical analytic and synthetic skills toward more informed and inspired specifications grounded in:\n\nPractitioners approached design methods from a different angle than John Christopher Jones and the group of engineers and designers who convened in 1962. Many practitioners, through actual design opportunities, began to confront the complexities of the market and clients. They began to address issues of specifications, users, distribution and innovation. Since there were no established methods, each practitioner began to develop frameworks and languages to describe a new way to design. Like any market-based model, there were many competing ideas about these new methods and their basis. Many of these designers may have been aware of the design methods movement, but many were not. Yet all their ideas were aligned to many of the basic tenets of the 1962 conference which advocated a more rigorous way of doing design. However, the social perspectives and criticisms of mediocre products of 1962 participants may not have been shared or agreed with.\n\nThere is no one way to practice design methods. John Chris Jones recognized this by stating:\n\nThe focus of most post-1962 enhancements to design methods has been on developing a series of relevant, sound, humanistic problem-solving procedures and techniques to reduce avoidable errors and oversights that can adversely affect design solutions. The key benefit is to find a method that suits a particular design situation.\n\nThe benefits of their original work has been abstracted many times over; but in today's design environment, several of their main ideas have been integrated into contemporary design methods:\n\nA large challenge for design as a discipline, its use of methods and an endeavor to create shared values, is its inherent synthetic nature as an area of study and action. This allows design to be extremely malleable in nature, borrowing ideas and concepts from a wide variety of professions to suit the ends of individual practitioners. It also makes design vulnerable since these very activities make design a discipline unextensible as a shared body of knowledge.\n\nIn 1983, Donald Schon at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published \"The Reflective Practitioner\". He saw traditional professions with stable knowledge bases, such as law and medicine, becoming unstable due to outdated notions of 'technical-rationality' as the grounding of professional knowledge. Practitioners were able to describe how they 'think on their feet', and how they make use of a standard set of frameworks and techniques. Schon foresaw the increasing instability of traditional knowledge and how to achieve it. This is in line with the original founders of design methods who wanted to break with an unimaginative and static technical society and unify exploration, collaboration and intuition.\n\nDesign methods has influenced design practice and design education. It has benefited the design community by helping to create introductions that would never have happened if traditional professions remained \"stable\", which did not necessarily allow collaboration due to gate keeping of areas of knowledge and expertise. Design has been by nature an interloper activity, with individuals that have crossed disciplines to question and innovate.\n\nThe challenge is to transform individual experiences, frameworks and perspectives into a shared, understandable, and, most importantly, a transmittable area of knowledge. Victor Margolin states three reasons why this will prove difficult:\n\nIn the end, \"design methods\" is a term that is widely used. Though conducive to interpretations, it is a shared belief in an exploratory and rigorous method to solve problems through design, an act which is part and parcel of what designers aim to accomplish in today's complex world.\n\n\n"}

Based on The Algiers Motel Incident during Detroit's 1967 12th Street Riot, the film's release commemorated the 50th anniversary of the event. The film stars John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, Hannah Murray, Kaitlyn Dever, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, Nathan Davis Jr., Peyton Alex Smith, Malcolm David Kelley, Joseph David-Jones, with John Krasinski and Anthony Mackie.\n\n\"Detroit\" premiered at the Fox Theatre, Detroit, on July 26, 2017, and began a limited theatrical release on August 4, 2017. The film received positive reviews from critics, with particular praise towards Bigelow's direction, Boal's screenplay and the performances of John Boyega, Will Poulter and Algee Smith but was a box office failure, only grossing $24 million against its $34 million budget.\n\nOn July 23, 1967, the Detroit Police Department staged a raid on an unlicensed club during a celebration for returning black veterans from the Vietnam War. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the 12th Street Riot. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor George W. Romney authorizes the Michigan Army National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson authorizes Army paratroopers to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.\n\nThe Dramatics, a professional black R&B group, arrive in Detroit hoping to score a recording contract. Seconds before their scheduled performance at a music hall, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city. En route, their bus is attacked by rioters and the group subsequently splits up, with lead singer Larry Reed and his friend Fred Temple renting a room at the local Algiers Motel for the night. They meet two white girls, Julie Ann and Karen, who introduce them to their friends Carl Cooper and Aubrey Pollard. Carl and another friend stage a prank using a starter pistol, upsetting Julie and Karen, who move to the room of Greene, a Vietnam War veteran, while Larry and Fred return to their own room.\n\nMelvin Dismukes, a private security guard, is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters and ingratiates himself with the Guardsmen. Carl decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in the direction of the troops to frighten them, but they mistake it for a sniper attack and pinpoint it coming from the Algiers due to the pistol's muzzle flash. The Michigan State Police, National Guard, and Detroit Police arrive at the motel to investigate, led by Detroit police officer Krauss. Entering the building, they gun down Carl when he tries to escape, and Krauss plants a knife next to his body as he bleeds out and dies.\n\nThey round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, demanding to know who the sniper was. Despite not finding any weapon during a search of the room, Krauss terrorizes and interrogates the occupants of the hotel. Dismukes arrives to try to help. Unwilling to get involved, most of the state police and National Guard leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse.\n\nKrauss orders several suspects to be moved to different rooms and subjected to mock executions in order to terrify the others into confessing. One police officer actually kills Aubrey, as he didn't understand the executions were supposed to be faked. Julie and Karen are taken to an upstairs room when they begin screaming, and Julie's clothes are torn off. Disgusted, a Guardsman returns, and manages to get them released from custody. Fearing arrest, Krauss permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear to keep silent. Greene and Larry agree, but Fred is killed when he refuses.\n\nAs the riots die down, Dismukes, while working his other job in a factory, is arrested and charged with murder after Julie identifies him as being present at the Algiers that night. Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, and when everyone except Krauss confesses, they are also charged. Larry, whose singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, is summoned as a witness to testify. The judge ultimately refuses to accept any of the confessions as evidence, and without a solid case, the all-white jury acquits Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendants of all charges. Dismukes confronts Krauss with the truth, but finds himself powerless to get any justice for the victims.\n\nThe film ends by explaining what became of the participants: Dismukes moved to the suburbs to escape death threats and resumed work as a security guard, Krauss and his men never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer and still lives in Detroit to the present day.\n\nOn January 28, 2016, it was announced that Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal would reteam to make a film about the 1967 Detroit riots, with Bigelow directing from a script by Boal. Both would also produce the film, along with Annapurna Pictures' Megan Ellison and Matthew Budman. \"Game of Thrones\" actress Hannah Murray was cast in a \"key role\" in the film, although her character was then being kept under wraps. The film was scheduled to shoot in the summer of 2016, in order to be released in 2017 for the 50th anniversary of the riots. On June 21, 2016, John Boyega joined the cast. On August 3, 2016, Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, and Ben O'Toole were cast in lead roles. On August 4, 2016, Anthony Mackie joined the cast, and on August 5, 2016, Jacob Latimore and Algee Smith also joined. On August 8, 2016, Joseph David-Jones joined the cast, followed by Kaitlyn Dever on August 30, 2016. On September 9, 2016, Jason Mitchell joined the cast, and on September 13, 2016, John Krasinski was also added. In October 2016, Jeremy Strong, Chris Chalk, Austin Hébert, Ephraim Sykes, Laz Alonso, Nathan Davis Jr., Malcolm David Kelley, Peyton Alex Smith, and Leon Thomas III all joined the cast of the film.\n\nIt was reported at the end of July 2016 that the film had commenced principal photography in Boston during the previous week. Scenes were filmed inside Dedham District Court, in Dorchester, Massachusetts and in Brockton, Massachusetts. In addition, the movie filmed in Detroit during October 2016. The elimination of Michigan's film incentives in 2015 affected the filming locations.\n\nIn May 2017, James Newton Howard was hired as the film's composer. In July 2017, Detroit rapper Tee Grizzley released a song called \"Teetroit\" for the soundtrack. The Roots and Bilal released a song named \"It Ain't Fair\" for the soundtrack.\n\n\"Detroit\" began a limited release in 10 markets on July 28, 2017, opening in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Washington D.C., Detroit, San Francisco, Houston, Atlanta, and Baltimore. Annapurna Pictures then released the film nationally, its first as a distributor, on August 4, 2017. Annapurna handled the film's North American distribution, while Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Entertainment One handled distribution for its international release. On November 3, 2017, it was announced the film would get a ten city, 20 screen re-release on December 1, 2017 in an effort to push its award campaign.\n\n\"Detroit\" grossed $16.8 million in the United States and Canada and $7.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $24.1 million, against a production budget of $34 million.\n\nIn North America, \"Detroit\" grossed $350,190 in its limited opening from 20 theaters (an average of $17,510), finishing 16th at the box office. The film then had its wide expansion alongside \"Kidnap\" and \"The Dark Tower\", and was initially projected to gross $10–15 million from 3,007 theaters over the weekend. The film made $525,000 from Thursday previews, which was more than the $515,482 it made in its entire week of limited release. It then made $2.6 million on its first day, lowering weekend projections to $7.5 million. It went on to open to $7.1 million, finishing 8th at the box office; 40% of its opening weekend audience were African American. Deadline Hollywood said that the film could have done better had it been released in the fall during festivals and awards season. In its second weekend the film grossed $2.9 million, dropping 59.5% (above average for an adult drama) and finishing in 13th. In its third week of wide release the film was pulled from 1,579 theaters and grossed $850,000 (a drop of 70.9%).\n\n\"Detroit\" received praise for its direction, screenplay, and acting, especially Boyega, Poulter, and Smith's performances. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 260 reviews, and an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Detroit\" delivers a gut-wrenching – and essential – dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past that draws distressing parallels to the present.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 86% overall positive score and a 63% \"definite recommend\".\n\nRichard Roeper of \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and called it one of 2017's best, saying: \"Journalist-screenwriter Mark Boal (Bigelow's collaborator on \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\") does a magnificent job of juggling the multiple storylines and creating fully authentic characters—some flawed, some basically decent, some evil.\" Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Peter Travers praised the cast and script, giving the film 3.5/4 stars and saying, \"... \"Detroit\" is far more than a liberal howl against the escalating toxicity of racism in America. Bigelow, with the same immersive intensity that Christopher Nolan brings to \"Dunkirk\", smacks us down in the middle of a brutal historical event so we can see it – and feel it – for ourselves.\"\n\nConversely, Alexander Nazaryan of \"Newsweek\" said, \"[Bigelow's] characters never come alive, moving through the film less as people than entries in a sociology textbook ... If Bigelow could get inside the minds of soldiers suffocated by post-traumatic stress disorder, as she did so capably in \"The Hurt Locker\", she can get into the mind of anyone. In \"Zero Dark Thirty\", she made even CIA interrogators likeable. The characters in \"Detroit\", though, black and white, are as flat as the plains of the Upper Midwest.\"\n\nSeveral critics noted the film's questionable take on a predominantly African American-based story. A. O. Scott in \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion—however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been—should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency.\" K. Austin Collins of \"The Ringer\" wrote, \"This movie isn't really about black people as people, nor history as a lived experience, but is instead invested in a dutiful, 'just the facts, ma'am' reenactment that pretends those other things are already a given. Boal, and Bigelow beside him, refuse to speculate about — or imagine — the rest.\"\n\n\"The New Yorker\"s Richard Brody called the film \"a moral failure\", saying: \"[Bigelow's] intentions come through clearly: to depict an incident—and a climate—of racism, to show that the cruelty of these deeds was multiplied by their ultimate impunity, and to suggest that, in the intervening half-century since the events depicted in the film took place, little has changed. Movies aren’t made with intentions, though; they’re made with people and with equipment, and what Bigelow has her actors do for the benefit of the camera is repellent to imagine.\"\n\nAccording to Melvin Dismukes, who is depicted prominently in the film, \"Detroit\" \"is 99.5% accurate as to what went down at the Algiers and in the city at the time.\" However, the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Bigelow does say there are moments of fiction, and Boal notes instances of 'pure screenwriting.' Some facts are contested within accounts; others were changed for the screen\" and then raised the question \"Does a disclaimer at the end sufficiently cover fictional manipulations in an ostensibly true story?\" Variety went so far as to state that Bigelow and Boal \"changed names [of characters] so as to enjoy other creative liberties in the storytelling.\" One such subject whose name was dropped in favor of a fictional one is lawyer Norman Lippitt (played in the film by actor John Krasinski under the name Auerbach).\n\nIn response to the historical criticism, Boal said, \"I employed poetic license, under a self-imposed rule to never stray from what I understood to be the underlying truth of a scene or an event. This script is built on a sturdy base of journalism and history, but it is not the same as journalism or history, nor does it aspire to be. As a screenwriter, I take the responsibility of being the creator of a tale, of transforming these raw materials into a drama.\"\n\n\n"}

She first became known for her candid memoir, \"\" (2005), and the blog that preceded it. Later, Cody achieved critical acclaim for her debut feature film script, \"Juno\" (2007), winning awards such as the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nShe is also known for creating, writing, and producing Showtime's television series \"United States of Tara\" (2009–2011) and for writing and producing the films \"Jennifer's Body\" (2009) and \"Young Adult\" (2011). For the latter, she received a second nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay. Her directorial debut, \"Paradise\", was released on October 18, 2013.\n\nCody and her older brother Marc were born and raised in Lemont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. She is the daughter of Pam and Greg Busey. Her mother is of Italian descent and her father is of British ancestry. Cody was raised Catholic and attended Benet Academy, a Roman Catholic school in Lisle, Illinois. She took the pen name Diablo Cody (\"diablo\" is Spanish for \"devil\") after repeatedly listening to the song \"El Diablo\" by Arcadia while passing through Cody, Wyoming. She graduated from the University of Iowa with a media studies degree. While at the University of Iowa, she worked in the acquisitions department in the main university library. Her first jobs were doing secretarial work at a Chicago law firm and later proofreading copy for advertisements that played on Twin Cities radio stations.\n\nCody began a parody blog called \"Red Secretary\", detailing the (fictional) exploits of a secretary living in Belarus. The events were thinly-veiled allegories for events that happened in Cody's real life, but told from the perspective of a disgruntled, English-idiom-challenged Eastern Bloc girl.\n\nHer first \"bona fide\" blog appeared under the nickname \"Darling Girl\" after she had moved from Chicago to Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nOn a whim, Cody signed up for amateur night at a Minneapolis strip club called the Skyway Lounge. Having enjoyed the experience, she eventually quit her day job to become a full-time stripper. Cody also spent time working peep shows at Sex World, a Minneapolis adult novelty and DVD store.\n\nWhile still stripping, Cody began writing for \"City Pages\", an alternative Twin Cities weekly newspaper. She left \"City Pages\" just before it changed editorial hands, and has since written for the now-defunct \"Jane\" magazine. In December 2007, Cody began writing a column for the magazine \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\nAt the age of 27, Cody wrote her memoir \"\". The memoir began after Mason Novick, who would soon become Cody's manager, showed interest in her sharp and sarcastic voice. Based on the popularity of her blog, \"The Pussy Ranch\", he was able to secure her a publishing contract with Gotham Books.\n\nAfter completion of her book, Cody was encouraged by Mason Novick to write her first screenplay. Within months she wrote \"Juno\", a coming-of-age story about a teenager's unplanned pregnancy. The Jason Reitman-directed comedy stars Ellen Page and Michael Cera.\n\nIn July 2007, Showtime announced that it would be producing a pilot of Cody's DreamWorks television series, \"United States of Tara\". Based on an idea by Steven Spielberg, \"Tara\" is a comedy about a mother with dissociative identity disorder, starring Toni Collette. The series began filming in Spring 2008, and premiered on January 18, 2009.\n\nIn October 2007, Cody sold a script titled \"Girly Style\" to Universal Studios, and a horror script called \"Jennifer's Body\" to Fox Atomic. Released on September 18, 2009, \"Jennifer's Body\" starred Megan Fox as the title character and Amanda Seyfried as the supporting character.

Best known for her contributions to music education through her energetic involvement with the Australian Music Examinations Board, Holland has in recent decades gained greater recognition as a composer. She is now regarded by some critics as one of the more significant Australian composers of her generation.\n\nDulcie Holland was born in Sydney in 1913. She began taking piano lessons at the age of six, and attended Shirley School for Girls, known for its academic excellence. In 1929 she entered the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music (now the Sydney Conservatorium) to continue her studies. At the Conservatorium she studied piano with Grace Middenway and Frank Hutchens, cello with Gladstone Bell, and composition with Roy Agnew and Alfred Hill, eventually completing both the Diploma course (DSCM) and the Licentiate of the Royal Schools of Music (LRSM) in 1933.\n\nIn 1936, Holland travelled to London to study composition at the Royal College of Music with John Ireland. At the end of her first year, she won the Blumenthal Scholarship for composition, which entitled her to another three years of study at the College. The following year she won the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, but with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, decided to return to Australia.\n\nSeveral years after the war, in 1951, she returned to the United Kingdom for a year to study serialism with Mátyás Seiber.\n\nAfter returning to Australia from the Royal College in 1939, Holland embarked on a career as a recitalist and freelance composer. In 1940 she married the Australian conductor Alan Bellhouse, with whom she would have two children. During the 1940s, in addition to her childrearing and composing, she wrote a number of children's books, under her married name of Dulcie Bellhouse. She also began to write music for the North Shore Symphony Orchestra (founded and conducted by her husband), an association that would continue for 25 years.\n\nIn the 1950s, Holland was commissioned to write musical scores for the Department of the Interior, which was then producing a number of documentary films about Australian life for the new wave of migrants entering the country. She eventually wrote the scores for forty of these films.\n\nIn 1967, Holland joined the Australian Music Examinations Board (AMEB) as an examiner. During her long association with the Board, her prolific output of musical studies and pieces for students at all levels of development, along with her authorship of numerous music theory books, were eventually to make her a familiar name in thousands of Australian households. Sales of her didactic writings made her Australia's most celebrated music author.\n\nAfter her retirement from AMEB in 1983, Holland continued to compose, but chose to focus more on the writing of music text books, on the ground that she believed \"making new converts to music\" to be more important than adding to the volume of existing music.\n\nIn 1977, she was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). In 1993, along with Miriam Hyde, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) by Macquarie University.\n\nThroughout the course of her seventy-year career, Holland produced a considerable body of serious (as opposed to educational) music. Her work includes orchestral pieces (including a symphony), vocal and choral works, a large output of chamber music featuring different combinations of instruments, and many pieces for piano and other solo performance. She wrote in both the contemporary and neo-classical genres.\n\nDulcie Holland has been described as \"less conservative and more appealing than many of her contemporaries\". Her music is generally \"melodic, optimistic and sunny\", and even her darker moods are \"reflective and lyrical\". She employs \"non-traditional key relationships and swiftly changing tonal centres\", and is \"fond of the pentatonic scale with its built-in ambiguities, and the possibilities thus given to modulate to unexpected keys\". Overall however, her music is said to convey a \"sense of balance, of confidence, of individuality [and] of formal structure\".\n\nIn addition to the symphony and string quartet, Holland's \"Piano Sonata\" has been called \"undoubtedly a landmark work in the Australian oeuvre\", while her 1944 \"Trio for Violin, Cello and Piano\" has been described as \"one of the greatest treasures of Australian music\". Reflecting Holland's difficulty in gaining recognition as a serious composer through much of her lifetime, the latter work did not receive its first public performance until 1991, 47 years after it was first written.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38907546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38907546", "title": "Fourth dimension in art", "text": "Fourth dimension in art\n\nNew possibilities opened up by the concept of four-dimensional space (and difficulties involved in trying to visualize it) helped inspire many modern artists in the first half of the twentieth century. Early Cubists, Surrealists, Futurists, and abstract artists took ideas from higher-dimensional mathematics and used them to radically advance their work.\n\nFrench mathematician Maurice Princet was known as \"le mathématicien du cubisme\" (\"the mathematician of cubism\"). An associate of the School of Paris, a group of avant-gardists including Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Jean Metzinger, and Marcel Duchamp, Princet is credited with introducing the work of Henri Poincaré and the concept of the \"fourth dimension\" to the cubists at the Bateau-Lavoir during the first decade of the 20th century.\n\nPrincet introduced Picasso to Esprit Jouffret's \"Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions\" (\"Elementary Treatise on the Geometry of Four Dimensions\", 1903), a popularization of Poincaré's \"Science and Hypothesis\" in which Jouffret described hypercubes and other complex polyhedra in four dimensions and projected them onto the two-dimensional page. Picasso's \"Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler\" in 1910 was an important work for the artist, who spent many months shaping it. The portrait bears similarities to Jouffret's work and shows a distinct movement away from the Proto-Cubist fauvism displayed in \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", to a more considered analysis of space and form.\n\nEarly cubist Max Weber wrote an article entitled \"In The Fourth Dimension from a Plastic Point of View\", for Alfred Stieglitz's July 1910 issue of \"Camera Work\". In the piece, Weber states, \"In plastic art, I believe, there is a fourth dimension which may be described as the consciousness of a great and overwhelming sense of space-magnitude in all directions at one time, and is brought into existence through the three known measurements.\"\n\nAnother influence on the School of Paris was that of Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, both painters and theoreticians. The first major treatise written on the subject of Cubism was their 1912 collaboration \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", which says that: \"If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidian mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.\"\n\nThe American modernist painter and photographer Morton Livingston Schamberg wrote in 1910 two letters to Walter Pach, parts of which were published in a review of the 1913 Armory Show for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", about the influence of the fourth dimension on avant-garde painting; describing how the artists' employed \"harmonic use of forms\" distinguishing between the \"representation or rendering of space and the designing in space\":\nIf we still further add to design in the third dimension, a consideration of weight, pressure, resistance, movement, as distinguished from motion, we arrive at what may legitimately be called design in the fourth dimension, or the harmonic use of what may arbitrarily be called volume. It is only at this point that we can appreciate the masterly productions of such a man as Cézanne.\n\nCézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired the Cubists to experiment with simultaneity, complex multiple views of the same subject, as observed from differing viewpoints at the same time.\n\nIn 1936 in Paris, Charles Tamkó Sirató published his \"Manifeste Dimensioniste\", which described how \n\nThe manifesto was signed by many prominent modern artists worldwide. Hans Arp, Francis Picabia, Kandinsky, Robert Delaunay and Marcel Duchamp amongst others added their names in Paris, then a short while later it was endorsed by artists abroad including László Moholy-Nagy, Joan Miró, David Kakabadze, Alexander Calder, and Ben Nicholson.\n\nIn 1953, the surrealist Salvador Dalí proclaimed his intention to paint \"an explosive, nuclear and hypercubic\" crucifixion scene. He said that, \"This picture will be the great metaphysical work of my summer\". Completed the next year, \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\" depicts Jesus Christ upon the net of a hypercube, also known as a tesseract. The unfolding of a tesseract into eight cubes is analogous to unfolding the sides of a cube into six squares. The Metropolitan Museum of Art describes the painting as a \"new interpretation of an oft-depicted subject. ..[showing] Christ's spiritual triumph over corporeal harm.\"\n\nSome of Piet Mondrian's (1872–1944) abstractions and his practice of Neoplasticism are said to be rooted in his view of a utopian universe, with perpendiculars visually extending into another dimension.\n\nThe fourth dimension has been the subject of numerous fictional stories.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26424489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26424489", "title": "G7 Method", "text": "G7 Method\n\nThe G7 Method is a printing procedure used for visually accurate color reproduction by putting emphasis on matching grayscale colorimetric measurements between processes. G7 stands for grayscale plus seven colors: the subtractive colors typically used in printing (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black) and the additive colors (Red, Green, and Blue). The method is used in many applications of printing such as offset lithography, flexography, and gravure since it uses a one-dimensional neutral print density curve (NPDC) to match neutral tonality between two G7 calibrated printing systems. The G7 method is not a completely accurate color management system nor is it officially standardized by the International Color Consortium (ICC).\n\nThe G7 method was created by Don Hutcheson, chairman of the IDEAlliance GRACoL (International Digital Enterprise Alliance, General Requirements for Applications in Commercial Offset Lithography) in 2006. It was created to solve the problem of computer to plate (CtP) printing systems and other devices printing images with different tonal value increases (TVIs), or dot gains. Also, professionals in the printing industry follow the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) principles of half-tone printing, called ISO 12647-2, which does not specify colorimetric values for gray balance and refers to multiple TVI curves. This results in an ambiguous definition of the print’s final ‘appearance’.\n\nThe G7 method solved this problem by creating Neutral Print Density Curves (NPDC) that related neutral density to the half-tone dot percentages of a print image rather than a TVI curve relating the input dot percentage to the output gain relative to the input percentage.\n\nTo calibrate a printing system with the G7 method, it basically entails comparing the NPDC generated by the device to the ‘ideal’ NPDC given in G7 specifications, calibrating the Raster Image Processor (RIP) or the driver of the device, and then repeating the NPDC comparison to check for accuracy. More specifically, one dimensional interpolation between the NPDC graph generated by the printer and the GRACoL 7 NPDC “FanGraph” must be done to generate new dot percentage aim values to be given to the device’s RIP or driver.\n\nThe G7 method's emphasis on grayscale calibration is loosely based around the concept of neutralizing the camera image of a scene using a gray card. This is done to lower the effects of lighting conditions, such as color temperature, on the resulting image. G7 takes this further by defining percentages of cyan, magenta, and yellow ink at which the image should be gray balanced. It also defines values for a* and b* for the Lab color space.\n\nMost printing systems use half-tones to generate images by using a series of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black dots to recreate colors. This is done by varying the size of the dots so that the human eye can spatially integrate the image's color and make it look like one uniform color.\n\nUsing the G7 method for printing calibration is a manual process and is device independent, meaning it can be used for any printing devices that allows manipulation of the raster image processor or computer to plate curve information that dictates how digital signals from an image is printed with ink.\n\nHowever, since the G7 method relies mostly on gray balance, if the image does not contain much gray information, the calibration can be inaccurate. Also, using any offset printing may be difficult to gray balance because it involves \"wet-trapping\" which can lead to unpredictable values for dark tones.\n\nIDEAlink Curve\nCalibration using the G7 method involves comparing two NPDCs from the G7 Fangraph to calculate new aim values that will be given to the printer's RIP files. This can be a manual process, but the IDEAlink curve software, created by IDEAlliance, does this automatically and with minimal error. Improvements to this program include Curve2 and Curve3. \"IDEAlink Curve 1.1 software is no longer commercially available\". See the list below for systems and software that have received G7 System Certification.\n\nIDEAlliance certifies systems and software that meet or exceed established industry tolerances for excellence and are capable of calibrating a printing device to meet the G7 grayscale definition using four 1-D curves. \n\nG7 Certified systems/software include the following:\n\nEFI Fiery Color Profile Suite\n\nFUJIFILM ColorPath™ Sync®\n\nHeidelberg Prinect® Color Toolbox \n\nCHROMiX/HutchColor Curve2™\n\nAlwan Dynamic Printer Calibration™\n\nKODAK ColorFlow\n\nColorGATE Productionserver / G7 Calibration Module\n\nKonica Minolta Color Care™ version 2.2.1 with CurveCore™ Module\n\nCHROMiX/HutchColor Curve3™\n\nBodoni Systems pressSIGN 6 & later | pressSIGN Standard | pressSIGN Pro | pressSIGN Global Print Management\n\nMutoh G7 Calibrator™ (part of the Mutoh ColorVerify Pro/G7 process control solution for large format inkjet printers) \"http://www.mutoh.com/smart-printing/color-verify\"\n\nCaldera Print Standard Verifier G7\n\nTucanna tCOLOR http://color.tucanna.com/\n\nIn addition to the above G7 certified products, ColorMetrix (http://www.colormetrix.com) offers a version of its ProofPass® cloud-based process control software bundled with G7 Calibrator™ under license from Mutoh in the US.\n\n"}

It was designed by Nyoman Nuarta and inaugurated in September 2018. The total height of the monument, including the 46-meter base pedestal is . The statue is about 30m higher than the Statue of Liberty, but Liberty is tall and thin, while Garuda is almost as wide as it is high — its wingspan is 64m. The statue was designed to be the Indonesia’s tallest statue, that was inspired by a Hindu myth about the search for Amrita (the elixir of life). According to this myth, Garuda agreed to be ridden by Vishnu in return for the right to use the elixir to liberate his enslaved mother. The monument was completed on 31 July 2018 and inaugurated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on 22 September, 2018.\nIt took twenty-eight years and around $100 million to build the statue. GWK was designed back in 1990 by Nyoman Nuarta under the auspices of then tourism minister Joop Ave,energy minister IB Sudjana and Bali governor IB Oka. The groundbreaking event of the statue’s construction took place 1997. In the late 1990s, the project was brought to a sudden halt by the combining force of the global economic crisis. The construction work resumed in 2013 after a sixteen year hiatus, when property developer PT. Alam Sutera Realty Tbk (ASR) agreed to financing the construction of the statue and the project.The idea for the monument was not without controversy; religious authorities on the island complained that its massive size might disrupt the spiritual balance of the island, and that its commercial nature was inappropriate, but some groups agree with the project, because it will be a new tourist attraction.\n\nThe statue was assembled in Bali from 754 discrete modules that were constructed in Bandung, West Java and then transported to the work site. The modules were cut into 1,500 smaller pieces to accommodate the cranes maximum load. The last piece that was placed onto the gigantic artwork was at its tail, which is located at the highest point of the statue. Garuda's shape is so complex that engineers have designed special joints in the supporting structure, with up to 11 enormous steel girders coming together at the same point, whereas normal construction joints have four or six girders. The Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue is designed to withstand storms and earthquakes, and expected to last for the next 100 years.\n\nThe completed monument is about as tall as a 21-storey building. It weighs 4000 tonnes, making it the heaviest statue in Indonesia. The artwork is made of copper and brass supported by 21,000 steel bars, and bolts of 170,000. The statue is made of copper and brass sheeting, with a stainless steel frame and skeleton, as well as a steel and concrete core column. The outer covering measures in area. The crown of Vishnu is covered with golden mosaics and the statue has a dedicated lighting arrangement. The sculpture sits atop a building base which will function as a restaurant, museum, and viewing gallery.\n"}

Kerameikos is located outside the Themistoclean Wall's Dipylon Gate. Stelai come in various shapes/designs and depict images varying from pottery to narrative scenes. They were often marble or limestone, and were carved or sculpted to depict the person being memorialized sometimes with relatives or slaves. Reliefs decorating the graves were meant to show the dead in their best light, using imagery to recognize their bravery in battle, or pathos, or wealth. These monuments marked the graves of Athenian men, fallen warriors, as well as non-citizens. Women were also included in Kerameikos but typically it was the wealthiest or prominent women who were given stele. In many vase paintings of grave scenes wreaths are seen resting at the base of stele. This was likely a popular way to adorn the graves of Greek loved ones.\n\nThe first steles were dated from the Early Bronze Age, around 2000 B.C. The use of steles as grave markers gained popularity in Kerameikos around the Protogeometric period c.a. 950 B.C.E. until they fell out of style around the 8th century C.E. The site was first excavated in 1870 by German archaeologists looking for grave-goods. Many of the fragments and inscriptions found in the present came from the remnants of the Themistoclean Walls, which were built after the Persian Wars, using any and all stone available. Many graves and buildings had been destroyed so they were used as building material.\n\nAthenians used Kerameikos for centuries to bury their dead. Over time different styles were introduced so there is a great variety of graves that came from Kerameikos. Notable styles found in Kerameikos include the naiskos stele, lekythos graves, and kore.\n\nGraves were inscribed with the name of the deceased and where they came from.\n\nSome steles at Kerameikos used a style known as naiskos (\"small temple\"), which looks like a temple with columns and a pediment at the top. This particular symbol of wealth gained popularity in the 5th century B.C. examples include the Grave Stele of Dexileos and the Grave Stele of Hegeso.\n\nAfter the Battle of Chairon and Thibrachos, Lacedaemonian soldiers of King Pausanias' army were buried at Kerameikos. The tomb was found marked by a marble plinth with Lacedaemonian inscriptions of the names of the men.\n\nThe Grave Stele of Hegeso is one of the best-preserved surviving attic stele and features a woman seated by her servant. This grave is a naiskos, meaning Hegeso was likely a prominent woman as this style signified wealth and importance.\n\nToday the Kerameikos grave monuments can be found at the Kerameikos Archaeological Museum where many of them are preserved and kept on display.\n"}

Plato said that lexis can be divided into mimesis (imitation properly speaking) and diegesis (simple narrative). Gerard Genette states: \"Plato's theoretical division, opposing the two pure and heterogeneous modes of narrative and imitation, within poetic diction, elicits and establishes a practical classification of genres, which includes the two distinct modes...and a mixed mode, for example the Iliad\".\nIn the \"Iliad\", a Greek epic written by Homer, the mixed mode is very prevalent. According to Gerald Prince, diegesis in the \"Iliad\" is the fictional storytelling associated with the fictional world and the enacting/re-telling of the story. Mimesis in the\" Iliad\" is the imitation of everyday, yet fantastical life in the ancient Greek world. Diegesis and mimesis combined represent the fullest extent of lexis; both forms of speech, narrating and re-enacting.\nIn conclusion, lexis is the larger overview of literature. Within lexis the two areas of differentiation of mimesis (imitation) are diegesis (narrative) and the \"direct representation of the actors speaking to the public.\"\n\nAccording to Jose M. Gonzalez, \"Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\" Pistis is the Greek word for faith and is one of the rhetorical modes of persuasion.\nGonzalez also points out that, \"By invoking phantasia, lexis against the background Aristotle instructs us to view of his psychology, as mediating the rhetorical task and entrusted with turning the orator's subject matter into such opinion of the listeners and gain their pistis.\" Phantasia is a Greek word meaning the process by which all images are presented to us. Aristotle defines phantasia as \"our desire for the mind to mediate anything not actually present to the senses with a mental image.\" Aristotle instructs the reader to use his or her imagination to create the fantastic, unordinary images, all the while using narrative and re-enactment to create a play either written or produced.\n\nAlthough Aristotle at times seems to demean the art of diction or 'voice,' saying that it is not an \"elevated subject of inquiry,\" he does go into quite a bit of detail on its importance and its proper use in rhetorical speech. Often calling it \"style,\" he defines good style as follows: that it must be clear and avoid extremes of baseness and loftiness. Aristotle makes the cases for the importance of diction by saying that, \"it is not enough to know what we ought to say; we must also say it as we ought.\". In an oratorical speech, one must consider not only the facts, but also how to put the facts into words and which words and, also, the \"proper method of delivery.\" Aristotle goes on to say that only the facts in an argument should be important but that since the listeners can be swayed by diction, it must also be considered. \nVoice \n\nAt the time when Aristotle wrote his treatise on Rhetoric, orators had not paid much attention to voice. They thought it was a subject only of concern to actors and poets. In \"The Rhetoric\", Aristotles says, \"proper method of delivery…affects the success of a speech greatly; but hitherto the subject has been neglected.\" Aristotle defined voice as controlling one's voice, using rate, volume and pitch, to convey the appropriate emotions. The manner of voice in which an idea or speech is conveyed affects not only the emotions of the audience but, also, their ability to understand this concept.\nAlthough Aristotle gives this mention and explanation of voice, he does not go into specifics about how to produce appropriate voice or how to convey specific tones with one's voice. This may or may not be due to his mild disdain for the topic as a whole. Modern scholars have explored voice more extensively. According to Taylor Stoehr, \"voice is the pervasive reflection in written or spoken language, of an author's character, the marks by which we recognize his utterance as his.\". However, just as in Aristotle's time set of specific rules or guidelines has yet been laid out for the production or interpretation of voice. Due to the vast array of elements involved in the production of voice this task would be nearly, if not entirely, impossible. \n\nLanguage\n\nAs mentioned before, Aristotle thought the language of a speech should avoid being too lofty or too crude. The speaker must use the ordinary language of everyday life. However, because people best remember what is out of the ordinary, the speaker must use some language that gives the speech an air of importance.\n\nThe elevation of the language must correlate to the elevation of the subject or, in poetry, the character that is speaking. In poetry, language and linguistic devices that convey a sense of importance are more appropriate, and should be used more often because the events of poetry are more removed from ordinary life. They are less appropriate in rhetorical speech because the topics relate more directly to ordinary things and the people who are listening to the speech. Most of all, the speaker must \"give the impression of speaking naturally and not artificially.\" When one seems to speak with ease, the audience is more easily persuaded that the facts he is communicating are truthful. \n\nAlso, a speaker must avoid using very many \"strange words, compound words, and invented words.\". Aristotle considered this kind of language an excessive departure from the way people normally speak. However, one acceptable departure from plain language is the use of metaphor because metaphors are used by all people in everyday conversation.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, lexis, meaning the delivery of words, is the least important area of speech when in comparison to invention, arrangement and style. However, lexis is still closely looked at and broken down into two forms. The two types of lexis in rhetoric include: \"lexis graphike\" and \"lexis agonistike\" The separate terms that describe the two forms of lexis, graphike and agonistike, have been conformed by several Latin terms. Although the words directly relate to the type of lexis, the theories of Aristotle and Plato do not compare.\n\n\"Lexis graphike\" comes from the term \"zographia\", meaning realistic painting, and graphe, meaning writing. Plato believes that writing and painting are one of the same. His theory proves that both do not have the capability to defend themselves through an argument, question and answer, which conveys that these forms can not prove truth. Although for Aristotle, \"lexis graphik\"e is the most accurate delivery of language, which leads to his theory that proves that writing does not need to be questioned because it is already exact. \"Lexis agonistike\" however is from the term \"skiagraphia\", meaning a rough sketch or outline of painting. Aristotle once again opposes Plato by believing that \"lexis agonistike\" does not need questions asked, but only answers. The answer refers to the use of invention given to the actor because the writing portion is only outlined.\n\nTo further understand the separate types of lexis, each type can be broken down by how the writing is prepared and delivered. \"Lexis graphike\" is the most precise style of rhetoric and strongly appeals to intelligence. The delivery of \"lexis graphike\" is designed for a careful reading from either the book or paper as opposed to a performance that leaves room for improvisation. This type of lexis is a simple, straight forward recitation rather than an elaborate presentation. \"Lexis graphike\" is most accurately written and depends the least upon the person who is delivering the speech. \"Lexis agonistike\" contradicts \"lexis graphike\" because it is typically carelessly written and meant for a full performance. The lack of attention given to the written words allows the performer to improvise. This gives the presentation a style that reflects the entertainer rather the writer.\n"}

She made her first appearance on 22 May 2006 and left in 2010. She is the daughter of Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Owen Turner (Lee Ross), and half-sister of Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin). The Fox family were introduced by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character of Libby was featured in a prominent storyline in 2006, when Owen attempts to murder her. The character then cultivates a relationship with her peer Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins). She is portrayed as intelligent and competitive. The character was axed in April 2010 and her departure episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Libby returned in May 2014 for Lucy Beale's (Hetti Bywater) funeral. Since then she continued to make various guest appearances up until 31 January 2017.\n\nLibby is Denise Fox (Diane Parish)'s second daughter. Libby secretly contacts her estranged father, Owen Turner (Lee Ross), an abusive alcoholic, and he starts making demands to see her. Denise is reluctant to allow this, but Owen seems to have changed, and Libby is keen for her parents to get back together; Denise is swayed and sleeps with Owen. However, as soon as Owen begins drinking again, he becomes abusive and hits her. He is arrested, but Libby persuades Denise to give a glowing character witness statement and he is released. Owen kidnaps Libby and takes her to Epping Forest. He drugs her and tries to kill her and himself by filling the car with noxious exhaust fumes. She escapes, but he catches her and tries to drown her in a stream. Denise arrives to find Libby unconscious on the bank. She is taken to hospital and makes a full recovery. Owen is imprisoned.\n\nLibby gets involved in various scams with her friend Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins). She develops a crush on Gus Smith (Mohammed George), but is too young to be noticed by him, so she begins using an internet chat room, talking to a stranger named \"Einstein27\". She refuses to listen to Yolande Trueman's (Angela Wynter) concerns about the dangers of meeting someone online and agrees to meet him in person. When she meets the stranger, she discovers that she was chatting to Darren all along. He admits to liking Libby. She is initially unimpressed, but after Yolande arranges a meal between them, they decide to start a relationship. A few weeks later Darren visits his family in the Cotswolds, and Libby is heartbroken to discover he has decided not to return. She concentrates on her school work and achieves eleven good GCSE grades.\n\nDarren returns some weeks later but Libby avoids him. When she finally plucks up the courage to see him, she hears him talking about someone called Clara. Thinking he has found someone new, she pretends she is going out with Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). It turns out Clara is a dog and the pair get back together. Libby and Darren have an anniversary dinner to celebrate a year of dating. However, Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) reveals that Darren frequently looks at pornography. Libby becomes furious and confides in Tamwar with whom she is in the process of starting a home tutoring business. Darren becomes jealous, but eventually reconciles with Libby and begins thinking about starting a sexual relationship with Libby. He invites her round to do this, however Jay ruins the night by telling Libby that Darren told him that she was a virgin. Libby is devastated, but she eventually comes round and she and Darren decide not to rush things.\n\nLibby achieves A grades in her AS Level exams, leading Denise to declare that she will be applying for Oxford or Cambridge University. Libby worries her mother cannot afford to send her there. She later finds out she has conditionally been accepted at Oxford. Libby turns eighteen and Owen, who is still in prison, contacts her by sending her a birthday card and asking Libby's grandmother, Liz Turner (Kate Williams), to arrange a meeting. At the same time, Libby decides it is the right time for her to lose her virginity with Darren. She then phones her grandmother and agrees to meet with her father. Chelsea returns for Libby's birthday and sees Liz in the Square. Libby is forced to reveal that she visited Owen and that he will be released in a matter of months. Denise visits him but then tells Libby he will not be returning to their lives. Libby discovers she will attend Oxford University when she gets the A Level grades she needs but decides against it, saying her mother needs her in Walford. She later changes her mind, and leaves for Oxford early in October. Adam Best (David Proud), an Oxford student who has taken a liking to her, sends her a text message saying \"See you in Oxford. X\".\n\nWhen Owen is released from prison, he returns to Walford to see Libby, although he is not supposed to. Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker) discovers this and threatens to call the police, but instead he contacts Libby, who comes straight to Walford from Oxford to see her father. She overhears Darren booking a table for two in a restaurant and suspects he is meeting another woman. She turns up at the restaurant and finds Darren there with Owen. Darren says he wanted to ask Owen's permission to ask Libby to marry him. Libby accepts his proposal. When Lucas, Denise's boyfriend and Chelsea's father, has Owen arrested for breaching his bail conditions, Libby at first doesn't believe Owen's claims but is shocked when Lucas confesses. Though angry with Lucas at first she eventually forgives him. Libby makes her dad promise to leave Denise and Lucas alone. The day before the wedding, Owen crashes Denise's hen night to warn her that Lucas killed his ex-wife Trina Johnson (Sharon Duncan Brewster) and she is in danger.\n\nBoth Denise and Libby are angry with Owen. Owen is heartbroken and prepared to leave until Chelsea tells him about the bracelet. Unknown to everyone but Lucas, Owen hides in Phil's Jaguar and confronts Lucas about his crime, leading to Lucas strangling him to death and burying him in the gardens in Albert Square. Libby feels a bit guilty about parting on bad terms with her father but Liz reassures her. Darren receives a card from Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), which Libby opens and finds cash inside. Libby asks him about it and he says before Christmas he found Heather crying because she could not afford to buy any presents for her baby son George (Joshua Jacobs) and he felt sorry for her. Libby calls him a softie, but later overhears Heather and her friend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) discussing Darren and the paternity of the baby. Libby reveals that Darren is George's father in front of everyone at Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) and Amira Shah's (Preeya Kalidas) wedding.\n\nDarren tries to speak to Libby but Chelsea will not let him in. He continues to bang on the door while Denise tells Libby that she could go back to Oxford early and it is time to move on. Libby eventually talks to Darren, who explains why he slept with Heather and what happened between them. Libby then talks to Heather who says it was her fault it happened and she did not say anything as she did not want to hurt Libby. Libby then decides to leave and Darren stops her at the tube station and tells her how much he loves her, but she goes anyway. She returns from Oxford and tells her family she is now dating Adam, though Adam tells Darren that Libby she makes up for her lack of good looks by being good in bed. On hearing that Owen has supposedly sent flowers to Liz, Libby wonders why he won't get in touch with her. She steals some CCTV footage from the florists and is shocked to see Lucas ordering a huge bunch of lilies. Lucas explains to Libby that he sent Liz the flowers to buy Owen time because he is drinking again. Libby accepts this and hugs Lucas.\n\nLibby goes back to university but returns when she learns that Jordan is in a coma. She hears Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) confess in the middle of the cafe that he hit Jordan with a spanner and tells Lucas this. Lucas locks himself in the community centre and breaks down, blaming Jordan's condition on his own actions. Libby is worried about Lucas's state of mind and tries to coax him to come out. When she threatens to call the police, Lucas finally unlocks the doors. Lucas goes to the hospital and finds Jordan has been awoken from his coma and is safe. Libby tells Chelsea and Denise about Lucas's breakdown. Chelsea accuses her of making a mountain out of a molehill, Denise however listens intently.\n\nLibby is devastated to learn that a body discovered buried in the Square is that of her father. After speaking to Liz, Libby disowns her as she called the police to say she thought Denise was capable of murdering Owen, and she was taken away for questioning. When Adam brings Libby flowers and says Owen must have been murdered for a reason, Libby shouts at him for patronizing her. Chelsea tells Libby that Lucas found Trina's bracelet in Denise's bag after she died, leading them to believe that Denise may have killed both Trina and Owen. They see Denise driving away from the Square alone, and receive a text message from her saying \"I'm sorry\". In reality, Lucas had killed Owen and confessed to Denise, taken her to a canal and strangled her, sending the text message before throwing the phone in the canal. Libby is the only person who believes that there is no way Denise could have done this and says that \"sorry\" could mean anything. However, the police tell the family that Denise's car has been found by the canal, before a body is pulled from the water. Libby vows to carry on as normal, but says that this is not like Denise. The police arrive and say they have found a body in the canal along with Denise's mobile. Libby and Patrick comfort each other while Lucas and Chelsea go to the mortuary, where Lucas identifies the body as Denise.\n\nLibby discovers that Adam has been blackmailing Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield) for sex, and dumps him after slapping him across the face, leading to him leaving Walford. She feels let down by Patrick when he does not write a eulogy for Denise, and then asks the family to leave after Denise's funeral, however, Lucas convinces him to change his mind. On the day of Denise's funeral, Libby again questions who she was. Libby is happy when Patrick gives a eulogy to Denise, but is upset when an argument starts between Liz and Denises's sisters Kim (Tameka Empson) and Daphne (Emi Wokoma). Patrick reveals that the girls can continue to stay with him and Chelsea and Libby agree to start packing up Denise's belongings. While celebrating Libby's birthday, Denise walks in, revealing that she is not dead but that Lucas has been keeping her prisoner, and that he was the one who killed Trina and Owen. Lucas enters and confirms this, and takes the family hostage, but when Jordan arrives, they escape and Lucas is arrested. Denise is taken to hospital, and Libby has to go through the pain of attending her father's funeral. Chelsea then decides she wants to move to Spain with Liz, so Libby arranges to take time off from university to help with her mother at home. Denise disapproves of this, and arranges for Libby to go to Spain for a holiday with Chelsea and her grandmother, before returning permanently to Oxford. After tearfully saying goodbye to her family, the taxi is stopped by Darren who is upset that Libby is leaving without saying goodbye to him. Libby says that she has always loved him and that he will always be her best friend, before she leaves Walford. Darren moves away from Walford in 2011, following his break-up with Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington) and opts to stay with Libby in Oxford. A few months later, Jodie also moves to Oxford to be with Darren.\n\nDenise visits Libby at Oxford and she is concerned, as Denise does not like talking about her home life. Later on, Libby calmly confronts Denise, who reveals to a stunned Libby that she does not want to marry her fiancé, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Denise later rings Libby, telling her that she will end her relationship with Ian the following day. However, Ian's daughter and Libby's old friend, Lucy (now Hetti Bywater), dies in mysterious circumstances (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?) that night and after hearing about her death, Libby sends her condolences to Ian, via a text message to Denise. Libby returns to Walford a few weeks later, in order to attend Lucy's funeral. She is unhappy when she witnesses how Ian treats Denise and urges her mother to call things off with him. After staying the night at Patrick's, Libby asks Denise to go to Spain, with her for Chelsea's birthday. Denise is unsure, but Ian encourages her to go, admitting that he has taken her for granted. Denise and Libby then depart in a taxi.\n\nLibby returns for her 24th birthday to find Denise arguing with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) over the preparation of food for the party. Libby opens her presents then receives a secret phone call from Chelsea, and she promises to tell Denise something when she finds the right time. However, Libby cannot bring herself to tell Denise and later calls Chelsea to tell her this. Libby then leaves and returns to Oxford. She returns again in December 2015 for the housewarming party of Kim and her husband Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), where she reveals to Denise about how troublesome Jordan has become and how he caused trouble for her and Chelsea in Spain.\n\nLibby returns again for Mother's Day and goes for a family dinner, where later she finds a note Denise put there saying that Lucas plans to escape prison. Libby leaves and tells Masood, who advises her to call the police and he helps her get into Denise's house, which has been locked by Jordan (now Joivan Wade), who is helping Lucas escape. Libby witnesses Jordan raging at Denise and reveals that she has reported him to the police. Jordan becomes angry with Denise and Libby and is arrested. Libby then returns to Oxford after saying goodbye to Denise and Patrick.\n\nIn April 2016, Libby returns upset, and tells Denise she is pregnant. Denise is overjoyed but Libby says she is having an abortion and has already taken the first of two abortion pills. Denise is against this and she gets very drunk, with only Kim supporting Libby's decision. The following day, as Libby returns to the abortion clinic to terminate her pregnancy, a hungover Denise arrives to support her alongside Kim. She then thanks Denise for being a good mother to her before leaving again. Libby returns in November after Kim calls her and is shocked to see that Denise is seven months pregnant. She vows to remain in Walford and help Denise with the birth. Denise is frustrated when Libby insists that Denise should eat only vegan food. After Denise is suspended from her job, Libby helps her get it back by threatening legal action. However, Denise tells Libby that she should not be sacrificing her life in Oxford for her, so after sharing an emotional farewell with Denise, Libby departs. Libby returns with Kim and her grandmother, Emerald Fox (Doña Croll), for the birth of her half-brother. Libby is shocked when she learns Denise is having her son adopted, but respects her decision.\n\nIn September 2018, it is mentioned that Libby is the only student from Walford High to ever attend Oxbridge.\n\nEarly in Spring 2006, an official BBC press report announced the introduction of a new, all female family joining \"EastEnders\", Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and her two daughters Chelsea (Tiana Benjamin) and Libby (nicknamed Squiggle), cast to Belinda Owusu, who was 16 at the time. Benjamin has revealed that she was the second Fox to be cast, and on her final audition, she had a workshop and met Diane Parish there. Owusu was cast at a later date. Tiana Benjamin who plays Chelsea has said that the three actors who play the Fox family have a bond, commenting \"We all respect and understand each other, and manage to have a good time while we're filming too. I felt that we clicked from our first few scenes together.\"\n\nDescribed as \"the feisty Fox family\", the characters first appeared on-screen in May 2006. An insider reportedly said to the \"Sunday Mirror\", \"They'll arrive in Albert Square with a bang and they'll cause friction from the off. The Fox girls don't take any nonsense -they'll be a force to be reckoned with.\" The newspaper described the character of Libby as a superbrat and teenage troublemaker. Owusu commented, \"Squiggle is going to cause lots of mischief.\"\n\nIn April 2010 it was announced that the character had been axed along with five others by the new executive producer Bryan Kirkwood as part of a plan to \"breathe new life into the show\". Speaking of her departure, Owusu said: \"I've had a great time playing Libby but I agree with Bryan that after four years of great storylines, it is now time for Libby to move on. \"EastEnders\" was my first real job and I have learnt so much but I am now really looking forward to trying new roles.\" Her final episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010.\n\nIn March 2014, it was announced that Owusu had agreed to reprise the role of Libby Fox for number of episodes from April 2014, as part of the \"Who Killed Lucy Beale?\" storyline. She made her on-screen return on 18 April 2014. It was again announced in July 2015 that Libby would return again for a two episode guest stint. Speaking of her return, Owusu said: \"It's great to be back again! I'm always excited to see how Libby has grown and be back with the Fox family!\" Libby appeared on 3 and 4 August 2015. Libby has since returned over various guest stints: on 11 December 2015, four episodes from 7 to 10 March 2016, four episodes from 22 to 27 April 2016, five episodes from 7 to 17 November 2016 and for a guest stint from 23 December 2016.\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that Cambridge University wanted to shed its \"elitist\" image. Cambridge University allegedly approached the producers of Britain's three leading soaps, \"EastEnders\", \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\", asking them to include the university in their storylines. Spokesman Greg Hayman said the idea was part of a bid to correct the perception that Cambridge was \"not for young people from ordinary backgrounds.\" He added, \"We're very keen to attract the brightest and best students regardless of their background. One of the better ways of communicating directly with potential students is to talk to them through the soaps and other programs they watch.\" This move followed government pressure for the university to become more inclusive and to target all economic backgrounds. 90% of British students attend state secondary schools; Oxford and a Cambridge Universities draw about half their student body from state schools. It was reported that working-class individuals view attending Oxford or Cambridge as an impossible dream, which university officials claim is unfair and they are hoping to dispel this by featuring the Universities in working-class soaps such as \"EastEnders\". Hayman said there have been no firm commitments from TV producers, although one crew was planning an exploratory visit to Cambridge; however, he stated that he was happy with the plot running in \"EastEnders\" that showed \"working-class teenagers Tamwar Masood and Libby Fox considering applying to Cambridge and Oxford, to the delight of their ambitious mothers\", saying that \"It's a very happy coincidence.\" Oxford University said it had no plans to write to the soaps for inclusion but a spokesperson claimed, \"I did speak to somebody at \"EastEnders\" about our bursary scheme in case the storyline was going to continue. We wanted to make sure they knew what kind of assistance might be available to someone like Libby.\" \"EastEnders\" refused to comment on whether the universities would be featured at the time, as Tamwar and Libby still had another year left at college \"and it was too early to say whether the Oxford-Cambridge plot would continue.\"\n\nReporting on the University storyline, \"The Guardian\" noted that Libby and Tamwar applying to Oxford and Cambridge could be the universities' \"dream storyline\", as it showed that \"clever state school kids can get a place.\" However, the reporter added that \"it could also be their worst nightmare. Young Libby is already revealing concerns that she might not be able to afford to go to the university.\" The paper alleged that both universities' press offices \"fired off letters to the script editors: did they know about the generous bursaries and seemingly bottomless pit of cash available to help students from low-income homes stay on their courses? Could that be mentioned?\".\n"}

{"id": "288471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288471", "title": "Mordant", "text": "Mordant\n\nA mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set (i.e. bind) dyes on fabrics by forming a coordination complex with the dye, which then attaches to the fabric (or tissue). It may be used for dyeing fabrics or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. As applied to textiles, mordants are mainly of historical interest because the use of mordant dyes was largely displaced by directs. \n\nThe term mordant comes from the Latin \"mordere\", \"to bite\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion, often chromium(III). The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline.\n\nMordants include tannic acid, alum, chrome alum, sodium chloride, and certain salts of aluminium, chromium, copper, iron, iodine, potassium, sodium, tungsten, and tin. KAl(SO4)2 12 H2O\n\nIodine is often referred to as a mordant in Gram stains, but is in fact a trapping agent.\n\nThe three methods used for mordanting are:\n\nThe type of mordant used affects the shade obtained after dyeing and also affects the fastness property of the dye. The application of mordant, either pre-mordant, meta-mordant or post-mordant methods, is influenced by:\n\n\nDye results can also rely on the mordant chosen as the introduction of the mordant into the dye will have a marked effect on the final color. Each dye can have different reactions to each mordant. For example, cochineal scarlet, or Dutch scarlet as it came to be known, used cochineal along with a tin mordant to create a brilliant orange-hued red. \n\nResidual iron mordant can damage or fade fabric, producing \"dye rot\".\n\nThe dye lake is an insoluble complex formed upon combining the dye and mordant, which then attaches to the substrate. Mordants increase the fastness of the dye since the higher molecular weight dye is now bonded to the fibre.\n\nThe type of mordant used can change the colour of both the dye-plus-mordant solution and influence the shade of the final product.\n\nUnlike cotton, wool is highly receptive toward mordants. Due to its amphoteric nature wool can absorb acids and bases with equal efficiency. When wool is treated with a metallic salt it hydrolyses the salt into an acidic and basic component. The basic component is absorbed at –COOH group and the acidic component is removed during washing. Wool also has a tendency to absorb fine precipitates from solutions; these cling to the surface of fibres and dye particles attached to these contaminants result in poor rubbing fastness.\nLike wool, silk is also amphoteric and can absorb both acids and bases. However, wool has thio groups (-SH) from the cystine amino acid, which act as reducing agent and can reduce hexavalent chromium of potassium dichromate to trivalent form. The trivalent chromium forms the complex with the fibre and dye. Therefore, potassium dichromate cannot be used effectively as mordant.\n\nIn histology, mordants are indispensable in fixing dyes to tissues for microscopic examination.\n\nMethods for mordant application depend on the desired stain and tissues under study; pre-, meta- and post-mordanting techniques are used as required.\n\nThe most commonly used stain used in diagnostic histology of animal tissues is Harris' haematoxylin as part of a haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain.\n\n\n"}

Eliot from Shakespeare, Whitman and Baudelaire, all in ways that would infringe today's bloated copyright.\"\nParaphrase may apply to music as well as to writing. It was commonplace for Baroque, Classical and Romantic composers to create variations on each other's work without permission. This would not be allowed today.\n\nCopyright protection in Britain dates back to the 1556 Charter of the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers.\nThe Licensing of the Press Act 1662 gave publishers exclusive printing rights, but did not give any rights to authors.\nParliament failed to renew the act in 1694, primarily to remove monopoly and encourage a free press.\nThe Statute of Anne in 1710 prescribed a copyright term of fourteen years, and let the author renew for another fourteen years, after which the work went into the public domain.\nOver the years, additional acts and case law steadily refined the definitions of what could be protected, including derivative works, and the degree of protection given.\n\nThe Soviet Union's Copyright Act of 1925 in essence said that a work created by a minimal paraphrase of an existing text could be considered a new work eligible for copyright.\nBy 1991, the Copyright law of the Soviet Union had evolved to give much more protection to the author.\nFree use, similar to the English common law concept of fair use, was only allowed if it did not infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author.\n\nMoral rights are rights of creators of copyrighted works that are generally recognized in civil law jurisdictions and, to a lesser extent, in some common law jurisdictions. \nThey include the right of attribution and the right to the integrity of the work, which bars the work from alteration, distortion, or mutilation without the author's permission. Paraphrasing without permission may be seen as violating moral rights. \nMoral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. \nEven if the author has assigned their copyright to a third party, they still maintain the moral rights to the work.\nMoral rights were first recognized in France and Germany.\nThey were included in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1928.\nWhile the United States became a signatory to the Berne convention in 1989, it does not completely recognize moral rights as part of copyright law, which is seen as protecting commercial rights in intellectual property, but as part of other bodies of law such as defamation or unfair competition which protect the reputation of the author.\n\nEdward Gibbon published the last three volumes of his masterpiece \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" in 1788, at a time when both copyright and moral rights were poorly enforced.\nWith a small private income, he was not dependent on sales but was more concerned about the damage to his reputation from poor translations, a form of paraphrasing.\nHe wrote, \"The French, Italian and German translations have been executed with various success; but instead of patronizing, I should willingly suppress such imperfect copes which injure the character while they propagate the name of the author. The Irish pirates are at once my friends and my enemies...\"\n\nBy the start of the twentieth century, U.S. decisions on unfair competition found that representing as the author's work a version of the work that substantially departed from the original was a cause of action.\nSection §43(a) of the Lanham Act, which protects brands and trademarks, also provides similar protection to laws based on moral rights.\nFor any goods or services, it bans false designation of origin or a false description or representation.\nIn \"Gilliam v. American Broadcasting\" the British comedy group called \"Monty Python\" took action against the ABC network for broadcasting versions of their programs which had been correctly attributed to them but had been extensively edited, in part to remove content that their audience might consider offensive or obscene. \nThe judgement of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was in favor of \"Monty Python\", finding the cuts might be an \"actionable mutilation\" that violated the Lanham Act.\n\nIn the United States, copyright was covered by common law until it was formalized in the Copyright Act of 1976.\nSection §107 of this act set out four \"fair use\" principles to be used in evaluating whether copyright had been infringed:\n\nThese principles apply both to literal copies and to paraphrases.\nJudges are required to consider these factors, but may also take others into consideration, and may choose what weight they apply to each factor.\nAccording to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp\" (1977), \"The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of a copyright holder with the public's interest in dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as art, science and industry.\"\nClaims of fair use in copying or paraphrasing are more likely to succeed when the work being copied is factual. \nIn \"Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises\" the Supreme Court of the United States said, \"the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy.\"\nHowever, the court went on to quote Gorman, \"Fact or Fancy? The Implications for Copyright\" (1982) which said, \"[E]ven within the field of fact works, there are gradations as to the relative proportion of fact and fancy. One may move from sparsely embellished maps and directories to elegantly written biography. The extent to which one must permit expressive language to be copied, in order to assure dissemination of the underlying facts, will thus vary from case to case.\"\nUse of a work for critical commentary is generally considered fair, as long as the commentary is indeed about the substance or style of the original work.\nParody may be seen as a form of commentary, and to be effective must copy or paraphrase many of the elements of creative expression in the work being parodied.\nAlthough courts have differed in the past about how closely a parody can copy an original work, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" (1994) ruled strongly: \"[P]arody has an obvious claim to transformative value... Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, it can provide social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and in the process, creating a new one. We thus line up with the courts that have held the parody, like other comment or criticism, may claim fair use under §107.\"\n\nUnpublished works have special status under both moral rights and copyright, since the author or copyright owner has the right to control first publication.\nPublication of an excerpt or paraphrase of an unpublished work may infringe that right.\nAn author wishing to quote or even loosely paraphrase an unpublished work in France can only do so with permission from the author.\nIn \"Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises\" (1985) the United States Supreme Court held that \"under ordinary circumstances, the author's right to control the first public appearance of his undisseminated expression will outweigh a claim of fair use.\"\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"Salinger v. Random House\", which concerned a biography in which a number of unpublished letters by the subject had been paraphrased, similarly concluded that the copyright owner's right to control publication took precedence over \"fair use\", so even limited paraphrasing was unacceptable.\nThis drew support from those concerned with the rights of an individual to privacy and criticism from those more interested in the public \"right to know.\"\nIn 1992 the Copyright Act was amended as a result of the \"Salinger\" case to include a sentence at the end of §107 saying that the fact that a work is unpublished \"shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration\" of all four fair-use factors.\n\nA paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. Equivalent concepts apply to images or music.\nIn most countries, copyright applies to the original expression in a work rather than to the meanings or ideas being expressed.\nA loose paraphrase of a portion of a work may therefore be published without violating copyright.\nIf the paraphrase is so different that the expression in the derivative work has no similarity to that of the prior work, there is no infringement. \nIn \"See v. Durang\" (1983) the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found \"Copying deleted or so disguised as to be unrecognizable is not copying.\"\nBut courts have struggled to find a clear method of comparing a paraphrase or derivative to a prior work to determine whether the copyright in the original expression has been infringed.\nPhilosophically, there is disagreement about the distinction between thought and language.\nIn the past it was often thought that the two could not be separated, and so a paraphrase could never exactly reproduce a thought expressed in different words. \nAt the opposite extreme is the view that concepts and language are completely independent, so there is always a range of ways in which a concept can be expressed.\nCopyright law in common law countries tries to avoid theoretical discussion of the nature of ideas and expression such as this, taking a more pragmatic view of what is called the idea/expression dichotomy.\nIn \"Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation\" (1930), Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit gave an explanation of the dichotomy that has often been cited by courts hearing copyright cases, and that illustrates the inherent subjectivity of any decision.\nHe said:\nThe plaintiff in a copyright case must show that there is \"substantial similarity\" between the alleged copy and the prior work. \nIn \"Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co\" (1970) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit introduced the concept of \"total concept and feel\", holding that a work could be made up of elements that could not be copyrighted, but that the total concept and feel could be subject to copyright, and would be considered to be infringed if a normal reasonable person would consider that a disputed work was a copy of a prior work.\nThis concept has been used in later cases such as \"Reyher v. Children's Television Workshop\" (1976), where two works derived from the same folk tale had similar plots.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that there had not been copying, since the different versions were very different in style and in detail, saying \"the essence of infringement lies in taking not a general theme but its particular expression through similarities of treatment, details, scenes, events and characterization.\"\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in \"Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.\" (1977) refined the concept by establishing a two-stage comparison.\nAn extrinsic test would determine similarity of general ideas, while an intrinsic test would compare the particular expressions used.\nExtrinsic similarity means that two works are substantially similar in their general ideas, which can be determined objectively by an expert.\nIntrinsic similarity means they are substantially similar in their forms of expression, and this is the more subjective test.\nThe second test should be made by an \"ordinary reasonable person\" rather than an expert.\nBoth must be true for an infringement to exist.\n\nThe ideas or facts in a work are not subject to copyright protection, but the \"protected expression\" is.\nA paraphrase of a work may infringe on copyright if the \"protected expression\" in the paraphrase is similar to that in the prior work.\nMany court cases have hinged on how \"protected expression\" is defined and how similarity is determined.\n\nOne of the earliest cases was \"Baker v. Selden\" (1879). Charles Selden had developed a new system of bookkeeping and in 1865 published a short book that described his system, with sample forms. W.C.M. Baker, who had seen Selden's book, published a similar book in 1867 describing an improved version of the system. A suit claiming copyright infringement went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1879. \nThe Supreme court found that Selden's idea could not be protected since there was no patent, but his description or explanation of the system was protected by copyright law, and found that Baker's book was \"in large and material part identical with and infringements of the books of Selden system.\"\nThe arguments and ruling differ from modern law in that there was no discussion of the expression, only of the close similarities in the ideas given in the two books.\n\nIn \"Nutt v. National Institute Inc.\" (1929), Nutt was prohibited from delivering in public and for profit lectures that were similar to lectures whose copyright was held by the National Institute for the Improvement of Memory.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case found that the protected expression is more than the literal words but also includes the \"association, presentation, and combination of the ideas and thought which go to make up the [author's] literary composition.\"\nThe court said \"The infringement need not be a complete or exact copy. Paraphrasing or copying with evasion is an infringement, even though there may be little or no conceivable identity between the two.\"\n\nWainwright Securities was engaged in preparing in-depth analyses of public companies, and selling them to major investors. The Wall Street Transcript Corporation, publisher of the \"Transcript\" magazine, began to publish abstracts of the Wainwright reports.\nIn \"Wainwright Securities v. Wall Street Transcript Corp\" (1977) the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted that \"news events\" cannot be copyrighted, but found that \"the Transcript appropriated almost verbatim the most creative and original aspects of the reports, the financial analyses and predictions.\"\nThe court said, \"What is protected is the manner of expression, the author's analysis or interpretation of events, the way he structures his material and marshals facts, his choice of words and the emphasis he gives to particular developments.\"\nAn example of very close paraphrasing in this case was:\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in \"Salinger v. Random House\" (1987) found that an unauthorized biography by Ian Hamilton had infringed copyright with paraphrases of passages from unpublished letters written by the subject, the well-known novelist J. D. Salinger. As an example, the court cited:\nDespite differences in wording and sentence structure, the court found this to be a close paraphrase of a highly original expression.\nIn this case, the close paraphrasing was considered to contribute to the \"amount and substantiality\" of the material that had been copied - that is, paraphrasing is a form of copying.\nThe court also found that Hamilton's practice of including phrases like \"Salinger says,\" or \"he said\" within his paraphrase could give readers of the biography the false impression that they had read Salinger's own words. They might therefore decide not to buy a collection of the original letters. The court found that this meant there would be a financial impact.\nThe court barred publication.\n\nThe case of \"Wright v. Warner Books\" (1991) was superficially similar to \"Salinger\".\nMargaret Walker wrote an unauthorized biography of Richard Wright, best known for his books \"Native Son\" and \"Black Boy\", \nin which she made \"sparing use\" of excerpts from the subject's unpublished letters and journals.\nEllen Wright, Richard Wright's widow, sued the author and Warner Books, the publisher.\nIn one example, the book paraphrased as follows from an unpublished letter that Wright had written:\nDespite the apparent similarity, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that copyright had not been infringed.\nThe paraphrasing was just \"straightforward and factual reportage\" of the \"most basic and banal factual matter.\"\n\nThere are cases where there is very little choice about how to express some fact or idea, so a copy or close paraphrase may be unavoidable.\nIn this case, the \"merger doctrine\" comes into play.\nThe fact or idea and the expression are seen as merged, and the expression cannot be protected.\nThe merger doctrine is typically applied only to factual information or scientific theories, not to imaginative works such as plays or novels where the author has a much broader choice of expression.\nThe merger doctrine has been applied to the user interface design of computer software, where similarity between icons used by two different programs is acceptable if only a very limited number of icons would be recognizable by users, such as an image looking like a page to represent a document.\nHowever, in 1994 a U.K. judge in \"Ibcos Computers v. Barclays Mercantile Finance\" cast doubt on the merger doctrine, saying he was not comfortable with the idea that \"if there is only one way of expressing an idea that way is not the subject of copyright.\"\n\nThe term \"Scenes a faire\" means \"obligatory scene\", a scene in a play that the audience \"has been permitted to foresee and to desire from the progress of the action; and such a scene can never be omitted without a consequent dissatisfaction.\" The term was applied to copyright law in \"Cain v. Universal Pictures\" (1942), where the United States District Court for the Southern District of California ruled that \"... similarities and incidental details necessary to the environment or setting of an action are not the material of which copyrightable originality consists.\"\nThe concept has been used by U.S. and U.K. courts.\nThe term is used both in the sense of a scene that follows inevitably from a situation,\nor a standard scene that is always included in a particular genre of work.\nAnother court said \"Under the ... doctrine of \"scènes à faire\", courts will not protect a copyrighted work from infringement if the expression embodied in the work necessarily flows from a commonplace idea.\"\nThe concept has been extended to computer software, where some aspects may be dictated by the problem to be solved, or may be standard programming techniques.\n\nPublishers may formally allow limited quotation but prohibit paraphrasing, since they do not want readers to mistake the paraphrase for the original work.\nIn this case they would prohibit alteration of the work in their permission agreement. \nAlthough paraphrasing may be considered fair use under copyright law it may be considered breach of contract when the author of the paraphrase has implicitly or explicitly accepted a permission agreement.\n\nJudge Richard Posner has argued in his blog in favor of laws that require online sites to obtain permission from the copyright holder before linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials from newspapers. His concern is that existing laws based on fair use may not provide sufficient protection to the newspapers, who are paying for expensive news collection while the websites essentially get a free ride. Without greater protection, Judge Posner considers that the result of widespread paraphrasing of newspapers on internet sites could be a drastic reduction in the number of news-gathering sources.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "969793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=969793", "title": "Polychrome", "text": "Polychrome\n\nPolychrome is the \"'practice of decorating architectural elements, sculpture, etc., in a variety of colors.\" The term is used to refer to certain styles of architecture, pottery or sculpture in multiple colors. \n\nSome very early polychrome pottery has been excavated on Minoan Crete such as at the Bronze Age site of Phaistos. In ancient Greece sculptures were painted in strong colors. The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone. But it could cover sculptures in their totality. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. For example, the pedimental sculptures from the Temple of Aphaia on Aegina have recently been demonstrated to have been painted with bold and elaborate patterns, depicting, amongst other details, patterned clothing. The polychrome of stone statues was paralleled by the use of materials to distinguish skin, clothing and other details in chryselephantine sculptures, and by the use of metals to depict lips, nipples, etc., on high-quality bronzes like the Riace bronzes.\nAn early example of polychrome decoration was found in the Parthenon atop the Acropolis of Athens. By the time European antiquarianism took off in the 18th century, however, the paint that had been on classical buildings had completely weathered off. Thus, the antiquarians' and architects' first impressions of these ruins were that classical beauty was expressed only through shape and composition, lacking in robust colors, and it was that impression which informed neoclassical architecture. However, some classicists such as Jacques Ignace Hittorff noticed traces of paint on classical architecture and this slowly came to be accepted. Such acceptance was later accelerated by observation of minute color traces by microscopic and other means, enabling less tentative reconstructions than Hittorff and his contemporaries had been able to produce. An example of classical Greek architectural polychrome may be seen in the full size replica of the Parthenon exhibited in Nashville, Tennessee, US.\n\nThroughout medieval Europe religious sculptures in wood and other media were often brightly painted or colored, as were the interiors of church buildings. These were often destroyed or whitewashed during iconoclast phases of the Protestant Reformation or in other unrest such as the French Revolution, though some have survived in museums such as the V&A, Musée de Cluny and Louvre.\n\nThe exteriors of churches were painted as well, but little has survived. Exposure to the elements and changing tastes and religious approval over time acted against their preservation. The \"Majesty Portal\" of the Collegiate church of Toro is the most extensive remaining example, due to the construction of a chapel which enclosed and protected it from the elements just a century after it was completed.\n\nWhile stone and metal sculpture normally remained uncolored, like the classical survivals, polychromed wood sculptures were produced by Spanish artists: Juan Martínez Montañés, Gregorio Fernández (17th century); German: Ignaz Günther, Phillip Jacob Straub (18th century), or Brazilian: Aleijadinho (19th century).\n\nWith the arrival of European porcelain in the 18th century, brightly colored pottery figurines with a wide range of colors became very popular.\n\nPolychrome brickwork is a style of architectural brickwork which emerged in the 1860s and used bricks of different colors (typically brown, cream and red) in patterned combination to highlight architectural features. It was often used to replicate the effect of quoining and to decorate around windows. Early examples featured banding, with later examples exhibiting complex diagonal, criss-cross, and step patterns, in some cases even writing using bricks.\n\nIn the twentieth century there were notable periods of polychromy in architecture, from the expressions of Art Nouveau throughout Europe, to the international flourishing of Art Deco or Art Moderne, to the development of postmodernism in the latter decades of the century. During these periods, brickwork, stone, tile, stucco and metal facades were designed with a focus on the use of new colors and patterns, while architects often looked for inspiration to historical examples ranging from Islamic tilework to English Victorian brick. In the 1970s and 1980s, especially, architects working with bold colors included Robert Venturi (Allen Memorial Art Museum addition; Best Company Warehouse), Michael Graves (Snyderman House; Humana Building), and James Stirling (Neue Staatsgalerie; Arthur M. Sackler Museum), among others.\n\nPolychrome building facades later rose in popularity as a way of highlighting certain trim features in Victorian and Queen Anne architecture in the United States. The rise of the modern paint industry following the American Civil War also helped to fuel the (sometimes extravagant) use of multiple colors.\n\nThe polychrome facade style faded with the rise of the 20th century's revival movements, which stressed classical colors applied in restrained fashion and, more importantly, with the birth of modernism, which advocated clean, unornamented facades rendered in white stucco or paint. Polychromy reappeared with the flourishing of the preservation movement and its embrace of (what had previously been seen as) the excesses of the Victorian era and in San Francisco, California in the 1970s to describe its abundant late-nineteenth-century houses. These earned the endearment 'Painted Ladies', a term that in modern times is considered kitsch when it is applied to describe all Victorian houses that have been painted with period colors.\n\nJohn Joseph Earley (1881–1945) developed a \"polychrome\" process of concrete slab construction and ornamentation that was admired across America. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, his products graced a variety of buildings — all formed by the staff of the Earley Studio in Rosslyn, Virginia. Earley's Polychrome Historic District houses in Silver Spring, Maryland were built in the mid-1930s. The concrete panels were pre-cast with colorful stones and shipped to the lot for on-site assembly. Earley wanted to develop a higher standard of affordable housing after the Depression, but only a handful of the houses were built before he died; written records of his concrete casting techniques were destroyed in a fire. Less well-known, but just as impressive, is the Dr. Fealy Polychrome House that Earley built atop a hill in Southeast Washington, D.C. overlooking the city. His uniquely designed polychrome houses were outstanding among prefabricated houses in the country, appreciated for their Art Deco ornament and superb craftsmanship.\n\nThe term polychromatic means having several colors. It is used to describe light that exhibits more than one color, which also means that it contains radiation of more than one wavelength. The study of polychromatics is particularly useful in the production of diffraction gratings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2322291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322291", "title": "Pretty Persuasion", "text": "Pretty Persuasion\n\nPretty Persuasion is a 2005 American black comedy film directed by Marcos Siega, written by Skander Halim, and starring Evan Rachel Wood, James Woods, Ron Livingston, Elisabeth Harnois, and Jane Krakowski. Its plot follows a 15-year-old student at an elite Beverly Hills academy who accuses her drama teacher of sexual harassment.\n\nKimberly Joyce is a precocious, sociopathic high school student at Roxbury Academy, an elite preparatory school in Beverly Hills. She and her best friend Brittany take Randa, a new Muslim student who recently immigrated from the Middle East, under their wing. Kimberly's home life is troubled; her bigoted and disaffected father Hank, an electronics executive, shows little interest in her life, while her vapid stepmother, Kathy, constantly attempts to reprimand her for her coarse language and attitude. Kimberly dreams of becoming an actress, and obtains a coveted role as Anne Frank in the school play.\n\nThe school drama teacher, Percy Anderson, orders Kimberly and Randa to after-school detention one day for disrupting class, and forces Kimberly to write an essay reflecting on her transgression. Percy takes the essay home that evening and has his wife, Grace, read it aloud provocatively as a role play before the two engage in sex. After Brittany is publicly humiliated by Percy during an acting exercise, Kimberly devises a plan to accuse him of sexually harassing each of them. Unable to afford an attorney, Percy agrees to his friend Roger a clueless high school law teacher who passed the bar acting as his attorney. In court, Roger proposes that the accusations are in retaliation to Kimberly having been replaced in the school play after referring to her Jewish classmate Josh's lawyer father as a \"money-grubbing shyster.\"\n\nThe case becomes a media sensation covered extensively by Emily Klein, a local lesbian reporter. Shortly after the trial begins, Kimberly has a sexual encounter with Emily. She manipulates Josh with oral sex into convincing his father Larry, a renowned defense attorney, to defend Percy \"pro bono\". When Larry cross examines Brittany, she confesses on the stand that she, Kimberly, and Randa fabricated the accusations. When Emily confronts her outside the courthouse, Kimberly reveals she filmed their sexual encounter, and uses it as blackmail to receive favorable press coverage.\n\nOverwhelmed with the shame brought on her family by the false accusations, Randa shoots herself to death at school. Grace, now aware the essay Percy had her read was written by Kimberly, leaves him. In the storm of media coverage, Emily extolls Kimberly as a mere \"victim\" of society, and the ensuing press incites Hollywood producers to give Kimberly a bit part on a daytime soap opera. \n\nWhen Brittany visits Kimberly at her house, Kimberly reveals she manipulated Josh into having his father defend Percy as she knew it would cause Brittany to buckle under pressure in court. When Brittany asks why, Kimberly explains that she devised the calculated plot to garner publicity for herself, as well as exact revenge against Brittany for having stolen her ex-boyfriend, Troy. Brittany lambasts her and leaves, vowing never to speak to her again. Kimberly turns on the television and sees herself on the episode of the soap opera. As she watches herself onscreen, tears begin streaming down her face.\n\nThe plot primarily focuses on sexual harassment accusations within a school system, as well as the repercussions of one 15-year-old girl's actions. But the film also makes commentary on many other social issues in contemporary American culture as well, many of them being controversial. Some of the topics that are commented on include racism, ignorance, discrimination, gender identity, homosexuality, intolerance, immigration, teenage behavior, suicide, parenting, deceit, and fascination with celebrity status and the entertainment industry.\n\nThe musical score was composed by Gilad Benamram. The film deliberately does not feature any popular music songs. Similarly, the wardrobe and props do not feature contemporary branding.\n\n\nRoger Ebert called \"Pretty Persuasion\" \"daring, and well-acted\", but also said that it \"exists uneasily somewhere between comedy and satire.\" Phil Villarreal of the \"Arizona Daily Star\" called the film a \"scathing and hilarious social satire.\" While Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" praised the film: \"An obscene, misanthropic go-for-broke satire, \"Pretty Persuasion\" is so gleefully nasty that the fact that it was even made and released is astonishing. Much of it is also extremely funny. Any satire worth its salt should not be afraid to offend, and \"Pretty Persuasion\" flings mud in all directions with a fearless audacity.\" James Mottram of Channel 4 opined, \"Hovering uncomfortably between comedy and satire, \"Pretty Persuasion\" never quite gets the balance right.\" Carlo Cavagna thought it a \"dark teen comedy that tries way too hard to be a dark teen comedy.\" \n\nThe \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" accused the film of being an \"ugly, cheap attempt at satire\", and \"Slant\" magazine called it \"a pretty unpersuasive lecture\". Adam Vary of \"The Advocate\" called the film \"rife with political incorrectness.\" Critic Armond White deemed the film \"ingenious.\"\n\nThe film has a \"rotten\" 32 percent rating at Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n"}

John Wright Dolls is an art doll making workshop located in Bennington, Vermont. Established in 1976, R. John Wright Dolls (RJW) is a privately held company founded by R. John Wright.\n\nThe company designs, produces and markets original felt doll and plush animal lines along with many licensed products including Winnie-the-Pooh, Raggedy Ann, Beatrix Potter characters, Classic Disney, Paddington Bear, and The Wizard of Oz. The dolls are designed by John and Susan Wright and produced in numbered limited editions at the R. John Wright workshop in Bennington, Vermont.\n\nR. John Wright was born and raised in Michigan where he attended Wayne State University and worked towards a degree in Liberal Arts. Two years later, having relocated to New England, he met his wife Susan who had a degree in Fine Arts from the University of New Hampshire. In November 1976, while living in Brattleboro, Vermont, R. John Wright created his first felt doll in the image of a simple male folk character. Production commenced at the couples' ground-floor apartment. These early dolls were primarily sold at juried craft fairs along the east coast including the American Craft Council (ACC) exhibitions in Rhinebeck, New York. The technique and style of the R. John Wright dolls underwent significant changes throughout 1977-78. The early felt dolls of the Steiff Company were a strong inspiration. The Wrights were also inspired by the early molded cloth dolls of Kathe Kruse and the felt Lenci dolls. In 1978, through trial and error, the Wrights were able to reinvent the art of molded felt dolls using their own techniques.\n\nIn 1978, R. John Wright joined the United Federation of Doll Clubs (UFDC) and was elected to the National Institute of American Doll Artists (NIADA) where he served as the Standards Chairman of the organization.\n\nIn 1981, the R. John Wright facility relocated from Brattleboro, Vermont to Cambridge, New York.\n\nBeginning in 1987, every R. John Wright item features a 8mm brass identification button inscribed with the initials 'RJW.'\n\nIn 2005 the R. John Wright facility relocated from Cambridge, New York to Bennington, Vermont. All work continues to be done on-site under the Wrights' direct supervision.\n\nIn 1984 R. John Wright Inc. began a 13-year relationship with the Walt Disney Company with the development of a range of dolls and animals based closely on the original illustrations by E. H. Shepard in the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne. These products ushered in a new licensing division titled “Classic Winnie the Pooh” which was a departure in Disney's marketing of Winnie the Pooh products in the U.S. Several editions of Winnie-the-Pooh and other characters from the Hundred Acre Wood were produced.\n\nUnder license with Disney, the R. John Wright company went on to produce many Disney art character dolls including Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Cinderella, Pinocchio, Geppetto, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs set won the RJW Company the Award of Excellence from DOLLS Magazine in 1998.\n\n1984-1999, R. John Wright was under license with the Walt Disney Company for collectible dolls and plush. In 1985 the RJW Company received the first Doll of the Year Award from Doll Reader magazine for their rendition of Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh.\n\n1999, RJW was licensed to produce Rose O'Neill's Kewpie in felt. Production coincided with an extensive R. John Wright tour and exhibition at the Takashimaya department store in Japan.\n\n2000-2008, RJW secured licensing to produce the Beatrix Potter Collection with the introduction of Peter Rabbit and a series of animal characters from the Beatrix Potter books.\n\n2000-2002, three editions of The Little Prince were produced under license with the Estate of Antoine de Saint-St. Exupéry, including a one of a kind figure that traveled the world from January 2001 to January 2002 and sold by the doll auction house Theriault's for $35,000 with proceeds going to St. Jude's Children's Research.\n\n2000-2002, R. John Wright produced several editions of Paddington Bear under license with the Copyrights Group\n\n2002, R. John Wright produced the Clifford Berryman Bear under license with Linda Mullins to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the Teddy Bear.\n\n2004-2008, RJW was licensed with the Copyrights Group to produce Raggedy Ann and other related characters created by Johnny Gruelle.\n\n2006, The French comic character Becassine was produced by special permission from the copyright holder and publisher, Gautier-Languereau/Hachette Jeunesse.\n\n2007-2008, RJW and the Steiff Company in Germany collaborated on a series of felt child dolls titled 'Steiff Kinder.'\n\n2007, The 50th Anniversary of Edith The Lonely Doll by Dare Wright was met with limited edition replica based on the original Lenci doll.\n\n2009-2015, RJW produced felt dolls based on the Flower Fairy books of Cicely Mary Barker under license with Frederick Warne & Co.\n\n2010-2018, RJW was licensed by Warner Bros. to produce felt art dolls and mohair mice based on the film the Wizard of Oz.\n\n2012, an edition of the vintage Patsy and Skippy dolls designed by Bernard Lipfert were made by special permission of the copyright holders.\n\n2013, RJW began production of felt dolls based on the original Hummel designs under license from M.I. Hummel. In 1992, Goebel distributed a series of Christmas Angels including the Celestial Musician which has been released by RJW in late 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the company will mark its 40th anniversary with joint ventures with Steiff, an extensive array of licensed pieces, and a line of mice, bears, cats, dogs, and lambs.\n\nIn 1996, the company formed the R. John Wright Collector's Club which attracted more than 4,000 members worldwide.\n\n\n\"R. John Wright and his fanciful felt dolls exemplify the fine work being done by doll artists today.\"\n\n\"I am grateful that somehow I was given the strength—and the unfounded optimism—to begin making dolls. I don’t know where that came from, but it was like being on the edge of a cliff with no other alternative but to jump. I’m glad I did. But even if I had failed, it would be preferable to never knowing.\"\n\n"}

Anamnesis and Transmission publish philosophy and Anomaly publishes other works including poetry and speculative fiction. The open access free downloads seem to be confined to the Anamnesis and Transmission series.\n\nAccording to re.press’ website they are committed to “maximizing design values, boosting clarity and aesthetic qualities”. This commitment is expressed through the use of Melbourne-based artists on their covers. According to their website:\n\n“re.press aims to publish the best philosophical works available, whether these emerge from well-established or from previously unknown thinkers, whether they are from the North or the South, the East or the West, whether they are Platonists or Hegelians, materialists or idealists. True thought is global, universal, transformative, shredding ideologies and opinions like the statues of old dictators. But true thought also begins locally, in images and signs that may as yet have no recognisable reference or import. re.press' head offices are located in the city of Melbourne, Australia. And Melbourne is, as the art-critic Norbert Loeffler has remarked, one of the great art-cities of the world - without anybody knowing it. Lacking the established power, media and reputation of traditional centres of world art, Melbourne forces its artists to sustain themselves otherwise. Aware of contemporary work from all over the world, local artists transmute it for their own, often-obscure purposes, into unprecedented forms. re.press seeks, like an insatiable kleptoparasite, to draw off some of this aesthetic power for its own ends, by using their images for its cover-art.”\n"}

Even if not the work now at Detroit, this could have been the latter's prototype, since the painting is not unanimously attributed to van Eyck. There are indeed striking similarities between this work and Domenico Ghirlandaio's \"Saint Jerome in His Study\" (1480).\n\nThe painting depicts Saint Jerome in the traditional representation inside his study. He wears a cardinal's dress and hat, and is reading a book, in a small study clogged with numerous objects showing his erudition and interests. Below is a lion, recalling the saint's legend in which he had extracted a thorn from the paw of the animal, who had later remained loyal to him. The light enters from a window behind the writing desk and from the foreground, in order to illuminate any detail of the scene. Objects on the desk and the shelves include an hourglass, a pounce pot, a ruler, an astrolabe, numerous books and writing instruments, all suitable for the idealized man of the Renaissance.\n\n"}
{"id": "3401540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3401540", "title": "Saint Matthew and the Angel", "text": "Saint Matthew and the Angel\n\nSaint Matthew and the Angel (1602) is a painting from the Italian master Caravaggio (1571–1610), completed for the Contarelli Chapel in the church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome. It was destroyed in 1945 and is now known only from black-and-white photographs and enhanced color reproductions.\n\nCaravaggio was known for painting very realistically, using models instead of standard convention and idealization. He made his figures lifelike and relatable, as opposed to portraying unrealistic or phony poses. In this instance, however, the patrons wanted an idealization of the beloved Saint, someone who its viewers could admire and strain to be like. They did not want a bumbling peasant who looked as if he just walked in off the street. With the angel sweeping down and the Saint’s stool teetering in movement, it is arguably one of Caravaggio’s earliest examples of his dynamic style. It was a much more exciting composition than the first. Even though Caravaggio changed the composition to suit the desires of the patron, you can still see his own style under the more refined subject of Saint Matthew.\n\nSaint Matthew and the Angel was completed in 1602. A part of the collection of the former Kaiser Friedrich Museum, it was destroyed by fire at the end of World War II while stored in an anti-aircraft bunker in Berlin. This work, by a pillar of the Baroque movement, might have provided new information about the artist and patron. Reproductions of the original still survive.\n\n\"Saint Matthew and the Angel\" was created as a commission for the Contarelli Chapel. Caravaggio was previously commissioned to paint two scenes of the saint’s life, and after the patrons were satisfied with them, a third was commissioned. \n\nThe Contarelli Chapel was dedicated to Saint Matthew. With funds left for its building left in 1585, it was completed in 1600. Cardinal Del Monte played a major part in orchestrating the decoration of its interior, and was the one who suggested Caravaggio as the painter of the scenes of Saint Matthew’s life. The altar was to be composed of two Caravaggio paintings as well as a statue of the saint by Flemish artist Jacob Cobaert. However, the church was not pleased with the statue and Caravaggio was re-hired to do another piece as the center for the altar, to show Saint Matthew writing the Gospel under the guidance of an angel. Caravaggio depicted the Saint as an unlearned peasant, gaping in the presence of the angel. The church rejected Caravaggio's irreverent presentation of the saint, and Caravaggio replaced it with a more glorifying image, \"The Inspiration of Saint Matthew\", which remains in the Chapel today.\n\nThe comparison is not perfect because the only images available of the lost \"Saint Matthew and the Angel\" are black and white photographs that were taken before World War II. The lost painting showed Saint Matthew as poorly groomed, with dirty feet. Although this was the style of Caravaggio, the church leaders thought it was too crude and did not want to have what looked like a peasant hanging in their sacred altarpiece. In addition, they thought that this Matthew did not match the other two paintings that Caravaggio had already done. It was apparently disconnected and therefore had no place with the others. The second piece keeps true to the same subject, but with a few changes. Matthew looks more like the other two Matthews in the altar. The Saint is now more serious and in control in the presence of the angel. Instead of being fully controlled by the angel, Saint Matthew is only encouraged by the angel in the second one. He is working more on his own accord.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1039920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1039920", "title": "Shabby chic", "text": "Shabby chic\n\nShabby chic () is a form of interior design where furniture and furnishings are either chosen for their appearance of age and signs of wear and tear or where new items are distressed to achieve the appearance of an antique. At the same time, a soft, opulent, yet cottage-style decor, often with an affected feel is emphasized to differentiate it from genuine period decor.\n\nShabby chic items are often heavily painted through the years, with many layers showing through obviously time-worn areas. The style is imitated in faux painting using glaze or by painting then rubbing and sanding away the top coat to show the wood or base coats, known as \"distressing\" the finish of the furniture. Furniture pieces that are not genuine antiques are usually selected for their resemblance to older furniture styles, and may be reproduction furniture with a distressed finish. Elaborate furniture appliques depicting flower swags and garlands, cherubs, and other motifs may be added.\n\nFabrics tend to be cottons and linens, with linen being particularly popular, inspired by old French linens. Pure whites, as well as ecrus and worn or bleached out pastel colors are favorites. Fabric is often stained with tea to give it the look of old fabric. Bleached and faded are terms often applied to the style. Vintage floral patterns with pastel colors, cotton ticking patterns, or linen in earth tones, are all typical of shabby chic style.\n\nAntique pieces such as pie safes and jelly cupboards are popular in shabby chic décor. Besides white, the shabby chic style also includes soft neutral colors such as sky blue, rose pink and beige tones. Hints from French-style interior design often show in shabby chic homes such as Rococo-style lighting fixtures, furniture or wall paneling.\n\nThe shabby chic aesthetic also expands to the garden, with the same design principles of using timeworn garden furniture and feminine accessories. Rose gardens are popular with the shabby chic style of décor.\n\nOther popular décor items are pillows made of vintage barkcloth fabric, vintage linens, chenille bedspreads, vintage chandeliers, and anything with roses in the design. \"Newsweek\" used the term to describe avant-garde fashion designer Martin Margiela's 1992 fall fashion show, which took place in a Salvation Army furniture store and featured models in \"wrinkled jackets, baggy-kneed pants and coats with inner linings hanging down from unfinished hems.\"\n\nDecorators consider shabby chic a soft, relaxed, romantic style that looks comfortable and inviting, and is usually associated as feminine. Masculine shabby chic would be \"rustic\", with deeper or richer colors, Rustic furniture using unfinished wood, denim, burlap, sailcloth and homespun.\n\nVariants of shabby chic style include:\n\n\nThe style started in Great Britain and evokes the type of decoration found in large country houses where there are worn and faded old chintz sofas and curtains, old paintwork and unassuming \"good\" taste. The end result of shabby chic is to achieve an elegant overall effect, as opposed to the sentimentally cute Pop-Victorian. Recycling old furniture and fabrics is an important aspect of the look and was especially popular with modern Bohemians and artisans that made up a sidelined counter-culture movement during the 1980s when expensive quality decor became very fashionable with the upper middle classes. The original shabby chic interiors were usually considered in themselves works of art.\n\nThe early forms of shabby chic were rather grand but the style has evolved taking inspiration from many forms of decoration. These range from 18th century Swedish painted decoration, the French Chateau as well as the American Shakers where simplicity and plainness was essential.\n\nRachel Ashwell founded a furniture chain called Shabby Chic, and in 1996, published a book around the aesthetic she described as \"the aura of old money, cushy comfort, and crafted indifference.\"\n\nThe term was coined by \"The World of Interiors\" magazine in the 1980s, and became extremely popular in the United States in the 1990s with a certain eclectic surge of decorating styles with paints and effects, notably in metropolitan cultural centers on the West Coast of America, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, with heavy influences from Mediterranean cultures such as Provence, Tuscany, and Greece.\n\n"}

{"id": "8084997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8084997", "title": "The Freewoman", "text": "The Freewoman\n\nThe Freewoman was a feminist weekly published between 23 November 1911 and 10 October 1912 and edited by Dora Marsden and Mary Gawthorpe.\n\nAlthough \"The Freewoman\" published articles on women's waged work, housework, motherhood, the suffrage movement, and literature, its notoriety and influence rested on its frank discussions of sexuality, morality, and marriage. \"The Freewoman\" urged tolerance for male homosexuality, advocated for free love, and encouraged women to remain unmarried.\n\n\"The Freewoman\"'s editorial stance distinguished it sharply from the attitude of suffragists like Millicent Fawcett, who was so disturbed at the journal's approach to sexuality that she tore the first issue into little pieces.\n\nIn March 1912 Gawthorpe resigned due to poor health and disagreements with Marsden. In September 1912, W H Smith refused to carry \"The Freewoman\" and in October 1912, the journal folded.\n\nAlthough its circulation probably never exceeded 200, it had a significant influence in Modernist circles. Among its contributors were Rebecca West, H. G. Wells, Edward Carpenter, and Guy Aldred.\n\nIn June 1913 Marsden started \"The New Freewoman\" which was more concerned with literary modernism than feminism and was funded by Harriet Shaw Weaver. In 1914, \"The New Freewoman\" became \"The Egoist\".\n\n\"The Freewoman\" was a feminist journal/newspaper in publication during the early twentieth century in Britain. Dora Marsden founded \"The Freewoman\" in November 1911, but the paper was also co-edited by Mary Gawthorpe. Despite being edited by both women, Marsden initially used Gawthorpe for her name and influence in the feminist society to give the paper creditability and popularity. The paper was rooted in more radical feminist ideals that stretched beyond strictly suffrage. Marsden focused the paper around the discussion of sex and the idea of being sexual, causing many issues to arise amongst readers. After the first issue of \"The Freewoman\", the female readers, many of whom grew up during the Victorian era of feminism, thought the views presented did not reflect the ideals of the feminism they had grown to understand. One of their main objectives was the papers very obvious discussions and references to sex. \nIn the paper’s first issue it stated that it sought to represent the feminist movement through intellectual thought by actual feminists of the time. It touched on the idea of marriage, motherhood, sexuality, women’s rights, and the domestic man. Its radical approach on these ideas seemed misplaced for the twentieth century, however its influence amongst the feminist and sexual radicals was greater than its small circulation implied.\n\nAccording to many of the female readers, \"The Freewoman\" expressed beliefs more radical than most feminists during the early twentieth century. In the paper’s first issue it discussed the definition of marriage. To \"The Freewoman\" marriage did not only mean men and women, nor did it mean that a couple had to have children. To the women who were raised during the Victorian era, this concept of marriage did not register with them. Marriage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and even in the current day, meant a man and woman and usually resulted in children. However, with the job opportunities and improved possibility of economic and social independence from the years preceding and during the war, women were able to forge a new identity separate from the confines of marriage. \nAs feminism began to grow throughout the twentieth century the paper began to put a new label on these radical and forward thinking feminists: The New Woman.\n\n\"The Freewoman\" began to redefine and transform feminism from being solely related to suffrage and the suffrage movement, but to show feminism in its purest form. It aimed to say that feminists needed to strive for more than just the right to vote. Marsden’s rather liberal and forward thinking opinion on the definition of feminism is what caused future debates amongst other prominent feminists of the time. The New Woman was to be a politically, socially and economically independent woman. \"The Freewoman\" did not reject the domestic life that most women during the twentieth century lived, but rather used the domestic life of a woman as a tool to show women that they could take an active role in protecting their interests. \nIn the paper’s third publication it discussed the idea of the domestic man. It raised the idea that a man can do the work of a woman in the domestic sphere. The goal was to “work towards the evolution of the New Housekeeping.” Its rationale hinged on the argument that the house and its inner workings were no different from that of a restaurant or even a milliner’s shop. The paper also suggested the idea of communal cooking and man and wife dividing up the household duties that would allow women to work outside of the domestic life. This idea of the domestic man also supported the idea of the homosexual family. With a man being able to do the domestic work, it presented the idea that man and man could live as a couple. To say that this openly happened is not likely, however \"The Freewoman\" implied and even supported this life style choice. The paper again showed its liberal and progressive beliefs with its idea of the domestic man.\n\nThe Freewoman stated that: \"It is high time for a reversal of the servile notion of government from above. Free government proceeds from the individual outwards, not from the sum total inwards. It is for this reason that, considering the trend of Syndicalism, we are of the opinion that it is likely to make a far more intimate appeal to the nation than Socialism ever has. Its aims are the same: the means of production and exchange to be the property of the community as a whole, but under Syndicalism the control of conditions of work are to be in the hands of those who perform it.\"\n\nWith the papers candid nature of expressing many of its beliefs, there were bound to be arguments. One of it biggest criticisms and continuous debates with some readers came from its stance on the suffrage movement. It openly challenged the ideals of the movement and its organization. Despite being co-edited, these views were mainly the opinions of Marsden and not Gawthorpe. With the paper’s belief that feminism was more than just the right to vote, its views on the suffrage movement were unlike most feminists in Britain during the twentieth century. During this era women were fighting for the right to vote and to be regarded as political equals amongst men. Not all feminists believed in complete female independence from the strongholds of the normative female life. \"The Freewoman\" wanted to stray away from this concept of feminism. It wanted women to not only be politically equal, but economically and socially self-sufficient as well. It rooted its beliefs in complete female independence from the norms of society.\n\nThe publication of \"The Freewoman\" did not last long. Its final paper was published in 1912, but was later revived in May 1913 with the new title \"The New Freewoman\". Despite the attempts to revive the paper and inspire more readers, the paper finally ended publication in 1914. Its publication did not reach a large market, mostly due to its views on feminism and the suffrage movement. The paper, but more specifically Dora Marsden’s beliefs and opinions were far too liberal and progressive for its early twentieth century audience. The audience was still rather conservative in their views. It would not be until the years of the Great War that women began to take small strides in some of the ideals that \"The Freewoman\" expressed. Despite having an extremely small circulation, the paper’s strong beliefs and opinions were widely known and debated against and provided the impetus for future feminist activists.\n\n\nwww.aplink.co.jp/ep/4-902454-27-0.html\n\n"}

Among other Mbari members were Christopher Okigbo, J. P. Clark and South African writer Ezekiel Mphahlele, Frances Ademola, Demas Nwoko, Mabel Segun, Uche Okeke, Arthur Nortje and Bruce Onobrakpeya.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" in an obituary of Beier noted that \"the Mbari Club became synonymous with the optimism and creative exuberance of Africa’s post-independence era. Fela Kuti made his debut as bandleader there, and it became a magnet for artists and writers from all over Africa, America and the Caribbean.\" In the words of Toyin Adepoju: \"Coming to birth in the flux of the preindependence and immediate postindependence period in Nigeria, it brought together a constellation of artists whose work embodied the quality of transformation embodied by the aesthetic of creation, decay, and regeneration evoked by the Mbari tradition.\"\n\nClosely connected with the literary magazine \"Black Orpheus\", which Beier had founded in 1957, Mbari also acted as a publisher during the 1960s — considered to be the only African-based publisher of African literature at the time — producing 17 titles by African writers. Mbari published early works by Clark, Okigbo and Soyinka, poetry by Bakare Gbadamosi (\"Okiri\", 1961), Alex La Guma (\"A Walk in the Night and Other Stories\", 1962), Dennis Brutus (\"Sirens, Knuckles, Boots\", 1963), Kofi Awoonor and Lenrie Peters, as well as translations of francophone poetry. Brutus was chosen as winner of the Mbari Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.\n\nFounded in 1961 by a diverse group of writers, visual artists, musicians and actors, and active throughout the 1960s, the Mbari Club was originally located in Ibadan's Dugbe Market, on the site of \"an old Lebanese restaurant that was converted into an open-air performance venue, an art gallery, a library, and an office.\" \n\nWhile celebrating the creativity of Nigerian talent in the newly independent nation, Mbari \"was an international environment, attracting artists from across Africa and beyond\". The premieres of Soyinka's \"The Trials of Brother Jero\" and Clark's \"Song of a Goat\" were staged at Mbari, and internationally renowned artists were also invited to play or exhibit their work, including Langston Hughes, Jacob Lawrence and Pete Seeger. The club also initiated writing competitions.\n\nAs recalled by Lindsay Barrett, secretary of the Mbari Club from 1966 to 1967: \"We were in a historic, literary setting ... when the civil war [1967–70] broke out and disintegrated everything.\"\n\nIn 1962 a similar club based on the same concepts, called Mbari Mbayo (the name this time reflecting a Yoruba phrase meaning: \"Were I to see, I would rejoice\" or \"When we see it we shall be happy\"), was developed in Oshogbo — about 50 miles northeast of Ibadan — by dramatist Duro Ladipo together with Beier and Mphahlele. Ladipo converted his father's house into an art gallery and a theatre, where he produced his plays. Artists who emerged from the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oshogbo include Twins Seven Seven and Jimoh Buraimoh.\n\nThe Mbari-Enugu Club of Eastern Nigeria was established in 1963 and like Mbari Mbayo was particularly a platform for sculpture, painting and literary performance.\n\nIn June 2016 the Ibadan Literary Society (IBS) was launched, modelled after the Mbari Club.\n\n"}

The project revolves around presenting such readings, especially to audiences of medical professionals and students.\n\nA number of readings were followed by a panel discussion about doctor-patient relationships, involving presenters in psychiatry, physicians, and military medical personnel.\n\nThe concept has also been extended to training of medical students, such as a presentation also in 2007 to the first year medical class at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, involving not only the students, but also faculty members. The presentation included a discussion of an actual case dealing with the patient-caregiver interactions that parallel the situation that Sophocles presented.\n\nIn 2008, at a conference dedicated to finding new ways to help US Marines recover from post-traumatic stress and other disorders after serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, four New York actors presented a dramatic reading from \"Philoctetes\" and \"Ajax\". The plays focused on physical and psychological wounds inflicted on the warrior.\n\nThey have also presented plays such as: “Prometheus Bound,”, and “The Women of Trachis”.\n\nTheatre of War have performed in the UK presented by the military charity Glen art with actors \nLesley Sharp and Jason Isaacs at Edinburgh Castle and The Southbank Centre in London in 2015.\n\nIn March 2018, Glen Art presented Theatre of War’s first performance in Scotland for a serving military audience.\n\n"}

Derek Walcott was the founding director, from 1959 to 1971. In its inaugural season, the Workshop presented \"The Blacks\" by Jean Genet, Eric Roach's \"Belle Fanto\", and \"The Road\" by Wole Soyinka. The company continues to produce works by Walcott and others (including such diverse dramatists as Dario Fo, Tennessee Williams, Anton Chekhov, Ntozake Shange, Neil Simon, and Athol Fugard among many others), and in recent years has offered educational programs and community outreach in the region in addition to its production schedule.\n\n"}
{"id": "237137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237137", "title": "What would Jesus do?", "text": "What would Jesus do?\n\nThe phrase \"What would Jesus do?\" (often abbreviated to WWJD) became popular, particularly in the United States but elsewhere as well, in the 1990s and as a personal motto for adherents of Christianity who used the phrase as a reminder of their belief in a moral imperative to act in a manner that would demonstrate the love of Jesus through the actions of the adherents.\n\nIn popular consciousness, the acronym signifying the question—WWJD—is associated with a type of bracelet or wristband which became a popular accessory for members of Christian youth groups, both Catholic and Protestant, in the 1990s.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church emphasizes the concept of \"Imitatio Christi\" (imitation of Christ), which is summarized well in the English phrase \"What Would Jesus Do?\"\n\nJohn Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, in 1766 postulated the concept of Christian perfection, a moment in the life of a Christian at which the regeneration effectuated by the Holy Spirit results in a \"perfection in love\" which means that at least at that moment one is being motivated wholly by love of God and neighbor, with no taint of sin or ulterior motives in effect. While such Christian perfection is expressed in outward action, it is also the effect of grace. Indeed, Wesley could speak of sanctification by faith as an analogous doctrine to the more widely held belief in justification by faith. Because Christian perfection is also visible in outward good works and a rigorously moral lifestyle, adherents of the Holiness movement assumed that a perfectly moral lifestyle is a consequence (not the cause) of the state of grace and ultimate salvation.\n\nCharles Spurgeon, a well-known evangelical preacher in London, used the phrase \"what would Jesus do\" in quotation marks several times in a sermon he gave on June 28, 1891. In his sermon he cites the source of the phrase as a book written in Latin by Thomas à Kempis between 1418 and 1427, \"Imitatio Christi\" (The Imitation of Christ).\n\nCharles Sheldon's 1896 book \"In His Steps\" was subtitled \"What Would Jesus Do?\" Sheldon's novel grew out of a series of sermons he delivered in his Congregationalist church in Topeka, Kansas. Unlike the previous nuances mentioned above, Sheldon's theology was shaped by a commitment to Christian Socialism. The ethos of Sheldon's approach to the Christian life was expressed in this phrase \"What Would Jesus Do\", with Jesus being a moral example as well as a Saviour figure. Sheldon's ideas coalesced with those that formed into the Social Gospel espoused by Walter Rauschenbusch. Indeed, Rauschenbusch acknowledged that his Social Gospel owed its inspiration directly to Sheldon's novel, and Sheldon himself identified his own theology with the Social Gospel.\n\nDue to a mistake by the original publisher, the copyright for Sheldon's novel was never established and multiple publishers were able to print and sell the novel. This caused the novel to be easily affordable and it sold 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the top 50 bestselling novels ever.\n\nIn this popular novel (it had been translated into 21 languages by 1935), Rev. Henry Maxwell encounters a homeless man who challenges him to take seriously the imitation of Christ. The homeless man has difficulty understanding why, in his view, so many Christians ignore the poor:\n\n<poem>I heard some people singing at a church prayer meeting the other night,\n\n\"All for Jesus, all for Jesus,\nAll my being's ransomed powers,\nAll my thoughts, and all my doings,\nAll my days, and all my hours.\"\n\nand I kept wondering as I sat on the steps outside just what they meant by it. It seems to me there's an awful lot of trouble in the world that somehow wouldn't exist if all the people who sing such songs went and lived them out. I suppose I don't understand. But what would Jesus do? Is that what you mean by following His steps? It seems to me sometimes as if the people in the big churches had good clothes and nice houses to live in, and money to spend for luxuries, and could go away on summer vacations and all that, while the people outside the churches, thousands of them, I mean, die in tenements, and walk the streets for jobs, and never have a piano or a picture in the house, and grow up in misery and drunkenness and sin.\"</poem>\n\nThis leads to many of the novel's characters asking, \"What would Jesus do?\" when faced with decisions of some importance. This has the effect of making the characters embrace Christianity more seriously and to focus on what they see as its core — the life of Christ.\n\nIn 1993, Garrett W. Sheldon (great-grandson of the original author) and Deborah Morris published \"What Would Jesus Do? : a contemporary retelling of Charles M. Sheldon's classic In His Steps\". Garrett Sheldon states that his updated version \"is based on many actual events in the lives of believers.\"\n\nIt is possible that Sheldon was familiar with either Spurgeon or Thomas, or that he was independently inspired.\n\nA youth group leader at Calvary Reformed Church in Holland, Michigan, named Janie Tinklenberg, began a grassroots movement to help the teenagers in her group remember the phrase; it spread worldwide in the 1990s among Christian youth, who wore bracelets bearing the initials WWJD. Later, a sequel bracelet was generated with the initials \"FROG,\" to provide an answer to \"WWJD.\" FROG was an acronym for \"Fully Rely On God.\"\n\nIn 2005, Garry Wills wrote \"What Jesus Meant\", in which he examined \"What Would Jesus Really Do\" (also a book review in \"Esquire Magazine\").\n\nIn April 2010 a film, \"WWJD\", starring Adam Gregory and based on \"In His Steps\" by Charles Sheldon, was released on DVD.\nOn 31 March 2015 a sequel film was released \"WWJD What Would Jesus Do? The Journey Continues\". The second film using the moniker \"WWJD II\" was \"The Woodcarver\" which was released in 2012. It has a similar theme but different characters.\n\nThe expression has become a snowclone, sometimes for humorous effect. For example, \"What Would Jesus Buy?\", \"What Would Lincoln Do?\", \"What Would Brian Boitano Do?\", \"What Would Mary Marvel Do?\", \"What Would Johnny Cash Do?\", and \"What would Tintin do?\".\n\nThe term \"What Would Jesus Do?\" or \"WWJD\" is also perceived as a fundamental management and leadership principle given Jesus' methodology of going to the marketplace to preach and lead by example. In modern management principles, more academic and professional references are going to the gemba or Management by Walking Around.\n\n\n"}
