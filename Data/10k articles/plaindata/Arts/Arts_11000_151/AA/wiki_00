Resident artist Marta Becket staged dance and mime shows there from the late 1960s until her final show in February 2012. The Death Valley Junction Historic District is on the National Register of Historic Places and is owned by the nonprofit established by Becket for the preservation of the property.\n\nThe theater was part of a company town designed by architect Alexander Hamilton McCulloch and constructed in 1923–25 by the Pacific Coast Borax Company. The U-shaped complex of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture style adobe buildings included company offices, employees' headquarters, a dormitory and a 23-room hotel with a dining room, lobby and store. At the northeast end of the complex was a recreation hall used as a community center for dances, church services, movies, funerals and town meetings.\n\nWhen the town of Amargosa was booming due to the Borax mining business, and its position at the terminus of the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, about 350 people lived in the town. The hotel served as a very nice place to stay for both company executives and visiting investors, who were met at the train with white-gloved valets after a long and hot train ride. In addition to the hotel rooms, the cafe and a restaurant within the hotel, other rooms were bunkhouses for workers, an infirmary, a general store and what is now the Opera House, which was mostly used for showing films. A large gas station and garage across from the cafe was the only location in the area for repairs of trucks hauling borax out of the mines, in addition to passenger car repairs. When the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad ceased to be economical in 1942, the tracks were torn up completely and sent to Egypt, where the railroad was set up again to aid the Allies military effort in Egypt. Once the railroad stopped, the Opera House, Hotel and about 250 acres of land changed hands many times, until Marta Becket arrived on the scene.\n\nMarta Becket rented the recreation hall in 1967, when it was known as Corkhill Hall; she began repairs, created the sets, and painted murals on the adobe walls. She renamed it the Amargosa, the original name of the former mining town. In 1970, journalists from \"National Geographic\" discovered Becket doing a performance at the Amargosa Opera House without an audience. Their profile and another in \"Life\" led to an international interest in Becket and her theater. She began performing to visitors from around the world, including such notables as Ray Bradbury and Red Skelton.\n\nIn 1974, Becket completed her murals and established the nonprofit Amargosa Opera House, Inc. to continue preservation of the property. Through the Trust for Public Land, the nonprofit bought the town of Death Valley Junction, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1981. In 1983, the Opera House bought 120 theater seats from the Boulder City Theater in Boulder City, Nevada to replace the worn garden chairs and the official National Register of Historic Places marker for Death Valley Junction was placed.\n\nJenna McClintock saw a performance when she was six years old and was inspired to start training in ballet. After a career with the Oakland Ballet, Jenna returned to thank Marta, and decided to stay and maintain the tradition. Jenna retired from the Amargosa Opera House in the spring of 2016.\n\nHilda Vazquez requested to perform for Marta Becket on her 92th birthday while visiting the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel on a road trip from Massachusetts, both unaware that Marta Becket had no dancer. Hilda Vazquez, a ballerina from Dominican Republic, was invited to perform in the Amargosa Opera House for 2 years by Marta Becket. Marta Becket and Hilda Vazquez rehearsed for many months. Marta Becket took Hilda as her student and gave her all the secrets to her performances repertoire created of ballet and pantomime. Marta Becket entrusted the legacy of the Opera House to Hilda Vazquez. They rehearsed and worked hard on the performances and on Marta Becket's last day they danced together on the sands of Death Valley.\n\nThe Amargosa Hotel is open year-round for visitors from all over the world. Beyond these maintained areas, the town of Death Valley Junction is almost a ghost town. There are no gas stations. The single restaurant, the Amargosa Cafe, was part of the Opera House and Hotel, and has recently re-opened with an Australian-American cook making very upscale, Australian-American fusion roadhouse/coffee shop meals, pastries and coffees from espresso to American drip. The interior of the Cafe is like a time capsule, like most of the Amargosa Hotel, with an old counter and circular counter chairs.\n\nThe Amargosa Opera House and Hotel is located on California State Route 127 in Death Valley Junction at the junction of National Scenic Byway, California State Route 190, California State Route 127, Furnace Creek Inn area and Death Valley National Park, 27 miles (43 km) northwest. South is the town of Shoshone, California, and the Tecopa Hot Springs. The Nevada state line is five miles to the northeast.\n\nAs the Lost Highway Hotel, it was featured in David Lynch's \"Lost Highway\".\n\nThe exterior of the Amargosa Opera House was also shown in the movies \"The Hitcher\" and Carl Colpaert's \"Delusion\". The exterior of the adjacent cafe and hotel colonnade were shown in a 40 second segment of Robert Plant's video of his 1983 song, Big Log.\n\nTodd Robinson's (film director) documentary, \"Amargosa\" (2000) about Marta Becket and Amargosa won a 2003 Emmy Award for cinematographer Curt Apduhan and was a finalist for an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Feature, in addition to numerous festival awards and nominations.\n\nReports of hauntings in the buildings were investigated on the paranormal television shows \"Ghost Adventures\" in 2010 and \"The Dead Files\" in 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

Out of all early-medieval (old Croatian) architectural monuments in Dalmatia, which historians date beck to the period between 8th and 11th century, Church of Holy Trinity, with its original shape and rich findings, has a very important place. This small central edifice with six-leaf structure of semicircular arches strung around irregular circle has become one of the most precious heritage monuments of Split and Dalmatia.\n\nChurch of the Holy Trinity has been added to the register of the most valuable Croatian Cultural Heritage, of the highest category. The church is still in active use with Holy Mass being celebrated every Sunday at 8:30 am, except in the summertime (from June 13 to September 1).\n\nChurch of Holy Trinity was first mentioned in a list of countries which had Benedictine monasteries from 1060, which doesn't mean that the church wasn't built in the 9th century. Historians cite different dates of construction of this church; Iveković holds that it was built in the 6th century and Ljubo Karaman in the 11th century, but most historians believe that it was built in the 9th century.\n\nEnglish architect Thomas Graham Jackson, while studying the old architecture of Dalmatia, was first warned of the exceptional heritage value of this edifice, although it was founded abandoned and partially demolished in 1887. In 1891, investigations by domestic and foreign experts were conducted on the site. In 1914 the company from Bihać rented the church. In 1924, walls on the northwestern apse were renovated, while the previously walled up windows were opened in the 1950s. During restoration works in 1948, the remains of an older edifice that extends to the east, and more fragments of the altar partition were found. Findings are today kept in Archaeological Museum in Split. Arches and altar screen are a typical example of pre-Romanesque stone sculpture which is harmoniously decorated with the geometric Croatian interlace motifes and carved text.\n\nIn 1965, the walls and vaults of the church were cracked, and both interior and exterior neglected, with thorns growing in the interior. Therefore, the head of a monastery of the Assumption of Mary from Poljud neighborhood in Split, fra Vjekoslav Bonifačić, asked the authorities to renovate the church, which they eventually did. On October 22, 1967, church become founding place of newly founded parish of the Holy Trinity. The nearby monastery of the Assumption of Mary is used as a parish church because of practical reasons.\n\nChurch has a central shape which is dominated by a dome that lies on six apses interconnected with pillars. The church is only of all six-apse edifices in the early medieval architecture of Dalmatia that is located in Split (the others are in the Zadar area). In addition, it's also the best preserved. The maximum external length of the church is 10.30 meters, a minimum internal length 5.90 meters, while the height of the central tambour is 9.5 meters. The church is built of limestone drowned in plaster and vaulted with a semi-dome, probably taken from some older buildings in the area.\n\nRemains of an ancient edifice with an apse that had an unknown purpose were found nearby.\n"}

MacCormack coined the term and used it as the title of her 2008 essay to describe her philosophical speculation about film, which is similar in some respects to the poststructuralist philosophy of desire by contemporary philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. While the term is somewhat vague, she uses it to describe why there is a \"desire which flows through all who want cinema as a lover,\" why film can feel erotic, whether such intense feelings may be explained by a psychic model of \"tension and release,\" and why there is this \"physical pleasure of cinema\" which sometimes manifests itself in an \"erotic and subversive\" way. Catherine Grant suggested that MacCormack has essentially reformulated the term cinephilia, a term in film criticism which denotes passionate interest in film. Two reviewers suggest that MacCormack explores the \"inherent queerness of film,\" in the sense that the relation between spectators and a film is \"inherently queer.\" According to reviewer Jill Crammond Wickham in \"Poets Quarterly\", cinesexuality can explain not only why film audiences feel such a strong desire for what they see on screen, but why \"our culture is so obsessed with movie stars.\"\n\n"}

It is currently part of the permanent collection at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nInspired by the French impressionists of the time, Childe painted vibrant, colorful lines filled with action and movement. The varying brushstrokes and loose handling of the medium, Childe shows his confident free handling. Blue ocean reflects onto the large, sun-bleached rock, while Childe’s open strokes leads the viewer’s eye back into the painting, off into the distance to the shores beyond, which are barely hinted at with lines of cream and green. Through the broken brushstrokes, Childe’s desire for realism shines through with his use of shadows and broken reflection of the water.\n\nHassam, like many American painters at the turn of the century, studied in Paris, France for three years. He adopted the impressionist style as his own, and worked closely with other American Impressionists such as Mary Cassatt. Childe is often hailed as a pure example of the American Impressionist movement.\n\nA native New Endlander, Childe heavily favored the New England area for his work, and spent his time painting much of the Atlantic Coast. This shore is the shore of Appledore, one of the nine islands that make up the Isles of Shoals, located off the coasts of New Hampshire and Maine. Appledore was the location of a small artist colony.\n\n\"Cliff Rock - Appledore\" was purchased at its inaugural exhibition in 1906 by the John Herron Art Fund.\n"}

The film is the story of Cheng Lai-sheung (Josie Ho) who saves up money to buy her dream home. After the sellers decide to turn her down, she goes into a murderous frenzy.\n\n\"Dream Home\" was originally meant to be released in October 2009 in Hong Kong but due to legal disputes between 852 Films and the director the film premiered in Italy on 23 April 2010 and in Hong Kong on 13 May. The film received mixed reviews which focused on whether or not the satirical and horrific scenes worked well together.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Cheng Lai-sheung (Josie Ho) works two jobs with the hope of earning enough money to buy her own apartment with a view of the Victoria Harbour. In mixed chronological order, we see scenes from Lai-sheung's past. In her childhood, her family and friends are evicted from their low-rent housing so that developers can build expensive flats. Later in life, she vows to buy her mother and father a new apartment, but is unable to fulfill her promise before her mother dies. When her father becomes ill, she begins searching in earnest for a new place, having an obsession for the \"Victoria Bay No. 1\" high-rise address from a childhood vow that she would one day buy a flat near the harbour so that her uncle would not have to walk there and back on a daily basis and not needing to search for him every evening.\n\nThe bank will only give her a 70% mortgage and payments would reach over $15,000. Unfortunately, because of an oversight in declaring her father's medical history, she no longer has insurance to pay for his expensive treatment and has to take a second job. After Lai-sheung does save enough for a down-payment, her father's medical bills become excessive. When she asks her married lover for a loan to cover these, he refuses. One night her father has trouble breathing and, instead of giving him his oxygen, Lai-sheung allows him to die. The insurance payment now adds enough money to her current savings to purchase her dream flat.\n\nOn her way to finalize the purchase, there is a hike in the stock market that makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Lai-sheung into a frenzy where she goes to the flats and attacks people who live and work there, killing them with low-tech, household items. During the course of the final killings, the police arrive at the flat, demanding entry. A struggle ensues during which both officers are killed.\n\nReturning to her day job, Lai-sheung receives a call from her agent saying the owners of the flat she wishes to buy are willing to sell after all. Lai-sheung suggests that they might want to sell for a lower price, since there were 11 murders in the building the previous evening. That night, Lai-sheung's lover comes round to pick her up, but she turns her back on him and walks away, ending their relationship. The film concludes with Lai-sheung staring out at the harbour as newscasts discuss how America's worsening subprime mortgage crisis is beginning to have global repercussions.\n\n\n\"Dream Home\" was the first feature production from Josie Ho's film financing and production studio 852 Films. Josie did research and found that horror films were the best selling genre for films which led to the idea of producing one. She was also influenced by the Hong Kong action film \"The Story of Riki\" proclaiming that she had \"never seen such an outrageous film from Hong Kong before\" and thought that \"if that could be done, why can't we do the same\"?\n\nDirector and writer Pang Ho-cheung worked on the script in 2007. Pang stated he wanted to write a film about the average Hong Kong citizen facing the local inflated property market. Pang searched Hong Kong to make sure that no property name matched the one in his film stating that \"otherwise, we'd be in real trouble\". He chose to make the story a slasher film saying that he had always loved Hollywood b-movies. The film was set to start filming 27 March 2009 in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay area. Pang believed that music and lighting were important in slasher films and hired Wong Kar-wai's regular light man Wong Chi-ming and Italian composer Gabriele Roberto. Roberto had previously worked with Pang on his film \"Exodus\". The film includes documentary footage of protesters against the demolition of Queen's Pier in 2007.\n\n\"Dream Home\" finished filming around May 2009. It was originally set to be released in October 2009 in Hong Kong. The film was delayed due to legal disputes between the company and director Pang Ho-cheung. Despite the dispute, Pang continued to work on post-production on the film stating that he had not \"received any message telling me to stop working on it\". Josie Ho stated that she pushed Pang to make the film more violent and outrageous while Pang wanted the film to be \"more violent in a realistic manner\". \"Dream Home\"'s worldwide rights were bought by Fortissimo Films.\n\n\"Dream Home\" had its world premiere at the Far East Film Festival on 23 April 2010 in Udine, Italy. Two audience members vomited and one fainted during the Udine premiere. The North American premiere was at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010. On 25 July 2010, the film had its Canadian premiere at the Fantasia Festival where the film won the Bronze audience award for \"Best Asian Film\". The film premiered in the United Kingdom on 28 August 2010 at the London FrightFest Film Festival.\n\nThe film was released in Hong Kong on 13 May 2010. The film debuted at fourth place at Hong Kong box office earning $171,351 on its first week. The film ran for six weeks in Hong Kong grossing $378,650 in total. \"Variety\" suggested that the mid-May opening date was \"overshadowed by the socko B.O. of \"Ip Man 2\"\". \"Dream Home\" was shown at the Sitges Film Festival where it won awards for Best Make Up FX (Vitaya Deerattakul and Andrew Lin) and Best Actress (Josie Ho). \"Dream Home\" was released theatrically and on video-on-demand in North America by the Independent Film Channel in early 2011. In the United Kingdom, Network DVD scheduled the film for a Region 2 PAL DVD release on 28 March 2011.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews after its festival showings. \"Variety\" praised the film, describing it as a \"deliciously dark take on the dog-eat-dog Hong Kong housing market...another slickly produced, femme-driven item from local multihyphenate Pang (aka Edmond Pang), with its intricate editing and dash of capitalist critique adding some gloss and a hint of topicality to the blood-soaked proceedings.\" After its showing at the Tribeca Film Festival, Salon.com declared it as one of the best films of the whole festival. The \"Montreal Gazette\" wrote that the film was \"really well done but also really gory\". \"Screen Daily\" gave the film a positive review, stating that \"with its clever packaging and slasher credentials, the film will be grossing out viewers on the festival circuit and home video markets for some time to come\" and that \"Josie Ho in the lead role is focused but a bit wooden...Nonetheless Pang's direction is tight and cinematography by Yu Lik-wai is unobtrusively effective.\" In New Zealand, 3 News gave the film five stars, calling it \"a classy, clever film with an interesting story that is a darkly comic take on Hong Kong’s ever increasing property prices\".\n\nFilm Business Asia gave the film a six out of ten rating, writing that the film \"starts with a brilliant idea and has some great moments along the way but, as so often, doesn't quite manage to make all the bits cohere as the audience expects.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the film a negative review, finding that the social observation of the film is lost to the \"increasingly unrealistic and grotesque splatter material.\" \"Time Out\" gave the film a three out of six rating, opining that it is \"rendered with tremendous style but with little narrative intrigue, it's a shame that the macabre humour gracing \"Dream Home's\" (literally) eye-popping extreme violence doesn’t extend to its portrayal of Cheng’s hardship.\" Kim Newman in \"Empire\" gave the film three stars out of five stating that \"there's an undeniable sense of liberation in the killing frenzy, though some scenes (the asphyxiation of a pregnant woman using a vacuum cleaner attachment) will cross a line for many.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 74%, based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.3/10.\n\n"}

It works around the digital rights management built into online-store-published e-books by limiting access to a purchased e-book file to the borrower, resulting in loss of access to the file by the purchaser for the duration of the borrowing period.\n\nE-book lending has become an increasing practice in the early 2010s for public libraries as well as independent e-book lending communities; the latter is increasingly viable, especially for books which are not available in the Amazon Kindle's Kindle Format, Mobipocket or Barnes & Noble Nook formats. Websites such as Lendle.me and BookLending.com have emerged to facilitate lending and borrowing of books between strangers. In a survey of interlibrary loan librarians it was found that 92% of libraries held ebooks in their collections and that 27% of those libraries had negotiated interlibrary loan rights for some of their ebooks. This survey found significant barriers to conducting interlibrary loan for ebooks. Demand-driven acquisition (DDA) has been around for a few years in public libraries, which allows vendors to streamline the acquisition process by offering to match a library's selection profile to the vendor's e-book titles. The library's catalog is then populated with records for all the e-books that match the profile. The decision to purchase the title is left to the patrons, although the library can set purchasing conditions such as a maximum price and purchasing caps so that the dedicated funds are spent according to the library's budget.\nThe 2012 meeting of the Association of American University Presses included a panel on Patron-driven acquisition (PDA) of books produced by university presses based on a preliminary report by Joseph Esposito, a digital publishing consultant who has studied the implications of PDA with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nAs of 2014, over 90% of U.S. public libraries offer ebook lending. Many of those libraries use OverDrive, which provides ebook access to about 26,000 libraries and schools in the U.S. Overdrive is the only lending service that works with the Amazon Kindle.\n\nSome publishers have feared that making books available for loan may deter people from buying the books. However, ebook lending has the potential to increase the discoverability of books, encouraging readers to try out new authors and genres, resulting in increased purchases.\n\nIn December 2010, Amazon introduced the ability for Kindle users to lend ebooks to friends for a 14-day period. However, not all books support lending.\n\nAmazon operates a \"Kindle Owners' Lending Library\" that enables paid Amazon Prime users to borrow from a collection of over 600,000 ebooks without any due date, with books being delivered to Kindle and Kindle Fire devices, but not to the free Kindle reading apps for other platforms. The same book can be borrowed by a number of users at the same time, and users may keep a book for as long as they want. Alternatively, the books that are available in public domain can be downloaded in different formats from many sites like archive.org etc.\n"}

These out-of-continuity stories eventually came to be called \"Imaginary Stories\".\n\nThe title page of \"Superman, Cartoon Hero!\" stated that the story was \"Our first imaginary story\", and continued to say: \"In 1942, a series of Superman shorts started showing throughout the U.S.! So, with tongue firmly in cheek, the DC team turned out this story of what might have happened if Lois Lane had decided to see... Superman, Cartoon Hero!\". The story opens with Lois determined to learn Superman's secret identity and going to the theater to see the Max Fleisher \"Superman\" short \"Mad Scientist\" in hopes of seeing the animated Man of Steel reveal his secret identity. In addition to other things, when the opening credits roll and state that the cartoons are based on DC Comics, Lois Lane states that she has never heard of DC Comics. Clark Kent then wonders if the people there are clairvoyant. In the final panel, Clark Kent exchanges a knowing wink with the image of himself as Superman on the movie screen.\n\nCraig Shutt, author of the \"Comics Buyer's Guide\" column \"Ask Mr. Silver Age\", states that true imaginary stories differed from stories that were dreams and hoaxes. Dreams and hoaxes were \"gyps\" on account of \"not having happened\" whilst true imaginary stories were canonical at least unto themselves. Also, since they were \"just\" imaginary and thus had no bearing on the characters’ regular stories, imaginary stories could show things like people dying and the victory of evil. In the optimistic and hopeful Silver Age of Comics, such stories usually would not be told; this was hinted with writers telling readers how such an Imaginary Story often reassured the readers that it did not really happen.\n\nMost of these imaginary stories featured alternate histories of characters, such as \"The Amazing Story of Superman-Red and Superman Blue!\". There, readers saw possible pasts that could have happened, but did not happen. One such story has Superman being raised by apes in imitation of Tarzan, an idea that would be recycled into a later \"Elseworlds\" tale where Tarzan and Superman were switched at birth. Possible present times were shown, such as one story where Jonathan and Martha Kent, touched by pity, adopt a recently orphaned Bruce Wayne and raise him along with their own son, Clark. Thus, the present shows Superman and Batman as brothers, with Clark protecting Gotham and working for the \"Gotham Gazette\" instead of living in Metropolis, and Batman inviting his foster parents, the Kents, to live with him in Wayne Manor. In keeping with the fact that imaginary stories allowed for much grimmer stories than usual, the story ended with Lex Luthor killing the Kents and Batman trying to murder him in revenge.\nPossible futures that \"could very well happen\" were explored, such as Clark Kent revealing to Lois Lane his secret identity and marrying her. Futures that \"perhaps never will\" happen were also examined, such as the permanent death of Superman. \"Imaginary Stories\" appeared often enough that some comics – such as \"Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane\" #15 (February 1960), the cover of which appears to depict Superman marrying Lois Lane – had to assure readers that their contents were not \"imaginary\". The cover of \"Lois Lane\" #59 (August 1965), by contrast, promised that its depiction of Lois as romantic rival of Lara, Jor-El's girlfriend and future mother of Superman, was \"real--not imaginary!\".\n\nA few \"Imaginary Stories\" appeared in other DC publications. Batman editor Jack Schiff supervised stories in which the Dark Knight starts a family or loses his identity, though these were revealed at the end of the story to be stories written by Alfred. Schiff's stories were notable for the first appearance of the original Bruce Wayne Junior. Writer/editor Robert Kanigher supervised Wonder Woman's own series of \"Imaginary Stories\" called \"Impossible Tales\" which featured the same principle. There, Wonder Woman appeared along with her younger selves, Wonder Girl and Wonder Tot. However, the majority of \"Imaginary Stories\" were published in various Superman comics under the guidance of Superman editor Mort Weisinger, the \"King of Imaginary Stories\". This was in part because, according to Shutt, Weisinger aimed for younger readers instead of older ones. Later editors such as Julius Schwartz rarely used the \"Imaginary Stories\" concept.\n\nAlan Moore's \"?\" two-part story in \"Superman\" #423 and \"Action Comics\" #583 in 1986 was the last Pre-\"Crisis\" story to use the \"Imaginary Stories\" label.\n\nThe first \"Elseworlds\" title was \"Gotham by Gaslight\" (1989), written by Brian Augustyn and drawn by Mike Mignola, which featured a Victorian Age version of the superhero Batman hunting Jack the Ripper, who had come to Gotham City. The title was not originally published as an \"Elseworlds\" comic, but its success led to the creation of the \"Elseworlds\" imprint and this title was retroactively declared the first \"Elseworlds\" story. The first book to feature the \"Elseworlds\" logo was \"\" in 1991. In 1994, the \"Elseworlds\" imprint was used as the theme for the annual edition comic books of that summer.\n\nDC sporadically published various \"Elseworlds\" titles from 1989 to 2003. In August 2003, editor Mike Carlin mentioned that DC had scaled back the production of \"Elseworlds\" books in order to \"put the luster back on them.\" Several titles that were announced as \"Elseworlds\" books prior to this, such as \"Superman & Batman: Generations IV\" and \"The Teen Titans Swingin' Elseworlds Special\", were cancelled. The planned \"Teen Titans\" tale was released in January 2008 as the \"Teen Titans Lost Annual\".\n\nIn September 2009, Dan DiDio revealed the return of the \"Elseworlds\" imprint as a series of Prestige Format books, with the approach of taking the basic concepts and origins of DC characters and twisting them in various ways. The only \"Elseworlds\" story released under the initiative was the three-issue miniseries \"Superman: The Last Family of Krypton\", published from August to October 2010, which told the story of baby Kal-El reaching Earth with his mother and father and how the world handles the emergence of a superpowered family.\n\nAlthough the \"Elseworlds\" imprint was created to feature stories separate from DC continuity, concepts from various \"Elseworlds\" stories were incorporated into DC continuity at various times.\n\n\"The Kingdom\" miniseries in 1999 brought the \"Kingdom Come\" miniseries into DC continuity as part of a series of alternate timelines known as Hypertime, which included some of the alternate worlds depicted in various \"Elseworlds\" titles.\n\nA new Multiverse was introduced at the conclusion of the \"52\" weekly series that includes alternate worlds that were previously seen in various \"Elseworlds\" titles.\n\nThe fifth annual crossover of the Arrowverse series is set to be titled \"Elseworlds\", and will include \"The Flash\", \"Arrow\" and \"Supergirl\". This crossover will introduce Batwoman, Gotham City, Nora Fries, and Lois Lane to the Arrowverse, and is set to air on December 9–11, 2018 on The CW.\n\n"}
{"id": "7580209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7580209", "title": "Exhibition catalogue", "text": "Exhibition catalogue\n\nThere are two types of exhibition catalogue (or exhibition catalog): a printed list of exhibits at an art exhibition; and a directory of exhibitors at a trade fair or business-to-business event.\n\nCatalogues for art or museum exhibitions may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish hardcover \"coffee table book\". The advent of cheap colour-printing in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple \"handlists\" with several works to each page into large scale \"descriptive catalogues\" that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers. The catalogues for exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. \nIn the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues in the form of substantial books.\n\nBook-sized exhibition catalogues in the West typically have a colour photograph of every item on display, and also of other relevant works not in the exhibition (these usually smaller and often in black and white). There will be a short formal catalogue description of each item, and usually interpretative text often amounting to one or more pages. The resulting book will have at least one introductory essay, often several, footnotes, bibliography and other critical apparatus. It is usually only in the language of the location, although if the exhibition is travelling internationally, local translated editions will be produced for each location. The book may be published by the institution that hosts the exhibition (or one of these institutions), but is distributed by and often co-published with a larger publisher. It will not dwell on the fact that it is the catalogue of a particular exhibition, and often will not contain a plan of the exhibition. Visitors to the exhibition will anyway know this, and the intention - often successful - is to create a book which has a permanent usefulness. Nearly all are produced in paperback; a hardback edition is a sign of serious intentions. Most major catalogues are sold in at least some bookshops, and are available for order more widely through the booktrade. Many receive specific sponsorship to finance them, and usually a number of authors contribute.\nIn recent decades, exhibition catalogues have grown to prodigious sizes and may be the most comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas. Probably the largest to be produced were in the 1970s in a competitive spree by Italian provinces and German lander to promote the significance of their region by mounting huge exhibitions on the period when its cultural production was at its peak. A typical example is the three-volume \"Die \"Parler\" und der schöne Stil 1350-1400. Europäische Kunst unter den Luxemburgern\" from Cologne of 1978, with a further two volumes published in 1980 on a colloquium held in conjunction with the exhibition. The three volumes covering the exhibition proper amount to over a thousand pages and it would have been unfeasible to have taken them into the exhibition itself. Another example is \"The History of Japanese Photography,\" 432 pages long and with over four hundred plates.\n\nThis trend was led in Britain by the Royal Academy of Arts and in the USA by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.\n\nJapanese exhibition catalogues often provide captions, a certain amount of text, or both in a second language (usually English), and occasionally also a smaller amount in a third language. This is not always so: the large catalogue (over 360 pages) for a major exhibition of the wood-block artist Yasunori Taninaka is in Japanese alone. Meanwhile, \"Works by 25 Photographers in their 20s\" is completely bilingual, Japanese and English.\n\nThe great majority of Japanese exhibition catalogues are only available directly from the galleries or museums that host or hosted the exhibitions. These catalogues are acquired and shelved by libraries together with other books and are available on the used book market, but lack ISBNs. However, exceptions do exist: the catalogue of an exhibition of the photographs of Nakaji Yasui was produced via an independent publisher and distributed as a regular book.\n\nExhibition catalogues are used at commercial exhibitions and trade fairs to profile all the exhibitors at the event. They serve not only as a guide for visitors on the day, but also as an industry directory used afterwards by visitors (and others) to find suppliers and business partners.\n\nMany exhibition catalogues are used by market researchers because they contain good quality information about companies that are active in a particular market place.\n\nA typical exhibition catalogue contains the following: \n\nThe format of exhibition catalogues for trade fairs can range from A5-sized ‘saddle-stitched’ publications with descriptions of as few as 30-40 exhibitors, to much larger perfect-bound ‘stretched A5’ or A4-sized directories containing profiles on thousands of companies exhibiting at major international trade events such as The London Book Fair, SIAL (the Paris-based food exhibition), and Nuremberg International Toy Fair (Spielwarenmesse).\n\nThe exhibition organiser is ultimately responsible for publishing the catalogue for their own event. However, many organisers outsource the design, production and advertising sales for these publications to specialist exhibition catalogue contract publishers operating within the exhibitions industry.\n\nOther common terms to describe the exhibition catalogue at a trade fair include 'event guide', 'show guide', 'show catalogue', 'exhibition directory', 'fair guide' or 'exhibition guide'. Often exhibition organisers will add the word 'official' to the front of the name of the publication (e.g. 'Official exhibition catalogue') to distinguish their publication from unofficial exhibition catalogues for their event produced by trade magazine publishers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14632149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14632149", "title": "Facsimile", "text": "Facsimile\n\nA facsimile (from Latin \"fac simile\" (to 'make alike')) is a copy or reproduction of an old book, manuscript, map, art print, or other item of historical value that is as true to the original source as possible. It differs from other forms of reproduction by attempting to replicate the source as accurately as possible in scale, color, condition, and other material qualities. For books and manuscripts, this also entails a complete copy of all pages; hence, an incomplete copy is a \"partial facsimile\". Facsimiles are sometimes used by scholars to research a source that they do not have access to otherwise, and by museums and archives for media preservation and conservation. Many are sold commercially, often accompanied by a volume of commentary. They may be produced in limited editions, typically of 500–2,000 copies, and cost the equivalent of a few thousand United States dollars. The term \"fax\" is a shortened form of \"facsimile\" though most faxes are not reproductions of the quality expected in a true facsimile.\n\nAdvances in the art of facsimile are closely related to advances in printmaking. Maps, for instance, were the focus of early explorations in making facsimiles, although these examples often lack the rigidity to the original source that is now expected. An early example is the Abraham Ortelius map (1598). Innovations during the 18th century, especially in the realms of lithography and aquatint, facilitated an explosion in the number of facsimiles of old master drawings that could be studied from afar.\n\nImportant illuminated manuscripts like Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry are not only on display to the public as facsimiles, but available in high quality to scholars. However, unlike normal book reproductions, facsimiles remain truer to the original colors—which is especially important for illuminated manuscripts—and preserve defects.\n\nFacsimiles are best suited to printed or hand-written documents, and not to items such as three-dimensional objects or oil paintings with unique surface texture. Reproductions of those latter objects are often referred to as replicas.\n\n"}
{"id": "3351338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3351338", "title": "Ferenc Kalmar", "text": "Ferenc Kalmar\n\nFerenc Kalmar was born in 1928 in Subotica). He was a Serbian and Hungarian sculptor, living in Vojvodina. He died in 2013.\n\nFerenc Kalmar was born in Subotica (Kingdom of Yugoslavia) on 25 May 1928. He began doing sculptures in 1947. He had his first solo exhibition in Subotica in 1956. During more than six decades of rich creative work he produced a unique oeuvre which revealed his inquisitive and exploitative mind. His universality is seen in his interest in various materials: ceramics, metal, wood and frequent change of medium, until his ultimate surrender to raw, magnetic energy of the unity of painting and sculpture, expressed in coloured wood sculptures. He died in his atelier in Subotica (Serbia) in 2013.\n\nAt the beginning of the eighties, coloured wood successfully and permanently ranked Ferend Kalmar among artists of outsider art in Serbia. His journey to the United States (in the early eighties) when he was fascinated with the art of distant Indian culture, Mayan art and reliefs on Egyptian tombstones stimulated new sources of inspiration, changed his philosophy of living and artistic perception. He watched Indian ritual dances where exotic dancers decorated with feathers, flowers and turquoise flitted like birds in the wind. \nAs an explicitly authentic artist, the explorer of primordial unity, in the era of incredible speed and smoke of high technologies he provided us with the reminiscences of lost dimensions of everlasting childhood. With deep and surface incisions, the artist achieved the dynamics of closed and open, sharp and rounded forms, a dance of light and shadow. He coloured his figures with strong and bright tint and frequent interchanges of red and green, blue and yellow. The colour always followed the development of volume, whether related to gorgeous branching or delicately stylized and calm forms. The combination of the sculptural and the pictorial bears witness of the artist's complexity and expressiveness with additional help of naturally \"blooming\" forms, and nearly fauvist, wild tint. Kalmar the sculptor is sometimes overmastered by Kalmar the painter! The mere procedure of embodiment of the artist’s idea is an indispensable ritual where the artist and wood intertwine, surrender, snatch and combine. Animals are basic objects of Kalmar's inspiration: birds, bugs, lizards, grasshoppers, butterflies. His artistic \"credo\" is fully expressed in monumental and brightly painted birds. \n“Birds are divine creatures. Man is astonished with their grace and tenderness. Monuments should be erected to these beautiful creatures because our generations may be the last who are lucky to listen to nightingales in nature” he used to say.\n\nThe numerous collection of his sculptures is at Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia. \nHe exhibited worldwide and he was awarded several times. \nThe most significant awards are \"Forum’s Prize for Art\" Novi Sad, Serbia, 1993) and the \"Award for Entire Artistic Work\" at the Thirteenth International Biennial of Naïve and Marginal Art, MNMA, Jagodina, 2007.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11065202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11065202", "title": "Film criticism", "text": "Film criticism\n\nFilm criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films and the film medium. The concept is often used interchangeably with that of film reviews. A film review implies a recommendation aimed at consumers, however not all film criticism takes the form of reviews.\n\nIn general, film criticism can be divided into two categories: journalistic criticism which appears regularly in newspapers, magazines and other popular mass-media outlets; and academic criticism by film scholars who are informed by film theory and are published in academic journals. Academic film criticism rarely takes the form of a review; instead it is more likely to analyse the film and its place within the history of its genre, or the whole of film history.\n\nFilm was introduced in the late 19th century. The earliest artistic criticism of film emerged in the early 1900s. The first paper to serve as a critique of film came out of \"The Optical Lantern and Cinematograph Journal,\" followed by the \"Bioscope\" in 1908.\n\nFilm is a relatively new form of art, in comparison to music, literature and painting which have existed since ancient times. Because of this, early writing on film sought to argue that films could also be respected as art. In 1911, Ricciotto Canudo wrote a manifesto proclaiming cinema to be the \"Sixth Art\" (later \"Seventh Art\"). For many decades after, film was still being treated with less prestige than longer-established art forms.\n\nBy the 1920s, critics were analyzing film for its merit and value as more than just entertainment. The growing popularity of the medium caused major newspapers to start hiring film critics. In the 1930s, the film industry developed concepts of stardom and celebrity in relation to actors, which led to a rise in obsession with critics as well, to the point that they were often seen on \"red carpet\" and at major events with the actors.\n\nIt was in the 1940s that new forms of criticism emerged. Essays analyzing films with a distinctive charm and style to persuade the reader of the critic's argument. It was the emergence of these styles that brought film criticism to the mainstream, gaining the attention of many popular magazines; this made film reviews and critiques an eventual staple among most print media. As the decades passed, the fame for critics grew and gave rise to household names among the craft like James Agee, Andrew Sarris, Pauline Kael and in modern times Roger Ebert and Peter Travers.\n\nFilm critics working for newspapers, magazines, broadcast media, and online publications, mainly review new releases, although also review older films. An important task for these reviews is to inform readers on whether or not they would want to see the film. A film review will typically explain the premise of the film before discussing its merits. The verdict is often summarised with a form of rating. Numerous rating systems exist, such as 5- or 4-star scales, academic-style grades and pictograms (such as in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\").\nSome well-known journalistic critics have included: James Agee (\"Time\" (magazine), \"The Nation\"); Vincent Canby (\"The New York Times\"); Roger Ebert (\"Chicago Sun-Times\"); Mark Kermode (\"BBC\", \"The Observer\"); James Berardinelli; Philip French (\"The Observer\"); Pauline Kael (\"The New Yorker\"); Manny Farber (\"The New Republic\", \"Time\", \"The Nation\"); Peter Bradshaw (\"The Guardian\"); Michael Phillips (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Andrew Sarris (\"The Village Voice\"); Joel Siegel (\"Good Morning America\"); Jonathan Rosenbaum (\"Chicago Reader\"); and Christy Lemire (\"What The Flick?!\").\n\nRoger Ebert and Gene Siskel popularised the concept of reviewing films in a television format in the show \"Siskel & Ebert At the Movies\" which became syndicated in the 1980s. Both critics had established their careers in print media, and continued to write written reviews for their respective newspapers alongside their television show.\n\nSome websites, such as Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, seek to improve the usefulness of film reviews by compiling them and assigning a score to each in order to gauge the general reception a film receives.\n\nBlogging has also introduced opportunities for a new wave of amateur film critics to have their opinions heard. These review blogs may focus on one genre, director or actor, or encompass a much wider variety of films. Friends, friends of friends, or strangers are able to visit these blogsites, and can often leave their own comments about the movie and/or the author's review. Although much less frequented than their professional counterparts, these sites can gather a following of like-minded people who look to specific bloggers for reviews as they have found that the critic consistently exhibits an outlook very similar to their own. YouTube has also served as a platform for amateur film critics.\n\nSome websites specialize in narrow aspects of film reviewing. For instance, there are sites that focus on specific content advisories for parents to judge a film's suitability for children. Others focus on a religious perspective (e.g. CAP Alert). Still others highlight more esoteric subjects such as the depiction of science in fiction films. One such example is \"Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics\" by Intuitor. Some online niche websites provide comprehensive coverage of the independent sector; usually adopting a style closer to print journalism. They tend to prohibit adverts and offer uncompromising opinions free of any commercial interest. Their film critics normally have an academic film background.\n\nThe Online Film Critics Society, an international professional association of Internet-based cinema reviewers, consists of writers from all over the world, while New York Film Critics Online members handle reviews in the New York tri-state area.\n\nA number of websites allow Internet users to submit movie reviews and aggregate them into an average. Community-driven review sites have allowed the common movie goer to express their opinion on films. Many of these sites allow users to rate films on a 0 to 10 scale, while some rely on the star rating system of 1–5, 0–5 or 0–4 stars. The votes are then culled into an overall rating and ranking for any particular film. Some of these community driven review sites include Reviewer, Movie Attractions, Flixster, FilmCrave, Flickchart and Everyone's a Critic. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic aggregate both scores from accredited critics and those submitted by users.\n\nOn these online review sites, users generally only have to register with the site in order to submit reviews. This means that they are a form of open access poll, and have the same advantages and disadvantages; notably, there is no guarantee that they will be a representative sample of the film's audience. In some cases, online review sites have produced wildly differing results to scientific polling of audiences.\n\nThe emerging big data science has enabled computing to understand user's taste from reviews and connect them with similar users so that networked Tribe can be a great source of recommendations. Most review aggregators indirectly influence the herd mentality in us while critic reviewers are just one opinion among many. CineBee, a machine learning based approach to reviews and opinions, helps isolate user's taste from their reviews and connects similar users. As these Tribes are formed, CineBee uses the Tribe intelligence to provide recommendation, prediction and discovery to its users. \n\nMore often known as film theory or film studies, academic critique explores cinema beyond journalistic film reviews. These film critics try to examine why film works, how it works aesthetically or politically, what it means, and what effects it has on people. Rather than write for mass-market publications their articles are usually published in scholarly journals and texts which tend to be affiliated with university presses; or sometimes in up-market magazines.\n\nMost academic criticism of film often follows a similar format. They usually include summaries of the plot of the film to either refresh the plot to the reader, or reinforce an idea of repetition in the film's genre. After this, there tends to be discussions about the cultural context, major themes and repetitions, and details about the legacy of the film.\n\nSome notable academic film critics include André Bazin, Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut (all writers for \"Cahiers du Cinéma\"); Kristin Thompson, David Bordwell, and Sergei Eisenstein. Godard, Truffaut and Eisenstein were also film directors.\n\nIn the 2000s, the effect that reviews have on a film's box office performance and DVD rentals/sales have become a matter for debate. Some analysts argue that modern movie marketing, using pop culture convention appearances (e.g., Comicon) and social media along with traditional means of advertising, has led, in part, to a decline in the readership of many reviewers for newspapers and other print publications. There are fewer critics on television and radio in the last thirty years.\n\nHowever, in recent years, there has been a growing belief in the film industry that critic aggregators (especially Rotten Tomatoes) are increasing the collective influence of film critics. The underperformance of several films in 2017 was blamed on their low scores on Rotten Tomatoes. This has led to studies such as one commissioned by 20th Century Fox claiming that younger viewers give the website more credibility than the major studio marketing, which undercuts its effectiveness.\n\nToday, fan-run film analysis websites like Box Office Prophets, CineBee and Box Office Guru routinely factor more into the opinions of the general public on films produced.\n\nThe \"undulating curve of shifting expectations\" (UCoSE) refers to both the title of a recurring entertainment industry feature in \"New York\" magazine by cultural critic Adam Sternbergh and also to a concept of media analysis co-developed by writer Emily Nussbaum.\n\nUCoSE refers to the dynamic tension between pre-release promotional efforts and subsequent audience reactions to entertainment media.…what the UCoSE does is provide us a way of analyzing the trajectory of entertainment products as they metamorphize their way through his theorized seven-stage growth chart: Pre-Buzz, Buzz, Rave Reviews, Saturation Point, Overhyped, Backlash, and finally, Backlash To The Backlash.\n\nThere have been many complaints against the film-criticism industry for its underrepresentation of women. A study of the top critics on Rotten Tomatoes shows that 91 per cent of writers for movie/entertainment magazines and websites are men, as are 90 per cent of those for trade publications, 80 per cent of critics for general interest magazines like Time, and 70 per cent of reviewers for radio formats such as NPR.\n\nWriting for \"The Atlantic\", Kate Kilkenny argued that women were better represented in film criticism before the rise of the Internet. In the past, when film was considered less prestigious than visual art and literature, it was easier for women to break into film criticism. Judith Crist and Pauline Kael were two of the most influential film critics of the 1960s and 1970s. The Internet led to a decline in jobs at small newspapers where women were more likely to review films, whereas the more male-dominated jobs at major newspapers survived better. The Internet also encouraged a growth in niche review websites that were even more male-dominated than older media. Kilkenny also suggested that the shortage of female critics was related to the shortage of female opinion columnists.\n\nClem Bastow, culture writer at \"The Guardian Australia\", discussed the possible effects of this on the critical response to the 2015 film \"The Intern\", which received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics:The critical response to \"The Intern\" was fascinating. There’s a subset of male critics that clearly see Nancy Meyers as code for chick flick and react with according bile. What’s very interesting, though, is that I think female critics, working in an industry that is coded as very male, if not macho, often feel the need to go hard on certain films for women, presumably because they worry that they’ll be dismissed, critically speaking, if they praise a film like \"The Intern\" as though they’re only reviewing it favorably because they’re women. \n\nAs of 2013 film critics make about $82,000. Newspaper and Magazine critics would make $27,364-$49,574. Online movie critics would make $2-$200 per review. TV critics would make up to $40,000-$60,000 per month.\n\n\n"}

Its products were part of the so-called \"purple games\" segment of girls' games, which based its games on market research into the preferences and tastes of young girls. Because these tended to be stereotypically feminine interests such as gossip, relationships and makeup, \"purple games\" were criticized by feminists who considered them too prescriptive. Purple Moon's games did not perform well commercially, and the company was bought by Mattel in 1999.\n\nThe FEMICOM Museum is an organization, founded in 2012, that seeks to preserve these games and raise public awareness about them. A panel at the 2015 IndieCade Festival discussed their history.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "857078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857078", "title": "Golden calf", "text": "Golden calf\n\nAccording to the Bible, the golden calf (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב \" ‘ēggel hazāhāv\") was an idol (a cult image) made by the Israelites during Moses' absence, when he went up to Mount Sinai. In Hebrew, the incident is known as \"ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel\" (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or \"The Sin of the Calf\". It is first mentioned in .\n\nBull worship was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the Exodus narrative the Hebrews had recently come, the Apis Bull was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of religious assimilation and syncretism. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the ancient Near East and in the Aegean, the aurochs, the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the Lunar Bull and as the creature of El.\n\nWhen Moses went up into Biblical Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments (), he left the Israelites for forty days and forty nights. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that Aaron make them \"gods\" to go before them (). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a \"molten calf\" and they declared: \"These \"[be]\" thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\" (Exodus 32:4)\n\nAaron built an altar before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the . So they rose up early the next day and \"offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\" (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared (), and God \"repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people.\"\n\nMoses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two Tablets of Stone, breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ().\n\nThe Bible records that the tribe of Levi did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the 's side, let him come unto me.' And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the , the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ()\n\nThe golden calf is mentioned in .\nThe language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1 Kings are written by Deuteronomistic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus 32:4 where \"gods\" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.\n\nConversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between \"gods\" in Exodus 32 and \"God\" in Nehemiah 9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew \"elohim\" is used. Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish \"elohim\" God (known as the majestic plural) from \"elohim\" gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a) context or (b) adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus 32, the verb is in the 3rd person plural. In Nehemiah 9, the verb connected to \"elohim\" is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000 years apart: Exodus (by Moses) \"circa\" 1500 BCE, and Nehemiah \"circa\" 500 BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.\n\nAccording to , after Jeroboam establishes the northern Kingdom of Israel, he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.\nHis concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern Kingdom of Judah, would lead to a return to King Rehoboam. He makes two golden calves and places them in Bethel and Dan. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the \"cherubim\" built by King Solomon in Jerusalem.\n\nRichard Elliott Friedman says \"at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people.\" Friedman believes that the story was turned into a polemic, exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.\n\nThe declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: \nAfter making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).\n\nIn \"Legends of the Jews\", the Conservative rabbi and scholar Louis Ginzberg wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in their exodus from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by Aaron.\n\nThe devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at passing through the Red Sea, when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt. After seeing Hur son of Miriam who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, Aaron was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.\n\nAlso there would be among the Israelites no priestly caste, and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the tribe of Levi as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.\n\nThe incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the Quran and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to Mount Sinai for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to fast for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (\"Harun\") was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names Samiri raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had. Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt. There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned. The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.\n\nReturning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness (Qur'an 7:167-174). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his soul had suggested it to him. Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness. The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake. Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and resurrected them and they continued on their journey.\n\nIn the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been shirk (), the sin of idolatry or polytheism. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than Allah, or more literally the establishment of \"partners\" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.\n\nDespite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to Michael Coogan, it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a false god. He cites as evidence:\n\nAnother understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne. This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the ark of the covenant or the cherubim upon which Yahweh was enthroned.\n\nThe reason for this complication may be understood as\nThe second explanation relies on the \"sin of Jeroboam,\" who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722 BCE. Jeroboam’s \"sin\" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to Bethel as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to Dan as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1 Kings 12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern Kingdom of Judah, after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom. Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the cherubim of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.\n\nThe documentary hypothesis can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by E (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and J (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, \"the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light,\" and the worship of the calf was depicted as \"polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy\" (see Exodus 32:6). When compiling the narratives, P (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.\n\nAlternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the Ten Commandments by Moses when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the Ark of the Covenant. \"The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments.\" \n\nAs to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus 20) and J (Exodus 34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story. The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus 20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.\n\nArchaeologists Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"\n\nA metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the \"gold\" part of \"golden calf\" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish where Mammon, the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was a patron of Irish writer James Joyce.\n\nHarriet Shaw Weaver was born in Frodsham, Cheshire, the sixth of eight children of Frederic Poynton Weaver, a doctor, and Mary (née Wright) Weaver, a wealthy heiress. She was educated privately by a governess, Miss Marion Spooner, until 1894, initially in Cheshire and later in Hampstead. Her parents denied her wish to go to university. She decided to become a social worker. After attending a course on the economic basis of social relations at the London School of Economics she became involved in women's suffrage and joined the Women's Social and Political Union.\nIn 1911 she began subscribing to \"The Freewoman: A Weekly Feminist Review\", a radical periodical edited by Dora Marsden and Mary Gawthorpe. The following year its proprietors withdrew their support from it and Weaver stepped in to save it from financial ruin. In 1913 it was renamed \"The New Freewoman\". Later that year at the suggestion of the magazine's literary editor, Ezra Pound, the name was changed again to \"The Egoist\". During the following years Weaver made more financial donations to the periodical, becoming more involved with its organisation and also becoming its editor.\n\nEzra Pound was involved with finding new contributors and one of these was James Joyce. Weaver was convinced of his genius and started to support him, first by serialising \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in \"The Egoist\" in 1914. When Joyce could not find anyone to publish it as a book, Weaver set up the Egoist Press for this purpose at her own expense. Joyce's \"Ulysses\" was then serialised in The Egoist but because of its controversial content it was rejected by all the printers approached by Weaver and she arranged for it to be printed abroad. Weaver continued to give considerable support to Joyce and his family but following her reservations about his work that was to become \"Finnegans Wake\", their relationship became strained and then virtually broken. However, on Joyce's death, Weaver paid for his funeral and acted as his executor.\n\nIn 1931 Weaver joined the Labour Party but then, having been influenced by reading Marx's \"Das Kapital\" she joined the Communist Party in 1938. She was active in this organisation, taking part in demonstrations and selling copies of the \"Daily Worker\". She also continued her allegiance to the memory of Joyce, acting as his literary executor and helping to compile \"The Letters of James Joyce\". She died at her home near Saffron Walden in 1961, aged 85, leaving her collection of literary material to the British Library and to the National Book League.\n\n"}

Lauren decides to free him so he does not lose his job, and he tells her she is jealous that she did not get a kiss, so she slaps him. Joey is working at R&R when he sees Lauren flirting with a group of men so he throws them out and takes Lauren home. Lauren drunkenly kisses Joey but he rejects her. The following day, Joey explains that he rejected her because she was drunk and they kiss again. Lauren realises she cannot be with her cousin, so resists. Eventually, sexual tension mounts between them and they start a secret relationship.

Lauren discovers that Tanya has lied about missing a hospital appointment, and as Tanya refuses to talk, Lauren starts drinking again. Lauren destroys her mother's wedding gown and cake before Tanya and Max remarry. She later bonds with Max's secret wife, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), upsetting Tanya.\n\nLauren finds out that Kirsty is pregnant, unaware that Kirsty is lying.

She applies for a job as a waitress with Whitney at Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) new restaurant but Lucy gets Joey to be Lauren's test customer so Lauren will fail. Whitney gets the job but purposely withdraws so that Lauren gets the job instead. She tries to make Joey jealous by kissing Tyler, who is engaged to Whitney, but it fails and Whitney ends their friendship and Lucy offers the job to Whitney. Lauren's drinking gets worse, though she believes she is not alcohol and tricks her step-grandmother Dot Branning (June Brown) to give her money, which she uses to buy alcohol. Tanya is angry when she discovers this. Lauren then steals £20 from her grandmother's purse and when Tanya discovers this, she compares her to her aunt, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks). Disgusted, Lauren attempts to buy more alcohol but Kirsty refuses to serve her, following Tanya's wishes. Lauren walks outside and confides in Joey but Lucy sees this and starts intimidating Lauren so she punches Lucy and smashes the café window. Lauren is arrested but Lucy decides not to press charges. Ian gives Lauren her waitress job back, but is sacked on the opening night for getting drunk and spills drink on a guest. Tanya and Max find bottles in Lauren's bedroom and decide to keep her locked in the house. She believes Lauren is showing no signs of withdrawal but Lauren reveals she has been drinking vodka from a water bottle, so Tanya realises she is addicted. Tanya keeps Lauren locked in her room but her withdrawal leads her to climb out of the window and Lauren says that nobody can stop her from drinking if she wants to. The next day, Tanya tells Lauren to leave after she destroys Abi's revision notes, and she stays with Max and Kirsty. Tanya asks Peter (now played by Ben Hardy) to spend time with Lauren, but their date is sabotaged by Lucy, so Lauren gets drunk again and leaves with a group of strangers. When she returns, her skin and eyes are yellow and she collapses in pain, so she is taken to hospital and diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. She is warned that she could die if she doesn't stop drinking. Lauren returns and sees Joey so tries to find him. She confronts Lucy over her relationship with Joey, but Lucy refuses to answer, so Lauren concludes that they are together and tries to get a drink but is refused service. Tanya takes her home, where she admits that she cannot cope with her parents' onxtant arguing. Ultimately, Tanya blames herself and takes Lauren to a clinic in Exeter, believing a change of scene could help.\n\nLauren, now a recovering alcoholic, returns to Walford and dislikes how people treat her, until Abi reminds her of the hurt she caused. Lauren reconciles and is heartbroken to discover that Joey slept with Whitney while she was away. Lauren leaves, taking a drink with her but chooses not to drink it. She attends counselling and meets Jake Stone (Jamie Lomas). She sees that he is married but learns that is separated. Lauren falls in love with him but finds out that he is still married to Sadie Young (Kate Magowan), they split up but resume their affair, Max catches them and orders Lauren to end the relationship. Later that day, Joey asks Lauren to leave Walford with him but she decides to stay and resumes her affair with Jake. They are caught by Bella Young (Isobelle Molloy) when she walks in on Lauren getting dressed. Understanding how Bella feels, Lauren ends the affair. When Sadie learns of this, Lauren attempts to apologise to her but learns that Sadie and Bella have left. She tries to persuade Jake not to drink again but he angrily throws a bottle of wine at Lauren and injuring her face; however, she forgives him before he leaves Walford. Lauren is stunned to see Stacey in The Vic, Stacey tells Lauren she is not staying but they meet again at Dot's house. Cora decides to call the police, but Lauren stops her and makes amends with Stacey as they talk about Bradley. She overhears Max and Stacey talking about a recent kiss they had and is agitated, asking her to stay away from Max. She overlooks what she heard when Stacey reveals she is waiting for the police to arrest her for murdering Archie because she wants to clear Bradley's name. Lauren avoids Jake when he returns to Walford as he has fallen off the wagon and is staying on Ian Beale's sofa.\n\nLucy asks Lauren to go into business with her. Although initially reluctant, Lauren agrees and they set up \"LB Lettings\". Lauren becomes suspicious that Lucy is dating Jake when he sets up the website for their business and Lucy begins arranging secret meetings. Lucy soothes her anxieties but she is seeing Max. Soon after, Lucy is found dead and Lauren is devastated. She leans on Peter for support in her grief, and is tempted to drink again but Cora talks her out of it. Determined to overcome her grief, Lauren starts up the business again and finds an email from someone wanting to meet on the night Lucy died. Believing Lucy went instead of her, Lauren tells the police but is not taken seriously, so she arranges to meet them herself. She is shocked when the person is revealed to be Jake and he chases her through Walford to try and stop her from going to the police. However, she does and he is arrested, although Lauren clearly has doubts if he did kill Lucy.\n\nWhen Peter falls out with his girlfriend, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), Lauren comforts him and they kiss. However, Peter feels bad for cheating on Lola and leaves, but it is clear Lauren has feelings for him. Jake is released when evidence clears him of any involvement and makes peace with Lauren before leaving. Lauren starts dating Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) after they have a one night stand but is shocked when Peter breaks up with Lola and tells Lauren he loves her after kissing her again. Lauren tells him that she wants to be with Dean and Peter vows to wait for her. When Peter is about to visit New Zealand, Lauren ends her relationship with Dean and tells Peter she loves him. Lauren and Peter later begin to get paranoid when they are followed. When they get a car registration, DS Summerhayes finds that it is a police car signed out to DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) but she tells everyone that the registration number belongs to a reporter. On Halloween night, she encounters a mysterious person in a Halloween mask who follows her throughout the evening. This is later revealed to be Abi.\n\nPeter asks Lauren to marry him. Lauren accepts, but after finding out that Peter was selling drugs to Lucy, she tells him that she cannot marry him. On New Year's Day 2015, Max's girlfriend Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) is killed in a car accident after meeting someone who she thinks killed Lucy. Although Max tears up Emma's case notes, Lauren finds most of the pages and puts them together, suspicious about who killed Lucy. Lauren asks Peter to marry her and he accepts. However, after finding a previously torn off piece of a page from Emma's case files and trying to use Emma's phone, Lauren starts to doubt if she should marry Peter and drinks most of a half-bottle of whisky in Max's office. When Lauren nearly faints, Stacey buys her a test and discovers that Lauren is pregnant. Stacey confronts her about it but Lauren reveals that she knows who killed Lucy, but refuses to divulge the identity to the police. When Stacey calls the police, she is upset at her inability to keep a secret but hands in most of Emma's case files, while keeping the torn-off piece. She writes a card addressed to Jane, saying that Lucy was killed at home, and abruptly leaves to book an abortion. However, during the consultation, Peter interrupts her and offers to support her through all her issues. Lauren says she is confused and that she knows what happened to Lucy, leading him to discover the truth about the murder at home. When Peter decides to emigrate to New Zealand, he asks Lauren to go with him. She initially refuses, planning to join Tanya in Devon but after he tells her that his brother Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) is Lucy's killer, she changes her mind and decides to go to New Zealand. They dispose of Emma's remaining evidence and SIM card, deciding not to tell the police about Bobby being Lucy's killer. She says goodbye to Max and Abi and leaves with Peter, taking an outfit for their unborn child with them.\n\nA heavily pregnant Lauren returns for Max's murder trial, saying she knows who killed Lucy. As she threatens to tell everyone about Bobby, her waters break. She later gives birth to a baby boy who she names Louie, in honour of Peter's great-grandmother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing). Lauren convinces Abi to stop Max from going to prison and tells Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) that she is going to tell the truth but Max is found guilty, thanks to Phil bribing the jury foreman. Max is sentenced to 21 years imprisonment. Max discovers Lauren knew that he was innocent and disowns her. Lauren makes a statement to the Police claiming that Bobby killed Lucy but they do not believe her and she returns to New Zealand with Louie, vowing to come back and clear Max's name.\n\nIn May 2016, Bobby puts Jane in a coma and confesses to killing Lucy, so Ian's mother Kathy Sullivan (Gillian Taylforth) telephones Lauren and tells Ian that she and Peter are returning. However, when Lauren arrives with Louie, Ian is surprised to see his stepson Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) instead of Peter. Lauren tries to reconcile with an angry Abi, who is furious that Lauren did not tell her that Bobby killed Lucy. Lauren and Steven try to make Ian understand their relationship and why Peter has not returned. When Max is due to have a court hearing following Bobby's confession, Lauren and Abi write a letter saying they will wait for him in the pub, asking Stacey to deliver it. Stacey returns, saying she missed the hearing but passed the letter to his solicitor. Max is released but does not meet Lauren, so she goes home. The letter is returned and she runs outside to see Max leaving in a taxi. Lauren helps Abi get her job back in The Vic and decides to party with her friends. Lauren catches Abi and Lee and assumes that Abi is making a move on him, however Abi drunkenly reveals that she and Lee previously had sex. Lauren promises not to tell Whitney even though Steven tells her to. That same day, Lauren helps Whitney do a pregnancy test, which is positive. Lauren later warns Lee that she knows about his sex with Abi but says she will not say anything because it would mean ruining Whitney's happiness. When Whitney does eventually find out about Lee's unfaithfulness, Lauren supports her. She later starts a business as a web designer, with her first client being Belinda Peacock (Carli Norris). Steven is annoyed when Lauren buys a new laptop following a burglary at the Beales' restaurant. Steven tells Lauren he needed a way to pay debts and she promises not to tell Ian the truth about the burglary as long as they are honest with each other in future.\n\nLauren is excited when Louie says his first word: \"mama\". Steven gets him to say \"dada\" and records a video. Lauren sends it to Peter, which upsets Steven as he sees himself as Louie's father, but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. When Jane discovers Steven has been stealing money from the restaurant, he explains he borrowed it to pay Peter's debts as he is drinking heavily and getting into fights, and Lauren does not know the whole truth. When Lauren learns this, she is angry that he was not honest and considers visiting Peter. Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake, so she decides not to go. Lauren starts to worry that her relationship with Steven has become stale but she does manage to seduce him until they are interrupted. While visiting Max at work, Lauren meets Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) and they share an attraction. Lauren insists on meeting up with him to see what happens. Josh suggests that Lauren apply for a job at the company he works for, Weyland & Co, where Max also works. Lauren is shocked that Josh is one of the interviewers as she thought he worked on the photocopier, so she leaves but Josh follows; she slaps him for lying but they kiss. Meanwhile, Steven is eager for a baby with Lauren but she would rather concentrate on her career, so Steven starts piercing holes in his condoms. Lauren reaches the final two for the job and Max asks Josh not to employ Lauren, and he makes sure someone else gets the job, however, Josh visits Lauren at home and offers her a different job, and he meets Steven and realises Lauren is in a relationship and has a child. Thanks to Abi, Steven becomes paranoid about Lauren and Josh's relationship and starts tracking Lauren's whereabouts via a mobile app. Lauren finds out she is pregnant, and books an appointment to discuss an abortion, soon after revealing her intentions to Abi, as she is not ready to have a second child. Max tells a disbelieving Lauren that Josh is engaged, then Josh admits he is getting married in November. Lauren surprises and annoys Abi by arranging a secret Father's Day visit from Oscar for Max, neglecting to tell Abi about it. However, this drives Abi to reveal the abortion to Steven, though he decides not to confront Lauren. Lauren tells Josh that she loves Steven but admits that there are no \"fireworks\", and tells Josh that she will not cheat on him, unaware that Steven has been spying on her with a secret camera. Unaware that Abi and Steven have embarked on an affair, Lauren realises she does not love Steven and plans on returning to New Zealand to make amends with Peter. However, Steven learns about her plans and lies to her that he has an inoperable brain tumour. Lauren is wracked with guilt and decides to remain in Walford. In another desperate attempt to keep her, Steven spontaneously proposes to her in the Queen Vic, which she accepts. Lauren then resigns from Weyland & Co and starts planning her and Steven's wedding, however, after a fire which he started at Ian's restaurant, he dies. Lauren is devastated. Abi tries to tell her that she is pregnant with Steven's baby but Lauren misinterprets it as gloating about her own abortion, so Abi says that she wishes Lauren died instead and that she never deserved Steven's love, causing Lauren to start drinking again. On the day of Steven's funeral, Lauren finds out he lied about having a brain tumour and destroys his wreaths. When she finds out that Steven has been cremated, she refuses to scatter his ashes. Abi decides to leave Walford to visit Tanya and when Lauren learns of this, she asks if she and Louie can join her. Abi agrees and they leave Walford together; unbeknownst to Lauren, Abi is secretly taking Steven's ashes with her.\n\nLauren returns and moves back in with Ian and asks Josh for her job back. Josh accepts and flirts with Lauren but she rejects him again, but after numerous attempts, Lauren eventually gives into temptation and kisses Josh. When Josh's former fiancee, Imogen (Alexandra Sinclair) arrives unexpectedly at the office, she belittles Lauren and tells her that Josh dislikes children. To confirm this, Lauren asks Josh if he would like to spend time with her and Louie; he reluctantly accepts, but implies that they should go as a couple instead which displeases Lauren. Josh later tries to declare his love for he and asks why they cannot be together; she explains that they are different people and that she is a recovering alcoholic. Ian's mother Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) advises Lauren to move on from Steven and pursue Josh, which she does and they start a relationship. Lauren discovers Weyland & Co's Project Dagmar, a plan to develop Albert Square into luxury apartments, and photographs a scale model. She threatens to publicise the project but her boss James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde), who is also Josh's father, convinces Lauren that the project has fallen through due to investors dropping out at the last minute and she deletes the photo. Josh confirms this, having only just heard about the project. However, it emerges that this was a lie and that Weyland & Co have bought several properties in Albert Square and are evicting business owners. Lauren refuses to give an eviction notice to Ian, so is fired. She discovers that Max is involved in the plan to con the residents. James destroys Max's contract, revealing that he has also been manipulated, but Josh gives Lauren a copy as he is entitled to his share. Lauren asks Max for the truth or she will destroy the copy, but he destroys it himself, saying that he knew about Abi's affair with Steven and her pregnancy and that his plan was to exact revenge on those who abandoned him. Later, Josh tells Lauren that he can stop the development by revealing that James bribes members of Walford Council. Josh asks Lauren to stall James and Fi at a press launch so he can get evidence of the bribes, so she chains herself to their property, but is arrested for breach of the peace. Lauren is cautioned and released, and then kisses Josh when he says he has left Weyland, though his plan has failed. Josh is offered a new job in Glasgow and Lauren agrees to move there with him. Ian disapproves of her relationship with Josh when he catches them kissing which causes Lauren to slap Ian, but Kathy convinces him that Josh is not like his father. On Christmas Day, Max gives Lauren a thoughtful Christmas present and she tells him that he needs medical help. Tanya returns to take Lauren and Abi away from Walford, revealing that Max killed Steven and tried to kill Jane. Lauren and Abi reject Max. Max goes to the roof of the Vic where he plans to kill himself by jumping off, but Lauren and Abi climb on to the ledge to try and stop him. As Max agrees to come down, Lauren slips and she and Abi both fall off. They are taken to hospital, where Lauren has surgery on her pelvis, which is fractured, and Abi has a CT scan and is declared brain-stem dead. When Lauren starts physiotherapy, she becomes frustrated with not being told the truth about Abi and breaks down when she sees her. Lauren slaps Max for lying to her about Abi's condition and is devastated by Abi's death. Lauren is distraught when Abi's life support is withdrawn.\n\nBefore Abi's funeral, Lauren lies to Max that it has already taken place because Tanya does not want him there, however, he realises it is a lie. On the day of the funeral, Lauren tells Whitney about her planned move to Scotland with Josh and Whitney asks her to be sure that she actually loves him or if she is only with him because he is good with Louie. After the service, she sees Max going into the chapel and tells him that she needs to leave, before hugging him and crying. Lauren then takes Louie from Josh and walks away without him. Cora later reveals that Lauren has moved to New Zealand, possibly reuniting with Peter.\n\n Lauren is described by the BBC website as an \"outsider\" and \"doesn't care what people think\". It continues: \"Lauren is very quick on the uptake and picks up on everything going on around her but knows it doesn't pay to have loose lips. She's learnt the hard way that secrets destroy people. And this has made her vulnerable.\"\n\nLauren Branning was introduced in 2006 by executive producer Kate Harwood. She and her immediate family—father Max (Jake Wood), mother Tanya (Jo Joyner) and sister Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald)—are an extension of the popular and long-running Jackson/Branning clan, who have appeared in the series since 1993. It was announced in May 2006 that Lauren would be played by actress Madeline Duggan. Duggan was replaced by Jacqueline Jossa, with Duggan's final scenes airing on 23 June 2010.\n\nOn 9 May 2010 it was announced that Duggan had been axed from the soap by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and that she had already filmed her exit scenes. Her final episode was broadcast on 23 June 2010. In August 2010, it was announced that the character would be returning later in the year, now played by Jacqueline Jossa. Of her casting in the show, Jossa said \"I was so excited when I got the call to say I'd got the part in \"EastEnders\". I've always been a massive fan of the show and it's a dream come true. The character of Lauren Branning will be really fun to play and there are some exciting things coming up\". Kirkwood said \"I'm delighted to welcome Jacqueline Jossa to Albert Square. Jacqueline's portrayal of Lauren has all the classic Branning qualities of toughness, cynicism and sensitivity. Jacqueline is set to be at the heart of Walford drama for some time to come\". It was reported that Lauren's return would show a more grown-up side to the character, who will cause trouble but also show a softer side as she attempts to find love.\n\nJossa's first appearance was on 27 September 2010. Jossa said that when she first got the part of Lauren, she \"worried unnecessarily\". Talking to \"PA\", Jossa said that working with Joyner and Wood was not as scary as she thought. She commented: \"There was less pressure than I thought there was going to be. When I first started I got really scared and worked up, thinking everyone's going to hate me. They've been there four years and then I'm coming in to be their daughter - it was a bit surreal. And then two weeks later I felt completely comfortable, everyone was cracking jokes and I thought, 'Oh... I built it up a bit!'\"\n\nLauren's primary storylines concerned a school girl romance with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), a friendship with the delinquent Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), and being caught in the middle of her warring parents, who separated in the serial in 2007 when Tanya discovered Max was cheating on her with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), Lauren's half brother Bradley's wife. In the storyline, Lauren played an integral part in the discovery of the affair; as a result of a practical joke, Lauren unwittingly recorded Max and Stacey kissing on video camera, and sent the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present in December 2007 as means of revenge on her father. Despite a change of heart, the recording was seen by the entire Branning family on Christmas Day, an episode that drew 13.9 million viewers, 55.3% of the total audience share.\n\nThe character became involved in one of \"EastEnders\"' most controversial storylines in 2008, when she was groomed by a paedophile, Tony King (Chris Coghill). Tony King had been introduced in September 2008 as the fiancé of Lauren's cousin Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). However, in a plot twist, it was revealed that Tony was already in a sexual relationship with Bianca's 15-year-old stepdaughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). After losing interest in Whitney, Tony turns his attentions to 14-year-old Lauren. An insider said: \"He has got away with abusing Whitney for years but it seems one young girl isn't enough.\"\n\nIn April 2011, it was announced that Lauren is to have a relationship with already established character, Ryan Malloy. An \"EastEnders\" insider commented: \"Sparks will fly when Ryan and Lauren begin their relationship. Max is certainly someone not to mess with. He's already very protective of his daughters and Ryan isn't exactly his favourite person after his relationship with Stacey, who Max will always hold a torch for.\"\n\nJossa explained that upon Lauren finding out about Tanya's cancer, viewers see a different side to Lauren. She told \"Inside Soap\": \"Immediately, there's a change in her - with Tanya so sick, Lauren has to grow up. You'd expect her to dive into the drink again or something like that, but she's right there for Tanya from the minute she finds out what's going on.\" She continues: \"Tanya is still convinced she'll be fine, but then she finds out that the cancer has begun to spread. Tanya's really vulnerable at that point and it's Lauren who's saying, 'We're going to fix this and everything will be fine'. She's there for her mum the whole time - shopping, cooking, cleaning, looking after Abi and Oscar. She really wants to help Tanya and actually enjoys the responsibility.\"\n\nIn January 2012, Jossa praised her storyline in which Lauren starts binge drinking due to the stress of her mother suffering from cancer. Jossa commented on the storyline saying that teenagers should take binge drinking more seriously. She said: \"It's good \"EastEnders\" have done the storyline. It highlights that teenagers who people label irresponsible could be doing it to deal with worries they are keeping to themselves. What they actually need is help or someone to talk to. At first to Lauren drinking was a laugh. Then it became a way of forgetting - she has carried the burden of keeping her mum's illness secret.\" Speaking about Lauren's love life, Jossa added: \"I always want Lauren and Fatboy to get together. They would make such a cute couple.\"\n\nJossa predicted in November 2012 that Lauren will revert to her old ways after her latest relationship break-up. When asked if Lauren would start drinking again, Jossa said that Lauren did not really stop and that alcohol is her \"comfort blanket\". Executive Producer Lorraine Newman said that Lauren's binge drinking will \"come to a head\" in Spring 2013. Newman commented \"Lauren's obviously very troubled. A huge amount of what we're seeing now is to do with what's been going on with her parents for such a long time. It's a tough one covering the issue of binge drinking because inevitably, in order for it to have sufficient impact, it has to go on for a considerable amount of time. There's a real danger that it will become unpalatable and that you won't have too much empathy for the character.\" Newman also added that the binge drinking storyline will come to a conclusion in 2013.\n\nIn March 2013, it was revealed that Lauren is to have her drink spiked by her friend Lucy Beale. Lauren gave up her binge drinking to save her relationship with Joey but Lucy cannot stand seeing them happy together and decides she wants Joey back after a brief fling. Lucy spikes Lauren's drink and Lauren becomes extremely drunk and makes a fool of herself. Joey dumps Lauren as he thinks she has drinking behind her back and Lauren's life spirals out of control. An insider told the \"Daily Star\" \"It's going to be emotional to watch Lauren go through it all again as she's already been through so many battles with the bottle.\" Hetti Bywater said that she will continue her scheming until she gets Joey back.\n\nIn September 2012, Alison Rowley of \"Digital Spy\" said that Lauren will fall in love with her cousin Joey Branning (David Witts). An \"EastEnders\" insider told the \"Daily Star\" that it will be a huge storyline across the autumn. The insider said \"Lauren hits the booze and shows her vulnerable side to Joey. He's there for her and feels very protective. The more time they spend together the more they start to realise their feelings for each other are not just that of cousins.\" As the chemistry between the pair intensifies, they try to hide the relationship from their parents. The insider said that it is a powerful force and that the attraction between them is so strong that it will take something huge to \"stop them jumping into bed\". Daniel Kilkelly later revealed that Lauren and Joey will be in a \"horrifying\" car crash. Filming for scenes begun on 10 September and is thought that the on-location filming will continue through the week. The details of the storyline are being kept under wraps but the \"Daily Mail\" reports that Lauren will joyride her uncle Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) car but it goes horribly wrong and their lives are left hanging in the balance when Lauren loses control of the car and goes through a shop window. An insider commented \"Everyone is really excited about these scenes. It's going to be a huge storyline for us in a few weeks' time, so it's definitely one for the fans to watch out for.\" The storyline will reportedly air in November 2012 and is said to be one of the show's biggest moments of the year.\n\nLauren is later dumped by Joey after Derek blackmails him. Witts said that Joey will find life \"really hard\" after dumping Lauren. Derek suggests to Joey that if he tells the police that he was driving the car that drunken Lauren crashed, she can avoid a prison sentence. Joey agrees to the deception to help Lauren but is later horrified when Derek threatens to tell the police the truth unless he gets his own way. Speaking to \"Soaplife\", Witts said \"Joey must either move in with Derek and be a respectful and loving son, or dump Lauren. If Joey takes either of those options, Derek won't tell the police that Lauren was driving the car. Joey's love for Lauren is massive, but not quite as massive as his hatred for Derek. He decides to become the villain and lie that he never loved her. He'll take the flack because that will make it easier for her to move on without him.\" Witts also added that it will be \"really hard\" as he keeps making out to Lauren that he is not interested. Witts also said that Joey would be making a mistake if he told Lauren about Derek's blackmail. He commented \"She's very headstrong and she'd say that she doesn't care about getting into trouble with the law. It would all end in tears. Everyone would find out as Lauren's the sort of person who'd blurt everything out, and it would cause even more of a mess. Joey very much thinks he's doing the right thing.\" Tony Discipline said that he does not mind watching Jossa's, his real-life girlfriend's scenes and that he supports the Joey and Lauren plot commenting \"I don't find it strange to watch - it is part of the job. We always support each other and Jacqueline always asks me how it looks. But it is part of our job.\"\n\nOn 10 September 2017, it was announced that Jossa had been axed from the show by executive consultant John Yorke, along with Lorna Fitzgerald. An official spokesperson said: \"We can confirm Jacqueline and Lorna will be leaving. They have been wonderful to work with and we wish them all the best for the future.\" Their exit story started airing during the Christmas period of 2017. Jossa's departure aired on 16 February 2018.\n\nFollowing Jossa's first appearance, Lauren started appearing in her own internet spin-off series, \"Lauren's Diaries\", and a second series started in 2011.\n\n\"Inside Soap\" commented on Lauren's recasting describing Lauren played by Duggan was \"a pretty lass, but pretty unimpressive\" and that played by Jossa she has acquired \"an attitude as severe as her fringe\". Jane Simon from the \"Daily Mirror\" said that Lauren played by Jossa \"brings some badly needed oomph to the part\". Jossa won Best Newcomer at the National Television Awards 2012. Executive Producer Bryan Kirkwood commented: \"I'd like to say a huge congratulations to our girl, Jacqueline Jossa, for her amazing success. It's well-deserved recognition of Jacqueline's beautiful, truthful and moving portrayal of Lauren Branning.\" A writer for the \"Daily Mirror\" said that all of Lauren's problems are caused by her being a Branning. In August 2017, Jossa was longlisted for Sexiest Female at the Inside Soap Awards, while Steven's brain tumour lie to Lauren was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. Jossa's Sexiest Female nomination made the viewer-voted shortlist, but she lost out to Natalie J. Robb, who portrays Moira Dingle in \"Emmerdale\". The scene in which Lauren and Abi fall from the roof of The Queen Vic was awarded \"Scene of the Year\" at the 2018 British Soap Awards, tying with \"Doctors\" who also won the same award for \"The Bollywood Proposal\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "624074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=624074", "title": "Lead vocalist", "text": "Lead vocalist\n\nThe lead vocalist (or main vocalist, lead vocals, or lead singer) in popular music is typically the member of a group or band whose voice is the most prominent in a performance where multiple voices may be heard. The lead singer either leads the vocal ensemble, or sets against the ensemble as the dominant sound. In vocal group performances, notably in soul and gospel music, and early rock and roll, the lead singer takes the main vocal part, with a chorus provided by other band members as backing vocalists.\n\nEspecially in rock music, the lead singer or solo singer is often the front man or front woman, who may also play one or more instruments and is often seen as the leader or spokesman of the band by the public. As an example in rock music, Liam Gallagher was the lead singer of Oasis. Similarly in soul music, Smokey Robinson was the lead singer of The Miracles.\n\nIt is uncertain when the term \"lead vocals\" was first used, but it may have emerged in the late 1930s, when rich vocal interplay with multiple voices where one or more voices may dominate began to impact on North American popular music, which was previously dominated by solo vocals. The practice of using a lead singer in vocal groups, however, has a longer history: an early form is the \"call and response\" found in work songs and spirituals sung by African-American slaves. Songs of the late nineteenth century frequently used a leading solo voice (or \"call\"), followed by a choral response by other singers. As the style developed through early commercial recordings and performances in the early 20th century, the role of the lead vocalist became more established, although popular groups of the 1930s and 1940s such as the Ink Spots and the Mills Brothers generally used different lead singers on different songs rather than keeping the same lead singer throughout. By the 1950s, singers such as Sam Cooke (with the Soul Stirrers) and Clyde McPhatter (with the Drifters) took on more clearly defined roles as lead singers, and by the end of the decade credited group names often changed to reflect the leading roles of the main vocalists, with examples such as Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers and Dion & the Belmonts.\nAcademic David Horn has written:The influence of US rhythm and blues recordings may well be a crucial one in the assimilation of the format of lead singer plus backing group into the guitar-based British 'beat' groups of the 1960s, and in US groups such as The Beach Boys. From these various points - including Motown - it went on to become a standard device in much rock and pop music. In some bands - most famously, The Beatles - the role of lead singer alternated (in this case, principally between two performers), while in others - for example, Herman's Hermits - one lead singer dominated.\n\nThere are as many types and styles of lead singer as there are styles and genres of music. However, the lead singer of a group or band is usually the main focus of audiences' attention. The lead vocalist of band is sometimes called the \"front man\" or \"front woman,\" as the most visible performer in a group. While most bands have a singular lead singer, many others have dual lead singers, or other member of the band that occasionally sing lead on particular songs. While the lead singer often defines the group's image and personality to the general public, this is not always the case.\n\nIn modern rock music, the lead singer is often, but not always, also the band's leader and spokesperson. While lead singers or spokespersons for any musical ensembles can be called a front man, the term is used very widely in rock music. Since the position commonly has an expanded role from simple lead vocalists, there have been cases in which the front man for a band is someone other than the lead vocalist. For example, while the lead vocalist for the band Fall Out Boy is guitarist Patrick Stump, the bassist and lyricist, Pete Wentz, is generally called the front man, both in the media and by the band members themselves, since he represents the band in most interviews and contributes most to the band's image in the popular media. Another example is Angus Young of AC/DC, who is the band's lead guitarist, and co-leader with his brother Malcolm Young (until the latter's death in 2017); while lead singer Brian Johnson (and before him Bon Scott) is the band's front man, Angus Young can be thought to share the front man position with Johnson, due to his on-stage antics and his role as the band's mascot, frequently featuring on album covers and promotional materials.\n\nIn many bands, such as The Who, Led Zeppelin, Living Colour, Queen, The Stone Roses and Oasis, the lead guitarist may share spokesman responsibilities with the lead singer. Usually, this is derived from that guitarist's specific role as a co-songwriter, co-founder and/or co-vocalist. Also in some cases, there are two frontmen, such as Alice in Chains, with singer Layne Staley (and later William DuVall) sharing vocal duties with guitarist Jerry Cantrell, or Underoath, with singers Spencer Chamberlain and Aaron Gillespie (drummer) sharing vocal duties. Another example is Blink-182, in which vocal duties are split between bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge. Hoppus usually carries out most media either by himself or together with DeLonge, while the band's other member, drummer Travis Barker, usually remains quiet. Linkin Park had two vocalists as well, Mike Shinoda and Chester Bennington, both considered as frontmen. Another example is the thrash metal band Metallica, in which James Hetfield (lead singer and rhythm guitarist) and Lars Ulrich (drummer) share the spokesperson duties for being both founders and the only members who have never left the band.\n\n"}

{"id": "7727099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7727099", "title": "Literary adaptation", "text": "Literary adaptation\n\nLiterary adaptation is the adapting of a literary source (e.g. a novel, short story, poem) to another genre or medium, such as a film, stage play, or video game. It can also involve adapting the same literary work in the same genre or medium just for different purposes, e.g. to work with a smaller cast, in a smaller venue (or on the road), or for a different demographic group (such as adapting a story for children). Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case.\n\nIt also appeals because it obviously works as a story; it has interesting characters, who say and do interesting things. This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work, e.g. film, stage play, teleplay, as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult. To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensions—concept, character, story, dialogue, and action—is an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, especially for producers of the screen and stage, an adapted work is more bankable; it represents considerably less risk to investors, and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains. This is because:\n\nWorks of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry. Some of the earliest examples come from the work of Georges Méliès, who pioneered many film techniques. In 1899, he released two adaptations — \"Cinderella\" based on the Brothers Grimm story of the same name and \"King John\", the first known film to be based on the works of Shakespeare. The 1900 film \"Sherlock Holmes Baffled\", directed by Arthur Marvin featured Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes intruding upon a pseudo-supernatural burglary. The film, considered the first detective movie, ran for only 30 seconds and was originally intended to be shown in hand-cranked Mutoscope machines.\n\nMéliès' 1902 original science-fiction feature \"A Trip to the Moon\" was based loosely on two popular novels of the time: Jules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\" and H. G. Wells' \"The First Men in the Moon\". The first of many adaptations of the Brothers Grimm tale \"Snow White\" was released in 1902 while the earliest surviving copy is the 1916 version. 1903 saw the release of \"Alice in Wonderland\" directed by Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow, the first movie adaptation of Lewis Carroll's children's book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n\nThe first feature-length film to be shot entirely in Hollywood was Cecil B. DeMille's first assignment, \"The Squaw Man\", in 1914, which was the first of three movie versions (all directed by DeMille) based on Edwin Milton Royle's play of the same name. Since the early days of the genre, major films have been largely adapted:\nThe most celebrated of the early adaptations is Erich von Stroheim's \"Greed\", a 1924 adaptation of the 1899 novel \"McTeague\" by naturalist writer Frank Norris. The director intended to film every aspect of the novel in great detail, resulting in a 9½-hour epic feature. At studio insistence, the film was cut down to two hours and was considered a flop upon its theatrical release. It has since been restored to just over four hours and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. \n\nOne book that has been adapted very frequently (in one form or another) is Charles Dickens' Christmas story \"A Christmas Carol\", which has around 20 film adaptations to date.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, when a literary source has not passed into the public domain, rights must be arranged for the adaptation to be performed legally. Plagiarism occurs in every genre, and throughout history, but such literary rights violations can be challenged in court. In the case of Hollywood films, judgments for the plaintiff can run into the millions of dollars, but these have typically been for outright theft of a screenplay idea rather than for fraudulent adaptations (see \"Buchwald v. Paramount\").\n\nBecause of the importance of telling a story with a limited number of characters, short stories often make better sources for adaptable material than do novels. For the stage, in addition, theater audiences tend to accept and prefer works of a more conceptual, thought-based nature, meaning their preferences need to be considered when selecting a work for adaptation, but also when determining how best to adapt it. The stage imposes physical limits of size and technology. Not every illusion that can be made to appear real on the movie screen can be made to appear so on stage.\n\n"}

{"id": "381161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381161", "title": "Lyric Opera of Chicago", "text": "Lyric Opera of Chicago\n\nLyric Opera of Chicago is one of the leading opera companies in the United States. It was founded in Chicago in 1954, under the name 'Lyric Theatre of Chicago' by Carol Fox, Nicolà Rescigno and Lawrence Kelly, with a season that included Maria Callas's American debut in \"Norma\". The company was re-organized by Fox in 1956 under its present name and, after her 1981 departure, it has continued to be of one of the major opera companies in the United States. The Lyric is housed in the Civic Opera Building, which the company now owns.\n\nThe first opera to be performed in Chicago was Bellini's \"La sonnambula\", presented by a traveling opera company on 29 July 1850. Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871. The second opera house, the Chicago Auditorium, opened in 1889.\n\nIn 1929 the current Civic Opera House on 20 North Wacker Drive was opened, though the Chicago Civic Opera Company itself collapsed in the Great Depression. The old Auditorium continued to produce stage shows and musicals till it closed in 1941.\n\nResident opera companies began in Chicago in 1910 with the Chicago Grand Opera Company being formed from the remains of the Manhattan Opera Company, which had been founded by Oscar Hammerstein I, and had been squeezed out by the more financially sound Metropolitan Opera. Chicago had this first company for four seasons, then, after no season in 1914/15, it was re-formed as the Chicago Opera Association. This lasted through 1921/22, when it became the Chicago Civic Opera from 1922 until 1932. After no season in 1932/33, the company was re-formed and again named the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1933 to 1935. From 1936 to 1939, the company was called Chicago City Opera Company, and finally from 1940 to 1946 opera was presented by the Chicago Opera Company. There were no seasons from 1947 until 1953, so opera was presented by other companies on tour. Lyric Opera was formed in 1954 and has continued uninterrupted except for 1967.\n\nCarol Fox, America's first female opera impresario at the age of 28, began her first season in 1954 by bringing Maria Callas for her American debut in the title role of \"Norma\", the first of many electrifying Callas performances in Chicago. However, this first eight-opera season in 1954 was not the result of a long apprenticeship in opera production; Carol Fox, fluent in Italian and French, had studied opera singing for many years, culminating in two years of intensive work in Italy. However, when she realized that performance was not to be in her future, she decided that it lay in bringing the performances of the world's finest artists to her home town of Chicago. Her success can be measured in one statistic regarding the filling of the Lyric's Civic Opera House: in 1954, the season ran for three weeks; in 2007/08 the Lyric had an almost six-month season.\n\nFox also used her formidable persuasive powers on artists other than singers: she was able to bring Rudolph Nureyev to make his debut on an American opera stage at the Lyric; Vera Zorina, Alicia Markova, Erik Bruhn and Maria Tallchief also danced at the Lyric, and George Balanchine created choreography for the Lyric. The Italian composer Pino Donati was her artistic director. Bruno Bartoletti was principal conductor, but other conductors included Tullio Serafin, Dimitri Mitropoulos and Artur Rodzinski. Christoph von Dohnányi and Sir Georg Solti chose the Lyric for their American operatic debuts. Franco Zeffirelli staged operas as did Harold Prince.\n\nBecause of her illnesses and her refusal to lower her artistic standards despite the Lyric's dire financial state in 1980, her resignation was sought and given. Carol Fox died a few months later, survived by a daughter Victoria.\n\nIt was of the Lyric's founder that Saul Bellow wrote in 1979 \"Miss Fox will be remembered, together with Jane Addams of Hull House and Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine, as one of Chicago's greatest women.\"\n\nThroughout the many years at the Lyric, Carol Fox developed the confidence and authority to bring world-famous artists to the Lyric: Luciano Pavarotti (56 performances in 7 roles), Tito Gobbi, Eleanor Steber, Jussi Björling, Birgit Nilsson, Renata Tebaldi, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Giulietta Simionato, Richard Tucker, Boris Christoff, Eileen Farrell, Dorothy Kirsten, Leonie Rysanek, Leontyne Price, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Geraint Evans, Mirella Freni, Nicolai Ghiaurov, Alfredo Kraus, Renata Scotto, Robert Merrill, Joan Sutherland, Christa Ludwig, Jon Vickers, Marilyn Horne, Grace Bumbry, Montserrat Caballé, Tatiana Troyanos, Sherrill Milnes, Plácido Domingo, Felicia Weathers and José Carreras. Anna Moffo also chose the Lyric for her American debut.\n\nCarol Fox was succeeded at the Lyric by her longtime assistant manager, Ardis Krainik (1981–1996), after whom the opera house was named, and then by William Mason (1997–2011). Anthony Freud took over in October 2011.\n\nSir Andrew Davis is Lyric's music director and principal conductor, a post he has occupied since in September 2000. He led three complete cycles of \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" in the 2004/05 season to mark the company's 50th anniversary. Danny Newman was the company's long-time press agent from 1954 until his retirement in the 2001/02 season; Newman is largely credited as the founder of subscription-based arts marketing, the standard economic model for not-for-profit arts organizations in the US. Philip David Morehead was head of music staff until his retirement in 2015.\n\nIn addition to the standard operatic repertoire, Lyric also presents contemporary works. Recent productions have included Harbison's \"The Great Gatsby\" (2000–2001), Weill's \"Street Scene\" (2001–2002), Floyd's \"Susannah\", Sondheim's \"Sweeney Todd\" (2002–2003), and John Adams' \"Doctor Atomic\" directed by Peter Sellars.\n\nComposer William Bolcom wrote his most recent opera for Lyric, \"A Wedding\", based on the 1978 film of the same name directed by Robert Altman. It premiered during Lyric's 50th-anniversary season. During the 2015/16 season, the company premiered its latest commission, \"Bel Canto\" by Peruvian composer Jimmy López with a libretto by Nilo Cruz based on the novel by Ann Patchett.\n\nThe Lyric Opera productions were broadcast and nationally syndicated by WFMT Radio Network, from 1971 until 2001. \nThe broadcasts ceased then because of a loss of sponsorship . The issue was resolved at the 11th hour for the October 21, 2006 premiere of Richard Strauss's opera \"Salome\" starring Deborah Voigt. Syndicated broadcast of the Lyric Opera resumed in May 2007 on the WFMT network, which was included on XM Satellite Radio before it merged and became SiriusXM Radio. Syndicated broadcast of the Lyric Opera resumed in May 2007 on the WFMT network, which was included on XM Satellite Radio before it merged and became SiriusXM Radio.\n\nThe company's permanent home is the Civic Opera House, a building which it rented from 1954 until after the 1993 renovations. It is a 1929 structure with an Art Deco interior. Its 3,563-seat capacity makes it the second-largest opera auditorium in North America after the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. The interior was named \"The Ardis Krainik Theatre\" in 1996 in honor of Ardis Krainik, the former General Director, who was responsible for its renovation from 1993 onwards.\n\nIn 2017, Lyric Opera of Chicago as house manager of the theater announced that the Joffrey Ballet plans to move from its longtime performance venue at the Auditorium Theatre to the opera house in 2020. The announcement coincided with the Lyric’s presentation of a new production of Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" by choreographer John Neumeier; the production fused the musical and ballet elements of the opera and featured the Joffrey Ballet.\n\nThe Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center (formerly Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, 1981–2006), established in 1974 by Carol Fox, is the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago.\n\nThe Ryan Opera Center is considered one of the most prestigious vocal programs in America,\nand has produced notable singers, including:\n\nApproximately a dozen young singers are selected from the near 400 who audition annually, and they are in residence for twelve months. Over the course of the year they receive advanced instruction in numerous aspects of operatic performance, including voice lessons and coachings, language and acting training, and master classes with some of opera’s most renowned artists. The singers gain valuable performing experience by participating in recitals and concerts at many Chicago-area venues. During Lyric Opera’s mainstage season, they perform and understudy roles at all levels. The singers work with the world’s greatest opera singers, conductors, and directors, thus advancing the young artists’ professionalism. In 2005, author William Murray wrote a book about a year in the life of an entering class at the Ryan Opera Center.\n\nAndrew Foldi was Director of the Ryan Opera Center from 1991 to 1995. He was succeeded by Richard Pearlman, who was Director of the program from 1995 until his death in 2006. Renowned soprano Gianna Rolandi, who had been the Ryan Opera Center's Director of Vocal Studies and principal instructor since 2002, was appointed Director of the program in 2006. The program is now administered by Dan Novak, Director; Craig Terry, Music Director; Julia Faulkner, Director of Vocal Studies, and Renée Fleming, Advisor.\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "10373080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10373080", "title": "Mode (literature)", "text": "Mode (literature)\n\nIn literature and other artistic media, a mode is an unspecific critical term usually designating a broad but identifiable kind of literary method, mood, or manner that is not tied exclusively to a particular form or genre. Examples are the \"satiric\" mode, the \"ironic\", the \"comic\", the \"pastoral\", and the \"didactic\".\n\nIn his \"Poetics\", the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle uses 'mode' in a more specific sense. Kinds of poetry, he writes, may be differentiated in three ways: according to their \"medium\" of imitation, according to their \"objects\" of imitation, and according to their mode or 'manner' of imitation (section I). \"For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us\" (section III). According to this definition, 'narrative' and 'dramatic' are modes of fiction:\n\nFiction is a form of narrative, one of the four rhetorical modes of discourse. Fiction-writing also has distinct forms of expression, or modes, each with its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background. Author and writing-instructor Jessica Page Morrell lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition. Author Peter Selgin refers to \"methods\", including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.\n\nSummarization (also referred to as summary, narration, or narrative summary) is the fiction-writing mode whereby story events are condensed. The reader is told what happens, rather than having it shown. In the fiction-writing axiom \"Show, don't tell\" the \"tell\" is often in the form of summarization.\n\nSummarization has important uses:\n\nThe main advantage of summary is that it takes up less space. According to author Orson Scott Card, either action or summarization could be right, either could be wrong. Factors such as rhythm, pace, and tone come into play. The objective is to get the right balance between telling versus showing, action versus summarization.\n\nIntrospection (also referred to as internal dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing mode used to convey a character's thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, \"One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts ...\" According to Nancy Kress, a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story. As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both scene and sequel.\n\nAccording to Frederick Crews, it is traditional and useful to think of essays as falling into four types, corresponding to four basic functions of prose: \"description\", or picturing; \"narration\", or telling; \"exposition\", or explaining; and \"argument\", or convincing. Susan Anker distinguishes between nine different modes of essay writing: \"narration\", or writing that tells stories; \"illustration\", or writing that gives examples; \"description\", or writing that creates pictures in words; \"process analysis\", or writing that explains how things happen; \"classification\", or writing that sorts things into groups; \"definition\", or writing that tells what something means; \"comparison and contrast\", or writing that shows similarities and differences; \"cause and effect\", or writing that explains reasons or results; and \"argument\", or writing that persuades.\n\n"}

It was set up in 2011 to take advantage of the gift, in a legacy, of the property at 8 Royal College Street in the London Borough of Camden, the house occupied by the French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine when they lived in London in 1873. In 2014 it was launched as a new arts organisation and a registered charity.\n\nThe Foundation’s long-term aim is to develop 8 Royal College Street as a European-style \"poetry house\". In the meantime, it is using the two poets as an inspirational starting point for a much wider mission to champion arts and culture. Exploring the vital role played by the arts in education, social capital building and cultural exchange, the Foundation is also developing a new and more sustainable business model for the arts, based around earned income.\n\nThe Foundation is managed by a board of English-speaking and French-speaking trustees, chaired by Thomas Venning, head of Books and Manuscripts at Christie’s. Its chief executive (since April 2014) is Graham Henderson, who was previously chief executive of Poet in the City.\n\nThe Foundation was created by Graham Henderson and was initially incubated within Poet in the City. Henderson was part of (and inherited) the previous campaign to save the property at 8 Royal College Street. For many years this was run by Gerry Harrison, a Camden councillor, during the process of which many celebrities have rallied to the cause, including the actor Simon Callow, the writers Julian Barnes, Lisa Appignanesi and Tracy Chevalier and the musician Patti Smith.\n\nIn 2007 the house was bought and sympathetically restored by a new owner, Michael Corby. Committed to the historic identity of the property, he agreed in 2011 to leave the property as legacy gift to the Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation, created especially by Graham Henderson for this purpose. The Foundation has always been clear, however, that it does not want to be just a small house museum. It has therefore used the idea of the \"poetry house\" to create an arts organisation with the wider goal of promoting culture and the arts and championing their role in social capital building. This has seen the Foundation deliver an extensive programme of cross-arts events and commissions and take an innovative approach to audience and business development.\n\nThe programme of events delivered by the Foundation has been intentionally eclectic, involving many different art forms, and up-and-coming talent from across the arts and cultural sector. Amongst other things this programme has included events featuring opera, classical music, sculpture, poetry, literature, theatre, jazz music and rock music. Highlights have included \"The Disappearing Poet\", an event exploring why poets disappear, \"Faure’s Verlaine Settings\", an event presenting classical song settings of the poet’s work, and \"Rock for Rimbaud\", a concert featuring Americana artists. Institutional partners have included the National Opera Studio, Bloodaxe Books and Pernod Absinthe. From 2018 the Foundation is organising a series of salon-style events at Blacks Club in Soho in London, featuring speakers and artists, and designed to champion its work.\n\nThe Foundation has also been responsible for commissioning new work in the arts. For instance, in 2016 it commissioned both a full-length jazz show (\"Jazz from the Playing Card Factory\") and a full-length theatre show (\"Poetry House Live\"). As well as several performances the latter has resulted in a full-length film made in partnership with the film department at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow. The Foundation has also been responsible for an original poetry commission involving a suite of poems by George Szirtes, and a series of 24 paintings by the artist Rebecca Taber inspired by the poetry of Rimbaud and Verlaine. In 2018 the Foundation is seeking funding for, amongst other things, an original chamber opera, and an original puppet show.\n\nThe Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation is committed to encouraging new generations of students in secondary schools in the UK to engage with the arts and literature, and to gain an international perspective. In particular, it seeks to engage with young people in local Camden and Islington schools, located within a short distance of the property at 8 Royal College Street, many of whom come from socially and economically deprived backgrounds. The Foundation wants to provide these young people with experiences and educational opportunities they might otherwise not possess. This charitable mission lies at the heart of the Foundation’s identity, and forms an important part of its contribution to the local community.\n\nIn 2017, the Foundation delivered an extensive programme of educational placements featuring poetry in four schools in the London Borough of Camden, working with students from Maria Fidelis Roman Catholic Convent School, Regent High School, Camden School for Girls and La Sainte Union Catholic School in a programme that involved over 500 students. This schools programme was generously supported by the T.S. Eliot Foundation. As well as work in the classroom, it included school shows and the publication of an 89-page poetry anthology entitled \"How We Make Daylight\", featuring work by the students.\n\nThe Foundation is facilitating a repeat programme of schools’ placements in Camden in 2018, with poetry in translation as its main focus, which will be delivered by Modern Poetry in Translation.\n\nThe Foundation has also been working internationally. In 2015 Graham Henderson and the organisation took the lead in creating the Kindred Spirits network of European poetry houses including seven arts organisations based in six different European countries. The Foundation’s partners include the Rimbaud Museum in Charleville-Mézières, La Maison de la Poesie in Paris, Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, the Lorca Foundation in Granada, the Keats-Shelley House in Rome, the National Museum of Literature in Bucharest, the Druskininkai Poetic Fall festival in Lithuania and the Halldór Laxness Museum in Iceland. The network became a vehicle for an application for a European Union Large Cooperation Grant in the autumn of that year. The Foundation was all set to resubmit its application in 2016, with every chance of success, when the referendum result in favour of Brexit intervened. As a result, the charity's trustees decided that it was no longer sensible to place EU funding at the centre of the organisation’s future strategy. The Foundation, nevertheless, is keen to build on the relationships it had established with its \"poetry house\" partners, and particularly on the experience of the conference held in Bucharest in May 2015, bringing together representatives from all of the partner organisations. The Poetry House Live theatre show in 2017 was commissioned expressly with the purpose of involving talented up-and-coming playwrights from all of the seven countries involved in the network.\n\n\n"}

After making her acting debut with a minor role in the thriller \"Hangmen\" (1987), she received early attention for her performance in the sci-fi action film \"Demolition Man\" (1993). Her breakthrough came in the action thriller \"Speed\" (1994). A line of successful films followed throughout the 1990s, including \"While You Were Sleeping\" (1995), \"The Net\" (1995), \"A Time to Kill\" (1996), and \"Hope Floats\" (1998).\n\nBullock achieved further success in the following decades in \"Miss Congeniality\" (2000), \"Two Weeks Notice\" (2002), \"Crash\" (2004), \"The Proposal\" (2009), \"The Heat\" (2013), and \"Ocean's 8\" (2018). She was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy in the biographical drama \"The Blind Side\" (2009), and was nominated in the same categories for her performance in the thriller \"Gravity\" (2013). Bullock's greatest commercial success is the animated comedy \"Minions\" (2015), which grossed over US$1 billion at the box office. In 2007, she was one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses, and in 2015, she ranked as the highest-paid actress. She was also named \"Most Beautiful Woman\" by \"People\" magazine in 2015.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Bullock is the founder of the production company Fortis Films. She has produced some of the films in which she starred, including \"\" (2005) and \"All About Steve\" (2009). She was an executive producer of the ABC sitcom \"George Lopez\" (2002–07), and made several appearances during its run.\n\nBullock was born in Arlington, Virginia. Her father, John W. Bullock (1925–2018), was a United States Army employee and part-time voice coach; her mother, Helga Mathilde Meyer (1942–2000), was an opera singer and voice teacher. Helga was German, while John is from Birmingham, Alabama. Bullock's maternal grandfather was a German rocket scientist from Nuremberg. John, who was in charge of the U.S. Army's Military Postal Service in Europe, was stationed in Nuremberg when he met Helga. They married in Germany and moved to Arlington, where John worked with the Army Materiel Command before becoming a contractor for The Pentagon. Bullock has a younger sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, who went on to serve as vice president of Bullock's production company Fortis Films. Until the age of 18, Bullock held American-German dual citizenship. She then held only American citizenship until 2009, when she reapplied for German citizenship.\n\nBullock was raised in Germany (Nuremberg) and Austria (Vienna and Salzburg) for 12 years, and grew up speaking German. She attended the humanistic Waldorf School in Nuremberg. As a child, while her mother went on European opera tours, Bullock usually stayed with her aunt Christl and cousin Susanne, the latter of whom would later marry German politician Peter Ramsauer. Bullock studied ballet and vocal arts as a child and frequently accompanied her mother, taking small parts in her opera productions. She sang in the opera's children's choir at the Staatstheater Nürnberg. Bullock has a scar above her left eye, caused by falling into a creek when she was a child. She attended Washington-Lee High School, where she was a cheerleader and performed in high school theater productions. After graduating in 1982, she attended East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, where she received a BFA in Drama in 1987. While at ECU, she performed in multiple theater productions, including \"Peter Pan\" and \"Three Sisters\". She then moved to Manhattan, New York, where she supported herself as a bartender, cocktail waitress, and coat checker while auditioning for roles.\n\nWhile in New York, Bullock took acting classes with Sanford Meisner. She appeared in several student films, and later landed a role in an Off-Broadway play \"No Time Flat\". Director Alan J. Levi was impressed by Bullock's performance and offered her a part in the made-for-television film \"\" (1989). This led to her being cast in a series of small roles in several independent films as well as in the lead role of the short-lived NBC television version of the film \"Working Girl\" (1990). She went on to appear in several films, such as \"Love Potion No. 9\" (1992), \"The Thing Called Love\" (1993) and \"Fire on the Amazon\" (1993), before rosing to early prominence with her supporting role in the sci-fi action film \"Demolition Man\" (1993).\n\nBullock's big breakthrough came in 1994, when she starred in the action thriller \"Speed\", with Keanu Reeves, as one of the passengers of a city bus containing a bomb. She came to read for \"Speed\" with Reeves to make sure there was the right chemistry between the two actors. She recalls that they had to do \"all these really physical scenes together, rolling around on the floor and stuff.\" \"Speed\" garnered acclaim from critics who, according to Rotten Tomatoes, asserted it was a \"terrific popcorn thriller\" with \"outstanding performances from Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, and Sandra Bullock\". It took in US$350 million worldwide.\n\nA string of film successes followed \"Speed\", and Bullock soon established herself as a Hollywood leading actress. In the romantic comedy \"While You Were Sleeping\" (1995), she potrayed a lonely Chicago Transit Authority token collector who saves the life of a man. While the film made US$182 million globally, it received positive reviews, with Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reading: \"\"While You Were Sleeping\" is built wholly from familiar ingredients, but assembled with such skill — and with such a charming performance from Sandra Bullock — that it gives formula a good name\". She received her first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 1995, Bullock also starred in the thriller \"The Net\" (1995), as a computer programmer who stumbles upon a conspiracy, putting her life and the lives of those around her in great danger. Owen Gleiberman, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\", complimented her performance, saying \"Bullock pulls you into the movie. Her overripe smile and clear, imploring eyes are sometimes evocative of Julia Roberts\". \"The Net\" made US$110.6 million. \n\nIn the crime drama \"A Time to Kill\" (1996), Bullock portrayed a member of the defense team in the trial for murder of a young girl, opposite Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey and Kevin Spacey. She received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance. The film grossed US$152 million around the world. Bullock subsequently received US$11 million for the critically panned \"\" (1997), which she agreed to star in for financial backing for her next project, \"Hope Floats\" (1998). She has stated that she regrets making the sequel. In \"Hope Floats\", she starred as an unassuming housewife whose life is disrupted when her husband (played by Michael Paré) reveals his infidelity to her on a talk show. While the film made US$81.4 million, critic James Berardinelli, in his review, remarked that she is \"better suited to more lighthearted fare\". \n\nThe comedy \"Practical Magic\" (1998) saw her star with Nicole Kidman, as two witch sisters who face a curse which threatens to prevent them ever finding lasting love. While the film opened atop on its North American opening weekend, it flopped at the box office. In 1998, she also provided the voice of in the animated aventure film \"The Prince of Egypt\", and wrote, produced and directed the short film \"Making Sandwiches\". She played a free-spirited drifter who begins to talk to a writer in the 1999 romantic comedy \"Forces of Nature\", alongside Ben Affleck. The film was a commercial hit, grossing US$93 million worldwide, and \"Boxoffice Magazine\" remarked: \"The combination of Affleck's deadpan by-the-book persona with the spontaneity of Bullock's character sparks with convincing chemistry, their diverse personalities causing both to grow and bring to the surface what each is running away from or can't admit\".\n\nBullock took on the role of a FBI agent, who must go undercover in the Miss United States beauty pageant to prevent a group from bombing the event, in the comedy \"Miss Congeniality\" (2000). It was a financial success, grossing US$212 million worldwide, and earned Bullock another Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 2000, she also played a newspaper columnist obliged to enter rehabilitation for alcoholism in the dramedy \"28 Days\", which was a moderate commercial success, with a global gross of US$62.1 million. Bullock produced the romantic comedy \"Kate & Leopold\", released in 2001, which she followed with acting work in the psychological thriller \"Murder by Numbers\" (2002), portraying a seasoned homicide detective. Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of a possible four, stating: \"Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability, creating a character you'd like to like, and could like, if she weren't so sad, strange and turned in upon herself.\"\n\nBullock teamed up with Hugh Grant for the romantic comedy \"Two Weeks Notice\" (2002), in which she starred as a lawyer who walks out on her boss. Liz Braun, of \"Jam! Movies\", found Bullock and Grant to be \"perfectly paired\", stating: \"The script allows the two actors to be at their comedic best, even though the film as a whole is amateurish in many ways\". \"Two Weeks Notice\" made US$199 million globally. She was presented with the Raúl Juliá Award for Excellence in 2002, for her efforts, as the executive producer of the sitcom \"George Lopez\" (2002–07), in helping expand career openings for Hispanic talent in the media and entertainment industry. She also made several appearances on the show as Accident Amy, an accident-prone employee at the factory Lopez's character manages. \n\nBullock made part of a large ensemble cast, playing the wife of a district attorney, in the drama \"Crash\" (2004), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. She received positive reviews for her performance, with some critics suggesting that it was the best performance of her career. In 2005, she received a US$17.5 million salary for \"\", and was a co-recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award. In the romantic drama \"The Lake House\" (2006), Bullock reunited with Keanu Reeves, despite that their characters are separated throughout the film; they were only on set together for two weeks during filming. The film had a negative critical response, but made US$114.8 million. In 2006, Bullock also played Harper Lee in \"Infamous\", a drama based on George Plimpton's 1997 book, \"Truman Capote: In Which Various Friends, Enemies, Acquaintances, and Detractors Recall His Turbulent Career\". \n\nBullock headlined the supernatural thriller \"Premonition\" (2007), with Julian McMahon, as a housewife who experiences the days surrounding her husband's death in a non-chronological order. Despite negative reviews, several critics, including Rex Reed, commended Sandra Bullock for her performance, and the film grossed US$84.1 million around the globe. In 2008, Bullock was announced as \"the face\" of the cosmetic brand Artistry.\n\nThe year 2009 proved to be especially good for Bullock, giving the actress two record highs in her career. The romantic comedy \"The Proposal\", with Ryan Reynolds, grossed US$317 million at the box office worldwide, making it her fourth-most successful picture to date. She received her third Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress role for Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The drama \"The Blind Side\" opened at number two behind \"\" with US$34.2 million, making it her second-highest opening weekend ever. \"The Blind Side\" grossed over US$309 million, making it her highest-grossing domestic film, her fourth-highest-grossing film worldwide, and the first one in history to pass the US$200 million mark with only one top-billed female star. Bullock had initially turned down the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy three times due to a discomfort with portraying a devout Christian. She was awarded the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress. \"The Blind Side\" also received an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination.\n\nWinning the Oscar also gave Bullock another unique distinction—since she won two \"Razzies\" the day before, for her performance in \"All About Steve\" (2009), she is the only performer ever to have been named both \"Best\" and \"Worst\" for the same year. Following a two-year hiatus from the screen, Bullock starred alongside Tom Hanks, as a widow of the September 11 attacks, in the drama \"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\", a film adaptation based on the novel of the same name.

Bullock was nominated for Best Actress Drama by Teen Choice Awards.\n\nIn 2013, Bullock starred alongside Melissa McCarthy in the comedy \"The Heat\", as a FBI Special Agent who, along with a city detective, must take down a mobster in Boston.

Bullock also starred as an astronaut stranded in space in the thriller \"Gravity\", opposite George Clooney, which premiered at the 70th Venice Film Festival, and was released on October 4, 2013 to coincide with the beginning of World Space Week. \"Gravity\" received universal acclaim among critics and a standing ovation in Venice. The film was called \"the most realistic and beautifully choreographed film ever set in space\", and Bullock's performance was praised, with some critics calling \"Gravity\" the best work of her career. \"Variety\" wrote:\n\n\"Gravity\" took in US$716 million at the box office worldwide, making it Bullock's second-most successful picture. For her role as Dr. Ryan Stone, Bullock was nominated for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress.\n\nIn 2015, Bullock provided the voice of the villain in the animated film \"Minions\", which became her highest-grossing film to date with over US$1.1 billion worldwide, and she executive produced and starred, as a political consultant hired to help win a Bolivian presidential election, in the drama \"Our Brand Is Crisis\", based on the 2005 documentary film of the same name by Rachel Boynton. Upon the film's release, which was a critical and commercial flop, she took another sabbatical from film. Bullock returned in an all-female spin-off of the \"Ocean's Eleven\" franchise, \"Ocean's 8\" (2018), which was directed by Gary Ross, playing Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala in New York City. The film was a commercial success, grossing US$296.9 million globally. \n\nBullock played Malorie, a woman who must find a way to guide herself and her children to safety despite the potential threat from an unseen adversary, in the Netflix post-apocalyptic horror film \"Bird Box\" (also 2018), the adaptation of Josh Malerman’s novel of the same name, directed by Susanne Bier. For her performance, the actress has received universal acclaim. \"Variety\" found her to be \"wonderfully self-resilient\", while \"TheWrap\" described her as “brilliant [...] her performance was equally terrifying and fascinating to watch.“ , Bullock's films have grossed over US$5.3 billion worldwide, and her total domestic gross stands at over US$2.6 billion.\n\nSince her acting debut, Bullock has been dubbed \"America's sweetheart\" in the media due to her \"friendly and direct and so unpretentious\" nature. \n\nShe was selected as one of \"People\" magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in the World in 1996 and 1999, and was also ranked No. 58 in \"Empire\" magazine's Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time list. On March 24, 2005, Bullock received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.\n\nIn 2010, \"Time\" magazine included Bullock in its annual \"TIME\" 100 as one of the \"Most Influential People in the World.\" Bullock was selected by \"People\" magazine as its 2010 Woman of the Year and ranked No. 12 on \"People\"s Most Beautiful 2011 list. \n\nIn September 2013, Bullock joined other Hollywood legends at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard by making imprints of her hand- and footprints in cement in the theater's forecourt. In November 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" named Bullock among the most powerful women in entertainment, and she was also named \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Entertainer of the Year due to her success with \"The Heat\" and \"Gravity\".\n\nIn 2014, Bullock ranked No. 2 on \"Forbes\" list of most powerful actresses and was honored with the Decade of Hotness Award by Spike Guys' Choice Awards.\nIn 2015, she was named \"The Most Beautiful Woman\" by \"People.\"\n\nBullock owns a production company, Fortis Films. She was an executive producer of the \"George Lopez\" sitcom (co-produced with Robert Borden and Bruce Helford), which garnered a syndication deal that banked her some US$10 million. Bullock tried to produce a film based on F.X. Toole's short story \"Million-Dollar Baby\", but could not interest the studios in a female boxing drama. The story was eventually adapted and directed by Clint Eastwood as the Oscar-winning film, \"Million Dollar Baby\" (2004). Fortis Films also produced \"All About Steve\" which was released in September 2009. Her father, John Bullock, is the company's CEO, and her sister, Gesine Bullock-Prado, is the former president.\n\nIn November 2006, Bullock founded an Austin, Texas restaurant, Bess Bistro, located on West 6th Street. She later opened another business, Walton's Fancy and Staple, across the street in a building she extensively renovated. Walton's is a bakery, upscale restaurant and floral shop that also offers services including event planning. After almost nine years in business, Bess Bistro closed on September 20, 2015.\n\nBullock has been a public supporter of the American Red Cross, having donated US$1 million to the organization at least five times. Her first public donation of that amount was to the Red Cross's Liberty Disaster Relief Fund. Three years later, she sent money in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunamis. In 2010, she donated US$1 million to relief efforts in Haiti following the Haiti earthquake, and again donated the same amount following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2017, she donated US$1 million to support Red Cross relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey in Texas.\n\nAlong with other stars, Bullock did a public service announcement urging people to sign a petition for clean-up efforts of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Bullock backs the Texas non-profit organization The Kindred Life Foundation, Inc., and in late 2008 joined other top celebrities in supporting the work of KLF's founder and CEO Amos Ramirez. At a fundraising gala for the organization, Bullock said, \"Amos has led many efforts across our nation that have helped families that are in need. Our country needs more organizations that are committed to the service that Kindred Life is.\"\n\nIn 2012, Bullock was inducted into the Warren Easton Hall of Fame for her donations to charities, and in 2013 was honored with the Favorite Humanitarian Award at the 39th People's Choice Awards in 2013 for her contributions to New Orleans' Warren Easton High School, which was severely damaged by 2005's Hurricane Katrina.\n\nBullock was once engaged to actor Tate Donovan, whom she met while filming \"Love Potion No. 9\". Their relationship lasted three years. She previously dated football player Troy Aikman, and actors Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Gosling.\n\nBullock married motorcycle builder and \"Monster Garage\" host Jesse James on July 16, 2005. They first met when Bullock arranged for her ten-year-old godson to meet James as a Christmas present. In November 2009, Bullock and James entered into a custody battle with James' second ex-wife, former adult film actress Janine Lindemulder, with whom James had a child. Bullock and James subsequently won full legal custody of James' five-year-old daughter.\n\nIn March 2010, a scandal arose when several women claimed to have had affairs with James during his marriage to Bullock. Bullock canceled European promotional appearances for \"The Blind Side\" citing \"unforeseen personal reasons.\" On March 18, 2010, James responded to the rumors of infidelity by issuing a public apology to Bullock. He stated, \"The vast majority of the allegations reported are untrue and unfounded … beyond that, I will not dignify these private matters with any further public comment.\" James declared, \"There is only one person to blame for this whole situation, and that is me.\" He asked that Bullock and their children one day \"find it in their hearts to forgive me\" for their \"pain and embarrassment.\" James' publicist subsequently announced on March 30, 2010 that James had checked into a rehabilitation facility to \"deal with personal issues\" and save his marriage to Bullock. However, on April 28, 2010, it was reported that Bullock had filed for divorce on April 23 in Austin, Texas. Their divorce was finalized on June 28, 2010, with \"conflict of personalities\" cited as the reason.\n\nBullock announced on April 28, 2010 that she had proceeded with plans to adopt a son born in January 2010 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bullock and James had begun an initial adoption process four months earlier. Bullock's son began living with them in January 2010, but they chose to keep the news private until after the Oscars in March 2010. However, given the couple's separation and then divorce, Bullock continued the adoption of her son as a single parent.\n\nIn December 2015, Bullock announced that she had adopted a second child, and appeared on the cover of \"People\" magazine with her then -year-old new daughter.\n\nOn December 20, 2000, Bullock, who was the only passenger, and the two crew all escaped uninjured in the crash of a chartered business jet. The pilots were unable to activate the runway lights during a night landing at Jackson Hole Airport due to the use of out-of-date approach plates, but continued the landing anyway. The aircraft landed in the airport's graded safety area between the runway and parallel taxiway and hit a snowbank. The accident caused a separation of the nose cone and landing gear, partial separation of the right wing, and a bend in the left wing.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, while Bullock was in Massachusetts shooting the film \"The Proposal\", she and her then-husband Jesse James were in an SUV that was hit head-on (driver's side offset) at moderate speed by a drunken driver. Vehicle damage was minor and there were no injuries.\n\nIn October 2004, Bullock won a multimillion-dollar judgment against Benny Daneshjou, the builder of her Lake Austin, Texas home; the jury ruled that the house was uninhabitable. It has since been torn down and rebuilt. Daneshjou and his insurer later settled with Bullock for roughly half the awarded verdict.\n\nOn April 22, 2007, a woman named Marcia Diana Valentine was found lying outside James and Bullock's home in Orange County, California. When James confronted the woman, she ran to her car, got behind the wheel, and tried to run over him. She was said to be an obsessed fan of Bullock. Valentine was charged with one felony count each of aggravated assault and stalking. Bullock obtained a restraining order to bar Valentine from \"contacting or coming near her home, family or work for three years\". Valentine pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and stalking. She was subsequently convicted of stalking and sentenced to three years' probation.\n\nBeginning in 2002, Bullock was also stalked across several states by a man named Thomas James Weldon. In 2003, Bullock obtained a restraining order against him, which was renewed in 2006. After the restraining order expired and Weldon was released from a mental institution, he again traveled across several states to find Bullock; she then obtained another restraining order.\n\nIn June 2014, Joshua James Corbett broke into Bullock's Los Angeles home. Bullock locked herself in a room and dialed 911. Corbett pleaded no contest in 2017 and was sentenced to five years' probation for stalking Bullock and breaking into her residence. He was then subject to a 10-year protective order requiring him to stay away from Bullock. On May 2, 2018, after Corbett missed a court date the previous month, police officers went to his parents' residence where he lived in a guest house to arrest him. When he refused to leave and threatened to shoot officers, a SWAT team was called. After a five-hour standoff, the SWAT team deployed gas canisters and entered the house, where they found Corbett had committed suicide. Corbett's death was the result of \"multiple incised wounds\" according to the Los Angeles County coroner.\n\n\n"}

It toured nationally and appeared at the Edinburgh International Festival. The company represented British Theatre at the International Theatre Biennale in Warsaw in 1986 with Sir David Lyndsay's \"Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaites\".\n\nDespite attracting large audiences and its success in securing commercial sponsorship, including Scottish Television, it was brought to an end when the Scottish Arts Council stopped its annual funding.

{"id": "540098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540098", "title": "Screentone", "text": "Screentone\n\nScreentone is a technique for applying textures and shades to drawings, used as an alternative to hatching. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to paper from preprinted sheets, but the technique is also simulated in computer graphics. It is also known by the common brand names Zip-A-Tone (1937, now defunct), Chart-Pak (1949), and Letratone (1966, from Letraset).\n\nA traditional screentone sheet consists of a flexible transparent backing, the printed texture, and a wax adhesive layer. The sheet is applied to the paper, adhesive down, and rubbed with a stylus on the backing side. The backing is then peeled off, leaving the ink adhered to the paper where pressure was applied.\n\nA screentone saves an artist's time by allowing quick application of textures to line art where a hand-shaded area would not be reproduced in a timely or acceptable manner. Much like halftone, the size and spacing of black dots, lines, or hatches determine how light or dark an area will appear. Visual artists need to take into account how much an image will be reduced when prepared for publication when choosing the pitch of a screentone. Screentones can also be layered to produce interference patterns such as moire effects, or to simulate multiple sources of shadow in an image.\n\nDifferent styles of screentone exist, variously intended to depict clothing, clouds, emotions, backgrounds, gradients and even objects such as trees. While the sheets are most commonly produced with black ink, there are also varieties in solid and patterned colors. Screentones can also be modified by lightly scratching the backing with an X-Acto blade to produce starbursts and other special effects.\n\nScreentones are widely used by illustrators and artists, especially for cartoons and advertising. Use of the original medium has been declining since the advent of graphics software and desktop publishing, but it is still used, for example in manga.\n\nWhile computer graphics software provides a variety of alternatives to screentone, its appearance is still frequently simulated, to achieve consistency with earlier work or avoid the appearance of computer-generated images. It is sometimes accomplished by scanning actual screentone sheets, but original vector or bitmap screen patterns are also used.\n\n"}

While the palace has disappeared, records do list the paintings, consisting of depictions of muses, that hung in the room. These secular works are now dispersed across museums, but their collective presences recall the renewed attention of Renaissance patrons to symbols from classic mythology.\nThe palace, like the Palazzo Schifanoia, is described now a \"delizia\" of the Este dynasty, which are now considered semi-rural palaces for the enjoyment of \"delights\". The palace was commissioned in 1447 by Leonello d'Este but completed by Borso d'Este around 1463. The exact layout of the palace, located near the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli is unknown, since in 1483, it was severely damaged by the besieging Venetian armies, and a fire in 1683 completed the destruction.\n\nLeonello had commissioned the Studiolo dedicated to the Muses.\n\nThe decorative layout of the room was conceived by Guarino Veronese, a tutor of Lionello, In 1447, Guarino mailed Lionello a description of the allegorical figures. By 1449, the palace had the paintings of Clio and Melpomene. Decoration of the studio continued after the death of tutor and pupil, and the program underwent modifications. The intarsia walls were destroyed along with the palace. Eight of the nine canvases are now attributed to this room:\n\nSupposedly the iconography parallels a bas-relief (1454-1456) depicted by Agostino di Duccio in the Tempio Malatestiano of Rimini.\n"}

The Northern Renaissance work is one of a series of works, five of which still survive, that depict different times of the year. The painting is in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria. This scene is set in the depths of winter during December/January.\n\n\"The Hunters in the Snow\", and the series to which it belongs, are in the medieval and early Renaissance tradition of the Labours of the Months: depictions of various rural activities and work understood by a spectator in Breugel's time as representing the different months or times of the year. \n\nThe painting shows a wintry scene in which three hunters are returning from an expedition accompanied by their dogs. By appearances the outing was not successful; the hunters appear to trudge wearily, and the dogs appear downtrodden and miserable. One man carries the \"meager corpse of a fox\" illustrating the paucity of the hunt. In front of the hunters in the snow are the footprints of a rabbit or hare - which has escaped or been missed by the hunters. The overall visual impression is one of a calm, cold, overcast day; the colors are muted whites and grays, the trees are bare of leaves, and wood smoke hangs in the air. Several adults and a child prepare food at an inn with an outside fire. Of interest are the jagged mountain peaks which do not exist in Belgium or Holland.\n\nThe landscape itself is a flat-bottomed valley (a river meanders through it) with jagged peaks visible on the far side. A watermill is seen with its wheel frozen stiff. In the distance, figures ice skate, play hockey with modern style sticks and curl on a frozen lake; they are rendered as silhouettes.\n\nThe 1560s was a time of religious revolution in the Netherlands, and Bruegel (and possibly his patron) may be attempting to portray an ideal of what country life used to be or what they wish it to be.\n\nWriting in the \"opinion\" section of \"Nature\", art historian Martin Kemp points out that Old Masters are popular subjects for Christmas cards and states that \"probably no 'secular' subject is more popular than ... \"Hunters in the Snow\"\".\n\n\"Hunters in the Snow\" is used extensively in Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky's films \"Solaris\" (1972) and \"The Mirror\" (1974), and in Lars von Trier's 2011 film \"Melancholia\". It appears also in Alain Tanner's film \"Dans la ville blanche\" (1983). It was an inspiration for Roy Andersson's 2014 film \"A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence\", and it is the basis for the first frame of Abbas Kiarostami's \"24 Frames\" (2017).\n\nThe surviving \"Months of the Year cycle\" are:\n\n"}

It attempts to strengthen the main weaknesses of the 1970 UNESCO \"Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property\". The UNIDROIT Convention seeks to fight the illicit trafficking of cultural property by modifying the buyer's behaviour, obliging him/her to check the legitimacy of their purchase.\n\nThe Convention states that if a cultural property was stolen it must be returned (Chapter II, Art. 3.1). \nAny possessor deprived of his/her property will be compensated only if he/she can prove due diligence at the time of the purchase (Chapter II, Art. 4.1). The criteria for due diligence is listed under Article 4.4. of the Convention.\n\nTo assess the legitimacy of the object's origin, art market players can use international and national databases dedicated to cultural property protection, for instance, the INTERPOL Stolen Works of Art Database collects information about stolen cultural property and issues identification numbers to cultural objects.\n\nWhereas Chapter II of the Convention deals with stolen cultural objects, Chapter III contemplates the export of cultural property in violation of national export restrictions. A State Party can request the competent Court of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from its territory if the removal of the object caused detriment in one of the ways listed under Article 5.3. Again, the burden of proof is on the possessor to demonstrate that he/she \"neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported\" (Art. 6.1).\n\nThese rules apply equally to cultural objects inherited or received as gifts. Either an heir or a beneficiary has the same responsibility as a buyer. Therefore, museums and other public institutions must carry out checks over the origin of donated objects.\n\nThe UNESCO \"Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property\" (1970 UNESCO Convention) and the UNIDROIT Convention are compatible and complementary. \nAs distinct from the UNESCO Convention, the UNIDROIT Convention focuses on the recovery of cultural property. The UNIDROIT Convention establishes conditions for claims of restitution/return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects respectively.\n\nAlthough the UNIDROIT Convention follows key terminology of 1970 UNESCO Convention, cultural goods do not need to be defined as such by the State.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"cultural property\" is replaced by a more comprehensive \"cultural object\", but the list of their categories remains the same. The concept of \"illicit export\" is replaced by \"illegal export\", which references a prohibitive law rather than a general forbiddance.\n\nThe Convention regulates the time period that an affected party may bring a claim for the restitution of stolen cultural property or the return of those illegally exported. \nSuch a claim may be brought in three years from the time when the claimant knew the location of the cultural property and the identity of the possessor and in 50 years since the time of the theft (Art. 3.3). However, there are exceptions to this rule for stolen objects. \nCultural objects that form an integral part of an identified monument or archaeological site, or which belong to a public collection are not subject to time limitation other than a period of three years (Art. 3.4). In addition, a Contracting State may declare that a claim warrants an extended time limit of 75 years or longer if so stated in its national law (Art. 3.5).\n\nThe UNIDROIT Convention is not a retroactive treaty. Its provisions only apply to cultural property stolen or illegally exported after the Convention entered into force (Art. 10). However the UNIDROIT Convention \"does not in any way legitimise any illegal transaction of whatever which has taken place before the entry into force of this Convention\" and does not \"limit any right of a State or other person to make a claim under remedies available outside the framework\" of the Convention (Art. 10.3).\n\n\n"}

For example, a USB flash drive might be mounted in an outdoor brick wall and fixed in place with fast concrete. Members of the public are implicitly invited to find files, or leave files, on a dead drop by directly plugging their laptop into the wall-mounted USB stick in order to transfer data. (It is also possible to use smartphones and tablets for this purpose, by utilizing a USB on-the-go cable.) The dead drops can therefore be regarded as an anonymous, offline, peer-to-peer file sharing network. However, in practice USB dead drops are often used for social or artistic reasons, rather than for practical ones.\n\nThe Dead Drops project was conceived by Berlin-based conceptual artist Aram Bartholl, a member of New York's Fat lab art and technology collective. The first USB dead drop network of five devices was started by Bartholl in October 2010 in Brooklyn, New York City. The name comes from the dead drop method of espionage communication. An unrelated system called \"deadSwap,\" in which participants use an SMS gateway to coordinate passing USB memory sticks on to one another, was begun in Germany in 2009.\n\nEach dead drop is typically installed without any data on the drive, except two files: deaddrops-manifesto.txt, and a readme.txt file explaining the project. Although typically found in urban areas embedded in concrete or brick since 2010, installation of USB dead drop into trees and other types of bodies in natural settings has also been mentioned since at least 2013. Wireless dead drops such as the 2011 PirateBox, where the user connects to a wifi hotspot with local storage rather than physically connects to a USB device, have also been created.\n\nSome of the advantages of utilizing USB dead drops are practical in nature: they permit P2P file sharing without needing any internet or cellular connection, sharing files with another person secretly/anonymously, and they record no IP address or similar personally identifying information. Other benefits are more social or artistic in nature: USB dead drops are an opportunity to practice \"datalove\" and can be seen as a way to promote off-grid data networks. The motive to utilize USB dead drops has been compared to what drives people involved in geocaching, which has been around for much longer and is somewhat similar in that often a set of GPS coordinates is used to locate a particular USB dead drop, in particularly that USB dead drops give the user \"the thrill of discovery\" both in seeking out the location of the dead drop, and then also in addition when examining the data it contains.\n\nDead drops are USB-based devices, which must be connected to an upstream computer system (laptop or smartphone or similar). The act of making such a connection, to a device which is not necessarily trusted, inherently poses certain threats: \n\nPublicly and privately available USB dead drops give anyone (with physical access) the ability to save and transfer data anonymously and free of charge. These features are advantages over the internet and the cellular network, which are at best quasi-anonymous and low-cost (there is always some fee associated although in certain scenarios such as government-subsidized or employer-subsidized or public-library-subsidized network access the enduser may experience no direct costs). However, offline networks are vulnerable to various types of threats and disadvantages, relative to online ones:\n\nAs of 2013, there were more than one thousand known USB dead drops (plus six known wifi-based dead drops). Countries which have large numbers of USB dead drops include the United States and several in Europe. As of 2016, it was estimated that the overall dead drop infrastructure contained more than ten terabytes of storage capacity, with the majority still in the United States and Europe, but also with significant numbers of devices reportedly installed in the Asia/Pacific region, South America, and Africa.\n\n\n"}
