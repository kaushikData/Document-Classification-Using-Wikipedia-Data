The story is set in the kingdom of Nellurupattinam, of which the main protagonist Aaravalli (G. Varalakshmi) and her sister Sooravalli (S. Mohana) are the undisputed rulers. They were seven sisters, but the reins of control were in the hands of Aravalli and Sooravalli, who are described as having magical powers. Bheema (Thirupathisamy) offers to conquer them, however he is defeated by these women, who also humiliate him and lock him up in prison. However, Bheema manages to escape the prison. Sooravalli visits Indraprasta and she complains to King Dharma (K. Nadarajan) about his brother Bheema. Dharma concedes to her demands and sends back his brother to Nellurupattinam.\n\nThe astrologer Sahadevan formulates a master plan against the two cunning women. The plan is to use their nephew Alli Muthu (S. G. Eswar), the son of their sister Sangavathy (M. S. Draupadi), for the specific purpose of challenging the position of sisters on behalf of the Pandavas. So, Alli Muthu and his companion named as Arayathi (Kaka Radhakrishnan) set out towards the kingdom Nellurupattinam.\n\nOn their arrival in Nellurupattinam, they meet the magician queens who ask Alli Muthu to undergo three challenges. Alli Muthu accepts these challenges and ventures to complete them. Alli Muthu meets Aaravalli's daughter Alangaravalli (Mynavathi) at the palace and is fascinated by her and eventually they both fall in love. Then, Alli Muthu performs the three challenges and comes victorious with the help of Alangaravalli. As a sign of their submission, the two queens offer their daughter Alangaravalli in marriage to the victorious Alli Muthu.\n\nThe newlywed couple and Arayathi arrive at Indraprasta kingdom. The pair make their way into forest where the bride (Alanaravalli) in her innocence, follows the instruction of her mother and gives poisoned sweets to her husband. After first intoxicating his sense with the fragrance of poisoned bouquet, she asks Arayathi for help to discover the dead body of her husband. Arayathi rescues her companion's life. She cursed her wicked mother and Aaravalli agrees all truth. Then, Sahadevan formulates a plan to discuss with Abimanyu (V. Gopalakrishnan) and Arayathi, that Alli Muthu's life shall not end. So, Sahadevan wants to know which type of poison was used on Alli Muthu.\n\nAbimanyu and Aryathi get help to Singaravalli (T. P. Muthulakshmi), and told her in secret, that the poison is named as \"Karkotan\". Meanwhile, Aaravalli hears the news, so she disguises herself like a woman saint and begs to Dharma for food. Dharma arranges for lunch for her, but she sees Alli Muthu's dead body and the angered saint leaves the house. Then, she was forced to burn Alli Muthu's dead body. King Dharma arranged for the ritual event and set fire to Alli Muthu's body. Fortunately, Abhimanyu reaches at the correct time and saves Alli Muthu's life and curses his defeat. Then Alli Muthu captures the Nelluru Pattinam Kingdom. The two queens and his wife were arrested.\n\nThey are tried in front of King Dharma. But the two queens reject the case. So, King Dharma gives punishment to Alli Muthu. Then Alangavalli admitted to all crimes. King Dharma gives judgement to her and Aaravalli. Alangaram's head was to be cut off and her mother was to catch it. Then Alangaram requests to King Dharma, that her head was to be cut off by her husband hands; her mother stops the punishment and approved, Alli Muthu defeats death. Then Alli Muthu reunites with his wife.\n\n\n\nMusic was composed by G. Ramanathan and lyrics written by A. Maruthakasi, Pattukottai Kalyanasundaram and Villiputhan.

{"id": "40125139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40125139", "title": "Baigneuses (Metzinger)", "text": "Baigneuses (Metzinger)\n\nBaigneuses, also called Bathers, is a Proto-Cubist painting, now lost or missing, created circa 1908 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger. Possibly exhibited during the spring of 1908 at the Salon des Indépendants (n. 4243). This black-and-white image of Metzinger's painting, the only known photograph of the work, was reproduced in Gelett Burgess, \"The Wild Men of Paris\", \"Architectural Record\", May 1910. The painting was also reproduced in \"The New York Times\", 8 October 1911, in an article titled \"The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon\", and subtitled, \"Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do\".\n\n\"Baigneuses\", likely an oil painting on canvas (as practically all Metzingers' works of the period), was painted in a vertical format with unknown dimensions.\n\nThe work represents at least four nude women (or bathers) relaxing in a highly abstract landscape with vegetation and a small body of water visible through reflections and from the woman on the left whose legs are submerged from the knees down. The central figure holds the trunk of a tree with her left arm and a woman with her right, forming a tight central mass. The two nudes at the center, treated in a light color, stand-out against a darker background. They are flanked on both sides by a standing and a sitting nude.\n\nThe colors of the painting, as its dimensions and whereabouts, are unknown\n\nLeading up to 1910, the draftsman, illustrator and poet Gelett Burgess interviewed and wrote about artists and artworks in and around Paris. The result of Burgess' investigation was published after his visit to the 1910 Salon des Indépendants, the massive anti-establishment art exhibition in Paris, and one year before the scandalous group exhibition that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. At the 1910 Indépendants Jean Metzinger showed his \"Portrait of Apollinaire\" (the first Cubist portrait according to Guillaume Apollinaire); Albert Gleizes showed his \"Portrait de René Arcos\" and \"L'Arbre (The Tree)\", paintings in which the emphasis on simplified geometric form overwhelms representational interests. Louis Vauxcelles in his review of the 1910 Salon des Indépendants made a passing and imprecise reference to Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay, Léger and Le Fauconnier, as \"ignorant geometers, reducing the human body, the site, to pallid cubes.\" The works of Metzinger, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay were exhibited together. Le Fauconnier showed the geometrically simplified \"Ploumanac'h\" landscapes: \"Le Ravin\" and \"Village dans les Montagne\", along with \"Femme à l'éventail\" and \"Portrait of Maroussia\". In the same exhibition hung the works of Henri Matisse, Maurice de Vlaminck, Raoul Dufy, Marie Laurencin, Kees van Dongen and Henri Rousseau.\n\nGelett Burgess writes in \"The Wild Men of Paris\" of the same exhibition:\n\nThere were no limits to the audacity and the ugliness of the canvasses. Still-life sketches of round, round apples and yellow, yellow oranges, on square, square tables, seen in impossible perspective; landscapes of squirming trees, with blobs of virgin color gone wrong, fierce greens and coruscating yellows, violent purples, sickening reds and shuddering blues.<br><br>\n\nBut the nudes! They looked like flayed Martians, like pathological charts—hideous old women, patched with gruesome hues, lopsided, with arms like the arms of a Swastika, sprawling on vivid backgrounds, or frozen stiffly upright, glaring through misshapen eyes, with noses or fingers missing. They defied anatomy, physiology, almost geometry itself!\nAfter the death of Paul Cézanne in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in the form of several large exhibitions and a retrospective at the Salon d'Automne of 1907, greatly affecting the direction taken by the avant-garde artists in Paris. Prior to the advent of Cubism, Cézanne's geometric simplifications and optical phenomena inspired not just Metzinger, Matisse, Derain and Braque, but the other artists who earlier exhibited with the Fauves. Those who had not transited through a Fauve stage, such as Picasso, also experimented with the complex fracturing of form. Cézanne had thus sparked a wholesale transformation in the area of artistic investigation that would profoundly affect the development modern art.\nThe Fauvism of Metzinger, Matisse and Derain was virtually over by the spring of 1907. And by the Salon d'Automne of 1907 it had ended for many others as well. The shift from bright pure colors loosely applied to the canvas gave way to a more calculated geometric approach. The priority of simplified form began to overtake the representational aspect of the works. The simplification of representational form gave way to a new complexity; the subject matter of the paintings progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.\nBurgess continues:\n\nThough the school was new to me, it was already an old story in Paris. It had been a nine-days’ wonder. Violent discussions had raged over it; it had taken its place as a revolt and held it, despite the fulmination of critics and the contempt of academicians. The school was increasing in numbers, in importance. By many it was taken seriously. At first, the beginners had been called \"The Invertebrates.\" In the Salon of 1905 they were named \"The Incoherents.\" But by 1906, when they grew more perfervid, more audacious, more crazed with theories, they received their present appellation of \"Les Fauves\"—the Wild Beasts. And so, and so, a-hunting I would go!\n\nTurning his attention to Metzinger's abode, Burgess writes in The Architectural Record:\n\nMetzinger once did gorgeous mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that an effect of vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have noticed that he likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque as if they had been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.<br><br>\n\nWhat’s Metzinger? A scrupulously polite, well-dressed gentleman as ever was, in a scrupulously neat chamber, with a scrupulously well-ordered mind. He is complete as a wax figure, with long brown eyelashes and a clean-cut face. He affects no idiosyncrasies of manners or dress. One cannot question his earnestness and seriousness or sincerity. He is, perhaps, the most articulate of them all. Let us not call him prim.<br><br>\n\n\"Instead of copying Nature,\" [Metzinger] says, \"we create a \"milieu\" of our own, wherein our sentiment can work itself out through a juxtaposition of colors. It is hard to explain it, but it may perhaps be illustrated by analogy with literature and music. Your own Edgar Poe (he pronounced it ‘Ed Carpoe’) did not attempt to reproduce Nature realistically. Some phase of life suggested an emotion, as that of horror in ‘The Fall of the House of Ushur.’ That subjective idea he translated into art. He made a composition of it.\"<br><br>\n\n\"So, music does not attempt to imitate Nature’s sounds, but it does interpret and embody emotions awakened by Nature through a convention of its own, in a way to be aesthetically pleasing. In some such way, we, taking out hint from Nature, construct decoratively pleasing harmonies and symphonies of color expression of our sentiment.\" (Jean Metzinger, circa 1909)\n\nThere is a close association between Metzinger's \"Baigneuses (Bathers)\" and Picasso's 1908 \"Paysage aux deux figures (Landscape with Two Figures)\". Both stances are verbalized with the same abstract vocabulary. In both cases, the figures are camouflaged or blended with the background, their bodies forming part of the landscape. These works were completed at a time when Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir in Montmartre, where he may have seen Picasso's painting. There are differences, too, worth noting between the two works (aside from the size and colors which are unknown in the Metzinger case). While the dominant feature of Picasso's painting is the landscape, Metzinger chose to highlight the figures; the landscape playing only a secondary role in the overall composition. Metzinger's figures are much larger relative to the canvas. They are prominently and symmetrically displayed, and of lighter color contrast relative to Picasso's asymmetrical juxtaposition and subdued contrasting. Two of Metzinger's nudes—to the right and left of the dominant central figures—are quite inconspicuous, as in Picasso's piece. In both paintings the nudes and landscape have become unified, not presuming a representation of reality.\n\nThey are the product of a reductive abstracting process, of an open, freewheeling process of synthesis—where a dialogue between components lead to the liberation from any particular classical foundation. They are combined harmoniously though pictographic imagery rendered in residuum abstractions of apparent mathematical codes. In the case of Metzinger, his prowess in mathematics is well documented. In the case of Picasso, the mathematical association with his paintings has been made through Maurice Princet.\nMetzinger's early interests in mathematics is well documented. He was familiar with the works of Gauss, Riemann and Jules Henri Poincaré (and perhaps Galilean relativity) prior to the development of Cubism: something that reflects in his pre-1907 works. The French mathematician Maurice Princet promoted the work of Poincaré, along with the concept of the fourth spatial dimension, to artists at the Bateau-Lavoir. He was a close associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger. Princet is known as \"le mathématicien du cubisme.\" He brought to the attention of these artists a book entitled \"Traité élémentaire de géométrie à quatre dimensions\" by Esprit Jouffret (1903) a popularization of Poincaré's \"Science and Hypothesis\". In this book Jouffret described hypercubes and complex polyhedra in four dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page. Princet became estranged from the group after his wife left him for André Derain. However, Princet would remain close to Metzinger and participate in meetings of the Section d'Or in Puteaux. He gave informal lectures to the artists, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order. In 1910, Metzinger said of him, \"[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry\".\nPicasso's \"Landscape with Two Figures\" is almost entirely Cézannian, in its color, in its reduction to simplified forms and in its loose brushwork. Picasso still shows a sense of depth perspective through shading, despite some flattening of the surface. Metzinger's painting is less influenced by Cézanne in its brushstrokes, hardly visible in this photograph. Its quasi-Nabis post-Symbolist treatment can be observed, but Metzinger vacates all depth of field. The background and foreground have become one. The only devices that indicate depth are (1) elevation in the picture plane; lower is closer and further is higher, and (2) objects in front of others obscure the object in the background, such as the central nude appears in front of the nude she holds with her right hand.\n\nIn both paintings, the faces of the models have been left out, featureless, reduced to their simplest spherical form.\n\nIn light of the fact that Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir since 1908 and exhibited with Georges Braque at Berthe Weill's gallery, introduced to Picasso by Max Jacob and Guillaume Krotowsky (who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire), and in view of the similarities between the two works, it is probable that Metzinger's \"Bathers\" was painted the same year; 1908. The differences between the two paintings suggest that, while Metzinger may have been influenced by Picasso (unlike Albert Gleizes), his intention was certainly not to copy or even resemble the Spaniard, as would soon Braque (or \"visa versa\"). His intention was to create his own brand of art, dependent on his own lived experience.\n\nThen the kingdom of the Fauves whose civilization had appeared so new, so powerful, so startling, took on suddenly the aspect of a deserted village.<br><br>\n\nIt was then that Jean Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the Cubist City. (Guillaume Apolllinaire, 1913)\n\nWhether in advanced non-objective mathematical workings or abstract geometrical form, along with his non-representative dislocated outward appearance, Metzinger creates a pure image—\"the total image\".\n\nBy 1908–09, in such studies as \"Baigneuses (Bathers), it is apparent that Metzinger was not following the lead of Picasso or Braque in their hermetic approach to painting—he had little interest in imitating, whether it be \"an orb on a vertical plane\" or anything else—Metzinger was on a path leading to abstraction and to the almost total disintegration of recognizable form.\n\nMetzinger's \"Baigneuses\" was reproduced in the 8 October 1911 issue of \"The New York Times\". This article was published a year after \"The Wild Men of Paris\", and two years prior to the Armory Show, which introduced astonished Americans, accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism, Cubism, and Futurism. The 1911 \"New York Times\" article, a review of the 1911 Salon d'Automne, portrayed works by Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Metzinger and others dated before 1909; not exhibited at the 1911 Salon. The article is titled: \"The 'Cubists' Dominate Paris' Fall Salon\" and subtitled, \"Eccentric School of Painting Increases Its Vogue in the Current Art Exhibition - What Its Followers Attempt to Do.\"\n\nAccording to Metzinger, in his \"Cubism was Born\", published years later, Cubism had been born out of the \"need not for an intellectual art but for an art that would be something other than a systematic absurdity\"; the idiocies of reproducing or copying nature in trompe l'oeil on a surface that is rigorously flat. With this type of illusion other artist of his generation such as Gleizes and Picasso wanted nothing to do. \"Quite clearly\" Metzinger notes, \"nature and the painting make up two different worlds which have nothing in common ...\" Already, in 1906, \"it could be said that a good portrait led one to think about the painter not the model\".\n\nIn his \"Le Cubisme était Né: Souvernirs\", Metzinger writes:\nAs for Picasso ... the tradition he came from had prepared him better than ours for a problem to do with structure. And Berthe Weil was right when she treated those who compared him/confused him with, a Steinlen or a Lautrec as idiots. He had already rejected them in their own century, a century we had no intention of prolonging. Whether or not the Universe was endowed with another dimension, art was going to move into a different field.<br><br>\n\nThe illusion had been maintained up to 1906 or 1907 through the negligence of those whose job it was to clear away the rubbish, but the break was achieved in 1908. No-one would again dare to look at a Puvis de Chavannes or read Balzac. No-one, I mean, among those who walked above the Moulin Rouge, which they would never even have thought of entering.\n\nMetzinger continues:\n\nI had measured the difference that separated art prior to 1900 from the art which I felt was being born. I knew that all instruction was at an end. The age of personal expression had finally begun. The value of an artist was no longer to be judged by the finish of his execution, or by the analogies his work suggested with such-and-such an archetype. It would be judged – exclusively – by what distinguished this artist from all the others. The age of the master and pupil was finally over; I could see about me only a handful of creators and whole colonies of monkeys. (Jean Metzinger, Cubism was Born)\n\nFrom his Montmartre studio on the rue Lamarck to Picasso's Bateau Lavoir studio on the rue Ravignan, writes Metzinger, \"the attempt [\"prétention\"] to imitate an orb on a vertical plane, or to indicate by a horizontal straight line the circular hole of a vase placed at the height of the eyes was considered as the artifice of an illusionistic trickery that belonged to another age.\"\n\nI wanted an art that was faithful to itself and would have nothing to do with the business of creating illusions. I dreamed of painting glasses from which no-one would ever think of drinking, beaches that would be quite unsuitable for bathing, nudes who would be definitively chaste. I wanted an art which in the first place would appear as a representation of the impossible. (Metzinger)\n\nIt was the search for beauty that had attracted Metzinger to the abstract. Beauty depends not only on geometrical forms or simplified colors, but plainly beauty as it exists in itself. It wasn't just the simple result of a reductive approach to the elements of all the parts. It wasn't either just a dialectic view of everything that led him just as simply to treat each object as opposed to the other, and therefore thoroughly distinct. The blurring of differences was against the entire tenor of the whole.\n\nThe narrative of Metzinger outlined by his \"Bathers\" schematic geometric arrangements was the result of an abstracting process not solely based on \"axiomatics\". These axiomatic abstractions, however, by themselves contain no assertions as to the reality that can be experienced, not in a logical sense deduced from experience, but free inventions of the human mind, abstractions, construed by mathematical means. With works such as \"Bathers\" had emerged a growing accent on the power of the mind to create for itself, a growing spirit of abstraction, of invention, fabrication.\n\nAs one would expect, Metzinger’s concept of painting was both more sophisticated and perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally the shape of the misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, and at the same time brought out the \"flatness\" and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an \"n\"-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).\n\nNearly conscious in someone like Michelangelo, or Paolo Uccello, quite intuitive in painters such as Ingres, or Corot, it works on the basis of numbers which belong to the painting itself, not to whatever it represents.

{"id": "29586180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29586180", "title": "Contemporary African art", "text": "Contemporary African art\n\nContemporary African art is commonly understood to be art made by artists in Africa and the African diaspora in the post-independence era. However, there are about as many understandings of contemporary African art as there are curators, scholars and artists working in that field. All three terms of this \"wide-reaching noncategory [sic]\" are problematic in themselves: What exactly is \"contemporary\", what makes art \"African\", and when are we talking about art and not any other kind of creative expression? Western scholars and curators have made numerous attempts at defining contemporary African art in the 1990s and early 2000s and proposed a range of categories and genres. They triggered heated debates and controversies especially on the foundations of postcolonial critique. Recent trends indicate a far more relaxed engagement with definitions and identity ascriptions. The global presence and entanglement of Africa and its contemporary artists have become a widely acknowledged fact that still requires and provokes critical reflection but finds itself beyond the pressure of self-justification.\n\nAlthough African art has always been contemporary to its producers, the term \"contemporary African art\" implies a particular kind of art that has conquered, or, as some would say, has been absorbed by the international art world and art market since the 1980s. It is in that decade when Europe and the US became aware of art made in Africa by individual artists, thus breaking with the colonial tradition of assuming collective \"ethnic\" origins of so-called \"tribal art\" as found in most ethnographic collections. The exhibition \"Magiciens de la terre\" by Jean-Hubert Martin in 1989 is widely considered (but also challenged as) a key exhibition in this very recent history of international reception of African and other non-western art. However, this reception, too, has its roots in an exotizing and mystifying view on African culture from a dominant western position, as Rasheed Araeen argued in his response to \"Magiciens de la terre\".\n\nTherefore, although this exhibition and many that followed had a strong influence in creating a kind of a common understanding of what constitutes contemporary African art, it is true that it has been and still is subject to discussions and controversies. Almost every exhibition following \"Magiciens de la terre\" offered a taxonomy or system of categorization that helped to reflect the very notion of contemporary African art, but they failed to recognize the postcolonial need of giving up the Eurocentric epistemology.\n\nContemporary African art is believed to feature particularities typical to African aesthetics while at the same time it shares properties with other international contemporary arts. Therefore, it is both, shaped by and feeding into the globalizing art worlds and art markets, like any other contemporary arts. At the same time, there are a lot of contemporary art practices and forms in African regions and cities that are almost exclusively locally known. While meeting all three requirements of being contemporary, art, and African, they fail to fit into a certain type of art production that has been spreading on the international art market in the last 30 years.\n\nExhibitions variously showed work by artists based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists living in the West but including aesthetics and topics related to their \"roots\"; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed a wide range of taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed \"Western\" into \"African\" modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. Mount who proposed four categories: first, \"survivals of traditional styles\", which show continuities in traditional working material and methods such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly, souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules-Rossette; and finally, an emerging art requiring \"techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art\". Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a \"tradition-inspired\" one, a \"modernist\" trend, and \"a popular art\" whereby Mount’s categories would be situated somewhere \"between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend”. Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective \"currents\". In the exhibition catalogue of \"Africa Explores\" (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between \"traditional art\", \"new functional art\", \"urban art\", \"international art\", and \"extinct art\". Rejecting these categories, collector André Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named \"territory\", \"frontier\" and \"world\" in his survey book \"Contemporary African Art\", thus placing them into \"imaginary maps\". However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective. Among other things, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than \"particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent\" that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition \"Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition\", the Studio Museum in Harlem tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.\n\nA commonality to all these categorizations is their reliance on dichotomies between art and craft, Europe and Africa, urban and rural, and traditional and contemporary. These dichotomies tend to consider mutual influences in African and European art as an exception rather than the norm. Even more, they fail to think of African art independent from Europe as its counterpart or \"influence\", resulting in a frequent reproach of African artists \"copycatting\" or \"mimicking\" European achievements of modernism. Such Eurocentric attitudes have been revealingly criticized by theorists such as Olu Oguibe, Rasheed Araeen, Nkiru Nzegwu, Okwui Enwezor or Salah Hassan. This problem is not easy to solve, and in some cases it is tackled by simply subverting any attempt of categorization. \"Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa\", directed by Clémentine Deliss and curated by Chika Okeke-Agulu, Salah Hassan, David Koloane, Wanjiku Nyachae and El Hadji Sy (London, 1995) is a case in point. Rather than grafting binary taxonomies, it narrated seven modern art histories in different parts of Africa by invited curators and artists who were familiar with these recent histories and their respective art scenes. The exhibition proved to offer a highly complex, historically informed and well-researched presentation. Another example for subverting binary taxonomies is the book \"Contemporary African Art after 1980\" by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu. Rather than putting contemporary African art in relation to Western traditions, they contrast it with modern African art, in that it defies linear grand narratives of modernism and is radically postcolonial. \"[F]irst, within categories of time, it is neither belated nor does it exist out of time; second, because it is post-historical, it did not emerge out of a succession of historical styles; third, because it is critical of colonial valorization of an authentic past, it is postcolonial; and fourth, in relation to its postcoloniality, it seeks, according to Hans Belting’s thesis, to be post-ethnic […]. Neither being out of time nor belated, contemporary African art strategically inhabits a third epistemological space by being in time.\" As they add, this being \"fundamentally of its time\" counts for all contemporary art, not only the African. In their book, Enwezor and Okeke-Agulu discuss contemporary African art by its approaches and guiding topics rather than trying to define categories on the basis of styles, markets or traditions. Their chapters therefore are designated as \"Between postcolonial utopia and postcolonial realism\", \"Networks of practice\" in the globalized field of cultural production, \"Politics, culture and critique\", \"Archive, document, memory\", \"Abstraction, figuration and subjectivity\" and \"The body politic: difference, gender, sexuality\". Doing so, they locate contemporary African art within a historical perspective, something that had largely missed in previous discussions.\n\n\n1966\n\n1967\n\n1969\n\n1974\n\n1977\n\n1978\n\n1979\n\n1984\n\n1985\n\n1986\n\n1987\n\n1988\n\n1989\n\n1990\n\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n2009\n\n2010\n\n\n2011\n\n2012\n2013\n\n2014\n\n\n"}

Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral.\n\nDefensive design in software engineering is called defensive programming. Murphy's law is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design. It is considered the opposite approach to design by contract.\n\n\n"}

It was made between 1270 and 1280 and contains the coat of arms of 324 knights, starting with two illegitimate children of King John. Sir Edward Dering acquired the roll during the 17th century and modified it to include a fictitious ancestor of his own. It was eventually purchased by the British Library (as Add Roll 77720) following fund raising involving a number of other charities and individuals.\n\nGlover's Roll, made in 1586, is a copy of a now lost roll dating from even earlier, from the reign of King Henry III (1216–1272).\n\nThe Dering Roll depicts the coats of arms of around a quarter of the English baronage during the era of Edward I. Emphasis was given to knights from Sussex and Kent, as it was produced in Dover between 1270 and 1280 and the document was designed to list the knights who owed feudal service there. It depicts 324 coats of arms, beginning with Richard Fitz Roy and William de Say, two of King John's illegitimate sons. The shields are arranged in 54 rows, with six shields on each line. Above each shield reads the knight's name, except in six cases where it has been omitted or removed. Stephen de Pencester may have commissioned the roll during his time as Constable of Dover Castle.\n\nSir Edward Dering acquired the Roll whilst lieutenant of Dover Castle, and made his modification after 1638, removing the coat of arms of Nicholas de Crioll and inserting his own coat of arms with a fictitious ancestor named Ric[hard] fi[t]z Dering in order to prove the history of his own family. This appears adjacent to the shield for Thomas de Marines (\"or a cross engrailed gules\"). \n\nThe trail of Richard fitz Dering (built upon sources dependent upon Dering's collections) leads, or was intended to lead, to the manor of Heyton in Stanford, Kent (where the connection with the family of Marinis was mentioned by Edward Hasted), and exemplified by charters like that in Thomas Willement's hands. A descent through a branch of the de Haute family of Wadenhall, Waltham, Kent was then indicated, but Sir Edward Dering's constructive approach to genealogy leaves many of the sources bedevilled by doubts of authenticity.\n\nDuring the 20th century it was acquired by Sir Anthony Wagner. On 4 December 2007, the roll was sold at auction at Sotheby's for the sum of £192,000 to a private individual who subsequently applied for an export licence. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport placed a temporary block on the roll being moved overseas and the British Library led efforts to purchase it, after the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art confirmed it to be of sufficient importance and significance. The library raised £194,184 to acquire the roll; the Head of Medieval and Earlier Manuscripts, Claire Breay said of the purchase, \"the acquisition of the Dering Roll provides an extremely rare chance to add a manuscript of enormous local and national significance.\" They were assisted in funding the purchase from The Art Fund (£40,000), the National Heritage Memorial Fund (£100,000), Friends of the British Library (£10,000), Friends of the National Libraries (£10,000), and a number of individual benefactors. It is now on display at the Sir John Ritblat Gallery in the British Library, and available to researchers in the library's manuscripts reading room.\n\n"}

{"id": "26283054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26283054", "title": "Electronic Disturbance Theater", "text": "Electronic Disturbance Theater\n\nThe Electronic Disturbance Theater (EDT), established in 1997 by performance artist and writer Ricardo Dominguez, is an electronic company of cyber activists, critical theorists, and performance artists who engage in the development of both the theory and practice of non-violent acts of defiance across and between digital and non-digital spaces. Ricardo Dominguez, Brett Stalbaum, Stefan Wray, and Carmin Karasic collectively form EDT. Taking the idea of the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, the EDT members have always used their real names. As a collective group they organize and program computer software to show their views against anti-propagandist and military actions, and begin mobilizing micronetworks to act in solidarity by staging virtual sit-ins online and allowing the emergence of a collective presence in direct digital actions.\n\nThe EDT created a program called FloodNet to allow electronic civil disobedience (ECD). This was a form of hacktivism which would help create the simulation of a sit-in protest over the Internet simply known as a virtual sit-in demonstration to disrupt Zapatista oppressors' websites, by overloading their computer networks and servers. The Electronic Disturbance Theater group believe that the Internet should not be used purely as a means for communication and data exchange; it is also a forum for direct action.\n\nCurrent active members of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, who refer to themselves as Electronic Disturbance Theater 2.0, include Brett Stalbaum, Amy Sara Carroll, Elle Mehrmand, Micha Cárdenas, and Ricardo Dominguez (professor). \n\nThe group has received a storm of media attention for their 2007 project, the \"Transborder Immigrant Tool\" (TBT), which sends experimental poetry to users in addition to helping them find water and safe routes when crossing the Mexican-American border. EDT have described this project as the next step of electronic civil disobedience, or ECD 2.0. The Transborder Immigrant Tool was shown in numerous museums and galleries in 2010, including the California Biennial at the Orange County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, and the Galería de la Raza in San Francisco. The project is maintained by California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology.\n\nElectronic Disturbance Theater is currently under investigation for their virtual sit-in in support of the 2010 March 4 strikes and occupations in support of public education.\n\nThe group's objective was, with the use of digital media and internet based technology, to demonstrate nonviolent resistance in support of the Zapatista rebels residing in the state of Chiapas in Mexico. EDT uses both e-mail and the Internet to promote their work around the world, encouraging fellow supporters to download and run a tool based on HTML (Hyper Text Makeup Language) and Java applet (an internet program used to help support interactive web-based features or programs that a HTML cannot provide alone) called FloodNet. FloodNet is a computer-based program, created by members of the Electronic Disturbance theater company Carmin Karasic and Brett Stalbaum.\n\nThe FloodNet program would simply reload a URL for short several times, effectively slowing the website and network server down (a DDOS attack), if a high number of protesters were to join in the sit-in at one time. The EDT would first execute the FloodNet software in what would be for them a dress rehearsal before attacking their main targets on April 10, 1998, and a month later, on both Mexican and American government websites, representing both the Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and American President Bill Clinton.\n\nFloodNet would work on this basic idea taken from street theater practices and political rallies and protest, but instead present it on a much larger and international stage, with the facilitation of macro-networks and non-digital forms of action.\n\nThe EDT's mission was to allow the voices of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation to be heard, after the attack on the small remote village of Acteal in Chiapas, Mexico. The Paramilitary, a government-funded military squad, surrounded a Catholic church during a Tsotsil Mayan (a spoken Mexican language from around the Chiapas area of Mexico). For the next several hours the Paramilitary shot everyone to death, those inside the church and any who tried to escape, resulting in the death of fifteen children, nine men, and twenty-one women, four of whom were pregnant, on December 22, 1997. This event became known as the Acteal Massacre. Those who were convicted of this crime were later released in the Supreme Court to the outrage of many, after ignoring eyewitness reports and allowing those who confessed to this crime on humanity. Instead, the Supreme Court focused on the mismanagement of the investigation and the fabrication of evidence.\n\nThe Electronic Disturbance Theater took notice of these actions when others did not and arranged their first act of electronic civil disobedience against the Mexican Government. In a subsequent version of FloodNet, those who had downloaded the FloodNet program in support of the Zapatistas were asked to repeatedly input the names of those that had lost their lives at the hands of the Mexican Army in military attacks. This would then target the servers to return an error message each time these URLs would be requested. This data request would be stored in a server's error log and in the eyes of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Electronic Disturbance Theater group, a symbolic list of those 45 Acteal civilians who had died straight to their murderers. If enough people used the FloodNet applet, this would cause the computer server running the website to overload, so that when a regular visitor or someone working within the site tried to access the website or send company based emails and files, the pages would either load extremely slowly or not at all. This worked on the same basis of a real sit-in demonstration, where the protesters block the entrance to a public building of their oppressors and preventing access to the building.\n\nWith around 25% of the world's population in one way or another connected to the World Wide Web, with the use of dial-up internet connection, wired or wireless internet broadband connection and even mobile internet technology, every one of these means of communication can allow the internet to be used as a means of non-violent action within human rights, and is viewable around the world, and can be translated into different languages but most importantly not controlled by the government. The EDT networked performances have already opened access and communication between three unlikely micro-networks: net.art, net.activism, and net.hackers. With technology always evolving there is no telling how these areas will grow.\n\nHowever, on June 10, 1998, the EDT struck the Mexican Secretaria de Gobernacion (Secretary of Government), which is involved in immigration policies as well as Mexico's federal public security forces working in conjunction with the military Zapatista communities in Chiapas unsuccessfully. The Mexican government would have a programmed countermeasure in place. This is what the EDT believe took place. A countermeasure built into the operating JavaScript was placed in the Secretaria de Gobernacion's website that was designed to activate whenever FloodNet was directed toward its servers. Upon activation, the website would open window after window on the FloodNet user's Internet browser. If the FloodNet user remained connected long enough, their browser, whether it is Netscape or Internet Explorer, could crash the activist's computer, forcing the activist to reboot their system and stopping the FloodNet program at the source. The EDT has since dealt with both the Mexican government both online and offline and the United States Department of Defense, which has now inserted a counter attack system into their internet browser-based coding to prevent any more FloodNet-based attacks to the system and server.\n\nThe FloodNet system was used again against the World Trade Organization in 1999, where the group would release their online civil disobedience software to the public under the name \"Disturbance Development's Kit\".\n\nThe Electronic Disturbance Theater has been, and is likely to remain, a heated topic of debate within its areas of activity such as: political up rise, civil disobedience, hacktivism, and acts which cave been called cyber terrorism. The FloodNet program enables protesters to voice their grievances in a non-violent sit-in style, without having to attend protests and rallies in person. Additionally FloodNet incorporated Usernames which allowed protesters to be protected from potential retaliation, as their real names did not have to be used. There are those who have criticized that FloodNet constitutes an inappropriate use of bandwidth which impinges upon the right of those affected to use the internet which those same detractors claim should be free for anyone to use despite political views. A particular example of FloodNet detractors is The Virtual Republic, their representatives view EDT's blockage of both communications and data as an act of cyber terrorism. The Virtual Republic believes the system should be open for all internet users, and should be accessible with a simple point-and-click, furthermore it is their opinion that those individuals or groups which might impede the free access to internet resources should be banned. Protesters are asked to protest outside of their oppressors' physical location by means which will not affect the business conducted within. Representatives of The Virtual Republic have further opined that actions of the EDT are nothing more than agit-prop and act only to block data in the struggle for the development of democracy and human rights.\n\n\n"}

Following Krippendorf, EED focuses on creating meaningful and sense-making opportunities for engagement, and addressing aspirational and fundamental psychological needs of an employee, such as autonomy, competence and relatedness.\n\nRelated to design strategy, EED is a participatory systems approach to workplace improvements that applies methods and principles of experience design, such as design thinking, co-creation and empathic design. It also uses tools and techniques that are typical to customer experience management and service design, e.g. employee experience journey mapping or touchpoint analysis.\n\nPrimary design object is the employee experience, which – when successful – an employee finds unique, memorable and sustainable over time, would want to repeat and build upon, and enthusiastically promotes via word of mouth. It is suspected to encourage loyalty by creating an emotional connection through engaging, compelling, and consistent context. The categories for employee experience design context are products, processes, artefacts, content, space and interactions.\n\nHuman resource management, operating across hierarchies and departments, plays a central role in design, distribution and delivery of EED. As co-creation is an important design principle, it is a shared task and joint responsibility of leadership, HR professionals and employees. Following the logic of the service-profit chain, beneficiaries are also customers, as the recipients of improved service quality and the organization itself through increased profits.\n"}

Major filming locations were Fort Kochi and Sri Lanka. Principal photography began in late-June 2016. The film grossed 50 crore at the box-office.\n\nThe film opens with the death of the last Malabar Jew in Kochi. An antique seller steals a Dybbuk box with Jewish inscriptions from his house. Upon opening it, a dybbuk from the box kills the thief.\n\nMeanwhile, Ranjan Mathew (Prithviraj Sukumaran), a nuclear waste management specialist based in Mumbai, moves to Kerala due to work obligations, along with his wife Priya Raghuram (Priya Anand). Being a Marathi-Malayali, Priya finds it hard to adjust with the shift from Mumbai to Kerala. On a retail therapy, Priya buys the box from the antique shop. Upon opening it, paranormal activities are experienced by Ranjan and Priya.\n\nRanjan is an orphan who was living with his mother's brother Fr. Samuel (Vijayaraghavan). Samuel is invited to Ranjan's house. Samuel feels that something is amiss and he tells Ranjan that the box from the antique shop is a Dybbuk. Ranjan finds more about the Dybbuk from a Rabbi David Benyamin (Babu Antony). He tells Ranjan that the Dybbuk only possesses people without mental stability or children under 3 years. The next day, Rabbi Benyamin is dead and Ranjan finds that Priya is pregnant. He comes to the conclusion that his child is possessed. Ranjan finds more about the Dybbuk in his house with the help of Rabbi Marques (Rabbi Benyamin's son) (Sujith Shankar).\n\nThey get to know about a story in 1941 Thiru-Kochi. The story revolves around a Rich Jewish boy Abraham Ezra (Sudev Nair) and a poor Christian girl Rosy (Ann Sheetal) and their relationship. They both meet up daily in the villages and river banks and their relationship develop into a serious stage when Ezra gifts her a wedding gown which worn by Jewish bride and promises her to never leave her alone and marry her and they end up having passionate sexual intercourse and eventually Rosy got pregnant. Rosy was not ready to accept the reality and had a fear of losing Ezra from her life, since they both belong to different religions. One day Rosy makes Ezra to promise in the name of Jesus that he would never leave her alone and marry her even if their family oppose. Rosy was not able to tell Ezra that she was pregnant. So once Ezra wanted to leave to Kochi, he decided to tell his father about his relationship with Rosy so that he can convince Rosy's parents too.\n\nEzra's father refuses his wish to marry Rosy, since they belong to Jewish community and they marry only a Jewish girl. Ezra is forced to break up with Rosy by his father. Without knowing this, Rosy awaits Ezra to comeback. Months later Rosy showed up signs of pregnancy and she is caught by her mother. Her parents tried to make her understand the situation and asked her to tell who's child was she carrying, but Rosy trusted Ezra and was not ready to betray him so she remain silent and she is locked up in a room by her parents. Without knowing all this conflicts, months later, depressed Ezra writes a letter to Rosy telling her to end their relationships and erase him from her life. In sorrow Rosy commit suicide by wearing the wedding gown which was gifted by Ezra to show that she still love him. Later Rosy's father find the letter which was send by Ezra to Rosy and finds that they were in a relationship. He went to meet Ezra and his father. However, he was killed by Ezra and his father. The villagers tried to hit Ezra and they attempted to kill him. Ezra was seriously injured and he was taken to the hospital by his father.\n\nThe doctors confirms that he is brain dead . Ezra's father decides to take revenge on the people of the society. Ezra's father purposefully kills him to create Dybbuk. Instead of seeing his son in a brain-dead condition, he invoked black magic and made his son's soul enter into a Dybbuk box. The box was created in such a way that the spirit would destroy the entire community who killed Ezra. He let the others know that Ezra had died and they then buried Ezra's body, which was really a wooden dummy. For the spirit of Ezra to become a Dybbuk, his body could not be given a proper burial. Ezra's father then took Ezra's body, which was wrapped in a cloth, to the sea and dumped it.\n\nThe story comes back to Ranjan. Marques wants the Dybbuk to leave Ranjan and his family. So with the help of A.C.P Shafeer Ahammed (Tovino Thomas), he confirms that Abraham Ezra's story is true. Finally, he decides to exorcise the Dybbuk. But, it is revealed that it is not Priya, but Ranjan whom the spirit of Ezra has possessed. Fr. Samuel tell them that Ranjan, as orphan had mental problems in his childhood and because Ranjan is a nuclear waste management specialist, the Dybbuk would be easily able to destroy the society. At last, Ranjan is exorcised but failed. Marques along with other Jews try to control Ezra but Priya is trapped under Ezra but then suddenly looking at pregnant Priya, Ezra remembers Rosy and his love towards her made him to leave Priya. Finally the dybbuk who is uncontrollable is made to enter the box by Marques. The box is then taken to an ocean by Marues and Shafeer and dumped exactly like Ezra'a body was dumped.\n\nLater, Priya gives birth to a healthy baby and she and Ranjan are sharing their happy news with Marques. In a mid credit scene, it is shown that the Dybbuk box is found by some young men who were loafing about the sea shore. The film end by them taking the box with them planning to open it.\n\n\nOn February 2016, Jay K, who was an associate director to Rajeev Ravi, announced that he will make his directorial debut through a film called Ezra. It was announced that the film will be a horror thriller involving a love story and will explore the history of Jewish culture in Kerala. Jay K said that the film is not made to frighten the spectators, but has a strong plot. He also confirmed that the film will be dubbed in Tamil and Telugu languages. Mukesh R. Mehta, C. V. Sarathy and A. V. Anoop produce the film under the banner of E4 Entertainment and AVA Productions. Rahul Raj and Tirru were roped in for the music and cinematography respectively. But both of them left the project for reasons unknown.

It is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and tours worldwide. It is a non-profit organization which employs people with physical and intellectual disabilities. Those individuals share duties in dining room management, arts administration, and theatrical and visual arts performances.\n\nSince inception, the company has paid homage to the works of famous people within its own theatrical context, hence the name \"Famous People\" Players.\n\nThe Famous People Players was founded on June 1, 1974, by Diane Dupuy of Hamilton, Ontario. At inception, the company consisted of Dupuy and an assistant, eleven performers, and Dupuy's mother Mary Thornton; Thornton designed and built the costumes and props.\n\nThe company's original piece was \"Aruba Liberace\", in which a life-size character of Liberace plays the piano. It is still the company's signature performance. Liberace attended a showing of \"Aruba Liberace\", and was so impressed he invited Famous People Players to perform with him in Las Vegas. The company debuted in Las Vegas in October 1975; over the subsequent ten years, the company performed with Liberace both in Las Vegas and internationally.\n\nAs a result of the increasing popularity of Famous People Players, the company was featured as regulars on CBC Television's 1976-1977 variety series, \"The Wolfman Jack Show\"; the network also later produced and aired \"Carnival of the Animals\". In 1980, \"Sorcerer Apprentice\" premiered at Radio City Music Hall in New York. In 1982, Famous People Players was invited to perform in the People's Republic of China. The company's first Broadway Show, \"A Little Like Magic\", opened at the Lyceum Theatre in New York City and ran for 49 performances in 1985. They returned to New York in 1994 for a 4 week run, under the sponsorship of Phil Collins and actor Paul Newman, where they performed the show \"A Little More Magic\" for inner city kids to dream BIG!\n\nIn 1994, the company opened the Dine and Dream Theatre; Paul Newman funded the restaurant's development from some of the proceeds of Newman's Own products and Phil Collins funded the theatre's sound system. In 2009, facing the demolition of its 25-year location, the company moved further west to a new location. Despite damage caused by storms and unexpected costs from the city of Toronto, the company survived and opened its first show in its new location on October 23, 2009.\n\nThe Dine and Dream Theatre is located at the company's Toronto west-end headquarters. Guests first arrive to the restaurant for dinner, where they are served by individuals who also perform in Famous People Players productions. After dinner, they are led to the Phil Collins Theatre, where the main production is performed. The theatre is named after Phil Collins, who became a source of inspiration for the actors when he viewed a performance interpretation of his music. It is currently the only theatre in Canada exclusively devoted to puppetry performance.\n\nThe troupe has been subject of numerous talk shows, specials and documentaries. A 1984 CBS movie-of-the-week entitled \"Special People\" was based on the company's early history. \"A Little Like Magic\", which detailed the company's operation and success, was an Emmy Award-winning documentary. The company was also featured in the plot of an episode of the popular U.S. television drama \"7th Heaven\" in 2002.\n\nIn co-production with Treehouse's \"Roll Play\" Famous PEOPLE Players program for the juice box set is hugely popular. The theatre troupe first broke into this market with their Toronto Dinner Theatre as a guest spot location for Treehouse kingpin \"This is Daniel Cook.\"\n\nFounder Diane Dupuy has been inducted as a member of the Order of Canada in recognition for her contributions to Canadian society through the company and mother Mary C. Thornton has won many accolades, most recently with The Toastmasters as woman of the year.\n\nFamous People Players has created many productions over its 30-year history. (\"Note: The table below is currently incomplete.\")\n\n\"Leave the Porch Light On\" was the company's first original, full-length musical production and was created for the company's 25th-anniversary. The initial performance of \"Leave the Porchlight On\" was attended by a number of celebrities and other well-known people, including the Governor General of Canada. The production was very successful and is still occasionally performed at the company's theatre in Toronto and on tour. A sequel of sorts followed two years later, entitled \"Hide and Seek: A Game of Human Spirit\".\n\n"}

They entice Dawn to commit crimes by promising her fame, supplying her with drugs and money, and photographing her crimes to stoke her vanity.\n\nGater's aunt, Ida Nelson, is distraught over her nephew's marriage because she hopes he will \"turn nelly\" and take a male lover. When the marriage fails, Dawn persuades the Dashers to fire Gater, who moves to Detroit to work in the auto industry. Ida blames Dawn for driving Gater away and exacts revenge by throwing acid in her face, leaving Dawn hideously disfigured. The Dashers discourage Dawn from having corrective cosmetic surgery and use her as a grotesquely made-up model. They kidnap Ida, imprison her in a large birdcage in Dawn's apartment, and give Dawn an axe to chop off her hand as revenge for the acid attack.\n\nTaffy, now a teenager, is distressed by her mother's criminal lifestyle and convinces her to reveal the identity of her father. Taffy finds her father living in squalor and drinking excessively. She stabs him to death with a butcher knife after he tries to sexually assault her. Taffy returns home, falsely claims she was unable to locate her father, and announces she is joining the Hare Krishna movement. Dawn warns her she will kill her if she does.\n\nDawn, now with bizarre hair, make-up, and outfits provided by the Dashers, mounts a nightclub act. When Taffy appears backstage chanting mantras in religious attire, Dawn fulfills her threat and strangles her to death. Dawn brandishes a gun onstage during her nightclub act and begins firing into the crowd, wounding and killing several audience members. When police arrive to ostensibly subdue the crowd, they shoot several audience members themselves. However, they allow the Dashers to leave when they claim to be upright citizens caught in a bloody rampage. Dawn flees into a forest, but is soon arrested by the police and put on trial for murder.\n\nAt the trial, the judge grants the Dashers immunity from prosecution for testifying against Dawn. The Dashers feign innocence and completely blame Dawn for the crimes she committed at their behest; they also pay Ida to lie on the witness stand. Although Dawn pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, the jury finds her guilty and sentences her to die in the electric chair. Before Dawn is executed, she and a female prisoner kiss and fondle each other. As the priest says a prayer and Dawn is strapped to the electric chair, she thanks her fans for making her infamous before being electrocuted.\n\n\nThe lyrics to the title song, sung by Divine, were written by Waters and set to a pre-existing piece of music.\n\n\nThe film has an 87% \"Fresh\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews.\n\nThe initial 16mm release of the film which was shown at colleges ran 92 minutes. However, when the film was blown up to 35mm and shown theatrically, it was cut to 89 minutes. This version was the only version seen in the United States for many years. However, a recent restoration was done of the original cut, which runs 97 minutes; it has played at this 97-minute length in Europe, however, since its initial release.\n\nThe 97-minute version was shown only in select theaters and was included in an out-of-print DVD set paired with \"Pink Flamingos\" (\"Female Trouble\" is still available on DVD as a single disc and as part of a DVD box set, \"Very Crudely Yours, John Waters\"). This version also has a soundtrack remixed in stereo surround. The 97-minute version contains some additional scenes, including the chase through the woods, as well as an appearance by Sally Turner, the Elizabeth Taylor look-alike customer in the Lipstick Beauty Salon (Turner served as Divine's double in the junkyard sex scene between Dawn Davenport and Earl Peterson).\n\nThe film was shown in the 89-minute cut when re-released in 2002.\n\nThe 97-minute version is now available on DVD and includes an audio commentary by Waters.\n\nThe Criterion Collection released a restored version of the film in 4K on DVD and Blu-ray on June 26, 2018.\n\n\n"}

It is committed to art action in association with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.\n\nIn 1991, a group of New York City lesbians formed 'fierce pussy' to address issues of lesbian identity and visibility. All of its members were involved in AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power (ACT UP) to fight the AIDS pandemic. Low-tech and low budget, the collective responded to the urgency of those years, using readily available resources: old typewriters, found photographs, their own baby pictures, and the printing supplies and equipment accessible in their day jobs.\n\nOriginally fierce pussy was composed of a fluid and often shifting cadre of dykes including Pam Brandt, Jean Carlomusto, Donna Evans, Alison Froling, and Suzanne Wright. Many other women came to an occasional meeting, and joined in to wheat paste, stencil and sticker. Since 2008, four of the original core members—Nancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, Zoe Leonard, and Carrie Yamaoka—continue to work together.\n\nOne of fierce pussy's more well-known projects was the use of wheat-pasted posters and crack-and-peel stickers that were interspersed throughout New York City. In addition, their other projects included re-designing the bathroom at the Gay and Lesbian Center, a greeting card campaign, a video public service announcement, a moving billboard truck, and renaming the street signs along the New York City Gay Pride route in 1991 after prominent lesbian heroines. Since 2008, their work has appeared in various installations and exhibitions in New York City. Their site specific installation, \"For The Record\", was part of the exhibit \"Greater New York\" in 2015.\n\nWhile Fierce Pussy was most active between 1991 and 1995, their work is still exhibited as historic examples of AIDS-related art and lesbian-identified art. From 2008 to 2010 at the Lesbian Herstory Archives, fierce pussy presented an overview of their old work in addition to a new installation entitled \"Mining the Archive, \"in which objects from the archive were utilized. In addition, fierce pussy contributed their display to the White Columns featured exhibit \"ACT UP New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS crisis, 1987-1993\". This exhibition was revived at Harvard University's Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts in 2009. When the exhibition moved to White Columns, they were commissioned to make the installation called \"Get Up Everybody and Sing.\" In 2010, fierce pussy created \"Get Up Everybody and Sing\" for the White Columns presentation of the ACT UP New York exhibition; in 2015, VisualAIDS made this exhibit available under the name \"For the Record\". Fierce pussy has made an overview retrospective of their older work available at Printed Matter, which also published the book \"fierce pussy\".\n\n"}

The project implementation unit is a Non-governmental organization Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” (Russian name: Градостроительное бюро «Сердце города»), located in Kaliningrad, Russia.\n\nThe project emerged as a joint initiative of the members of the Ministry of Culture working under the leadership of the Governor of Kaliningrad Region, Nikolay Tsukanov. The Ministry of Culture under the Governor of the Kaliningrad Region is an advisory body established in 2005 designed to foster cooperation between cultural institutions, mass media, NGOs, the artistic and cultural community, and to develop proposals on different issues in the sphere of culture. The project is implemented in close cooperation with the Government of Kaliningrad Region, the Kaliningrad City Administration and the Kaliningrad Regional Branch Office of the Union of Architects of Russia. The Project Leader is a cultural expert, a writer and an architectural critic Alexander Popadin.\n\nBecause of the severe damages during the Second World War and uncompleted town planning projects of the Soviet times, so far, the city centre of Kaliningrad remains virtually empty and undeveloped in terms of urban infrastructure and design. In 2012, after several years of public and expert consultations held with Russian and foreign experts, the Kaliningrad Oblast Government launched the long-term program for the systematic regeneration of the historical part of the city, which is known for its seven centuries of history as Königsberg and still preserves some features of its original urban fabric. To implement the project named “Heart of the City”, the “road map” was developed to cover the areas of the King’s Mountain (Korolevskaya gora), the adjacent embankment of the Pregolya River and the Lower Lake.\n\nIn 2013, the Historic and cultural study of the “Heart of the City” project areas was conducted to set the basis for further activities within the project. The researchers determined the boundaries of twelve historic areas (corresponding to former Königsberg city parts), analysed their historic and cultural assets, and made recommendations for their future development. The study was presented to the local authorities and discussed with professionals and the local community on numerous occasions.\n\nIn 2014, the Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” organised and conducted an international architectural and urban planning competition for the Development Concept of the historic centre of Kaliningrad. The professional jury panel was represented by Bart Goldhoorn, Hans Stimmann, Barbara Engel, Rasmus Waern, Stephen Willacy, Olov Schultz, Alexander Lozhkin and Anna Brunow. The competition intended to find a new concept of the urban planning development of the area called “Korolevskaya Gora“ (Germ. Königsberg) and its surroundings (in total 56 ha). The winner emerging out of this competition was the St. Petersburg’s team of architects “Studio 44“ in partnership with St. Petersburg’s Institute of Territorial Development. The winners proposed an individual development scenario that would \"take the interplay between heritage and contemporary context to a totally new level.\" The former Altstadt would become a zone of archaeological research with a new medieval city growing on top of the ruined one. The reconstructed historic urban fabric and the strict regulations governing the height and the shape of the buildings, roof-slope angles and the use of finishing materials will generate echoes of something recognizably old-European. The Kneiphof Island is proposed to remain a park with the park alleys and landscape architecture reproducing the grid of the destroyed city blocks. The concept of Studio 44 became a Future Masterplanning category winner at the World Architecture Festival in 2015. The second prize was awarded to the consortium of companies Devillers et Associes (France) + Off-the-grid (Moscow, Russia) + Wall (Moscow, Russia); the two third prizes were won by the British architect Trevor Skempton and the Swedish studio \"Hosper Sweden\" AB. In 2015, the representatives of “Studio 44” and \"Devillers et Associes\"/\"Off-The-Grid Studio\" with the participation of the \"Heart of the City\" Bureau’s experts jointly elaborated a consolidated planning concept (a masterplan) for the development of the project area which was repeatedly discussed with local authorities, architects and the general public.\n\nThe consolidated planning concept formed the basis for the revisions of the current urban planning documents concerning the historic centre of Kaliningrad and led to a new open international design competition “Post-castle“ that was announced in May 2015. The competition sought to find an architectural image for a Historic and cultural complex on the grounds of the former Königsberg Castle that will accommodate a multifunctional concert hall, a museum of archaeology, a museum of the King’s castle history and other functions. In the final round of competition, 49 entries were submitted. The first prize was awarded to a young architect from Kaliningrad Anton Sagal (currently living in Italy). His design managed to combine all the requirements and particularly impressed the jury with the quality of the draft and the idea of creating several public spaces.\n\nAt present, the competition winner has been contracted for a conceptual design of the Historic and cultural complex. The Bureau continues working closely with local authorities to ensure that the results of both competitions are incorporated in the urban planning documents for the project area. The local authorities announced plans to start archaeological excavations on the grounds of the former Königsberg Castle. The construction works are planned to begin with the West Wing of the cultural complex.\n"}
{"id": "8391019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8391019", "title": "History of perfume", "text": "History of perfume\n\nThe word \"perfume\" is used today to describe scented mixtures and is derived from the Latin word, \"\"per fumus\",\" meaning \"through smoke\". The word Perfumery refers to the art of making perfumes. Perfume was further refined by the Romans, the Persians and the Arabs. Although perfume and perfumery also existed in East Asia, much of its fragrances were incense based. The basic ingredients and methods of making perfumes are described by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia.\n\nThe world's first recorded chemist is a woman named Tapputi, a perfume maker whose existence was recorded on a 1200 BCE Cuneiform tablet in Babylonian Mesopotamia. She held a powerful role in the Mesopotamian government and religion, as the overseer of the Mesopotamian Royal Palace. She developed methods for scent extraction techniques that would lay the basis for perfume making. She recorded her techniques and methods and those were passed on, with her most groundbreaking technique in using solvents.\n\nPerfume and perfumery also existed in Indus civilization, which existed from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE. One of the earliest distillation of Ittar was mentioned in the Hindu Ayurvedic text \"Charaka Samhita\" and \"Sushruta Samhita\". The perfume references are part of a larger text called Brihat-Samhita written by Varāhamihira, an Indian astronomer, mathematician, and astrologer living in the city of Ujjain. He was one of the ‘nine jewels’ in the court of the Maharaja of Malwa. The perfume portion mainly deals with the manufacture of perfumes to benefit ‘royal personages and inmates of harems’. The text is written as Sanskrit slokas with commentary by a 10th century Indian commentator Utpala.\n\nAccording to a 1975 report, archeologist Dr Paolo Rovesti found a terracotta distillation apparatus in the Indus valley together with oil containers made of the same material, carbon dated to 3000 BCE. The report also states that terracotta vessels with plugged orifices of woven materials were used so that when fragrant plant materials were covered with boiling water the vapours impregnated the material, which was subsequently wrung out to isolate the oil.\n\nTo date, the oldest perfumery was discovered on the island of Cyprus. Excavations in 2004-2005 under the initiative of an Italian archaeological team unearthed evidence of an enormous factory that existed 4,000 years ago during the Bronze Age. This covered an estimated surface area of over 4,000m² indicating that perfume manufacturing was on an industrial scale. The news of this discovery was reported extensively through the world press and many artifacts are already on display in Rome.\nThe Bible describes a sacred perfume (Exodus 30:22-33) consisting of liquid myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, fragrant cane, and cassia. Its use was forbidden, except by the priests.\nThe women wore perfume to present their beauty.\n\nIslamic cultures contributed significantly to the development of Western perfumery in two significant areas: perfecting the extraction of fragrances through steam distillation and introducing new raw materials. Both have greatly influenced Western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly chemistry.\n\nWith a rise of Islam, Muslims improved perfume production and continued to use perfumes in daily life and in practicing religion. They used musk, roses and amber, among other materials. As traders, Islamic cultures such as the Arabs and Persians had wider access to a wide array of spices, resins, herbs, precious woods, herbs and animal fragrance materials such as ambergris and musk. In addition to trading, many of the flowers and herbs used in perfumery were cultivated by the Muslims — rose and jasmine were native to the region, and many other plants (i.e.: bitter orange and other citrus trees, all of which imported from China and southeast Asia) could be successfully cultivated in the Middle East, and are to this day key ingredients in perfumery.\n\nIn Islamic culture, perfume usage has been documented as far back as the 6th century and its usage is considered a religious duty. Muhammad said:\n\nThey often used to blend extracts with the cement of which mosques were built. Such rituals gave incentives to scholars to search and develop a cheaper way to produce incenses and in mass production.\n\nMany great discoveries originates from the region in 10th century, the time when the still was invented, and as a consequence of which the distill techniques considerably improved. Thanks to the hard work of two talented Arabian chemists: Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber, born 722, Iraq), and Al-Kindi (Alkindus, born 801, Iraq) who established the perfume industry. Jabir developed many techniques, including distillation, evaporation and filtration, which enabled the collection of the odour of plants into a vapour that could be collected in the form of water or oil.\n\nAl-Kindi, however, was the real founder of perfume industry as he carried out extensive research and experiments in combining various plants and other sources to produce a variety of scent products. He elaborated a vast number of ‘recipes’ for a wide range of perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. His work in the laboratory is reported by a witness who said:\n\nThe writer goes on in the same section to speak of the preparation of a perfume called \"ghaliya\", which contained musk, amber and other ingredients; too long to quote here, but which reveals a long list of technical names of drugs and apparatus. Al-Kindi also wrote in the 9th century a book on perfumes which he named ‘\"Book of the Chemistry of Perfume and Distillations\"’. It contained more than a hundred recipes for fragrant oils, salves, aromatic waters and substitutes or imitations of costly drugs. The book also described one hundred and seven methods and recipes for perfume-making, and even the perfume making equipment, like the alembic, still bears its Arabic name.\n\nThe Persian Muslim doctor and chemist Avicenna (also known as Ibn Sina) introduced the process of extracting oils from flowers by means of distillation, the procedure most commonly used today. He first experimented with the rose. Until his discovery, liquid perfumes were mixtures of oil and crushed herbs, or petals which made a strong blend. Rose water was more delicate, and immediately became popular. Both of the raw ingredients and distillation technology significantly influenced western perfumery and scientific developments, particularly chemistry.\n\nEventually perfume arrived to European courts through Al-Andalus in the west, and on the other side, with the crusaders in the east. For instance, eggs and floral perfumes were brought to Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries from Arabia, by returning crusaders, through trade with the Islamic world. Those who traded for these were most often also involved in trade for spices and dyestuffs. There are records of the Pepperers Guild of London, going back to 1179; which show them trading with Muslims in spices, perfume ingredients and dyes. Catharina de Medici initiated the perfume industry in Europe when she left Italy in the 16th century to marry the French crown prince.\n\nKnowledge of something perfumery came to Europe as early as the 14th century due partially to Arabic influences and knowledge. But it was the Hungarians who ultimately introduced the first modern perfume. The first modern perfume, made of scented oils blended in an alcohol solution, was made in 1370 at the command of Queen Elizabeth of Hungary and was known throughout Europe as Hungary Water. The art of perfumery prospered in Renaissance Italy, and in the 16th century, Italian refinements were taken to France by Catherine de' Medici's personal perfumer, Rene le Florentin. His laboratory was connected with her apartments by a secret passageway, so that no formulas could be stolen en route.\n\nFrance quickly became the European center of perfume and cosmetic manufacture. Cultivation of flowers for their perfume essence, which had begun in the 14th century, grew into a major industry in the south of France mainly in Grasse now considered the world capital of perfume. During the Renaissance period, perfumes were used primarily by royalty and the wealthy to mask body odors resulting from the sanitary practices of the day. Partly due to this patronage, the western perfumery industry was created.\nPerfume enjoyed huge success during the 17th century. Perfumed gloves became popular in France and in 1656, the guild of glove and perfume-makers was established. Perfumers were also known to create poisons; for instance, a French duchess was murdered when a perfume/poison was rubbed into her gloves and was slowly absorbed into her skin.\n\nPerfume came into its own when Louis XV came to the throne in the 18th century. His court was called \"la cour parfumée\" (the perfumed court). Madame de Pompadour ordered generous supplies of perfume, and King Louis demanded a different fragrance for his apartment every day. The court of Louis XIV was even named due to the scents which were applied daily not only to the skin but also to clothing, fans and furniture. Perfume substituted for soap and water. The use of perfume in France grew steadily. By the 18th century, aromatic plants were being grown in the Grasse region of France to provide the growing perfume industry with raw materials. Even today, France remains the centre of the European perfume design and trade.\n\nAfter Napoleon came to power, exorbitant expenditures for perfume continued. Two quarts of violet cologne were delivered to him each week, and he is said to have used sixty bottles of double extract of jasmine every month. Josephine had stronger perfume preferences. She was partial to musk, and she used so much that sixty years after her death the scent still lingered in her boudoir.\n\nPerfume use peaked in England during the reigns of Henry VIII (reigned 1509-1547) and Queen Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603). All public places were scented during Queen Elizabeth's rule, since she could not tolerate bad smells. It was said that the sharpness of her nose was equaled only by the slyness of her tongue. Ladies of the day took great pride in creating delightful fragrances and they displayed their skill in mixing scents.\n\nAs with industry and the arts, perfume underwent profound change in the 19th century. Changing tastes and the development of modern chemistry laid the foundations of modern perfumery as alchemy gave way to chemistry.\n\nPerfume manufacture in Russia grew after 1861 and became globally significant by the early 20th century. The production of perfume in the Soviet Union became a part of the planned economy in the 1930s, although output was not high.\n\nIn early America, the first scents were colognes and scented water by French explorers in New France. Florida water, an uncomplicated mixture of eau de cologne with a dash of oil of cloves, cassia and lemongrass, was popular.\n\n"}
{"id": "118450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118450", "title": "Innovation", "text": "Innovation\n\nInnovation can be simply defined as a \"new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existingmarket needs. Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are made available to markets, governments and society. The term \"innovation\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \"breaks into\" the market or society. Innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and founders in startups, rather than existing organizations. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention, as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new/improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society, and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is exnovation.\n\nPronunciation of the word has long been argued about due to the unusual sounding of the o becoming an i. The phonetic sound would suggest a spelling of inivative if taken at the word of a true scholar. \n\nWhile a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science, and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In industrial economics, innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet growing consumer demand.\n\nA 2014 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions. In an industrial survey of how the software industry defined innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete, which builds on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) manual's definition: \n\nAccording to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.\n\nTwo main dimensions of innovation were degree of novelty (patent) (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is processor product-service system innovation). In recent organizational scholarship, researchers of workplaces have also distinguished innovation to be separate from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related but distinct constructs:\n\nIn business and in economics, innovation can become a catalyst for growth. With rapid advancements in transportation and communications over the past few decades, the old-world concepts of factor endowments and comparative advantage which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's global economy. Economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of innovation economics, argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as market distribution, such as the connection from the craft shop to factory. He famously asserted that \"creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism\". Entrepreneurs continuously look for better ways to satisfy their consumer base with improved quality, durability, service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies.\n\nA prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of Silicon Valley startups out of the Stanford Industrial Park. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of Shockley Semiconductor, the company of Nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor William Shockley, left to form an independent firm, Fairchild Semiconductor. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own, unique, latest ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years, this snowball process launched the momentous startup-company explosion of information-technology firms. Essentially, Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees. Since then, hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar metonyms, including Silicon Alley encompassing New York City.\n\nAnother example involves business incubators – a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world, close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other Government Excellence Centres – which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national economic growth.\n\nIn the organizational context, innovation may be linked to positive changes in efficiency, productivity, quality, competitiveness, and market share. However, recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements. Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee's core job tasks. Peter Drucker wrote:\nAccording to Clayton Christensen, disruptive innovation is the key to future success in business. The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity. The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.\n\nWhile disruptive innovation will typically \"attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly,\" foundational innovation is slower, and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business operating models as entirely new business models emerge over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of technological and institutional change that gain momentum more slowly. The advent of the packet-switched communication protocol TCP/IP—originally introduced in 1972 to support a single use case for United States Department of Defense electronic communication (email), and which gained widespread adoption only in the mid-1990s with the advent of the World Wide Web—is a foundational technology.\n\nAll organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. For instance, former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of potholes. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.\n\nStill other innovative strategies include hospitals digitizing medical information in electronic medical records. For example, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's HOPE VI initiatives turned severely distressed public housing in urban areas into revitalized, mixed-income environments; the Harlem Children’s Zone used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the Environmental Protection Agency's brownfield grants facilitates turning over brownfields for environmental protection, green spaces, community and commercial development.\n\nThere are several sources of innovation. It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure.\n\nAccording to Peter F. Drucker, the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, mood and meaning, in the amount of already available scientific knowledge, etc.\nIn the simplest linear model of innovation the traditionally recognized source is \"manufacturer innovation\". This is where an agent (person or business) innovates in order to sell the innovation. Specifically, R&D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation, in particular in the business sector, named Business Expenditure on R&D (BERD) that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&D invested by the public sector.\n\nAnother source of innovation, only now becoming widely recognized, is \"end-user innovation\". This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. MIT economist Eric von Hippel has identified end-user innovation as, by far, the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject, \"The Sources of Innovation\".\n\nThe robotics engineer Joseph F. Engelberger asserts that innovations require only three things:\n\nHowever, innovation processes usually involve: identifying customer needs, macro and meso trends, developing competences, and finding financial support.\n\nThe Kline chain-linked model of innovation places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&D.\n\nInnovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal research and development (R&D) for \"breakthrough innovations\". R&D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government. Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap. The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.\n\nInformation technology and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation. For example, the software tool company Atlassian conducts quarterly \"ShipIt Days\" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products. Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as Innovation Time Off). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.\n\nAn important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in focus groups (user centred approach), work closely with so called lead users (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate Europe’s surface transportation system, employs such workshops. Regarding this user innovation, a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become entrepreneurs, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like open source. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.\n\nOne technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions. This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the incandescent light bulb economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible filament designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.\n\nThis technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical drug discovery. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to high-throughput screening to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and reduce cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.\n\nThe related technique of A/B testing is often used to help optimize the design of web sites and mobile apps. This is used by major sites such as amazon.com, Facebook, Google, and Netflix. Procter & Gamble uses computer-simulated products and onlinen user panels to conduct larger numbers of experiments to guide the design, packaging, and shelf placement of consumer products. Capital One uses this technique to drive credit card marketing offers.\n\nPrograms of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, to the business plan, and to market competitive positioning. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, \"Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results\".\n\nOne survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found, ranked in decreasing order of popularity, that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved quality, creation of new markets, extension of the product range, reduced labor costs, improved production processes, reduced materials, reduced environmental damage, replacement of products/services, reduced energy consumption, conformance to regulations.\n\nThese goals vary between improvements to products, processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development. Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility, marketing firm, hospital or local government. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm.\n\nConversely, failure can develop in programs of innovations. The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, poor communication and access to information.\n\nDiffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher Gabriel Tarde, who first plotted the S-shaped diffusion curve. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes:\n\nOnce innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the 's-curve' or diffusion curve. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return\n\nThe s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have \"product life\" – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.\n\nInnovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an emerging technology that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.\n\nMeasuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service. Nevertheless, Edison et al. in their review of literature on innovation management found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.\n\nThere are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.\n\nThe measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&D, time to market, customer and employee perception & satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.\n\nFor the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region competitive advantage through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The OECD Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the Oslo Manual complementary to the Frascati Manual from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European Community Innovation Surveys.\n\nOther ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU Lisbon Strategy has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&D should be 3% of GDP.\n\nInnovation is starting to decline due to the newly introduced immigration policies. The new immigration policies have effects on the economy because 25% of the companies were created by foreign entrepreneurs. \n\nMany scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the \"science and technology mode\" (S&T-mode or STI-mode), while the \"learning by doing, using and interacting mode\" (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.\n\nA common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative cost-effectiveness research is a form of price control which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets. \nSome academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords \"truly significant\" therapeutic advances (i.e. providing \"health gain\") higher prices than free market mechanisms. Such value-based pricing has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.\n\nAn Australian academic developed the case that national comparative cost-effectiveness analysis systems should be viewed as measuring \"health innovation\" as an evidence-based policy concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong anti-trust laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing pharmaceutical innovations are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement.\n\nSeveral indices attempt to measure innovation and rank entities based on these measures, such as:\n\nMany research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation. Common areas of focus include: high-tech companies, manufacturing, patents, post secondary education, research and development, and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index. However, studies may vary widely; for example the Global Innovation Index 2016 ranks Switzerland as number one wherein countries like South Korea and Japan do not even make the top ten.\n\nIn 2005 Jonathan Huebner, a physicist working at the Pentagon's Naval Air Warfare Center, argued on the basis of both U.S. patents and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since. In his article, he asked \"Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?\" In later comments to \"New Scientist\" magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the Dark Ages, he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.\n\nJohn Smart criticized the claim and asserted that technological singularity researcher Ray Kurzweil and others showed a \"clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration\" when it came to innovations. The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing Second Life and eHarmony as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied. \nHowever, Huebner's findings were confirmed in 2010 with U.S. Patent Office data. and in a 2012 paper.\n\nThe theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major international development actors such as DFID, Gates Foundation's use of the Grand Challenge funding model, and USAID's Global Development Lab. Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at MIT. Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in developing countries, such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund, Human Development Innovation Fund, and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.\n\nGiven the noticeable effects on efficiency, quality of life, and productive growth, innovation is a key factor in society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits, from funding Research and Development to supporting regulatory change, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through.\n\nFor instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics, strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation economic development initiatives, especially to strengthen regional clusters. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision manufacturing, information technology, and clean energy, other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt, carbon footprint, and oil dependence. The U.S. Economic Development Administration understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative. In addition, federal grants in R&D, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to Japan, Finland, South Korea, and Switzerland in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to metropolitan areas, the essential engines of the American economy.\n\nMany countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Germany's Federal Ministry of Education and Research; and the Ministry of Science and Technology in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, Russia's innovation programme is the Medvedev modernisation programme which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. Also, the Government of Western Australia has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. Landgate was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.\n\nRegions have taken a more proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up regional innovation agency to strengthen regional innovation capabilities. In Medellin, Colombia, the municipality of Medellin created in 2009 Ruta N to transform the city into a knowledge city.\n"}

The series was one of the first television attempts to ‘demythologize’ the Gospel narratives.  The series suggests that the Jesus of the Bible was a myth created by the Apostle Paul, and developed by the established Church in the fourth century.\n\nThe series was the first major religious commission by the UK’s newly established fourth channel, and signaled a major departure from the largely non-critical approach to religious subject-matter that had been established from the earliest days of the BBC.  In setting itself up to be deliberately provocative, questioning and speculative, the series sparked a furore, and marked a significant moment in the deterioration in the relationship between the Christian churches, and the UK's broadcasting institutions.  The series's content referenced a range of popularized treatments of the search for the ‘real’ Jesus, including Hugh Schonfield’s \"The Passover Plot\", and Morton Smith’s \"Jesus the Magician\".\n\n The idea for the series was sparked by an article about \"The Gnostic Gospels\", an award-winning book by the American scholar Elaine Pagels, which was previewed in \"The Sunday Times\" in December 1979 tweaking the interest of John Birt who at that time was Director of Programmes at LWT.  An accompanying book of the same name was produced with the series by author Ian Wilson who also appeared as an interviewee.\n\nThe series featured a number of notable scholars, including Helmut Koester, Werner Kümmel, Dennis Nineham, Morton Smith, I Howard Marshall, George A Wells, and Geza Vermes.\n\nThe show was narrated by actor, Jeremy Kemp; researched by ; produced and directed by David W. Rolfe; Executive Produced by Jane Hewland; and Series Produced by Julian Norridge.\n\nThe series became the focus of a campaign of protest led by the Evangelical youth magazine, \"Buzz\", which drew wide support from across many sections of the churches (particularly the Evangelical and Catholic wings).  One leading commentator noted that what the series demonstrated was the way in which Channel 4 was ‘not so much the last of the main public service channels to arrive, as the first swallow heralding the broadcasting pluralism of cable and satellite’ . According to Bonner and Aston (2003):The producers did not help themselves either by including a statue of Christ that symbolically exploded in slow-motion.  Originally intended to illustrate a point made by Albert Schweitzer, it became a sort of visual punctuation mark used several times in the first and second programmes, causing genuine offence to some.Henry Chadwick then Regius Professor of Divinity at University of Cambridge, commented that the programmes ‘juxtaposed perfectly sensible scholarly opinions with opinions so outré and hard to defend on rational grounds that disservice was done to the sensible people by the company they were portrayed as keeping’.\n"}

It shows Francis of Assisi, with the stigmata, prostrating himself before an enthroned Madonna and Child - the work's theme is the intercession of the Madonna, which was promoted by the Franciscans after the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1473. Francis is supported by Anthony of Padua, whilst on the right are Catherine of Alexandria and John the Baptist and on the base of the Madonna's throne is a small grisaille image of Moses with the tablets of the law. Catherine's wheel bears the painter's signature \"Antonivs de Alegri F.[ecit]\".\n\nThe contract for the work (Correggio's first major commission) was signed by the artist on 30 August 1514, with the consent of his still-unmarried father, and of brother Girolamo Cattania, the guardian of the Franciscan convent in the town of Correggio, Emilia-Romagna, whose church was dedicated to St Francis. The work was probably meant as the high altarpiece for the convent church - that altar was site of the Da Correggio family vault. He was paid for it on 4 April 1515, showing how fast he produced it - these two records provide the first documentary evidence of his career. \n\nJust before 1638 the painting was confiscated by Francesco I d'Este and taken to the Palazzo Ducale in Modena, where it hung alongside five other Correggios seized from the duchy's territory. In 1746 the impoverished Francesco III d'Este tried to raise some money by selling the hundred most famous works in the Galleria Estense, including the six Correggios, to Augustus III of Saxony.\n\n"}

She began her career as a child actress after appearing in several commercials in Los Angeles. Anderson is known for her role as Mary Ingalls on the NBC drama series \"Little House on the Prairie\", on which she starred from 1974 until 1981. She is also known for her film roles, including Vivian in \"Midnight Offerings\" (1981), Ginny in the slasher film \"Happy Birthday to Me\" (1981), and Alex in the \"ABC Afterschool Special\", \"Which Mother Is Mine?\" (1979).\n\nAnderson became a naturalized citizen of Canada in 2007. In 2010, she published \"The Way I See It: A Look Back at My Life on Little House\", an autobiographical account of her years acting on \"Little House on the Prairie\".\n\nAnderson was born September 26, 1962, in Berkeley, California, the second of two daughters, to James and Marion Anderson. Her sister, Maureen, is twelve years her senior. When she was seven years old, Anderson's family relocated from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles. Her parents divorced when she was thirteen years old, and she was raised Roman Catholic by her mother. As a young child, Anderson appeared in commercials for Mattel and Sears.\n\nAnderson's show business career began when a dance teacher urged her parents to find an agent for her. After appearing in commercials, she was soon in demand for television roles. Her first came in a 1972 episode of \"Bewitched\" titled \"Tabitha's First Day of School\". Another memorable early role was as Millicent, a girl who kissed Bobby on \"The Brady Bunch\". She also appeared in an episode of \"Shaft\" the same year.\n\nAt the age of eleven, Anderson landed the role of Mary Ingalls on \"Little House on the Prairie\". She would go on to star on the series for eight seasons beginning in 1974, and leaving after season seven; later appearing in two episodes of season eight in late 1981. The wig she wore in later episodes was made from Yak hair.\nIn 1976, Michael Landon asked Anderson if she would appear in his autobiographical film \"The Loneliest Runner\". Anderson agreed to play Nancy Rizzi, the first girlfriend of John Curtis (based on Landon and played by Lance Kerwin), saying she was very thrilled to have been asked. In 1977, she once again co-starred as the love interest opposite Lance Kerwin in the television film \"James at 15\".\n\nShe was nominated for a 1978 Primetime Emmy Award for Best Leading Actress in a Drama Series for her work on \"Little House on the Prairie\" and won the Emmy Award for her performance in \"Which Mother Is Mine?\", which aired as an \"ABC Afterschool Special\" in 1979. Also in 1979, she played the title role of Dana Lee Gilbert, a North Dakota transfer student to Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley in CBS's television film \"Survival of Dana\".\n\nIn 1980, Anderson earned a 'TP de Oro' Award (considered to be Spain's most prestigious award for television) for 'Best Foreign Actress' for her role in \"Little House on the Prairie\". This followed a successful visit to Spain in 1979 to appear as a guest on RTVE's program, 625 Lineas. In 1981, she earned a Young Artist Award nomination for her performance in the Canadian slasher film \"Happy Birthday to Me\". After leaving \"Little House\", she continued acting in television series like \"The Equalizer\", \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1980s)\", CHiPs and \"Murder, She Wrote\", and was the associate producer for the next to last television project Michael Landon made before dying: \"Where Pigeons Go to Die\" (1990).\n\nIn 1998, she was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1999, she starred alongside Heather Langenkamp in the short lived television series \"Partners\". In 2014, Anderson had an uncredited appearance as Stosh's mother in the neo-noir mystery comedy-drama film \"Veronica Mars\" (2014).\n\nIn 2010, Anderson released her autobiography titled \"The Way I See It: A Look Back at My Life on Little House\". The book, which is primarily based on her life during her years as a child star on \"Little House on the Prairie\", contains behind-the-scenes stories and anecdotes about the show itself, its stars, guest stars, and crew members. The autobiography also covers her pre- and post-\"Little House\" career, her side-projects during the \"Little House\" years and how her personal life was affected by her career.\n\nAnderson married television writer and producer Michael Sloan (\"The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries\", \"The Equalizer\" and others) in 1990.

Created by cartoonist Charles Addams, she was based on his first wife Barbara.\n\nMorticia first appeared in Charles Addams' newspaper cartoons as the stern, aloof matriarch of the Family. She often appeared with the rest of the family, and was, along with Gomez and Grandmama, one of the few members to actually speak in the cartoons.\n\nMorticia is the wife of Gomez Addams and mother of Wednesday, Pugsley and Pubert Addams. The character originated in the Charles Addams cartoons for \"The New Yorker\" magazine in the 1930s. In the cartoons, none of the family members had names. When the characters were adapted to the 1964 television series, Charles Addams' selection of her name was inspired by \"mortician\". Morticia's maiden name is \"Frump\" and she has an older sister named Ophelia (also played by Carolyn Jones). In the television series, her mother (Uncle Fester's sister) was named Hester Frump (played by Margaret Hamilton). Her mother-in-law is Grandmama Addams. In the 1990s Addams Family films, Grandmama is actually Morticia's mother, not Gomez's.\n\nMorticia is described as a witch; she is slim, with extremely pale skin and long flowing straight black hair. In one episode she is seen wearing a black pointed hat. She commonly wears black hobble dresses to match her hair, tightly form fitting, with a hobble dress, with fringe of octopus-like cloth \"tentacles\" at the lower hem. According to Wednesday, Morticia applies baking powder to her face instead of actual makeup. In each episode, she easily allures her husband Gomez by speaking French (or any other foreign language for that matter). Morticia is musically inclined, and is often seen freely strumming a Japanese shamisen. She frequently enjoys cutting the buds off of roses, which she discards (keeping only the stems), likes cutting out paper dolls with three heads and making sweaters with three arms, collecting the mail from the hand-in-the-box Thing, and cooking unusual concoctions for her husband, including eye of newt. Her personal pet is Cleopatra, a fictitious breed of carnivorous plant called an African Strangler, and to which she feeds hamburgers.\n\nMorticia's family tree can be traced back to Salem, Massachusetts, and witchcraft is also implied at times in the television series. For example, Morticia likes to \"smoke,\" an activity that does not involve cigarettes or cigars (like her husband frequently enjoys), but smoke instead emanates from below her.\n\nIn 2009, she was included in Yahoo!'s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 1964–1966. AOL named her one of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.\n\nMorticia was portrayed by Carolyn Jones in the television series of the 1960s and by Anjelica Huston in \"The Addams Family\" (1991) and its sequel \"Addams Family Values\" (1993). Huston's portrayal of Morticia was always illuminated by a ghostly glow around the eyes, which became most noticeable when she was standing or lying in dim light. Daryl Hannah played Morticia in the 1998 film \"Addams Family Reunion\". Canadian actress Ellie Harvie played Morticia in the revival series, \"The New Addams Family\". In the first animated series made in 1973, Morticia was voiced by Janet Waldo. Jones also voiced this character in an episode of \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" that featured the family. In the 1992 animated series, she was voiced by Nancy Linari. In the 2010 Broadway musical, Morticia was portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth. Brooke Shields replaced her in the role of Morticia on June 28, 2011.\n\nMorticia was also one of the inspirations for the Walt Disney character Magica De Spell, first designed and drawn by Carl Barks. Natasha Fatale, a villain from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, was also based on Morticia's design.\n\n\n"}

The music industry includes record labels, music publishers, merchandisers, the live events sector and of course performers and artists.\n\nThe terms \"music law\" and \"entertainment law\", along with \"business affairs\", are used by the music and entertainment industry and should not be thought of as academic definitions. Indeed, music law covers a range of traditional legal subjects including intellectual property law (copyright law, trademarks, image publicity rights, design rights), competition law, bankruptcy law, contract law, defamation and, for the live events industry, immigration law, health and safety law, and licensing.\n\n\nPublishing is the primary source of income for musicians writing their own music. Money collected from the 'publishing' rights is ultimately destined for songwriters - the composers of works, whether or not they are the recording artist or performer. Often, songwriters will work for a musical ensemble to help them with musical aspects of the composition, but here again, the writer of the song is the owner of it and will own the copyrights in the song and thus will be entitled to the publishing revenues. Copyrights in compositions are not the same as sound recordings. A recording artist can record a song and sell it to another band or company. As a result, that particular company will own the recording, but not the song. The original writer will always maintain the copyright for that particular song. The publishing money is connected to the copyright, so the owner will be the only one making money off of the song itself. All successful songwriters will join a collection society (such as ASCAP and BMI in the USA, SOCAN in Canada, JASRAC in Japan, GEMA in Germany and PRS for Music in the UK, etc.) and many will enter into agreements with music publishing companies who will exploit their works on the songwriters behalf for a share of ownership, although many of these deals involve the transfer (assignment) of copyright from the songwriter to the music publisher.\n\nBoth the recorded music sector and music publishing sector have their foundations in intellectual property law and all of the major recording labels and major music publishers and many independent record labels and publishers have dedicated \"business and legal affairs\" departments with in-house lawyers whose role is not only to secure intellectual property rights from recording artists, performers and songwriters but also to exploit those rights and protect those rights on a global basis. There are a number of specialist independent law firms around the world who advise on music and entertainment law whose clients include recording artists, performers, producers, songwriters, labels, music publishers, stage and set designers, choreographers, graphic artists, games designers, merchandisers, broadcasters, artist managers, distributors, collection societies and the live events sector (which further includes festivals, venues, promoters, booking agents and production service providers such as lighting and staging companies).\n\nThe US Government views artists that give concerts and sell merchandise as a business. Bands that tour internationally will also face a plethora of legislation around the world including health and safety laws, immigration laws and tax legislation. Also, many relationships are governed by often complex contractual agreements.\n\nIn the US it is important for musicians to get legal business licenses. These can be obtained at a city hall or local government center. The business license will require the tracking of sales, wages, and gigs. A tax ID is also necessary for all businesses. Musicians that fail to comply with the tax ID process and do not report their profits and losses to the government can face serious consequences with the IRS.\n\n\n"}

The message is straightforward but arriving there requires thought and investigation into the deeper message. An example of this is seen in CarnivorePE, a parody of FBI surveillance activity. CarnivorePE was designed by the Radical Software Group, founded by Alexander R. Galloway in 2000 with a team of artists. What comes into question is whether the use of technologically sophisticated devices on everyday citizens is reasonable, and what is the rationale behind the practice. CarnivorePE was in response to a digital wiretapping software called Carnivore which the FBI used to surveil internet traffic in the 1990s. Agents could listen into chat room conversations and emails. The software uses an open source tool called a packet sniffer to listen in on the network on which it was installed. This detects the packets of data that make up emails sent and received, text and images posted online and websites browsed by individuals on the network. The data harvested is then used to develop clients: which is raw material for artistic interfaces. These clients are produced by New Media artists who then used an animated Flash interface to create brightly hued translucent circles to represent each active user. Each is represented with a different color; deep green, for example, represents someone using AOL. The intent of these artists is to observe the utilitarian definition of surveillance, examine the use of it, and then to construct an artistic spectacle which demonstrates perhaps that wiretapping on ordinary citizens can be a spectacle in of itself. Software is then transformed into a colorful work of art with moving images and a powerful message.\n\nPop artists' main goal was to expose the power of commercial culture, while both embracing and parodying popular culture. In contrast to Pop art, New Media artists can employ a level of absurdity or purposeless. The debate is open between artists using technologies for producing amazing effects and those who consider that new media are new means to convey meaning and a form of social engagement. This is clearly expressed in certain form of hacking or what the artist and theorist Maurice Benayoun calls \"Critical Fusion\", a critical approach of the \"fusion of fiction and reality\", built to unveil social and political issues at stake in the physical world. \"Critical Fusion\" is, according to Maurice Benayoun, a branch of \"Open Media Art\".\n\nVuk Ćosić, a Slovanian artist trained in archaeology, is among one of the pioneering New Media artists. He also coined the term \"net art\". For his piece, he uses ASCII characters to construct images. It is not a new practice for artists prior to the 90s to construct images using this method, and these images can be made manually or by using software that converts images into ASCII characters. Cosic then incorporates the use of films and television programs to convert these images into animation with a retro-futuristic aesthetic.\n\nVera Molnar a pioneer in computer art used geometric and mathematical abstraction to aid her artistic expression. In 1968 she began working with a computer to create images with the aid of a computer and terminals like a plotter and a cathode-ray tube screen. Early works of computer art include \"(Des)orders\" (1969). \n\nManfred Mohr influenced by German philosopher Max Bense and French composer Pierre Barbaud, created hypercubes founded on a constructivist, algorithmic aesthetic. In 1969 he used a computer to superimpose multiple rules and found that this was the only way possible to superimpose multiple rules without losing track of the general concept. This strategy made the information become deeply buried and a certain participation is demanded from the viewer. Each work is based in a subset of a defined structure, ranging from cubes to 6-dimensional hypercubes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22706", "title": "Orchestra", "text": "Orchestra\n\nAn orchestra (; ) is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which mixes instruments from different families, including bowed string instruments such as violin, viola, cello, and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, each grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.\n\nA full-size orchestra may sometimes be called a \"symphony orchestra\" or \"philharmonic orchestra\". The actual number of musicians employed in a given performance may vary from seventy to over one hundred musicians, depending on the work being played and the size of the venue. The term \"chamber orchestra\" (and sometimes \"concert orchestra\") usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles of about fifty musicians or fewer. Orchestras that specialize in the Baroque music of, for example, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, or Classical repertoire, such as that of Haydn and Mozart, tend to be smaller than orchestras performing a Romantic music repertoire, such as the symphonies of Johannes Brahms. The typical orchestra grew in size throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, reaching a peak with the large orchestras (of as many as 120 players) called for in the works of Richard Wagner, and later, Gustav Mahler.\n\nOrchestras are usually led by a conductor who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a conductor's baton. The conductor unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo and shapes the sound of the ensemble. The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.\n\nThe leader of the first violin section, commonly called the concertmaster, also plays an important role in leading the musicians. In the Baroque music era (1600–1750), orchestras were often led by the concertmaster or by a chord-playing musician performing the basso continuo parts on a harpsichord or pipe organ, a tradition that some 20th century and 21st century early music ensembles continue. Orchestras play a wide range of repertoire, including symphonies, opera and ballet overtures, concertos for solo instruments, and as pit ensembles for operas, ballets, and some types of musical theatre (e.g., Gilbert and Sullivan operettas).\n\nAmateur orchestras include those made up of students from an elementary school or a high school, youth orchestras, and community orchestras; the latter two typically being made up of amateur musicians from a particular city or region.\n\nThe term \"orchestra\" derives from the Greek ὀρχήστρα (\"orchestra\"), the name for the area in front of a stage in ancient Greek theatre reserved for the Greek chorus.\n\nThe typical symphony orchestra consists of four groups of related musical instruments called the woodwinds, brass, percussion, and strings (violin, viola, cello and double bass). Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes be grouped into a fifth section such as a keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and electric and electronic instruments. The orchestra, depending on the size, contains almost all of the standard instruments in each group.\n\nIn the history of the orchestra, its instrumentation has been expanded over time, often agreed to have been standardized by the classical period and Ludwig van Beethoven's influence on the classical model. In the 20th and 21st century, new repertory demands expanded the instrumentation of the orchestra, resulting in a flexible use of the classical-model instruments and newly developed electric and electronic instruments in various combinations.\n\nThe terms \"symphony orchestra\" and \"philharmonic orchestra\" may be used to distinguish different ensembles from the same locality, such as the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. A symphony orchestra will usually have over eighty musicians on its roster, in some cases over a hundred, but the actual number of musicians employed in a particular performance may vary according to the work being played and the size of the venue.\n\n\"Chamber orchestra\" usually refers to smaller-sized ensembles; a major chamber orchestra might employ as many as fifty musicians; some are much smaller than that. The term \"concert orchestra\" may also be used, as in the BBC Concert Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra.\n\nThe so-called \"standard complement\" of doubled winds and brass in the orchestra from the first half of the 19th century is generally attributed to the forces called for by Beethoven. The composer's instrumentation almost always included paired flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns and trumpets. The exceptions to this are his Symphony No. 4, Violin Concerto, and Piano Concerto No. 4, which each specify a single flute. Beethoven carefully calculated the expansion of this particular timbral \"palette\" in Symphonies 3, 5, 6, and 9 for an innovative effect. The third horn in the \"Eroica\" Symphony arrives to provide not only some harmonic flexibility, but also the effect of \"choral\" brass in the Trio movement. Piccolo, contrabassoon, and trombones add to the triumphal finale of his Symphony No. 5. A piccolo and a pair of trombones help deliver the effect of storm and sunshine in the Sixth, also known as the \"Pastoral Symphony\". The Ninth asks for a second pair of horns, for reasons similar to the \"Eroica\" (four horns has since become standard); Beethoven's use of piccolo, contrabassoon, trombones, and untuned percussion—plus chorus and vocal soloists—in his finale, are his earliest suggestion that the timbral boundaries of symphony might be expanded. For several decades after his death, symphonic instrumentation was faithful to Beethoven's well-established model, with few exceptions.\n\nApart from the core orchestral complement, various other instruments are called for occasionally. These include the flugelhorn and cornet. Saxophones and classical guitars, for example, appear in some 19th- through 21st-century scores. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's \"Pictures at an Exhibition\" and Sergei Rachmaninoff's \"Symphonic Dances\", the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's \"Boléro\", Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2, Vaughan Williams' Symphonies No.6 and 9 and William Walton's \"Belshazzar's Feast\", and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th-century works, usually playing parts marked \"tenor tuba\", including Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\", and Richard Strauss's \"Ein Heldenleben\". The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle \"Der Ring des Nibelungen\" and several other works by Strauss, Béla Bartók, and others; it has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major. Cornets appear in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet \"Swan Lake\", Claude Debussy's \"La Mer\", and several orchestral works by Hector Berlioz. Unless these instruments are played by members \"doubling\" on another instrument (for example, a trombone player changing to euphonium or a bassoon player switching to contrabassoon for a certain passage), orchestras typically hire freelance musicians to augment their regular ensemble.\n\nThe 20th-century orchestra was far more flexible than its predecessors. In Beethoven's and Felix Mendelssohn's time, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments, which was very rarely modified by composers. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as Berlioz and Mahler; some composers used multiple harps and sound effect such as the wind machine. During the 20th century, the modern orchestra was generally standardized with the modern instrumentation listed below. Nevertheless, by the mid- to late 20th century, with the development of contemporary classical music, instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer (e.g., to add electric instruments such as electric guitar, electronic instruments such as synthesizers, non-Western instruments, or other instruments not traditionally used in orchestra).\n\nWith this history in mind, the orchestra can be analysed in five periods: the Baroque era, the Classical music period, early/mid-Romantic music era, late-Romantic/early 20th century music and 21st century era. The first is a Baroque orchestra (i.e., J.S. Bach, Handel, Vivaldi), which generally had a smaller number of performers, and in which one or more chord-playing instruments, the basso continuo group (e.g., harpsichord or pipe organ and assorted bass instruments to perform the bassline), played an important role; the second is a typical classical period orchestra (e.g., early Beethoven along with Mozart and Haydn), which used a smaller group of performers than a Romantic music orchestra and a fairly standardized instrumentation; the third is typical of an early/mid-Romantic era (e.g., Schubert, Berlioz, Schumann); the fourth is a late-Romantic/early 20th century orchestra (e.g., Wagner, Brahms, Mahler, Stravinsky), to the common complement of a 2010-era modern orchestra (e.g., Adams, Barber, Aaron Copland, Glass, Penderecki).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the instrument groups and within each group of instruments, there is a generally accepted hierarchy. Every instrumental group (or section) has a principal who is generally responsible for leading the group and playing orchestral solos. The violins are divided into two groups, first violin and second violin, with the second violins playing in lower registers than the first violins, playing an accompaniment part, or harmonizing the melody played by the first violins. The principal first violin is called the concertmaster (or \"leader\" in the UK) and is not only considered the leader of the string section, but the second-in-command of the entire orchestra, behind only the conductor. The concertmaster leads the pre-concert tuning and handles musical aspects of orchestra management, such as determining the bowings for the violins or for all of the string section. The concertmaster usually sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience. There is also a principal second violin, a principal viola, a principal cello and a principal bass.\n\nThe principal trombone is considered the leader of the low brass section, while the principal trumpet is generally considered the leader of the entire brass section. While the oboe often provides the tuning note for the orchestra (due to 300-year-old convention), no principal is the leader of the woodwind section though in woodwind ensembles, often the flute is leader. Instead, each principal confers with the others as equals in the case of musical differences of opinion. Most sections also have an assistant principal (or co-principal or associate principal), or in the case of the first violins, an assistant concertmaster, who often plays a tutti part in addition to replacing the principal in his or her absence.\n\nA section string player plays in unison with the rest of the section, except in the case of divided (\"divisi\") parts, where upper and lower parts in the music are often assigned to \"outside\" (nearer the audience) and \"inside\" seated players. Where a solo part is called for in a string section, the section leader invariably plays that part. The section leader (or principal) of a string section is also responsible for determining the bowings, often based on the bowings set out by the concertmaster. In some cases, the principal of a string section may use a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster, to accommodate the requirements of playing their instrument (e.g., the double-bass section). Principals of a string section will also lead entrances for their section, typically by lifting the bow before the entrance, to ensure the section plays together. Tutti wind and brass players generally play a unique but non-solo part. Section percussionists play parts assigned to them by the principal percussionist.\n\nIn modern times, the musicians are usually directed by a conductor, although early orchestras did not have one, giving this role instead to the concertmaster or the harpsichordist playing the continuo. Some modern orchestras also do without conductors, particularly smaller orchestras and those specializing in historically accurate (so-called \"period\") performances of baroque and earlier music.\n\nThe most frequently performed repertoire for a symphony orchestra is Western classical music or opera. However, orchestras are used sometimes in popular music (e.g., to accompany a rock or pop band in a concert), extensively in film music, and increasingly often in video game music. Orchestras are also used in the symphonic metal genre. The term \"orchestra\" can also be applied to a jazz ensemble, for example in the performance of big-band music.\n\nIn the 2000s, all tenured members of a professional orchestra normally audition for positions in the ensemble. Performers typically play one or more solo pieces of the auditionee's choice, such as a movement of a concerto, a solo Bach movement, and a variety of excerpts from the orchestral literature that are advertised in the audition poster (so the auditionees can prepare). The excerpts are typically the most technically challenging parts and solos from the orchestral literature. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the concertmaster, the principal player of the section for which the auditionee is applying and possibly other principal players and regular orchestra members.\n\nThe most promising candidates from the first round of auditions are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. The final stage of the audition process in some orchestras is a \"test week\", in which the performer plays with the orchestra for a week or two, which allows the conductor and principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual rehearsal and performance setting.\n\nThere are a range of different employment arrangements. The most sought-after positions are permanent, tenured positions in the orchestra. Orchestras also hire musicians on contracts, ranging in length from a single concert to a full season or more. Contract performers may be hired for individual concerts when the orchestra is doing an exceptionally large late-Romantic era orchestral work, or to substitute for a permanent member who is sick. A professional musician who is hired to perform for a single concert is sometimes called a \"sub\". Some contract musicians may be hired to replace permanent members for the period that the permanent member is on parental leave or disability leave.\n\nHistorically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of male musicians. The first female members hired in professional orchestras have been harpists. The Vienna Philharmonic, for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (the other orchestras ranked among the world’s top five by \"Gramophone\" in 2008). The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic. In February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told \"Westdeutscher Rundfunk\" that accepting women would be \"gambling with the emotional unity () that this organism currently has\". In April 1996, the orchestra’s press secretary wrote that \"compensating for the expected leaves of absence\" of maternity leave would be a problem.\n\nIn 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was \"facing protests during a [US] tour\" by the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women in Music. Finally, \"after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist.\" As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova, became one of the orchestra’s concertmasters in 2008, the first woman to hold that position. In 2012, women made up 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened blind auditions.\n\nIn 2013, an article in \"Mother Jones\" stated that while \"[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the New York Philharmonic's violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the National Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists\", the double bass, brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras \"...are still predominantly male.\" A 2014 BBC article stated that the \"...introduction of ‘blind’ auditions, where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift.\"\n\nThere are also a variety of amateur orchestras:\n\nOrchestras play a wide range of repertoire ranging from 17th-century dance suites, 18th century divertimentos to 20th century film scores and 21st-century symphonies. Orchestras have become synonymous with the symphony, an extended musical composition in Western classical music that typically contains multiple movements which provide contrasting keys and tempos. Symphonies are notated in a musical score, which contains all the instrument parts. The conductor uses the score to study the symphony before rehearsals and decide on their interpretation (e.g., tempos, articulation, phrasing, etc.), and to follow the music during rehearsals and concerts, while leading the ensemble. Orchestral musicians play from parts containing just the notated music for their instrument. A small number of symphonies also contain vocal parts (e.g., Beethoven's Ninth Symphony).\n\nOrchestras also perform overtures, a term originally applied to the instrumental introduction to an opera. During the early Romantic era, composers such as Beethoven and Mendelssohn began to use the term to refer to independent, self-existing instrumental, programmatic works that presaged genres such as the symphonic poem, a form devised by Franz Liszt in several works that began as dramatic overtures. These were \"at first undoubtedly intended to be played at the head of a programme\". In the 1850s the concert overture began to be supplanted by the symphonic poem.\n\nOrchestras also play with instrumental soloists in concertos. During concertos, the orchestra plays an accompaniment role to the soloist (e.g., a solo violinist or pianist) and, at times, introduces musical themes or interludes while the soloist is not playing. Orchestras also play during operas, ballets, some musical theatre works and some choral works (both sacred works such as Masses and secular works). In operas and ballets, the orchestra accompanies the singers and dancers, respectively, and plays overtures and interludes where the melodies played by the orchestra take centre stage.\n\nIn the Baroque era, orchestras performed in a range of venues, including at the fine houses of aristocrats, in opera halls and in churches. Some wealthy aristocrats had an orchestra in residence at their estate, to entertain them and their guests with performances. During the Classical era, as composers increasing sought out financial support from the general public, orchestra concerts were increasingly held in public concert halls, where music lovers could buy tickets to hear the orchestra. Of course, aristocratic patronage of orchestras continued during the Classical era, but this went on alongside public concerts. In the 20th and 21st century, orchestras found a new patron: governments. Many orchestras in North America and Europe receive part of their funding from national, regional level governments (e.g., state governments in the U.S.) or city governments. These government subsidies make up part of orchestra revenue, along with ticket sales, charitable donations (if the orchestra is a registered as a charity) and other fundraising activities. With the invention of successive technologies, including sound recording, radio broadcasting, television broadcasting and Internet-based streaming and downloading of concert videos, orchestras have been able to find new revenue sources.\n\nOne of the \"great unmentionable [topics] of orchestral playing\" is \"faking\", the process by which an orchestral musician gives the \"...impression of playing every note as written\", typically for a very challenging passage that is very high or very fast, while not actually playing the notes that are in the printed music part. An article in \"The Strad\" states that all orchestral musicians, even those in the top orchestras, occasionally \"fake\" certain passages. One reason that musicians \"fake\" is because there are not enough rehearsals. Another factor is the extreme challenges in 20th century and 21st century contemporary pieces; professionals interviewed by the magazine said \"faking\" was \"...necessary in anything from ten to almost ninety per cent of some modern works. Professional players who were interviewed were of a consensus that faking may be acceptable when a part is not written well for the instrument, but faking \"just because you haven’t practised\" the music is not acceptable.\n\nThe invention of the piston and rotary valve by Heinrich Stölzel and Friedrich Blühmel, both Silesians, in 1815, was the first in a series of innovations which impacted the orchestra, including the development of modern keywork for the flute by Theobald Boehm and the innovations of Adolphe Sax in the woodwinds, notably the invention of the saxophone. These advances would lead Hector Berlioz to write a landmark book on instrumentation, which was the first systematic treatise on the use of instrumental sound as an expressive element of music.\n\nThe next major expansion of symphonic practice came from Richard Wagner's Bayreuth orchestra, founded to accompany his musical dramas. Wagner's works for the stage were scored with unprecedented scope and complexity: indeed, his score to \"Das Rheingold\" calls for six harps. Thus, Wagner envisioned an ever-more-demanding role for the conductor of the theatre orchestra, as he elaborated in his influential work \"On Conducting\". This brought about a revolution in orchestral composition, and set the style for orchestral performance for the next eighty years. Wagner's theories re-examined the importance of tempo, dynamics, bowing of string instruments and the role of principals in the orchestra. Conductors who studied his methods would go on to be influential themselves.\n\nAs the early 20th century dawned, symphony orchestras were larger, better funded, and better trained than ever before; consequently, composers could compose larger and more ambitious works. The influence of Gustav Mahler was particularly innovational; in his later symphonies, such as the mammoth Symphony No. 8, Mahler pushes the furthest boundaries of orchestral size, employing huge forces. By the late Romantic era, orchestras could support the most enormous forms of symphonic expression, with huge string sections, massive brass sections and an expanded range of percussion instruments. With the recording era beginning, the standards of performance were pushed to a new level, because a recorded symphony could be listened to closely and even minor errors in intonation or ensemble, which might not be noticeable in a live performance, could be heard by critics. As recording technologies improved over the 20th and 21st centuries, eventually small errors in a recording could be \"fixed\" by audio editing or overdubbing. Some older conductors and composers could remember a time when simply \"getting through\" the music as best as possible was the standard. Combined with the wider audience made possible by recording, this led to a renewed focus on particular star conductors and on a high standard of orchestral execution.\n\nWith the advent of the early music movement, smaller orchestras where players worked on execution of works in styles derived from the study of older treatises on playing became common. These include the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the London Classical Players under the direction of Sir Roger Norrington and the Academy of Ancient Music under Christopher Hogwood, among others.\n\nIn the United States, the late 20th century saw a crisis of funding and support for orchestras. The size and cost of a symphony orchestra, compared to the size of the base of supporters, became an issue that struck at the core of the institution. Few orchestras could fill auditoriums, and the time-honored season-subscription system became increasingly anachronistic, as more and more listeners would buy tickets on an ad hoc basis for individual events. Orchestral endowments and—more centrally to the daily operation of American orchestras—orchestral donors have seen investment portfolios shrink or produce lower yields, reducing the ability of donors to contribute; further, there has been a trend toward donors finding other social causes more compelling. Also, while government funding is less central to American than European orchestras, cuts in such funding are still significant for American ensembles. Finally, the drastic falling-off of revenues from recording, tied to no small extent to changes in the recording industry itself, began a period of change that has yet to reach its conclusion.\n\nU.S. orchestras that have gone into Chapter 11 bankruptcy include the Philadelphia Orchestra (in April 2011), and the Louisville Orchestra, in December 2010; orchestras that have gone into Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have ceased operations include the Northwest Chamber Orchestra in 2006, the Honolulu Orchestra in March 2011, the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra in April 2011, and the Syracuse Symphony in June 2011. The Festival of Orchestras in Orlando, Florida ceased operations at the end of March, 2011.\n\nOne source of financial difficulties that received notice and criticism was high salaries for music directors of US orchestras, which led several high-profile conductors to take pay cuts in recent years. Music administrators such as Michael Tilson Thomas and Esa-Pekka Salonen argued that new music, new means of presenting it, and a renewed relationship with the community could revitalize the symphony orchestra. The American critic Greg Sandow has argued in detail that orchestras must revise their approach to music, performance, the concert experience, marketing, public relations, community involvement, and presentation to bring them in line with the expectations of 21st-century audiences immersed in popular culture.\n\nIt is not uncommon for contemporary composers to use unconventional instruments, including various synthesizers, to achieve desired effects. Many, however, find more conventional orchestral configuration to provide better possibilities for color and depth. Composers like John Adams often employ Romantic-size orchestras, as in Adams' opera \"Nixon in China\"; Philip Glass and others may be more free, yet still identify size-boundaries. Glass in particular has recently turned to conventional orchestras in works like the \"Concerto for Cello and Orchestra\" and the Violin Concerto No. 2.\n\nAlong with a decrease in funding, some U.S. orchestras have reduced their overall personnel, as well as the number of players appearing in performances. The reduced numbers in performance are usually confined to the string section, since the numbers here have traditionally been flexible (as multiple players typically play from the same part).\n\nConducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as an orchestral or choral concert. The primary duties of the conductor are to set the tempo, ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble, and to \"shape\" the phrasing where appropriate. To convey their ideas and interpretation, a conductor communicates with their musicians primarily through hand gestures, typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton, and may use other gestures or signals, such as eye contact with relevant performers. A conductor's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance.\n\nThe conductor typically stands on a raised podium with a large music stand for the full score, which contains the musical notation for all the instruments and voices. Since the mid-18th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the harpsichordist or first violinist (see concertmaster), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a piano or synthesizer may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \"count in\"). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\n\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections, and so on), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media. Orchestras, choirs, concert bands and other sizable musical ensembles such as big bands are usually led by conductors.\n\nIn the Baroque music era (1600–1750), most orchestras were led by one of the musicians, typically the principal first violin, called the concertmaster. The concertmaster would lead the tempo of pieces by lifting his or her bow in a rhythmic manner. Leadership might also be provided by one of the chord-playing instrumentalists playing the basso continuo part which was the core of most Baroque instrumental ensemble pieces. Typically, this would be a harpsichord player, a pipe organist or a luteist or theorbo player. A keyboard player could lead the ensemble with his or her head, or by taking one of the hands off the keyboard to lead a more difficult tempo change. A lutenist or theorbo player could lead by lifting the instrument neck up and down to indicate the tempo of a piece, or to lead a ritard during a cadence or ending. In some works which combined choirs and instrumental ensembles, two leaders were sometimes used: a concertmaster to lead the instrumentalists and a chord-playing performer to lead the singers. During the Classical music period (ca. 1720–1800), the practice of using chordal instruments to play basso continuo was gradually phased out, and it disappeared completely by 1800. Instead, ensembles began to use conductors to lead the orchestra's tempos and playing style, while the concertmaster played an additional leadership role for the musicians, especially the string players, who imitate the bowstroke and playing style of the concertmaster, to the degree that is feasible for the different stringed instruments.\n\nIn 1922, the idea of a conductor-less orchestra was revived in post-revolutionary Soviet Union. The symphony orchestra Persimfans was formed without a conductor, because the founders believed that the ensemble should be modeled on the ideal Marxist state, in which all people are equal. As such, its members felt that there was no need to be led by the dictatorial baton of a conductor; instead they were led by a committee, which determined tempos and playing styles. Although it was a partial success within the Soviet Union, the principal difficulty with the concept was in changing tempo during performances, because even if the committee had issued a decree about where a tempo change should take place, there was no leader in the ensemble to guide this tempo change. The orchestra survived for ten years before Stalin's cultural politics disbanded it by taking away its funding.\n\nIn Western nations, some ensembles, such as the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, based in New York City, have had more success with conductorless orchestras, although decisions are likely to be deferred to some sense of leadership within the ensemble (for example, the principal wind and string players, notably the concertmaster). Others have returned to the tradition of a principal player, usually a violinist, being the artistic director and running rehearsal and leading concerts. Examples include the Australian Chamber Orchestra, Amsterdam Sinfonietta & Candida Thompson and the New Century Chamber Orchestra. As well, as part of the early music movement, some 20th and 21st century orchestras have revived the Baroque practice of having no conductor on the podium for Baroque pieces, using the concertmaster or a chord-playing basso continuo performer (e.g., harpsichord or organ) to lead the group.\n\nSome orchestral works specify that an offstage trumpet should be used or that other instruments from the orchestra should be positioned off-stage or behind the stage, to create a haunted, mystical effect. To ensure that the offstage instrumentalist(s) play in time, sometimes a sub-conductor will be stationed offstage with a clear view of the principal conductor. Examples include the ending of \"Neptune\" from Gustav Holst's \"The Planets\". The principal conductor leads the large orchestra, and the sub-conductor relays the principal conductor's tempo and gestures to the offstage musician (or musicians). One of the challenges with using two conductors is that the second conductor may get out of synchronization with the main conductor, or may mis-convey (or misunderstand) the principal conductor's gestures, which can lead to the offstage instruments being out of time. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, some orchestras use a video camera pointed at the principal conductor and a closed-circuit TV set in front of the offstage performer(s), instead of using two conductors.\n\nThe techniques of polystylism and polytempo music have led a few 20th and 21st century composers to write music where multiple orchestras or ensembles perform simultaneously. These trends have brought about the phenomenon of polyconductor music, wherein separate sub-conductors conduct each group of musicians. Usually, one principal conductor conducts the sub-conductors, thereby shaping the overall performance. In Percy Grainger's \"The Warriors\" which includes three conductors: the primary conductor of the orchestra, a secondary conductor directing an off-stage brass ensemble, and a tertiary conductor directing percussion and harp. One example in the late century orchestral music is Karlheinz Stockhausen's \"Gruppen\", for three orchestras, which are placed around the audience. This way, the \"sound masses\" could be spacialized, as in an electroacoustic work. \"Gruppen\" was premiered in Cologne, in 1958, conducted by Stockhausen, Bruno Maderna and Pierre Boulez. It has been performed by Simon Rattle, John Carewe and Daniel Harding.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8023119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8023119", "title": "Oscar Martinez (The Office)", "text": "Oscar Martinez (The Office)\n\nOscar Martinez is a fictional character from the US mockumentary-style television series \"The Office\" played by Cuban-American actor Oscar Nunez. Martinez was one of the few openly gay characters in broadcast television at the time that the series aired. Nunez, who is straight, did not know his character might be gay when he first signed on. For the 2006–2007 season, Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) reported he was the only LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) person of color character on a regular series. For the 2007–2008 season he was the \"only remaining gay character on a half-hour comedy program\" and the only LGBT lead or supporting character who is a person of color. For the 2009–2010 season, Martinez was one of four people of color LGBT regular series characters; in 2010–2011 there were six and in 2011–2012 there were five.\n\nMartinez is an accountant at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, office of the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin and gets his first name from Núñez; series producer Greg Daniels felt that \"Oscar\" sounded like a good accountant's name. He is a first-generation Mexican American. He is also openly gay after being outed by his then boss Michael Scott in \"Gay Witch Hunt\", the third-season premiere episode devoted to the outing. However, the character was implied to be gay in the second-season episode \"The Secret\", when Dwight catches him faking sickness to spend the day with his boyfriend (Dwight remains oblivious to this detail as he was obsessed with proving that Oscar was not ill). As a result, in earlier episodes, many co-workers erroneously attribute to him various Mexican stereotypes (e.g. being involved in drug cartels) but after his outing, his stereotypes are more focused on his being gay, particularly by Michael, which may explain their conflicted relationship. Núñez explained in a 2008 interview that the character variously feels amusement, pity and hatred towards his fictional boss. He has no specific counterpart in the original British series.\n\nOscar is known for being a rational, quietly efficient, and intellectual worker in the office, often the one who will ask pointed financial questions that his colleagues will not or that Michael avoids answering. In some episodes he is described as the smartest in the office. Martinez refers to himself as being in the \"Coalition for Reason\" with Jim and Pam Halpert. According to Núñez, the three \"are there to set up the comic situations\" for boss Michael and Dwight Schrute, Michael's toady. He explained, \"We can still be funny but we are definitely the 'straight guys'.\" He is often the one who is able to clearly see the reality and logic in situations, including financial ones such as when Michael started up his own paper company or Ryan Howard's online startup business. Because of this, Oscar is considered to be a know-it-all by many of his co-workers. Oscar is frequently exasperated by the antics of his coworkers and tends to find their humor offensive. He is reserved, not really exhibiting a desire for close contact with any of his co-workers, although he is friendly when not outwardly pedantic. In an \"AfterElton.com\" interview, Núñez explained he plays the character like an accountant, who happens to be gay, and just trying to do his work and not really interested in what the documentarians are filming. Actor Núñez references the character as a Log Cabin Republican, though no mention of this has occurred in the show. In the episode \"Dwight Christmas\", he is in fact openly acknowledged as a Democrat. His more balanced and normal personality makes him an everyman type character, contrasting with the generally extroverted people with whom he works. He's also a charter member of the company's three-person (and exclusive) \"Finer Things Club\" with Pam and Toby Flenderson. He and co-worker Kevin Malone seem to have a strong friendship with each other, often a dynamic where Oscar is often the calm, rational one while Kevin is the fun-loving one.\n\nOscar has worked at Dunder Mifflin for over nine years in 2008. He is openly gay (after being publicly outed by Michael) and previously lived with his partner, Gil. Originally, Oscar was in the closet, and Gil was believed to be his roommate. In earlier seasons, he is seen driving a Saturn Ion. This is the same Saturn that Angela can later be seen driving, such as in the episode \"Niagara\". However, he is seen in the third season driving a Lexus RX 400h, a company car he was lent as a result of his unwanted outing by Michael.\n\nThough Oscar is openly gay in later episodes, in the episode \"The Fire\", when asked by Jim \"Who would you do?\", Oscar offers the answer, \"Pam\"; also, in \"The Client\", he makes an intentionally vague reference to a woman he previously dated.\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"Gay Witch Hunt\", Oscar explains that he in fact notified Michael of his being gay during his job interview. This caused Michael to laugh repeatedly, and he hired Oscar on the spot because he was \"the funniest person that [Michael] had ever met\". Oscar then hid his sexuality from his co-workers (until he was outed) for fear of losing his job.\n\nIn the episode \"Diversity Day\", Michael makes an example of Oscar in a diversity training seminar for his being Mexican. Michael annoys Oscar by stating the word \"Mexican\" might be offensive because it has \"certain connotations\". In \"The Alliance\", Oscar goes around the office asking for donations for his nephew's walkathon for cerebral palsy. In \"Basketball\", Oscar asks to be on Michael's team; however, Michael assumes he is good at baseball and boxing, but not basketball.\n\nOne of Oscar's favorite pastimes at work is playing a paper football game dubbed \"Hateball\" (because Angela hates it) with Kevin Malone whenever Michael isn't around. He keeps a two-year running total of their scores. Oscar enjoys ice skating, likes the office thermostat to be set to a chilly 66 degrees, and dressed up in drag on \"Halloween\". He has a conflict with Angela Martin over her poster of babies dressed as jazz musicians and claims it offends him more than \"hardcore pornography.\" In \"The Secret,\" Oscar calls in sick, but Dwight discovers that Oscar spent the day shopping and ice skating with his \"roommate\" Gil, but Dwight's naivete stops him realizing the truth about Oscar's sexuality, which is here revealed to the viewers, and again indicated in the episode \"Valentine's Day\", when Oscar receives a gift and unconvincingly tells Kevin it is from his mother.\n\nIn the first episode of the third season, \"Gay Witch Hunt\", Michael obliviously calls Oscar \"faggy\" for preferring the film \"Shakespeare in Love\" to \"Die Hard\". Oscar is understandably upset and reports it to corporate. When Michael realizes Oscar is actually gay, he tries to make it up to him and embraces some gay culture. Michael calls a meeting and announces that Oscar is gay in front of the entire staff, much to Oscar's shock and dismay. In the conference room, to show no hard feelings, Michael hugs Oscar then proceeds to try to kiss him. Oscar is both disgusted and horrified by Michael's actions and proclaims it has been \"the worst, most backwards day of my life.\"\n\nTo prevent Oscar from suing the company for anti-gay discrimination, the corporate manager, Jan Levinson, gives him a three-month paid vacation to Europe and use of a company car, a silver Lexus RX 400h, replacing his gold Saturn Ion. After going on his vacation with Gil, Oscar returns briefly in \"A Benihana Christmas,\" but decides that it is too soon and leaves before anyone notices him. Oscar finally returns to the office in \"The Return\" and Michael decides to throw a Mexican themed party for him. Angela, who had acted cold towards him when he came out, apologizes and invites him to be a part of the party planning committee. He is also shown in \"Business School\" with his partner Gil at Pam's art show, agreeing with Gil that, although it's her first try, Pam's art lacks courage and honesty, which she overhears.\n\nIn \"Beach Games\", Michael announces that the winner of his \"Survivor\"-style game will get his job. In an interview, Oscar states that if Dwight gets the position, he will transfer to Albany. He also mentions that he is trying to get out of his relationship with Gil and that he \"might try women for a while; Angela thinks I can cross over.\"\n\nIn \"Fun Run\", Kevin tries to use Oscar to see if Jim and Pam are dating. In a deleted scene, he says that he was raised Catholic, but now identifies as an agnostic Secular Humanist. In \"Money\", Oscar helps Michael deal with his financial problems by going over his current finances. Oscar does this after Michael follows through with some bad advice from Creed, who advises Michael to declare bankruptcy will give him a clean financial state. With Pam and Toby, Oscar is a founding member of the Finer Things Club, which he refers to as the \"gayest thing\" about him \"besides having sex with men\".\n\nBesides ice skating, Oscar is revealed to have an interest in yoga. In \"Weight Loss\", he refers Holly to his yoga teacher whom she later dates. For Halloween, he dresses as Uncle Sam. And in Business Ethics, he comes the closest to congratulating Pam and Jim for their engagement, by commenting that he had assumed they were already engaged.\n\nIn \"Business Trip\", he travels to Winnipeg, Manitoba with Michael and Andy, with whom he bonds when they drink Long Island iced teas. Drunk, he questions Andy's desire to marry Angela and they drunk dial her. In the morning, Oscar has rebuilt his reserve, but does thank Andy for trying to hook him up with two men in the hotel bar the previous night; however, by \"Lecture Circuit\", Oscar has returned to being dismissive of Andy and refuses to listen when Andy wants advice on asking out an attractive female customer. Oscar also shows a liking for egg salad sandwiches.\n\nIn \"Stress Relief\", during Dwight's over-the-top attempt to teach the office employees about fire safety, Oscar and everyone else are locked in the building, while under the impression that there is a fire. Oscar then attempts to escape by climbing into the ceiling, and is at first successful. However, his legs eventually fall through. Later, during a roast held by Michael, Oscar severely roasts Michael, yelling at him in Spanish with the intent to make him cry (his comments, in English, amount to Oscar screaming that he can't believe has to drive for hours every day to work for someone like Michael) which succeeds after Oscar and the branch humiliate Michael. Oscar later regrets it and apologizes to Michael. Michael accepts the apology, but not without roasting Oscar by pointing out \"You're gay\", which Oscar seems to accept.\n\nOscar also finds himself at odds with Pam during \"The Surplus\" when he reveals a $4,300 budget surplus to Michael that he suggests could be used to purchase a new copier. Jim sides with him over the issue and they take Michael out to lunch to further their agenda. But Oscar finally concedes to Pam and agrees to buying new chairs like she wanted, ruining Michael's plans to keep 15% of the surplus for himself when the sides remained deadlocked past a deadline for using the entire amount.\n\nIn \"Blood Drive,\" Oscar opens up during Michael's \"Lonely Hearts Party\" at the office about being rejected by a man who claimed not to be gay, but was later spotted on a date at a gay nightclub in Kansas City. Along with the staff, a sympathetic Oscar walks out with Michael after the holiday party is over, showing he can empathize with anyone.\n\nOscar wears sandals without socks in the office on \"Casual Friday\", which disgusts Angela and she objects to it. Oscar however, refuses to back down on Toby's request that he wear socks.\n\nDuring the company picnic when Meredith suggests forfeiting their volleyball game against corporate, an insightful Oscar points out that they need to go through with it, saying \"Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.\" after upper management decides to shut down the Buffalo branch after corporate hid the news.\n\nIn the episode \"Gossip\", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, he tells everyone that Oscar is the voice of the Taco Bell dog. Oscar also helps Andy cope when a rumor is spread that he is gay. In \"The Meeting\", Michael calls Oscar to his office to seek advice about his upcoming colonoscopy due to Michael thinking that it's going to be a lot like anal intercourse and feels Oscar would be well versed in that field, this makes Oscar visibly uncomfortable.\n\nIn \"Niagara\", Pam's sister mistakes Kevin as Gil, Oscar's boyfriend, which greatly offends Oscar; Kevin is in turn insulted, telling Oscar that \"he would be honored to be his boyfriend\". In \"Mafia\", Oscar's psyche begins to crumble when Jim and Pam go on their honeymoon (they help maintain the \"Coalition for Reason\" in the office) and Michael, Dwight, Andy and Ryan began to believe that an Italian-American insurance salesman is in the Mafia. So much so that, much to their anger, he calls them on their honeymoon in desperate need to talk to someone normal. He is further annoyed when Kevin, fearing that he [Kevin] will go to jail for committing identity theft against Jim, suggests that Oscar, being a homosexual, would \"love\" prison (because of the occurrence of male on male prison rape ).\n\nIn \"Murder\", Oscar does not take part in Michael's murder mystery game, preferring to keep working and keeping tabs on what's going on with Dunder-Mifflin in the wake of bankruptcy rumors. He hears that Corporate has ordered Accounting to stop payments to vendors and tries to interrupt the game to tell Michael, only to have Michael stay in character rather than allow the game to be disrupted. He tries to deliver the news in as someone who would inhabit the game's world but can't figure out a way to do so and just says it plainly. In Shareholder Meeting, he visits the company conference with Michael due to his annoyance at how poorly and inefficiently the company is being run, but refuses the chance to tell the board what he really thinks.\n\nIn \"Secret Santa\", Pam tries to play matchmaker, introducing the newly-single Oscar to the new gay warehouse worker Matt (played by Sam Daly). Oscar dismisses a nosy Pam and doesn't correct Matt when he calls him by the wrong name, Victor. Later, he acts aloof and calls Matt by the wrong name.\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"Happy Hour\", Michael acts surprised when he is told it was Oscar who came up with the idea to go out, not aware Oscar set up the happy hour plan so he could get to spend more time with Matt in a social setting. When Oscar asks why Michael is so surprised, Kevin responds by telling Oscar that he's anti-social and a snob; a claim which Oscar then justifies by stating he hates the Philadelphia Opera. In the aired episode, Daryl initially picks up Oscar's interest in Matt, telling Oscar \"You can be gay with him--just be straight with me\", and later Daryl bluntly says that Matt is a dummy and not worth Oscar's time, before he watches with bemusement as Oscar quickly runs off when Matt invites him to play an arcade basketball game.\n\nIn \"Costume Contest\", Oscar points out that the contest's coveted prize, a coupon catalog, only provides the thousands of dollars of savings promised if the person buys a lot of things they do not really need. He then puts on a bland \"rational consumer\" outfit to mock the contest, but is stunned to learn that he won (mainly because Kelly and others voted for him out of surety he would lose), Ryan wanted to shake things up a la his support for Ralph Nader, and Creed says it was \"the best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen\".\n\nIn \"China\", Oscar's know-it-all tendencies come to the fore when he is wrong about a fact related to urban population centers in China—and Michael was right about it. Oscar then wants to have Michael meet him for coffee, which Jim recognizes is a way for \"Mr. Actually\" (Oscar) to get to have the last word and show Michael up on the facts about China. However, while Oscar does make some points Michael can't rebut, Michael still wins over a number of watching co-workers when he makes an emotional argument about the U.S. and China that Oscar isn't able to counter.\n\nIn \"Classy Christmas\", Oscar, who was already annoyed at Angela for constantly talking about her State Senator boyfriend, meets him and immediately says in an interview that \"he's gay\". Later on at the party, Ryan walks away from their group to make a drink, and the Senator clearly watches Ryan's backside as he leaves. Oscar notices this and turns the camera with a shocked expression.\n\nIn \"The Seminar\", Oscar and Pam help Erin when she plays a scrabble game against Gabe on her phone so that she can pick the movie she wants to watch with him (\"Wall-E\"). Before Oscar can type in the final word, Pam suggests that Erin should be the one to do it. Oscar reluctantly gives her the phone and hints that she should type the word \"apoplexy\". Erin ends up typing \"ape\", and Oscar is left frustrated.\n\nIn \"PDA\", Oscar strongly disapproves of Michael and Holly's public displays of affection. Later on, after the two announce that they are moving in together, Oscar comes around and tells them to kiss. The kiss causes Kevin to say, \"Suck on that, Oscar\", and Oscar frustratedly points out that he was the one who told them to kiss. In \"Garage Sale\", Oscar tries to sell a vast collection of \"Will and Grace\" memorabilia he has gathered over the years due to people mistakingly thinking he's a fan of the show. He is also part of the group that helps Michael think of a good way to propose to Holly.\n\nIn \"Michael's Last Dundies\", Oscar laughs at Michael's portrayal of Angela in the opening video of the award show. He tells the camera (when referring to the movie) \"the analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content\". Later, he has a brief solo in the employees' a cappella version of \"Seasons of Love\" (with altered lyrics) that they sing to Michael (who is soon departing). In it, he sings that he forgives Michael for kissing him (which previously happened in the third season premiere episode \"Gay Witch Hunt\").\n\nIn \"Goodbye, Michael\", Michael gives Oscar a miniature scarecrow figurine that he clearly made on his own, to symbolize the \"brain\" that Oscar gave to Michael, just like in \"The Wizard of Oz\". In an interview, it was clearly intended as a joke on Michael's part, but Oscar accepts it as a serious gift. Oscar listens in as Angela shows off pictures of her and her boyfriend together, shaking his head at the fact the pictures hint heavily at the boyfriend being gay but Angela continues not to see it. In the extended version of the episode, Oscar says in a talking-head interview that Michael once asked him if \"gay guys squeeze each other's boobs\", and gives a little laugh while citing that he will never forget that.\n\nIn \"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\", Dwight makes everybody recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The camera focuses on Oscar during the phrase \"under God\" which he does not say.\n\nOscar finds himself on the \"winners\" side of new boss Robert California's (James Spader) \"List\". Along with Jim, Oscar appears visibly uncomfortable when he finds this out.\n\nDuring \"The Incentive\", Andy manages to rouse the staff into doubling sales by promising to get a tattoo of their choice, on Andy's buttocks. With the rest of the staff, Oscar joins in on the bet and is witness to Andy's tattoo at the shop.\n\nIn \"Garden Party\", Oscar, along with other staff, listens to Andy's father verbally browbeat his son on Jim and Pam's baby monitor. With Darryl, they cheer Andy up with a barbecue. The two later confide in a talking head interview that they understand why Andy has a need to prove himself to everyone.\n\nIn \"New Guys\", Angela pleads with Oscar to adopt her cat, Comstock, to which Oscar refuses and insists he's a dog person. But when he learns that the cat is a favorite of her husband's, Oscar changes his mind and adopts Comstock. It's later implied that Oscar is having an affair with Robert, judging by a secretive phone call he makes to let him know of adopting Comstock. In \"The Boat\", the affair is confirmed after the cameras catch Oscar kissing Robert. When Oscar sees that Kevin saw them, he goes to great lengths to ensure that Kevin keeps the secret, which he does.\n\nIn \"The Whale\", Angela confides to Oscar that she suspects Robert is cheating on her and they follow Robert to his gym. When Angela sees Robert making a call, after asking \"who is he calling,\" and Oscar's phone begins to ring, she finally suspects that Oscar may be the one having an affair with Robert. In \"The Target\", Angela seeks revenge on Oscar and hires a hitman to attack him but is talked out of it by Dwight. Oscar allows her to kick him in the shin instead. In \"Vandalism\", Oscar and Angela compete uncomfortably for the affections of Robert at Angela's son's birthday party, but Oscar later suspects that Robert may have invited him only to boost Latino representation for his political campaign. Later, Oscar and Angela reconcile after he invites her to move in with him when she and Robert break up and she is evicted from her apartment.\n\nIn \"Finale\", one year after the airing of the documentary, Oscar is revealed to be running for Pennsylvania State Senate (it is possible, but not explicitly stated, that Robert's re-election bid failed after he was outed by the documentary, meaning Oscar may be running for Robert's old seat) and he is the godfather of Angela and Dwight's son. Oscar also brings some of his old condescension to events around Dwight's wedding; at the dinner for Dwight and his old friends, when he learns that Andy has gotten a job at Cornell's Office of Admissions he assumes that it is volunteer work or an internship, leading Andy to somewhat annoyedly say that the job is a full-time paid position.\n"}
{"id": "10748625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10748625", "title": "Pilot (Twin Peaks)", "text": "Pilot (Twin Peaks)\n\nThe pilot episode, also known as Northwest Passage, of the mystery television series \"Twin Peaks\" premiered on the ABC Network on Sunday, April 8, 1990. It was written by series creators Mark Frost and David Lynch, and directed by Lynch. The pilot follows the characters of Dale Cooper and Harry S. Truman as they investigate the death of popular high school student Laura Palmer; Cooper believes the murder has connections to a murder case that occurred a year earlier. In addition to setting the tone for the show, the episode sets up several character and story arcs and marked the appearance of several recurring characters. The episode received a strong Nielsen household rating compared to other season one episodes and was well received by fans and critics alike. The original title for the series was \"Northwest Passage\", but this was later changed.\n\nThe small northwest town of Twin Peaks, Washington is shaken when the body of Laura Palmer is discovered washed up on a riverbank, wrapped in plastic. FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in when Ronnette Pulaski, who attended the same high school as Palmer, is found wandering on a bridge before lapsing into a coma. Cooper believes there is a connection between Palmer's death and the death of another girl named Teresa Banks that happened a year earlier. Cooper discovers a small piece of paper with the letter \"R\" on it shoved under Laura's fingernail. He tells Sheriff Harry S. Truman that under Banks's nail he found a \"T\". Meanwhile, the Palmer family and friends struggle to come to terms with her death, and wonder how it might have come about.\n\nBelieving that this is the same killer who struck the previous year, Cooper starts an official investigation. Meanwhile, the rebellious Audrey Horne ruins a business deal for her father Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer); Sheriff Truman arrests Palmer's boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), who is secretly seeing a married waitress named Shelly; Palmer's best friend Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle) and Palmer's secret boyfriend James Hurley discover a mutual attraction; and Laura's mother is terrified by a vision.\n\nThe episode has two different endings, depending on which version of the episode one is watching. The American version ends with the above events, concluded by Sarah Palmer's nightmare of a hand digging into the ground and grabbing James's half of a necklace that belonged to Laura.\n\nThe international version was filmed with 20 extra minutes of footage in case the series was not picked up by the networks, rather allowing them to release it as a Television movie. It contains scenes from episode one, where Sarah realises that there was a man hiding in Laura's room when she checked in it the previous day. It also contains the ending to episode two, when Cooper dreams of meeting Laura and a mysterious man who speaks to him in a disjointed voice. It also reveals who Laura's killers were.\n\nDavid Lynch and Mark Frost pitched the idea to ABC during the time of the Writers Guild of America, East strike in 1988 in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, with nothing more than this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was initially going to be in the foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera.\n\nABC liked the idea, and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like Benjamin Horne, while Lynch was responsible for Agent Dale Cooper. According to the director, \"He says a lot of the things I say\". Originally, the show was entitled \"Northwest Passage\" and set in North Dakota, but the fact that a town called Northwest Passage really exists prompted a revision in the script. They filmed the pilot for $1.8 million with an agreement with ABC that they would shoot an additional \"ending\" to it so that it could be sold directly to video in Europe as a feature if the TV show was not picked up. However, even though ABC's Bob Iger liked the pilot, he had a tough time persuading the rest of the network brass. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse, younger group, who liked it, and the executive subsequently convinced ABC to buy seven episodes at $1.1 million apiece. Some executives figured that the show would never get on the air, believing it would meet negative reviews from viewers and critics alike. However, Iger planned to schedule it for the spring. The final showdown occurred during a bi-coastal conference call between Iger and a room full of New York executives; Iger won, and \"Twin Peaks\" was on the air.\n\nAt several points during the filming of the pilot episode, David Lynch improvised by incorporating on-set accidents into the story. The most notable of these occurred when set decorator Frank Silva was being told to be careful to not get stuck in a room while furniture was being moved around. Lynch heard this and he says that the image of Silva being stuck intrigued him. Lynch then shot some footage of Silva perching behind Laura Palmer's bed, but was unsure as to what he would do with it. Silva was then accidentally filmed in a mirror during Sarah Palmer's vision at the end of the pilot. The camera operator insisted that Lynch do another take because of the mistake, but he liked it so much he kept it in the show, and cast Silva as Killer BOB, the mysterious tormentor of Laura Palmer.\n\nDuring the filming of the scene in which Dale Cooper first examines Laura's body, a malfunctioning fluorescent light above the table flickered constantly, but Lynch decided not to replace it, since he liked the disconcerting effect that it created. Also, during the take, one of the minor actors misheard a line and, thinking he was being asked his name, he told Cooper his real name instead of saying his line, briefly throwing everyone off balance. Lynch was reportedly pleased with the lifelike, unscripted moment in dialogue, and kept the mistake in the final cut.\n\nThe pilot was first shown in September 1989 at the Telluride Film Festival. That same month, \"Connoisseur\" magazine ran a cover story calling Twin Peaks \"the series that will change TV forever.\" After viewing the episode, Tom Shales of the \"Washington Post\" wrote \"Twin Peaks isn’t just a visit to another town; it’s a visit to another planet. Maybe it will go down in history as a brief and brave experiment. But as can be said of few other TV shows in the near or immediate future: This You Gotta See.\"\n\nOn February 10, 1990, it was shown as part of the Miami Film Festival. Sun-Sentinel writer Robert Hurlburt wrote \"the Lynchian sense of impending danger and kinky sexual undercurrents, coupled with excellent music, makes the \"Twin Peaks\" pilot work almost too well. You'll want to see the entire package in one sitting. But the series may lay an egg on television because of its drawn-out and deliberate pacing, brutality, sex with violence and a hint of something else ... something deadly, yet unseen and probably repulsive.\"\n\nIn April, a screening was also held at the Museum of Broadcasting in Hollywood. Media analyst and advertising executive Paul Schulman said, \"I don't think it has a chance of succeeding. It is not commercial, it is radically different from what we as viewers are accustomed to seeing, there's no one in the show to root for.\"\n\nThe two-hour pilot was the highest-rated movie for the 1989–1990 season with a 21.7 rating and was viewed by 34.6 million people. In Los Angeles, \"Twin Peaks\" became the seventh most-watched show of the week earning 29% of viewers, the most-watched show being \"Married... with Children\" which gathered 34% of viewers. The following episode, \"Traces to Nowhere\" would start with a significant drop in ratings with only 23.2 million people tuning in. Various media such as \"The New York Times\" and local radio stations announced that the show had managed to grow a cult following.\n\nFor the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards, the pilot episode was nominated six times, including \"Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series\" for David Lynch, \"Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" for Kyle MacLachlan as Dale Cooper, and \"Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series\" for Mark Frost and Lynch. The pilot won two awards, with frequent Lynch collaborator Patricia Norris winning for \"Outstanding Costume Design for a Series\" and Duwayne Dunham winning the \"Outstanding Editing for a Series - Single Camera Production\". The pilot also received a Peabody Award in 1990.\n\nThe pilot's international release tells the story of the series in a self-contained manner, and includes 20 minutes of additional footage.\n\nInitially, the show's Thursday night time slot was not a good one for soap operas as both \"Dynasty\" and its short-lived spin-off \"The Colbys\" did poorly. \"Twin Peaks\" was also up against the hugely successful sitcom \"Cheers\". Initially, the show received a positive response from TV critics. Tom Shales, in the \"Washington Post\", wrote, \"\"Twin Peaks\" disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It's a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling.\" In the \"New York Times\", John J. O'Connor wrote, \"\"Twin Peaks\" is not a sendup of the form. Mr. Lynch clearly savors the standard ingredients...but then the director adds his own peculiar touches, small passing details that suddenly, and often hilariously, thrust the commonplace out of kilter.\"\n\nMany critics saw the pilot as \"the movie that will change TV\" history, according to Diana White from the \"Boston Globe\". Ken Tucker from \"Entertainment Weekly\" was strongly positive about the episode, giving it a A+. While liking the story, and calling Lynch's directing beautiful, he said \"[there is] not a chance in hell\" the show could become a ratings hit, because of its \"unsettling\" story. David Zurawik from \"The Baltimore Sun\" compared the pilot to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. He also said its cinematography was \"about as close as prime-time television gets to art.\" Jen Chaney from \"The Washington Post\" called the pilot \"one of the most finely crafted series kick-offs in broadcast history\".\n\nIn 1997, TV Guide ranked the pilot #25 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.\n\nDue to rights issues, the American pilot (94 minutes long) was not released in the United States home video market until 2007. The European pilot (116 minutes) had been released on VHS and laser disc years earlier: this alternate version of the pilot was aired in Europe as a stand-alone television movie. The European version is identical to the United States-aired version up until the last several scenes, when the killer of Laura Palmer is revealed. Both versions of the pilot are included in the \"Twin Peaks: Definitive Gold Box Edition\" DVD set, released in the US on October 30, 2007. Lynch was so pleased with the footage shot for the European ending that he later incorporated some of it into Cooper's dream sequences that aired in subsequent episodes.\n\n"}
{"id": "1433456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1433456", "title": "Potpourri", "text": "Potpourri\n\nPotpourri is a mixture of dried, naturally fragrant plant material, used to provide a gentle natural scent, commonly in residential settings. It is often placed in a decorative bowl or tied in small sachet made from sheer fabric.\n\nThe word \"potpourri\" comes into English from the French word \"pot-pourri\". The French term has two connotations. It is the French name for a Spanish stew with a wide variety of ingredients called \"olla podrida\", a specialty of the town of Burgos. The word was taken and copied by the French military during the Napoleonic occupation of Burgos (1808-1813). The word \"pot\" in French has the same meaning as it does in Spanish and English, while the word \"pourri\" means rotten. \n\nDried scented plant material has been used in rooms since ancient times, in a variety of ways, including just scattering them on floors. In early 17th Century France, fresh herbs and flowers were gathered—beginning in spring and continuing throughout the summer. The herbs were left for a day or two to become limp, then layered with coarse sea salt. The aging mixture was stirred occasionally as layers were added to it. Often the mixture would ferment or even mold as the summer went by. In fall, spices would be added to the unsightly grey mix until a pleasant fragrance was achieved. Then, scent preserving fixatives (see below) were added. The finished potpourri was set out in special pots with perforated lids to perfume rooms. \n\nMuch modern potpourri consists of any decoratively shaped dried plant material (not necessarily from scented plants) with strong natural and synthetic perfumes (and often colored dyes) added, with the scent often bearing no relation to the plant material used. Sometimes, items that do not originate from plants are mixed in with the potpourri, to give it bulk and to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It is possible to spray scents onto potpourri, however, a fixative is needed so that the scent is absorbed for slow release. Generally, orris root is used for this purpose.\n\nDried flowers can last anywhere from two months to 20 years, depending on the chosen blend. Properly made potpourri will last longer when stored in closed container.\n\nIn ceramics manufacturing, a potpourri vase is a specifically designed for holding potpourri. In the traditional designs, a potpourri container is provided with a pierced fitted lid, through which the scent may slowly diffuse. The porcelain Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship is one of the most spectacular examples from the 1750s and 1760s; Madame de Pompadour owned three of the twelve examples made, ten of which survived.\n\nThere are many plant species that are used for potpourri. Researchers have identified 300 species from 95 families, including fungi and lichens. A few toxic ingredients have been found in fruits such as \"Strychnos nux-vomica\", the strychnine tree. Naturally scented plants used in traditional potpourri include:\n"}

It demands having not only a strong Amharic, Tigrigna, or Ge’ez vocabulary, but also familiarity with the culture from where the particular poem originates or the background against which it was written.\n\nIt is believed that Saint Yared is the originator of Qəne. Since most of Saint Yared’s works are based on the Bible, thus it can be assumed that the Bible is the original source of Qəne composition. Some parts of the Bible such as the Psalms and the Song of Songs (Song of Solomon) are written in poetry form. Some books of the Bible such as the Song of Songs and the teachings (sermons) of Jesus use a lot of metaphorical and allegorical language similar to the Säm əna Wärq mode of Qəne. Saint Yared’s non-sparing use of the content and style of the Bible helped in making his compositions acceptable and popular. Some of his compositions are still used as prayers in their original form.\n\nAlthough Saint Yared was the earliest composer of Qəne, he does not appear to have set the forms and meters for the genre. There are, in fact, several possible candidates deemed responsible. One possibility lies with Qəne scholars during the reign of Emperor Eskender (1478-1494) - Hawira, Menkera, Eskendera, Poeskenedera and Abidira. Another explanation – commonly referred to as the Wadla claim – attributes it to an early 15th-century scholar from Wadla named Yohannəs Geblawi. And then there is the Gonj claim - attributing the deed to a certain Täwanäy who flourished after the 15th century. Täwanäy is alleged to have learned his Qəne alongside Wäldä Mariam from a certain Eliab, who in turn learned it from alongside Lehib from Sämrä Ab, who in turn learned it from Yohannəs Geblawi.\n\nOral traditions also mention a certain Däqä Est’ifa as the scholar responsible for setting the meters for Qəne. Däqä Est’ifa is alleged to have acquired seven crafts from Greece - six having to do with magic, and the seventh Qəne - and returned to Ethiopia during the reign of Emperor Bä'edä Mariam (1468-1478). He is then said to have taught the seventh craft to Prince Eskinder, Hawira, Menkera, Behur, and another Eskinder.\n\nDäqä Est’ifa was quite popular at his former pupil Emperor Eskinder's court. One tradition claims he seduced the Emperor's wife and used one of his other crafts to vanish with her. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor set fire to the house Däqä Est’ifa and the Empress were hiding in. However, Däqä Est’ifa allegedly used another of his crafts to again disappear with his lover - and is said to still roam the island.\n\nYohannəs Geblawi, in contrast to Däqä Est’ifa's worldly crafts, is said to have acquired his Qəne during a spiritual meditation. Yohannəs was born at Geblon in Wadla (Lasta), and flourished at the time of Emperor Zar'a Yacob (1434-1468). He and is said to have taught near Mount Tabor at Amara Saynt. Yohannes taught Qəne to the monk Aba Wäldä Gabriel, who in turn taught Sämrä Kristos (Sämrä Ab). Sämrä Kristos (Sämrä Ab) is said to have given Emperor Bä'edä Mariam (1468-1478) Qəne lessons. He also taught Lehib and Eliab, the latter of whom taught Qəne to Täwanäy and Dədəq Wäldä Mariam.\n\nEmperor Be'ede Mariam was so taken by the art of Qəne that he is said, on the advice of his teacher Sämrä Kristos, to have gone into a week-long meditation to determine its origin. The answer was revealed to him on the festival of the changing of water unto wine (Qana ZeGelila), when he composed the following Qəne by divine inspiration,\n\nAs Be'ede Mariam's Qəne was composed during a gathering (Gubae) at the festival of Qana ZeGelila, its form and meter has been known as Gubaʾe Qana. Sämrä Kristos was then said to have composed a Zäʾämlakəye Qəne, after which the Emperor composed a Mibäzhu Qəne - the tradition claims.\n\nOne tradition also claims Täwanäy as Däqä Est’ifa's student. However, Däqä Est’ifa flourished during the reign of Emperor Eskender - a period when third generation disciples of Yohannes Geblawi also taught. This casts into doubt the alleged role of Däqä Est’ifa as the originator of Qəne - as the line of Yohannes Geblawi would have precedence. Furthermore, the more than fifty years that span between Däqä Est’ifa and Täwanäy would make it hard to take the latter as a disciple. Moreover, other accounts put Täwanäy's time at the early 18th century.\n\nAccordingly, along the Qəne line of Yohannes Geblawi, Sämrä Ab taught Lehib and Eliab. Eliab, in turn, taught Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy. Tradition also holds that due to unfavorable conditions caused by the wars of Ahmad Gragn (mid-16th century), Dədəq Wäldä Mariam and Täwanäy formed two separate Qəne styles - the Wadla and the Gonj schools, respectively.\n\nAnother interesting tradition holds that both disciples made the trip to Däq Island to further their knowledge. While Dədəq Wäldä Mariam chanced upon mystical teachers that helped him further his Qəne, Täwanäy had no such luck. Instead, he fell into the carnal snares of mystical women who thwarted his many attempts to escape. When he turned into an eagle and tried to fly away, they would turn into pebbles and stone him. When he turned into a worm to wiggle his way off the island, they would turn into chickens and peck at him. He finally managed to escape by turning into a flea and attaching himself to a sack of Gesho leaves destined for sale on the mainland! Perhaps the notion of Täwanäy as the disciple of Däqä Est’ifa stems from his legendary exploits at Däq Island.\n\nThe same tradition claims that by the time Täwanäy escaped from Däq, he had only retained a fraction of what Eliab had taught him. Hence, the Gonj school of Qəne associated with Täwanäy stresses Qəne composition, but only fleetingly covers Ge'ez verb conjugation and syntax - whereas the Wadla school associated with Dədəq Wäldä Mariam teaches all these elements. The Wadla school was led by a succession of seven teachers - all with the title Dədəq - the last of whom was also named Dədəq Wäldä Mariam. He was succeeded by Ma'ibel Wäldä Hiwot (MeCha), who was then succeeded by Aleka Getahun (Gete Amoraw). The other disciple of Sämrä Kristos, Lehib, taught Qəne to Zetre Wengel - who was succeeded by Zikri. He was in turn succeeded by Bekuru, and followed by Yonathan, who taught ZeNebiyat and QaleAwadi. Qale Awadi was succeeded by Aleka Maru of Amhara Sayint, who then taught Aqabe Se'at Kabte of Gonder.\n\nNevertheless, the multiplicity of Qəne lines of transmission does not imply multiple origins for Qəne. Saint Yared remains to be held as the founder of Qəne. Moreover, the many schools of Qəne can be seen in parallel to the various types of musical notations (such as Bethleheme, Qome, WenChere, AChabre, Wadle and Tegulete schools) that developed out of Saint Yared's Deggwa.\n\nTraditionally any metrical verse with a rhyming scheme is defined as a poem, and since Qəne fulfills these requirements it can be considered to be a poem. However, while most poems have literal meaning, Qəne has to have a literal as well as a symbolic meaning by using the mode of Säm əna Wärq. One can say that all Qəne are poems, but not all poems can be Qəne. Qəne is different in that a profound idea can be veiled underneath an every-day idea through the mode of Säm əna Wärq (i.e. metaphorical representation). \nSince Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, one has to adhere to a standard metrical pattern. The different types of Qəne have their own metrical pattern. The measure for the types of Qəne is not only numbers of verse but the syllabic metrical pattern as well. Thus, even though a poem uses a mode of Säm əna Wärq, unless it follows a certain metrical pattern it can’t be classified as a Qəne.\n\nThe poem has two Wärq phrases, the former is about the harlot and the latter warns about being destroyed by promiscuity. Even with such complex mode of Säm əna Wärq, the author called it a poem and not a Qəne. Thus we can see that Qəne has a much complex character than a poem.\n\nMost Qənes are composed in Ge’ez, and most students at Qəne school start their education by learning the basics of the Gəʾəz language. Most Qənes are composed in Gəʾəz since Qəne rules regarding the Säm əna Wärq mode and metrical pattern are set up for the Gəʾəz language. But once we follow the right metrical pattern and rules of metaphor, one can compose Qəne in other languages. For Example in Amharic, Afaan Oromo, English …etc. This is evident in the advent of Guramayle Qəne (a blend of Gəʾəz and Amharic) and Amharic Qənes starting from the Gondarine Period (17th to 19th century)\nExample of Qene blending Gəʾəz, Amharic and English:\n3፡ Mäwädəs\n\nMeanings:\nFor the Säm, it is normal for people to rush towards a banquet hall where good food and drinks are being served. Comparatively, the BaläQəne(Qene Poet) advises his brothers (members of the MahəBärä Qədusan(MQ) organization) to rush towards the gates of the church where one can find food for the soul – words from the gospel and angelic voices of gratitude. In the second half, the BaläQəne recounts that without rain the farmer will lose all that he has planted. But observing the presence of rain clouds, the farmer will plant his seeds and when it rains all the plants will blossom. For the Wärq, the BaläQəne advises the MQ members to listen to the words of the gospel with love and humility. And the members are overjoyed because Patriarch Paulos, disregarding those advising him to close down the MQ association, allowed the association to continue doing its work.\n\nMost Qənes are differentiated by their metrical pattern and length of verse. There are also different types of Qəne which are differentiated by the particular usage of the Säm əna Wärq mode. Since Qəne is sung as a hymn at a church service, classifying Qənes according to the metrical pattern is commonplace. Accordingly, there are 9 major Qəne types. And since some of them have sub-types, we can say that there are 17 types of Qəne.\n\nThe Qəne type is determined by the quantity and length of the verses. Thus there are some Qənes which have the same quantity of verses but are classified as different types of Qəne because of the variation in the length of the verses. A student starts his Qəne education starting from the shorter Qənes and working up to the lengthy Qənes. Each Qəne stage uses the previous stage as a building block. When a student is able to compose all the different types of Qəne, he is said to \"Bet Molla\". When someone presents the full variety of Qənes he is said to have composed \"Mulu Bet\".\n\nGubaʾe Qana consists of two verses and symbolizes the divine and human nature of God. There are four types of Gubaʾe Qana differentiated by length of the verse (Short Gubaʾe Qana and long Gubaʾe Qana) and Zema mode ( Gəʾəz Gubaʾe Qana and ʾəzl Gubaʾe Qana). Some say that Gubaʾe Qana got its name by being presented on Tərr 12 – the commemoration of Qana zägälila (wedding in Cana of Galilee). Others say that it got its name by being presented at an assembly in a place called Qana in Showa. Still others say that the name is given to signify the flavor (Qana) of Qəne. The fact that there are only two verses makes it ideal for beginner students and all Qəne students take their first steps in the world of Qəne with the two verse Gubaʾe Qana.\n\nZäʾämlakəye consists of three verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . The second verse is called Mändärdärya. According to some Qəne experts, the three verses symbolize the mystery of the Trinity. The name Zäʾämlakəye is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 62 (“አምላኪየ አምላኪየ እገይስ ሀቤከ).\n\nJust like Zäʾämlakəye, Mibäzhu has three verses. The zema mode is ʾəzl and symbolizes the Trinity. The name Mibäzhu is derived from the fact that this type of Qəne is composed using the first line of Psalm 3 (እግዚኦ ሚበዝኁ እለ ይሳቅዩኒ).\n\nThere are two types of Wazema: Long Wazema (five verses with Araray zema mode) and Short Wazema(two verses). Some say Wazema is named as such because it is composed on the eve (wazema) of a major church holiday. Others say that the name is derived from a line in St. Yared’s chant “ዋይ ዜማ ሰማእኩ እመላእክት ቅዱሳን’’ . The long wazema is always composed on the eve of major church holidays.\n\nSəllase has six verses and the zema mode is ʾəzl . This Qəne genre symbolizes the 6 commands of the New Testament. The name is derived from the prayer of the 3 children thanking the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ይትባረክ እግዚአብሔር አምላከ አበዊነ አምላከ አብርሃም አምላከ ይስሃቅ አምላከ ያዕቆብ.\n\nZäyəʾəze Qəne is usually presented in honor of a sovereign. The name is derived from the Psalm where it says “ይዕዜ ትስእሮ ለገብርከ”. There are two types of Zäyəʾəze: long Zäyəʾəze (five verses with Gəʾəz zema mode) and Short Zäyəʾəze (three verses with Araray zema mode). The Short Zäyəʾəze is also called sahləkä because it is usually presented with the psalm “ተሰሃለኒ እግዚኦ በከመ እበየ ሳህልከ”.\n\nThe word Mäwädəs is derived from the verb ወደሰ and denotes gratefulness. There are two types of Mäwädəs: fətah litä (eight verses with Araray zema mode) and kuləkəmu (nine verses). Fətah litä is so named because it is performed after Psalm 42 (“ፍታህ ሊተ እግዚኦ ወተበቀል በቀልየ”), while kuləkəmu is performed after Psalm 46 (ኩልክሙ አህዛብ ጥፍሁ እደዊክሙ).\n\nThis four verse Qəne is usually composed about the subject of the Holy Cross. According to the Zema mode, kəbər yəʾəti is classified into two: Gəʾəz kəbər yəʾəti and ʾəzl kəbər yəʾəti. The name kəbər yəʾəti is derived because it is performed after Psalm 149:9 (“ክብር ይእቲ ዛቲ ለከሉ ፃድቃኑ”).\n\nThere are two types of ʾət’anä mogär: Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär (seven verses) and ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär (eleven verses). The first 4 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the first 6 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär usually recount about the day’s festivity. The last 3 verses of Gəʾəz ʾət’anä mogär and the last 5 verses of ʾəzl ʾət’anä mogär are called ʿäsärä nəgus. The ʿäsärä nəgus is composed in honor of a sovereign or to praise or rebuke a public figure.\n\nThere are some well known traditions of Qəne such as Nät’äqa, Gəlbät’a, and Tämäst’o. The mastery of these Qəne traditions is the sign of the BaläQəne’s expertise of the genre and his placement at the summit of the Qəne world.\n\nAs the meaning of the term attests, this tradition signifies the taking away of verses but does not equate with stealing. Nät’äqa involves finishing off the verses of a Qəne as another person is reciting the beginning verses. This shows that the one who is doing the Nät’äqa already knows what the other composer was going to recite.\nExample: Emahoy Gälanäsh’s Nät’äqa of her father’s Qəne\n\nWhen the father was reciting\n\nAnd the daughter finished the Qəne by saying,\n\nThe amazed father then said,\n\nMeaning: When a strong horse gallops it is hard for the rider to restrain it.\n\nHidden Meaning: When Jesus took Peter and John with him to the top of Mount Tabor and showed them his transfiguration amongst Moses and Elijah, the disciples were overwhelmed and fell on the ground. The part about St Paul is referring to the Paul’s edict barring women from teaching in public.\n\nGəlbät’a involves taking someone’s Qəne creating a new Qəne by changing the message and rhyming scheme. For example, it is common to wish newlyweds to have a marriage like Abraham and Sarah. But another person can use Gəlbät’a and overturn the blessing by saying let your marriage be not like Abraham and Sarah. When asked why, one can say may the bride not be mentally anguished as Sarah was when Abraham had a child from Sarah’s Servant Hagar. On the other hand, a fearful Abraham gave away his wife to King Abemelek saying she was his sister – and this is a good reason to overturn the first blessing.\n\nThus, likewise, one can overturn the message of a Qəne being recited and create a whole new Qəne. Such practice will help open up new viewpoints of things we are accustomed to and help us list the advantages and disadvantages of a particular knowledge system.\n\nWhen composing Qəne, one is usually immersed in deep contemplation (Tämäst’o) and becomes oblivious to one’s surrounding. A well known example of such a deep contemplation is the story of the BaläQəne Kəflä Yohannəs who was active during the reign of Emperor Iyassu I (1674 – 1698). It is said that Kəflä Yohannəs lived a very humble life and was not popular among the luxury-seeking clergy of the court who were constantly at work to put a rift between him and the emperor. On one occasion, Kəflä Yohannəs, deep in contemplation, did not salute as the Emperor entered the Däbrä Bərhan Səllase Church with his entourage. The clergy were quick to point out Kəflä Yohannəs’ faux pas to the Emperor. Knowing that Kəflä Yohannəs meant no malice, the Emperor threw at him a gold nugget to rouse him from his meditation. Kəflä Yohannəs then approached the Emperor and composed the following Qəne:\n\nThe clergy were further disgraced when the Emperor rewarded Kəflä Yohannəs the gold nugget. Kəflä Yohannəs donated the gold nugget to the church.\n\n"}
{"id": "26436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26436", "title": "Rent (musical)", "text": "Rent (musical)\n\nRent is a rock musical with music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson, loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's opera \"La bohème\". It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York City's East Village in the thriving days of Bohemian Alphabet City, under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe musical was first seen in a workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop in 1993. This same Off-Broadway theatre was also the musical's initial home following its official 1996 opening. The show's creator, Jonathan Larson, died suddenly of an aortic dissection, believed to have been caused by undiagnosed Marfan syndrome, the night before the Off-Broadway premiere. The musical moved to Broadway's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.\n\nOn Broadway, \"Rent\" gained critical acclaim and won several awards. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run of 5,123 performances. On February 14, 2016, the musical \"Wicked\" surpassed \"Rent\"s number of performances with a 2pm matinee, pushing \"Rent\" from the tenth- to eleventh-longest-running Broadway show. The production grossed over $280 million.\n\nThe success of the show led to several national tours and numerous foreign productions. In 2005, it was adapted into a motion picture featuring most of the original cast members.\n\nIn 1988, playwright Billy Aronson wanted to create \"a musical based on Puccini's \"La Bohème\", in which the luscious splendor of Puccini's world would be replaced with the coarseness and noise of modern New York.\" In 1989, Jonathan Larson, a 29-year-old composer, began collaborating with Aronson on this project, and the two composed together \"Santa Fe\", \"Splatter\" (later re-worked into the song \"Rent\"), and \"I Should Tell You\". Larson suggested setting the play \"amid poverty, homelessness, spunky gay life, drag queens and punk\" in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, which happened to be down the street from his Greenwich Village apartment. He also came up with the show's ultimate title (a decision that Aronson was unhappy with, at least until Larson pointed out that \"rent\" also means torn apart). In 1991, he asked Aronson if he could use Aronson's original concept and make \"Rent\" his own. Larson had ambitious expectations for \"Rent\"; his ultimate dream was to write a rock opera \"to bring musical theater to the MTV generation\". Aronson and Larson made an agreement that if the show went to Broadway, Aronson would share in the proceeds and be given credit for \"original concept & additional lyrics\".\n\nJonathan Larson focused on composing \"Rent\" in the early 1990s, waiting tables at the Moondance Diner to support himself. Over the course of years, Larson wrote hundreds of songs and made many drastic changes to the show, which in its final incarnation contained 42 songs. In the fall of 1992, Larson approached James Nicola, artistic director of New York Theatre Workshop, with a tape and copy of \"Rent\"s script. When \"Rent\" had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993, it became evident that, despite its very promising material and moving musical numbers, many structural problems needed to be addressed, including its cumbersome length and overly complex plot.\n\nAs of 1994, the New York Theatre Workshop version of \"Rent\" featured songs that never made it to the final version, such as:\n\n\nThis workshop version of \"Rent\" starred Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi. Larson continued to work on \"Rent\", gradually reworking its flaws and staging more workshop productions.\n\nOn January 24, 1996, after the musical's final dress rehearsal before its off-Broadway opening, Larson had his first (and only) newspaper interview with music critic Anthony Tommasini of \"The New York Times\", attracted by the coincidence that the show was debuting exactly 100 years after Puccini's opera. Larson would not live to see \"Rent\"s success; he died from an undiagnosed aortic aneurysm (believed to have resulted from Marfan syndrome) in the early morning of January 25, 1996. Friends and family gathered at the New York Theatre Workshop, and the first preview of \"Rent\" became a sing-through of the musical in Larson's memory.\n\nThe show premiered as planned and quickly gained popularity fueled by enthusiastic reviews and the recent death of its composer. It proved extremely successful during its Off-Broadway run, selling out all its shows at the 150-seat New York Theater Workshop. Due to such overwhelming popularity and a need for a larger theater, \"Rent\" moved to Broadway's recently remodeled Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996.\n\nLarson's inspiration for \"Rent\"s content came from several different sources. Many of the characters and plot elements are drawn directly from Giacomo Puccini's opera \"La Bohème\", the world premiere of which was in 1896, a century before \"Rent\"s premiere. \"La Bohème\" was also about the lives of poor young artists. Tuberculosis, the plague of Puccini's opera, is replaced by HIV/AIDS in \"Rent\"; 1800s Paris is replaced by New York's East Village in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The names and identities of \"Rent\"s characters also heavily reflect Puccini's original characters, though they are not all direct adaptations. For example, Joanne in \"Rent\" represents the character of Alcindoro in \"Bohème\", but is also partially based on Marcello. Also, Joanne is the only \"Rent\" character whose predecessor in \"La Bohème\" is the opposite sex.\n\nOther examples of parallels between Larson's and Puccini's work include Larson's song \"Light My Candle\", which draws melodic content directly from \"Che gelida manina\"; \"Quando me'n vo'\" (\"Musetta's Waltz\"), a melody taken directly from Puccini's opera; and \"Goodbye Love\", a long, painful piece that reflects a confrontation and parting between characters in both Puccini's and Larson's work. \"Quando me'n vo'\" is paralleled in the first verse of \"Take Me or Leave Me\", when Maureen describes the way people stare when she walks in the street. It is also directly referred to in the scene where the characters are celebrating their bohemian life. Mark says, \"Roger will attempt to write a bittersweet, evocative song...\" Roger plays a quick piece, and Mark adds, \"...that \"doesn't\" remind us of 'Musetta's Waltz'.\" This part of \"Musetta's Waltz\" is also later used in \"Your Eyes\", a song Roger writes.\n\n\"Rent\" is also a somewhat autobiographical work, as Larson incorporated many elements of his life into his show. Larson lived in New York for many years as a starving artist with an uncertain future. He sacrificed a life of stability for his art, and shared many of the same hopes and fears as his characters. Like his characters he endured poor living conditions, and some of these conditions (e.g. illegal wood-burning stove, bathtub in the middle of his kitchen, broken buzzer [his guests had to call from the pay phone across the street and he would throw down the keys, as in \"Rent\"]) made their way into the play. Part of the motivation behind the storyline in which Maureen leaves Mark for a woman (Joanne) is based on the fact that Larson's own girlfriend left him for a woman. The Mark Cohen character is based on Larson's friends, cinematographer and producer Jonathan Burkhart and documentary filmmaker Eddie Rosenstein.\n\nPlaywright Sarah Schulman alleged that \"Rent\" bore striking similarities to her novel \"People in Trouble\".\n\nThe line, \"I'm more of a man than you'll ever be... and more of a woman than you'll ever get!\", attributed to Angel Dumott Schunard at her funeral, was previously used by the character Hollywood Montrose, who appeared in the films \"Mannequin\" (1987) and \"\" (1991). Like Angel, Hollywood performs a song and dance number and sometimes wears women's clothing. This line was originally in the film \"Car Wash\" (1976), delivered by Antonio Fargas as a flamboyant homosexual cross dresser.\n\nThe earliest concepts of the characters differ largely from the finished products. Everyone except Mark had AIDS, including Maureen and Joanne; Maureen was a serious, angry character who played off Oedipus in her performance piece instead of Hey Diddle Diddle; Mark was, at one point, a painter instead of a filmmaker; Roger was named Ralph and wrote musical plays; Angel was a jazz philosopher, while Collins was a street performer; Angel and Collins were both originally described as Caucasian; and Benny had a somewhat enlarged role in the story, taking part in songs like \"Real Estate\", which was later cut.\n\nMany actual locations and events are included in, or are the inspiration for, elements of the musical. Life Café, where the \"La Vie Bohème\" numbers are set, was an actual restaurant (closed 2013) on 10th Street and Avenue B in the East Village of New York City. The riot at the end of the first act is based on the East Village riot in 1988 that arose as a result of the city-imposed curfew in Tompkins Square Park.\n\n\"Will I?\", a song which takes place during a Life Support meeting and expresses the pain and fear of living a life with AIDS, was inspired by a real event. Larson attended a meeting of Friends in Deed, an organization that helps people deal with illness and grief, much like Life Support. After that first time, Larson attended the meetings regularly. During one meeting, a man stood up and said that he was not afraid of dying. He did say, however, that there was one thing of which he was afraid: Would he lose his dignity? From this question stemmed the first line of this song. The people present at the Life Support meeting in the show, such as Gordon, Ali and Pam, carry the names of Larson's friends who died. In the Broadway show, the names of the characters in that particular scene (they introduce themselves) were changed nightly to honor the friends of the cast members who were living with or have died from AIDS.\n\nThe scene and song \"Life Support\" were also based on Friends in Deed, as well as on Gordon, Pam, and Ali. Originally, the members of Life Support had a solid block of the \"forget regret\" refrain, and they talked about remembering love. When Jonathan's HIV positive friends heard this scene, they told him that having AIDS was not so easy to accept: it made you angry and resentful too, and the song did not match that. Jonathan then added a part where Gordon says that he has a problem with this \"credo...my T-cells are low, I regret that news, okay?\" Paul, the leader of the meeting, replies, \"Okay...but, Gordon, how do you feel today?\" Gordon admits that he is feeling the best that he has felt all year. Paul asks, \"Then why choose fear?\" Gordon says, \"I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life.\"\n\nLynn Thomson was a dramaturg who was hired by New York Theatre Workshop to help rework \"Rent\". She claimed that between early May and the end of October 1995, she and Larson co-wrote a \"new version\" of the musical. She sued the Larson estate for US$ 40 million and sought 16% of the show's royalties, claiming she had written a significant portion of the lyrics and the libretto of the \"new version\" of \"Rent\".\n\nDuring the trial, Thomson could not recall the lyrics to the songs that she allegedly wrote, nor the structures of the libretto she claimed to have created. The judge ruled against her and gave the Jonathan Larson Estate full credit and right to \"Rent\". A federal appellate court upheld the original ruling on appeal. In August 1998, the case was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nOn Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates—Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician—struggle to stay warm and produce their art (\"Tune Up #1\"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him (\"Voice Mail #1\"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power (\"Tune Up #2\"). However, Mark and Roger rebel and resolve not to pay the rent they cannot pay and which they were promised wouldn't be a problem (\"Rent\"). Meanwhile, Angel, a cross-dressing street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him (\"You Okay Honey?\") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, both learning that the other is HIV positive. It is revealed that Roger too has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed suicide after learning of her diagnosis, which has caused Roger to fall into depression. Mark goes to see one of Maureen's shows while Roger stays home (\"Tune Up #3\"), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies (\"One Song Glory\"). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections (\"Light My Candle\"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents (\"Voice Mail #2\").\n\nAt last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in full drag and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it (\"Today 4 U\"). Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves (\"You'll See\"). Mark leaves to fix Maureen's sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's promiscuous behaviors (\"Tango: Maureen\"). Mark joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting (\"Life Support\"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment (\"Out Tonight\"). Roger is extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, demanding she leave him alone and resisting any romantic feelings he may harbor for her (\"Another Day\"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts (\"Will I\").\n\nCollins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment, but she chastises them (\"On the Street\"). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe (\"Santa Fe\"). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger and while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other (\"I'll Cover You\"). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance all of the people calling her at once (\"We're Okay\"). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest (\"Christmas Bells\"). Maureen begins her avant-garde, if not over the top, performance based on \"Hey Diddle Diddle\" (\"Over the Moon\"). At the post-show party at the Life Café, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's bohemian lifestyle. In response, Mark and all the café's bohemian patrons defiantly rise up to celebrate their way of living (\"La Vie Bohème\"). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to move forward with their relationship (\"I Should Tell You\"). Joanne explains that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware, share their first kiss. The celebration continues (\"La Vie Bohème B\").\n\nThe cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life \"in love\" (\"Seasons of Love\"). Afterwards, Mark and Roger gather to break back into their locked apartment with their friends (\"Happy New Year\"). A new voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #3\"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix (\"Happy New Year B\").\n\nAround Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, but they are tentative with each other. It is also told that Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest, and during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's controlling behavior and Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuous mannerisms. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum (\"Take Me or Leave Me\"). Time progresses to spring (\"Seasons of Love B\"), but Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating heroin usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS (\"Without You\"). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #4\"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives (\"Contact\"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories with Collins being the last to reminisce (\"I'll Cover You [Reprise]\"). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer (\"Halloween\"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and between Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group shares a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will be breaking up. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, and so Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes angry with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhears everything Roger says, and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab (\"Goodbye Love\"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks; Collins accepts, causing him and Collins to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark has to turn down the offer due to work commitments.\n\nSome time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic epiphany, as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film (\"What You Own\"). The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their phones (\"Voice Mail #5\"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him (\"Finale\"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her (\"Your Eyes\"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is \"no day but today\" (\"Finale B\").\n\n\nThere are also many other non-named roles such as Cops, Bohemians, Vendors, Homeless People.\n\n\"Rent\" received several awards including a Pulitzer Prize and four Tony Awards.\n\nCritical reception of \"Rent\" was positive not only for its acting and musical components, but for its representation of HIV-positive individuals. Many critics praised the portrayal of characters such as Angel and Collins as being happy, with positive outlooks on life, rather than being resigned to death. While critics and theatre patrons had largely positive reviews of the show, criticism was given to the show for the stereotypically negative portrayal of lesbian characters and the \"glamourization\" of the East Village in the late 1980s.\n\nBilly Aronson said, \"For the record, although I was ambivalent about Jonathan’s ideas for \"Rent\" when we were working together on it, I have come to love the show. And as tragic as it is that he didn’t live to see his work become a huge success, I believe he knew it would be. In our last conversation I asked how the show was going and he said, with complete assurance, that it was incredible.\"\n\nThe song \"Seasons of Love\" became a successful pop song and often is performed on its own. Because of its connection to New Years and looking back at times past, it is sometimes performed at graduations or school holiday programs.\n\n\"Rent\" gathered a following of fans who refer to themselves as \"RENT-heads.\" The name originally referred to people who would camp out at the Nederlander Theater for hours in advance for the discounted $20 rush tickets to each show, though it generally refers to anyone who is obsessed with the show. These discounted tickets were for seats in the first two rows of the theater reserved for sale by lottery two hours prior to each show. Other Broadway shows have followed \"Rent\"s example and now also offer cheaper tickets in efforts to make Broadway theater accessible to people who would otherwise be unable to afford the ticket prices.\n\nThe term originated in \"Rent\"s first months on Broadway. The show's producers offered 34 seats in the front two rows of the orchestra for $20 each, two hours before the performance. Fans and others interested in tickets would camp out for hours in front of the Nederlander Theater – which is on 41st Street, just outside Times Square – to buy these tickets.\n\nThe television series \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\", \"Friends\", \"Will and Grace\", \"Scrubs\", \"Glee\", \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"Gilmore Girls\", \"Felicity\", \"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Office\", \"Franklin & Bash\", \"2 Broke Girls\", \"Girls\", \"Seinfeld\", \"The Neighbors\", \"Modern Family\", \"Smash\", \"Supernatural\", \"Superstore\", and \"Bob's Burgers\" have included references to the show.\n\nThe film \"\" includes a character who plays a lead role in \"Lease\", a Broadway musical parody of \"Rent\"; the finale song is \"Everyone has AIDS!\". \n\nYitzhak in \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\" wears a \"Rent\" T-shirt and speaks of his aspiration to play the role of Angel.\nThe off-Broadway musical revue \"Forbidden Broadway Strikes Back\" includes parodies of \"Rent\" songs such as \"Rant\" (\"Rent\"), \"Ouch! They're Tight\" (\"Out Tonight\"), \"Season of Hype\" (\"Seasons of Love\"), \"Too Gay 4 U (Too Het'ro 4 Me)\" (\"Today 4 U\"), \"Pretty Voices Singing\" (\"Christmas Bells\") and \"This Ain't Boheme\" (\"La Vie Bohème\").\n\nIn the film \"Deadpool\", Wade Wilson is seen wearing a \"Rent\" T-shirt. Stan Lee also referenced one of the songs (\"Cover you\") when he said as the Dj in the strip club \"You can't buy love..\" - \"but you can rent it... \" \n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, the composer and writer of the Broadway show \"Hamilton\", has cited \"Rent\" as a main source of inspiration. He also referenced the show in a verse of the song \"Wrote My Way Out\" on \"The Hamilton Mixtape\" in the line \"Running out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check\".\n\n\"Rent\" had its first staged reading at New York Theatre Workshop in March 1993. A further two-week New York Theatre Workshop version was performed in 1994 starring Anthony Rapp as Mark and Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and more workshops followed. The show opened on 1996, again at New York Theatre Workshop, and quickly gained popularity off-Broadway, receiving enthusiastic reviews. \"The New York Times\" theater critic Ben Brantley called it an \"exhilarating, landmark rock opera\" with a \"glittering, inventive score\" that \"shimmers with hope for the future of the American musical.\" Another reviewer wrote, \"\"Rent\" speaks to Generation X the way that the musical \"Hair\" spoke to the baby boomers or those who grew up in the 1960s,\" while the \"New York Times\" similarly called it \"a rock opera for our time, a \"Hair\" for the 90s.\" The show proved extremely successful off-Broadway, selling out all of its performances at the 150-seat theatre.\n\nDue to its overwhelming popularity and the need for a larger theater, \"Rent\" moved to Broadway's previously derelict Nederlander Theatre on 41st Street on April 29, 1996. On Broadway, the show achieved critical acclaim and word-of-mouth popularity. The production's ethnically diverse principal cast originally included Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker.\n\nThe production's controversial topics and innovative pricing, including same day-of-performance $20 tickets, helped to increase the popularity of musical theater amongst the younger generation. The production was nominated for ten Tony Awards in 1996 and won four: Best Musical, Best Book, Best Original Score and Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Heredia)\n\nOn April 24, 2006, the original Broadway cast reunited for a one-night performance of the musical at the Nederlander Theatre. This performance raised over $2,000,000 for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation, Friends In Deed and New York Theatre Workshop. Former cast members were invited, and many from prior tours and former Broadway casts appeared, performing an alternate version of \"Seasons of Love\" as the finale of the performance.\n\n\"Rent\" closed on September 7, 2008, after a 12-year run and 5,123 performances, making it the eleventh-longest-running Broadway show. The production grossed over $280 million.\n\nOriginal cast ensemble members Rodney Hicks and Gwen Stewart returned to the cast at the time of the Broadway closing. Hicks played Benny and Stewart played the role she created, the soloist in the song \"Seasons of Love\". In addition, actress Tracie Thoms joined the cast at the end of the run playing Joanne, the role she portrayed in the 2005 film version. The last Broadway performance was filmed and screened in movie theaters as \"Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway\" in September 2008. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on February 3, 2009.\n\nSuccessful United States national tours, the \"Angel Tour\" and the \"Benny Tour\", launched in the 1990s. Later, the non-Equity tour started its run. There was also a Canadian tour (often referred to as the \"Collins Tour\").\n\nThe Angel tour began in November 1996 in Boston. Anthony Rapp joined the cast for the Chicago run, and Daphne Rubin-Vega joined for the Los Angeles run. The tour finished in San Francisco in September 1999. Other members of the Angel Cast included Carrie Hamilton, Amy Spanger, Luther Creek, Kristoffer Cusick, Tony Vincent.\n\nThe Benny Tour began in July 1997 in San Diego, CA at the LaJolla Playhouse. Michael Grief, the original director of the Broadway show was also the artistic director of the LaJolla Playhouse and was instrumental in arranging for the Benny tour to begin in the smaller city of San Diego rather than Los Angeles, CA. It originally featured Neil Patrick Harris in the role of Mark Cohen. The Benny tour generally played shorter stops and often-smaller markets than the Angel Tour did. Other cast members included Wilson Cruz and d'Monroe.\n\nTours ran each season from 2005 to 2008. Cast members throughout the run included Aaron Tveit, Ava Gaudet, Declan Bennett, Rebecca Naomi Jones, Constantine Maroulis, Dan Rosenbaum, Heinz Winckler, Anwar Robinson and Karen Olivo. In 2009, a national tour starring Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp, reprising their original Broadway roles, launched in Cleveland, OH. Original Broadway Cast member Gwen Steward also appeared, alongside Michael McElroy as Collins, The tour ended on February 7, 2010, in Sacramento, CA. A 20th Anniversary touring production of \"Rent\" began in Dallas on September 20, 2016.\n\nThe show made its UK premiere on April 21, 1998, at the West End's Shaftesbury Theatre and officially opened on May 12, 1998. The original cast included Krysten Cummings as Mimi Marquez, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Schunard, Bonny Lockhart as Benjamin Coffin III, Jesse L. Martin as Tom Collins, Adam Pascal as Roger Davis, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, and Jessica Tezier as Maureen Johnson. The show closed on October 30, 1999, after one-and-a-half years. Limited revivals took place at the Prince of Wales Theatre from December 4, 2001, to January 6, 2002; December 6, 2002, to March 1, 2003 (featuring Adam Rickett as Mark and Caprice as Maureen). There was also a successful production for a limited run in Manchester in 2006 with an additional 'goodbye' performance in 2008 from the Manchester cast.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, the heavily revised production titled \"Rent Remixed\" opened at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End. Directed by William Baker, it was set in the present day. The cast included Oliver Thornton (Mark), Luke Evans (Roger), Craig Stein (Benny), Leon Lopez (Collins), Francesca Jackson (Joanne), Jay Webb (Angel), Siobhán Donaghy (Mimi), and Denise Van Outen (Maureen). From December 24, 2007, the role of Maureen was played by Jessie Wallace. The production received generally unfavorable reviews. The Guardian gave it only one out of five stars, writing, \"They call this 'Rent Remixed'. I'd dub it 'Rent Reduced', in that the late Jonathan Larson's reworking of La Bohème, while never a great musical, has been turned into a grisly, synthetic, pseudo pop concert with no particular roots or identity.\" The production closed on February 2, 2008.\n\nThe production radically altered elements of the musical including defining the characters of Mimi, Angel and Mark as British. Songs were reordered (including Maureen's first appearance as the Act I finale). The rehaul of the score was masterminded by Steve Anderson and featured radically rearranged versions of Out Tonight, Today 4 U, Over the Moon and Happy New Year.\n\nA one-off Rent - The 20th Anniversary Concert was held at the Blackpool Opera house Monday November 11, 2013 \nA 20th anniversary tour opened at Theatr Clwyd in October 2016 before playing a two-month run at the St James Theatre, London. The cast included Layton Williams as Angel and Lucie Jones as Maureen. The production then continued to tour the UK.\n\nIn 2018 an immersive production of RENT premiered at Frogmore Paper Mill in Apsley, Hemel Hempstead. The Cast included Aran Macrae (Roger), Connor Dyer (Mark) and Lizzie Emery (Mimi). The show opened on July 10, 2018, and ran until July 28th.\n\nThe show was revived Off-Broadway at Stage 1 of New World Stages with previews starting July 14, 2011 and a scheduled opening of August 11, 2011. This was the first New York Revival of the show since the original production closed less than three years earlier. The production was directed by \"Rent\"'s original director Michael Greif. Almost the entire show was different from the original yet the reinvention did not please the critics, who complained that the new actors did not have a feel for the characters they were playing and it made the show feel contrived. The Off-Broadway production of RENT closed on September 9, 2012.\n\nIn 1999, an Australian production featured Justin Smith as Mark, Rodger Corser as Roger and Christine Anu as Mimi. The tour began in Sydney and finished in Melbourne. A production in Perth, Western Australia was mounted in 2007 and featured Anthony Callea as Mark, Tim Campbell as Roger, Courtney Act as Angel and Nikki Webster as Maureen.\n\nThe Dublin production had an extended run at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin in 2000. It starred Sean Pol McGreevy as Mark, Rachel Tucker as Maureen and Allyson Brown as Mimi under the direction of Phil Willmot. The Swedish production premiered on May 15, 2002 at The Göteborg Opera in Gothenburg, Sweden, playing until June 8, 2003. Sarah Dawn Finer played Joanne.\n\n\"Rent\" veteran Neil Patrick Harris directed a production at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, CA. The production played a three night engagement, August 6–8, 2010. The cast included Vanessa Hudgens as Mimi, Aaron Tveit as Roger, Skylar Astin as Mark, Wayne Brady as Collins, Telly Leung as Angel, Tracie Thoms as Joanne, Nicole Scherzinger as Maureen, Collins Pennie as Benny, and Gwen Stewart as Seasons of Love soloist (and additional roles).\n\nIn 2017, the first tour for the German speaking countries was mounted by Berlin theatrical producer . The production travelled Germany, Austria and Switzerland and was directed by the British opera director Walter Sutcliffe.\n\nIn 2007, an abridged edition of \"Rent\" was made available to five non-professional acting groups in the United States for production. Billed as , this version omits the song \"Contact\" and eliminates some of the coarse language and tones down some public displays of affection of the original. Shorewood High School in Shorewood, WI became the first high school to perform an early version of the adaptation in May 2006. The high school was selected to present a workshop performance as part of Music Theatre International's work to adapt the musical for younger actors and potentially more conservative audiences. As of 2008, Music Theatre International began licensing \"Rent School Edition\" for performances by schools and non-professional amateur theaters in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"Rent\" has been performed in countries around the world, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Greece, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, South Africa, Australia, Guam, New Zealand, Israel, Puerto Rico, Austria, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Dominican Republic, Cuba and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe musical has been performed in twenty-five languages: Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Dutch, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, Polish, Slovak, Greek, Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, Czech, and Catalan.\n\nA cast recording of the original Broadway cast recording was released in 1996; it features all the music of the show on a double-disc \"complete recording\" collection along with a remixed version of the song \"Seasons of Love\" featuring Stevie Wonder. The label later issued a single-disc \"best of\" highlights from the show.\n\nThe later 2005 film version (see below) also resulted in a double-disc cast recording of the complete score used in the movie and a single CD of highlights. There are also many foreign cast recordings of international productions of the show.\n\nIn 2005, \"Rent\" was adapted into a movie directed by Chris Columbus with a screenplay by Stephen Chbosky. With the exception of Daphne Rubin-Vega (who was pregnant at the time of filming) and Fredi Walker (who felt she was too old for her role), who played Mimi and Joanne respectively in the original Broadway cast, the original Broadway cast members reprised the principal roles. Released on November 23, 2005, the film remained in the box office top ten for three weeks, receiving mixed reviews. Several plot elements were changed slightly, and some songs were changed to spoken dialogue or cut entirely for the film. The soundtrack was produced by Rob Cavallo, engineered by Doug McKean and features renowned session musicians Jamie Muhoberac, Tim Pierce and Dorian Crozier.\n\nThe final performance of the Broadway production of \"Rent\", which took place on September 7th 2008, was filmed live and, cut together with close-up footage from a day of filming in August of the same year, released as \"Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway\" in cinemas with high definition digital projection systems in the U.S. and Canada between September 24 and 28, 2008. \"Rent: Filmed Live\" on Broadway was released on February 3, 2009 on DVD & Blu-ray formats.\n\nFilmmaker and \"Rent\" alum Andy Señor, Jr. is currently producing a documentary, following his journey producing the musical in Cuba in late 2014.

Marc Platt is set to serve as executive producer along with the estate of Jonathan Larson.\n\n"}
{"id": "1115082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115082", "title": "Ruth Snyder", "text": "Ruth Snyder\n\nRuth Brown Snyder (March 27, 1895 – January 12, 1928) was an American murderer. Her execution in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison for the murder of her husband, Albert, was recorded in a well-publicized photograph.\n\nIn 1925, Snyder was a housewife from Queens Village, Queens, New York City who began an affair with Henry Judd Gray, a married corset salesman. She then began to plan the murder of her husband, enlisting the help of her new lover, though he appeared to be very reluctant. Her distaste for her husband apparently began when he insisted on hanging a picture of his late fiancée, Jessie Guischard, on the wall of their first home, and named his boat after her. Guischard, whom Albert described to Ruth as \"the finest woman I have ever met,\" had been dead for ten years.\n\nRuth Snyder first persuaded her husband to purchase insurance, and, with the assistance of an insurance agent (who was subsequently fired and sent to prison for forgery) \"signed\" a $48,000 life insurance policy that paid extra (\"double indemnity\") if an unexpected act of violence killed the victim. According to Henry Judd Gray, Ruth had made at least seven attempts to kill her husband, all of which he survived. On March 20, 1927, the couple garrotted Albert Snyder and stuffed his nose full of chloroform-soaked rags, then staged his death as part of a burglary. Detectives at the scene noted that the burglar left little evidence of breaking into the house. Moreover, the behavior of Mrs. Snyder was inconsistent with her story of a terrorized wife witnessing her husband being killed.\n\nThe police then found the property that Ruth claimed had been stolen. It was still in the house, but hidden. A breakthrough came when a detective found a paper with the letters \"J.G.\" on it (it was a memento Albert Snyder had kept from former lover Jessie Guischard), and asked Ruth about it. A flustered Ruth's mind immediately turned to her lover, whose initials were also \"J.G.,\" and she asked the detective what Gray had to do with this. It was the first time Gray had been mentioned, and the police were instantly suspicious. Gray was found upstate, in Syracuse. He claimed he had been there all night, but eventually it turned out a friend of his had created an alibi, setting up Gray's room at a hotel. Gray proved far more forthcoming than Ruth about his actions. He was caught and returned to Jamaica, Queens and charged along with Ruth Snyder. Dorothy Parker told Oscar Levant, an American in Paris, that Gray tried to escape the police by taking a taxi from Long Island to Manhattan, New York, which Levant noted was \"quite a long trip.\" According to Parker, in order \"not to attract attention, he gave the driver a ten-cent tip.\"\n\nSnyder was imprisoned at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York, about 30 miles north of New York City. Her prison cell there would in the future also be used to hold Eva Coo and \"Lonely Hearts killer\" Martha Beck.\n\nThe trial at the Long Island City Courthouse was covered by such figures as Peggy Hopkins Joyce, Mary Roberts Rinehart, Aimee Semple McPherson, D. W. Griffith, Damon Runyon, Will Durant, James M. Cain (crime reporter who wrote the novella that became the movie, \"Double Indemnity\") and, a year before her own death from cancer, Nora Bayes. Runyon disparaged the crime's status as a clever attempt at a murder—he nicknamed it \"the dumb-bell murder case\" because \"it was so dumb!\"\n\nRuth Snyder and Gray turned on each other, contending the other was responsible for killing Albert Snyder; both were convicted and sentenced to death.\n\nOn January 12, 1928, Snyder became the first woman to be executed in Sing Sing since 1899. She went to the electric chair only moments before her former lover. Her execution (by New York State Electrician Robert G. Elliott) was caught on film, by a photograph of her as the electricity was running through her body, with the aid of a miniature plate camera custom-strapped to the ankle of Tom Howard, a \"Chicago Tribune\" photographer working in cooperation with the \"Tribune\"-owned \"New York Daily News\". Howard's camera was owned for a while by inventor Miller Reese Hutchison, and later became part of the collections of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.\n\nSnyder was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Her gravestone simply reads \"Brown\".\n\nAlbert and Ruth had one child, a daughter named Lorraine, who was nine at the time of her father's murder. Following the pronouncement of the death sentence on her mother in May 1927, legal disputes arose between the relatives of both Albert and Ruth Snyder regarding the care of Lorraine. Warren Schneider, brother of Albert Snyder, petitioned to be allowed to appoint a legal guardian who was not a member of Ruth Snyder's family. Josephine Brown, mother of Ruth Snyder, also petitioned for custody of the girl. Lorraine had been in the care of Mrs. Brown since the murder. Lorraine was formally placed by her maternal grandmother in the Catholic institution where she had been residing at the time of her mother's execution. Ruth requested that her daughter not be brought to the prison for a final visit.\n\nOn September 7, 1927, Josephine Brown was awarded guardianship of the girl. During this time, there were disputes with the insurance company Ruth Snyder had used to insure her husband's life. Although one policy, worth US$30,000, was paid out without contest, they filed suit to void two other policies, worth $45,000 and $5,000 (the three combined policies worth $ million today). By May 1928, the insurance company made available $4,000 for the maintenance of Lorraine. In November 1928 a ruling in the case was reached, with a court finding the policies could not be collected as they had been issued fraudulently. At the time of the judgment, the lawyer acting on behalf of Snyder and Brown asked the court to allow them to appeal without a printed record, on the basis that the family was destitute and unable to sell the house due to the notoriety of the case. By May 1930 it was finally ruled on appeal that the two policies were invalid.\n\nDuring her time on death row, Ruth Snyder wrote a sealed letter to be given to Lorraine \"when she is old enough to understand\". One year after her mother's execution, Lorraine was apparently aware that her parents were both dead, but not of the manner of either of their deaths.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company was founded by Walter A. Sheaffer in Fort Madison, Iowa, and incorporated in 1913 to exploit his invention of a lever-filling fountain pen. The brand was sold by French parent company Bic to A. T. Cross Company in August, 2014.\n\nIn 1912, Walter A. Sheaffer took his idea of a pen-filling apparatus that utilized a lever system and, with his life savings, founded the W.A. Sheaffer Pen Company in Fort Madison, Iowa. The company was established in the backroom of Mr. Sheaffer's jewelry store with seven employees, and was incorporated a year later, in 1913. By the 1930s, Sheaffer fountain pens were being advertised as the pen that \"fills instantly from any ink-well, with one touch of a finger. Cleans automatically when filling.\"\n\nSheaffer has manufactured fountain pens down to the present day. The original lever-filler mechanism remained in use through the end of the 1940s, though a sacless plunger design was introduced in the early 1930s.\n\nIn 1949 Sheaffer adopted the \"Touchdown\" pneumatic-filling mechanism for its top-line fountain pens. A development of the Touchdown design was the Snorkel, which added a small extendable tube underneath the nib to avoid the need to dip the nib into ink when operating the filler plunger. The last Snorkel pen was the oversize \"Pen For Men (PFM),\" a fat-bodied model introduced in 1959 with the then-new \"Inlaid Nib\" which has since featured on all Sheaffer's high-end pens.\n\nAll Sheaffer pens after 1959 (excluding the PFM) were designed to accept either ink cartridges or a converter to allow the use of bottled ink. The Targa was a popular high-end model which was introduced in 1976 and came in over 80 different finishes and two sizes (classic and slim). The still very popular Connoisseur was introduced in 1986 as an upgraded version of the low cost No-Nonsense line that paid homage to earlier Sheaffer flat-tops, and included the high end Grande series, and three series of Levenger Connoisseur's that were dual branded and sold by Levenger. Another popular Sheaffer fountain pen was the low-cost \"School Pen\". Current high-end pens in the range include the Valor and the Legacy series, all of which retain the inlaid nib.\n\nOn July 31, 1997, Société Bic S.A., known for its Bic pens and lighters, agreed to buy Sheaffer for less than $50 million. Bic, of France, bought Sheaffer from Gefinor S.A., a Geneva-based investment bank, according to Thierry Michels, communications director at Bic. Michels said Bic paid less than the $50 million that Sheaffer had achieved in current annual sales. At the time of the Bic purchase, Sheaffer had 550 employees, 450 of whom were based in North America.\n\nIn 2003, corporate officials announced their intention of closing Sheaffer's Fort Madison, Iowa, plant after nearly a century of making pens in the southeastern Iowa city. At its peak, the company employed more than 1,000 people in Fort Madison. The shutdown of the factory was completed by the end of March 2008, affecting about 40 workers. Sheaffer's fountain pen point assembly department was moved to a third-party manufacturer in China. Customer service, purchasing, information technology, warehousing and distribution operations, packaging, and quality control were relocated to Slovakia.\n\nBought by BIC in 1997, Sheaffer was sold in August 2014 to the A. T. Cross Company for $15 million (US).\n\nSheaffer currently manufactures thirteen models of luxury writing instruments, including: Taranis, Legacy Heritage, Prelude, Prelude Mini, Sagaris, Intensity, 500, 300, 200, 100, Stylus, Sentinel, and VFM. As well as writing instruments, Sheaffer also manufactures leather pen pouches and tablet holders, two calligraphy sets, three types of pencil erasers, ballpoint and rollerball refills, stylus refills, Sheaffer converters, eight colors of Skrip bottled ink, Sheaffer Skrip cartridges, and Skrip universal cartridges.\n\nIn 2013, Sheaffer launched the Ferrari collection luxury writing instruments.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13727892", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13727892", "title": "Skull art", "text": "Skull art\n\nIndigenous Mexican art celebrates the skeleton and uses it as a regular motif. The use of skulls and skeletons in art originated before the Conquest: The Aztecs excelled in stone sculptures and created striking carvings of their Gods. Coatlicue, the Goddess of earth and death, was portrayed with a necklace of human hearts, hands and a skull pendant. She was imbued with the drama and grandeur necessary to dazzle the subject people and to convey the image of an implacable state. The worship of death involved worship of life, while the skull – symbol of death – was a promise to resurrection. The Aztecs carved skulls in monoliths of lava, and made masks of obsidian and jade. Furthermore, the skull motif was used in decoration. They were molded on pots, traced on scrolls, woven into garments, and formalized into hieroglyphs.\n\nWhen the Spanish invaded and conquered Tenochtitlan in the sixteenth century, they imposed the Catholic religion and Spanish folk-practices of the era. This included the pagan tradition of celebrating the dead with food-offerings and feasts. However, the Spanish priests were eager to discontinue these ancient traditions that found fertile ground in Mexico. The Spanish suppressed the Mexican skull art tradition because it was too \"Indito\" or pagan for their refined European tastes. Not until Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, did skull art begin to re-emerge as a symbol of \"Mexicanidad\".\n\nWhen Porfirio Díaz became president, he was burdened with a bankrupt economy. To help the economic situation in Mexico, Díaz encouraged foreign investments. Investors were pleased with Mexico's cheap labor force. The Mexican–Indian laborer worked under cruel conditions. José Guadalupe Posada, Mexican engraver, with his drawing criticized the conditions in Mexico.\nJose Guadalupe Posada is probably the most important Mexican artist of our times. During his lifetime, Posada was a witness to the crucial social and political changes which shaped Mexico into a modern nation. Changes such as the downfall of a dictator, a wide – spread social revolution, and the struggle for a power combined with the birth of a democratic process, all these experiences deeply influenced him. Through his work, he documented these occurrences and became a pictorial historian.\n\nPosada's drawings brought an awakening to the common man. He made those who could not read to understand what was happening in their country. Although the use of skulls and skeletons in art had been suppressed by foreign influences, it was still recognized among the poor in their celebrations of the Day of the Dead.\nUsing skull art was Posada's way to make a connection with the popular audience. Reproduced on box lids is his most famous engraving – la Calavera Catrina – which shows a fashionable lady in the guise of a skeleton. Diego Rivera called José Guadalupe Posada the greatest Mexican people's artist. From this influence, Rivera painted common people living and working in their environment. His work also carried a social message.\nPosada and Rivera deeply influenced the Jaliscano Jorge González Camarena, who disregarded the traditional methods and embraced the popular art of Posada and Rivera. Recurring battle scenes appear in González Camarena's work where Revolutionary soldiers become part of the ancient Mexican history as their lifeless bodies change into skeletons.\n\nFrida Kahlo was also the product of a bold and brilliant generation that looked back with devotion to its Mexican roots and valued the reality it found there, uncontaminated by foreign influence. She admitted having a great deal of admiration for her husband's work, as well as that of Jose Guadalupe Posada and she found great beauty in the highly developed pre-Conquest indigenous art.\n\nFrida was claimed early on by André Breton and the Surrealists as one of their own, and for a time she did not mind to be caught up and identified with the chic vanguard movement. But, later she declared herself not one of them because she said \"I painted dreams, I painted my own reality.\" In the 1940s she painted \"The Dream,\" where a conscious skeleton floats above the sleeping Frida. The Mexican brujos say \"to live is to sleep and to die is to awaken.\" For Frida, perhaps, death like dreams exists in parallel.\nWhile Frida's work focused on \"Mexicanidad\", Chucho Reyes integrated European fine art styles with the essence of the popular Mexican skull art. Perhaps his art was politically unpopular for those who chose to disregard foreign influences. However, Reye's unconventional combination was most likely influenced by his eccentric father who, although devoutly Catholic, practiced brujeria. He slept in a bed where roosters were tied to each bedpost and a large eye was painted above his bed on the ceiling. This mixture of European religious beliefs with Mexican witchcraft was what most likely inspired Reyes to combine different artistic styles. Art like this will take quite a while to master\n\nAlthough modernly the ancient Aztec religious traditions that have remained are called brujeria by those who practice European religions, in Oaxaca – superstitions and saints are spoken in the same breath.\n\nRufino Tamayo founded the Oaxacan school of painting on the principle that although painting must take place on the plastic level, it does not exclude the possibility that the work contain a profound consequence not altogether expressed. Tamayo seemed to strip away man's external self, found for instance in religion, in order to examine man's fundamental fears. His fear of nature, of the cosmos, and above everything else, man's fear of himself. The subtle and rich art of pre-Columbian times greatly inspired Tamayo. From this influence he painted man as a transparent flesh existing on a living skeleton.\n\nOn the other hand, Francisco Toledo painted his subjects as if they were x-rays. Salacious curiosity with the inner being becomes almost pornographic as his erotic and irreverent resurgence of Skull Art comes forward.\n\nWhile Rufino Tamayo founded the Oaxacan School, it was Rodolfo Nieto who defined it. Rodolfo added a dramatic tone to skull art. Using light colors fixed against dark hues, he showed the continual battle of life and death. With gaiety, humor, whimsies, and boyhood stories of Tarzan the Ape Man fighting the perils of the jungle, Rodolfo laughed at death while living in the shadows of his own deepening depression. Flashes of light confused by color, juxtaposed against the stark black canvasses, he did not attempt to define human existence, but just to live it, knowing that the skull was always within him. His painter wife Nancy Nieto removed the fleshy mask of life in order to examine the basis of life, the skull and skeleton... \n\nOften Chicano or Mexican American artists turn to their history, recently and notably Nancy Nieto brings a bold resurgence to the ancient tradition of Mexican skull art. Woven into a veil of rich colors and unconventional forms, adopted from the Oaxacan School, her work removes the veil of mystery the mystery of life only to reveal the mystery of death. She shows depths of mystery yet has a harmonious eurhythmic note of the epic origins of the chromatic Oaxaca. She struggles to re-address Francisco Toledo's erotic themes, and to step away from Rodolfo Nieto's dramatic tomes. Her work renews the Aztec view of death as a transitional cycle between the individual life and the ubiquitous \"to be\".\n\nRodolfo Nieto: Bestiario.

{"id": "227135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=227135", "title": "Stage combat", "text": "Stage combat\n\nStage combat or fight choreography is a specialised technique in theatre designed to create the illusion of physical combat without causing harm to the performers. It is employed in live stage plays as well as operatic and ballet productions. With the advent of cinema and television the term has widened to also include the choreography of filmed fighting sequences, as opposed to the earlier live performances on stage. It is closely related to the practice of stunts and is a common field of study for actors. Actors famous for their stage fighting skills frequently have backgrounds in dance or martial arts training.\n\nThe history of stage fighting and mock combat can be traced to antiquity, with Aristotle quoted as noting that tragedy is conflict between people or indeed it may be traced to the origins of the human species and primate display behaviour. Display of martial aptitude is a natural occurrence in warrior societies, and ritualized forms of mock combat often evolve into war dances. Whether it is the struggle between the men and women of Aristophanes' Lysistrata in Ancient Greece or Ancient Egypt where Herodotus in his Histories talks about a religious festival in which they beat each other with staves but no one dies, staged combat has always existed. As it doesn't make sense to sacrifice citizens in rituals, many ancient civilizations turned to symbolic gestures of combat through dancing or bringing a weapon to someone's throat or neck without actually touching them to symbolize death or an act of violence.\n\nFights staged for entertainment may also be in earnest for the combatants, as was the case with the Roman gladiators, and any public duel, such as the judicial duel of the European Middle Ages. The medieval tournament and joust are a classical examples of competitive ritualised mock combat. The joust from the time of Maximilian I developed into a sport with enormous cost involved for each knight and correspondingly high prestige attached, comparable to contemporary Formula One races, while at the same time minimizing the danger of injury with highly specialized equipment.\n\nIn the Late Middle Ages, staged fencing bouts, with or without choreography, became popular with fencing schools. Some German fechtbuch (\"combat manuals\", literally 'fight' or 'fence book') have sections dedicated to flamboyant techniques to be employed in such \"Klopffechten\" (\"knockabout fighting\"), which would be impractical in serious combat, and the Late Medieval German masters distinguish mock fights (\"fechten zu schimpf\", 'rant fighting') and real combat (\"fechten zu ernst\", 'earnest fighting').\n\nThe history of European theatrical combat has its roots in medieval theatre, and becomes tangible in Elizabethan drama. Richard Tarleton, who was a member of both William Shakespeare's acting company and of the London Masters of Defence weapons guild, was among the first fight directors in the modern sense. Sword duels depicted in plays showed how popular the pastime was in actual life. Before 1615 in England, many plays featured duels and the duels were regarded as highlights of the show. As opposed to after 1615, when dueling was publicly condemned by King James and the duels were used as a last resort in regards to the plot.\n\nDuring the late 17th and early 18th centuries, stylized stage combat has been a staple feature of traditional performing arts for centuries, such as in Japanese \"Kabuki\" theater (as \"tachimawari\" \"fighting scenes\"), Chinese Beijing Opera and Indian theater.\n\nFencing masters in Europe began to research and experiment with historical fencing techniques, with weapons such as the two-handed sword, rapier and smallsword, and to instruct actors in their use. Notable amongst these were George Dubois, a Parisian fight director and martial artist who created performance fencing styles based on gladiatorial combat as well as Renaissance rapier and dagger fencing. Egerton Castle and Captain Alfred Hutton of London were also involved both in reviving antique fencing systems and in teaching these styles to actors.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, scenes of swordplay in touring theatrical productions throughout Europe, the British Commonwealth and the USA were typically created by combining several widely known, generic routines known as \"standard combats\", identified by names such as the \"Round Eights\" and the \"Glasgow Tens\".\n\nCinematic fencing has its roots in the 1920s, with the movies of Douglas Fairbanks. One of the more celebrated fight directors who emerged in this time was Paddy Crean who revolutionized stage combat, specifically sword play, for the silver screen and theater. Paddy created the flamboyant style of sword play that can be seen in Errol Flynn movies, among others. He promoted the use of safety above all things and then focused on story of the fight. B. H. Barry and J. Allen Suddeth, students of Paddy Crean, are two fight masters who have continued developing Paddy's legacy. Barry helped found the Society of British Fight Directors and then came to the United States to give fight direction a more specific shape. J. Allen Suddeth founded the National Fight Directors Training Program in the United States and wrote the book \"Fight Direction for the Theater\" (1996). Martial arts movies emerge as a distinct genre from the 1940s, popularized by Bruce Lee and Sonny Chiba from the 1960s.\n\nInformal guilds of fight choreographers began to take shape in the 1970s with the establishment of The Society of British Fight Directors, 1969 to 1996. Training was established in the United States with the formation of the Society of American Fight Directors in 1977.\n\nFollowing this, further academies and associations worldwide have been established to uphold the craft, training and quality of work in the art-form of stage combat nationally and internationally, including: The British Academy Of Stage & Screen Combat (BASSC) and Fight Directors Canada (FDC) in 1993; the Society of Australian Fight Directors Inc. (SAFDi) in 1994; the Nordic Stage Fight Society (NSFS) and the New Zealand Stage Combat Society in 1995; the British Academy of Dramatic Combat (BADC) in 1996; Art of Combat in 1997; Stage Combat Deutschland in 2004; and the Australian Stage Combat Association (ASCA) in 2010; The British Guild of Stage Combat in 2015. As of 2005, East 15 Acting School, London offered a B.A. (Hons) Degree in \"Acting & Stage Combat.\" Many of the societies offer certification programs for different weapons, which is used as an indicator about how much training an actor has had.\n\nStage combat training includes unarmed combat skills such as illusory slaps, punches, kicks, throwing and holding techniques; theatrical adaptations of various forms of fencing such as rapier and dagger, smallsword and broadsword, as well as the use of other weapons, notably the quarterstaff and knives; and more specialized skills such as professional wrestling and different styles of martial arts. However, stage combat can include any form of choreographed violence and the options are limited only by safety concerns, and the ability of the participants involved. As a note, most of these techniques are drawn from actual fighting techniques, but modified to be safer for actors. For example, although there are a number of ways of creating the safe illusion of a slap to the face (which is obviously something that could really be done in combat), none of these involve making actual contact with the victim's face.\n\nThe over-riding concern is for the safety of the actors and audience. This requirement has led to the adaptation of many standard martial arts and fencing skills specifically for performance. For example, many basic sword attacks and parries must be modified to ensure that the actors do not bring the points of their weapons past their partner's face or otherwise inadvertently risk the other actor's health and well-being. Attacking actions in stage combat are extended past the performance partner's body, or aimed short of their apparent targets. Likewise, whereas their characters may be trying to violently twist each other's limbs, slap, or punch, or grapple, and engaging in vicious unarmed combat, the actors must operate at a high level of complicity and communication to ensure a safe, exciting fight scene. In many forms of stage combat, distance is a key factor in technique. Many attacks are performed 'out of distance' so that there is no possible chance of one performer accidentally striking the other. Considerable professional judgement is called upon to determine what technical level may be appropriate for a given performer, taking into account allotted rehearsal time, and the expectations of the director.\n\nAnother important element of stage combat is sound. Sound increases the believability of an action for the audience. There are two kinds of sounds that can be made. One is vocal reactions. By adding a gasp, groan, or grunt when struck, the combatants make the moves come to life. The other kind of sound is a knap or a percussive sound made by hitting a resonant part of the body. This is timed to the moment an impact would happen and is staged so it is hidden from the audience. This allows the audience to believe that an actual blow or slap has landed because they hear a corresponding sound and see a reaction. \n\nThe combat phase of a play rehearsal is referred to as a \"fight rehearsal\". Choreography is typically learned step by step, and practiced at first very slowly before increasing to a speed that is both dramatically convincing and safe for the performers and their audience. Even stage combat is risky, and it is preferable for actors to have as much training and experience as possible. A \"fight call\" or a brief rehearsal before the show is performed each time, set aside for the actors to \"mark\" through the fight to increase their muscle memory. A show which involves fight choreography will typically be trained and supervised by a professional fight choreographer and may also include a \"fight captain\", who runs fight calls and ensures that actors are remaining safe throughout the duration of the show. \n\nThe fighting styles in movies set in the Medieval or Renaissance period may be unrealistic and historically inaccurate. Most fight choreographers use a mix between Asian martial arts and sports fencing to re-enact fight scenes. This generally due to the look of the fighting asked for by the director. If the director wants the story to flow a certain way, then the fight director will choreograph the fights to fit that style and tell the story.\n\nFor stage combat, all edges should be dulled and points blunted so that there is no risk of severe injury if someone is accidentally stabbed. In addition, weapons that are used, and not just for show, should be certified as combat-ready, thereby preventing any accidents involving blades accidentally breaking off.\nUsed in shows that are performed in large playing spaces due to the large size of the weapon. Most popular quarterstaff fight is that between Robin Hood and Little John in the tale of Robin Hood from the 17th century ballad. Modern quarterstaff choreography has also integrated the techniques of the bō staff from the Japanese martial art Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū which originated around 1447. Examples of this style can be seen in the famous Kabuki play \"Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura\" written in 1748.\n\nA large sword commonly used in the early Middle Ages in Europe. The broadsword was notable for its large hilt which allowed it to be wielded with both hands due to its size and weight. Used for slashing rather than stabbing, this weapon is used in plays set in this period like Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" and is also seen in fantasy epics like \"Lord of the Rings\".\n\nFirst school instructing on the correct use of the rapier in England was started in 1576 by Rocco Bonetti from Italy. Bonetti took over the lease from playwright John Lyly to open his school in Blackfriars. The rapier has the advantage of the thrust over the slash which means it could be a much smaller and lighter weapon than the broadsword. It is popular in Shakespeare plays like \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Hamlet\" where duels are performed and can be used in combination with a dagger.\nThe smallsword came into fashion in England and France in the late seventeenth century. It was used as a thrusting weapon and so sword movements were kept minimal to find the opening that a thrust could land. Most men of the period carried smallswords as fashion accessories so most were elegantly ornamented. An example of a smallsword duel can be seen in \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\" by Christopher Hampton written in 1985, based on the 1782 novel of the same name.\nThere are many styles of knives from the Bowie knife to a switchblade. Knife fights tend to have quick sharp movements. A example of this can be seen in \"West Side Story\"'s fight between Riff and Bernardo. Often in plays however, it is one actor with a knife against someone who is unarmed like in Act I of Georges Bizet's opera \"Carmen,\" written in 1875.\n\nThe shields used in stage combat are commonly round and are strong enough that they can be used as a defensive and offensive weapon. An important element in using a shield is to hold the shield arm in an upper diagonal so the fist is higher than the elbow so the top of the shield does not move when struck, and the danger being hit in the face with the shield or the weapon using to strike it can be avoided. Sword and shields can be found in battle scenes like in Shakespeare's Wars of the Roses history plays.\n\nThis consists of hand to hand combat without weapon. Elements of unarmed combat include slaps, punches, kicks, grabs, chokes, falls, rolls, grappling, among others. Many fight directors rely on combinations of messy street fighting and martial arts such as aikido and Brazilian jiu-jitsu to create fights of this nature. Generally more common in modern contemporary plays, after swords have gone out of style but also seen in older plays such as Shakespeare's \"Othello\" when Othello strangles Desdemona.\n\nFound objects are objects that are not traditionally weapons but can be used so in the context of the scene. A classic example of this is breaking a bottle over someone's head. As with all stage combat, the objects are rigged so as not to actually pose any danger to the recipients. In the case of bottles or plates, sugar glass molds are used rather than actual glass bottles.\nOther weapons like a katana, a Japanese style sword that is curved on one side, and nunchuks can also be used onstage. These require more detailed study of Japanese martial arts. Stage combat versions of nunchuks can be purchased that are foam instead of wood, thereby reducing the danger to the actors.\nMelee weapons are used in large battle scenes and can include spears, axes, maces, flails, and more. These are other weapons that are best used in large playing spaces where there is room to work at a safe distance.\n\nFight choreography can vary widely from true realism to outright fantasy depending upon the requirements of a particular production. One of the biggest reasons that theatrical fight directors often do not aim for strict realism is that the live audience could not easily follow the 'story' of the action if bodies and blades were moving in the ways trained fighters would move them. For example, a production of Cyrano de Bergerac (play), by Edmond Rostand, using 17th-Century rapiers, might show Cyrano making lots of circular cut attacks. But a more efficient, practical attack would be taking a quicker, more direct line to the opponent's body. But the fight director knows that the audience couldn't follow the action as well if the attacks were faster (the audience might hardly be able to see the thin blades whip through the air), so most fight choreographers would make choices to help the audience follow the story. Of course, this is dependent on the production, the director and other stylistic choices.\n\nOne school of fight choreographer thought says that an unusual aspect of live stage combat, such as in a play, is that audiences will react negatively to even simulated violence if they fear the actors are being harmed: for example, if an actor is really slapped in the face, the audience will stop thinking about the character and, instead, worry about the performer. Audiences may also fear for their own safety if large combat scenes seem to be out of control. Therefore, stage combat is not simply a safety technique but is also important for an audience to maintain uninterrupted suspension of disbelief.\n\nHaving its roots in Medieval theatre, stage combat enters classical theatre choreography with Elizabethan drama (Shakespeare's simple and oft seen stage direction, \"they fight\").\n\nClassical stageplays with sword fight scenes:\n\nCinema inherited the concept of choreographed fights directly from the theatrical fight. Douglas Fairbanks in 1920 was the first film director to ask a fencing master to assist the production of a fencing scene in cinema. A second wave of swashbuckling films was triggered with Errol Flynn from 1935. Renewed interest in swashbuckling films arose in the 1970s, in the wake of\n\"The Three Musketeers\" (1973). Directors at this stage aimed for a certain amount of historical accuracy, although, as the 2007 Encyclopædia Britannica puts it, \"movie fencing remains a poor representation of actual fencing technique\".\nThe \"Star Wars\" films, the fights for which are choreographed by Bob Anderson & Peter Diamond (Episodes IV, V & VI) and Nick Gillard (Episodes I, II & III), tend to portray its lightsaber combat using swordsmanship techniques drawn from existing martial arts, but performed with fantasy weapons such as lightsabers or the Force, whereas the action featured in \"The Lord of the Rings\" also choreographed by Bob Anderson employed fantasy weapons and fighting styles, designed by Tony Wolf.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Sonny Chiba, Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, who are famous for both choreographing and acting in martial arts action films, were influential in the development of stage combat on film. Hong Kong-based fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping is known for his work on \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and the \"Matrix\" trilogy, in which the often unrealistic fighting techniques are complemented by directorial techniques such as bullet time. Ching Siu-tung is particularly noted in the field of Hong Kong action cinema for his use of graceful wire fu techniques. By contrast, films such as \"The Duellists\", fight directed by William Hobbs, \"Once Were Warriors\", fight directed by Robert Bruce and \"Troy\" & Ironclad, fight directed by Richard Ryan are widely famed for including gritty, realistic combat scenes. Ryan is also known for his creativity in devising styles such as Batman's in \"The Dark Knight\", Sherlock Holmes 'prevision' style in Guy Ritchie's two \"Sherlock Holmes\" movies.\n\nCombat reenactment is a side of historical reenactment which aims to depict events of battle, normally a specific engagement in history, but also unscripted battles where the 'winner' is not predetermined.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "84449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84449", "title": "The Closing of the American Mind", "text": "The Closing of the American Mind\n\nThe Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students is a 1987 book by the philosopher Allan Bloom. In the book, Bloom criticizes the \"openness\" of relativism, in academia and society in general, as leading paradoxically to the great \"closing\" referenced in the book's title. In Bloom's view, \"openness\" and absolute understanding undermine critical thinking and eliminate the \"point of view\" that defines cultures. Bloom's book became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback, but drew divided reactions from reviewers.\n\nBloom critiques the contemporary American university and how he sees it as failing its students, criticizing modern movements in philosophy and the humanities. Throughout the book, he attacks the \"moral relativism\" that he claims has taken over American universities for the barrier it constructs to the notions of truth, critical thinking, and genuine knowledge. Bloom claims that students in the 1980s have prioritized the immediate, blind relegation of prejudice as inferiority of thought, and therefore have \"closed\" their mind, as the title suggests, to asking the right questions, so that prejudice may be eradicated through logic and critical thinking, as opposed to empty, baseless instinct. Bloom writes, \"Prejudices, strong prejudices, are visions about the way things are. ... Error is indeed our enemy, but it alone points to the truth and therefore deserves our respectful treatment. The mind that has no prejudices at the outset is empty.\"\n\nIn part one, titled \"Students\", Bloom details how the young American mindset, the books, music, relationships, and other aspects of American popular culture contribute to the sanctimony of what he perceives to be dull, lazy minds in American universities today. Bloom contends that the \"clean slate\" with which students enter universities at first made them more susceptible to genuinely embracing the studies of philosophy and logic. But soon, because of \"[t]he improved education of the vastly expanded middle class [that] weakened the family's authority\", there came a \"gradual stilling of the old political and religious echoes\" in the students Bloom encountered later in his teaching career. He credits the narrowing and flattening of the American college experience to these phenomena.\n\nBloom then delves into what he believes is the \"Great Books\" dilemma. He believes that the \"great books\" of Western thought have been devalued as a source of wisdom—but more importantly, that \"our students have lost the practice of and the taste of reading\". Because of this, students are unable to derive their beliefs from evidence, from central texts, or any print source at all. Bloom contends that without an understanding of important older texts, such as Plato's \"Republic\" or Niccolò Machiavelli's \"The Prince\", modern students lack any reference point with which they can critically think about or address current events. Students are instead left with vague and abstract ideas of \"good\" and \"evil\".\n\nBloom notes that the \"addiction to music\" he observes in modern students is unparalleled, and has been for centuries. But even this, he says, contributes to the closing of the young American mind. He notes that fewer and fewer students have a surface level, let alone nuanced, understanding of classical music, and that instead, \"rock music is as unquestioned and un-problematic as the air the students breathe.\" Pop music, he believes, employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young and to persuade them that their petty rebelliousness is authentic politics, when, in fact, they are being controlled by the money-managers whom successful performers like Mick Jagger quietly serve. He regards the ubiquity of overly sexual overtones in 1980s rock music and what he perceives to be a subsequent corruption of young minds as a signal of \"parents' loss of control over the children's moral education at a time when no one else is seriously concerned with it.\" Bloom's conclusion about the effects of music on education is that its oversexualization in the late 20th century makes it \"very difficult for [students] to have a passionate relationship with the art and thought that are the substance of liberal education, [since] [i]t only artificially induces the exaltation attached to the completion of the greatest endeavors ... like discovery of the truth.\" Students no longer seek pleasure from the pursuit of learning.\n\nBloom concludes in \"Students\" that because of the relationships students have with popular culture, their family, and their peers, they no longer come to university asking questions, seeking instruction, or with imagination.\n\nBloom titles the second part of the book \"Nihilism, American Style\". He introduces in further detail the concept of \"value relativism\", mentioned previously only in the introduction. Value relativism, he says, plagues most elite institutions of higher learning. For Bloom, this dissolved into nihilism. He notices that students follow the path of least resistance when developing their values. For students, he writes, \"values are not discovered by reason, and it is fruitless to seek them, to find the truth or the good life.\" Ironically, when travelling this path without reason, Bloom opines, students still \"adopt strong poses and fanatic resolutions.\"\n\nPhilosophy professors involved in ordinary language analysis or logical positivism disregard important \"humanizing\" ethical and political issues and fail to pique the interest of students. Literature professors involved in deconstructionism promote irrationalism and skepticism of standards of truth and thereby dissolve the moral imperatives which are communicated through genuine philosophy and which elevate and broaden the intellects of those who engage with these imperatives. To a great extent, Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society. He draws analogies between the United States and the Weimar Republic. The modern liberal philosophy, he says, enshrined in the Enlightenment thought of John Locke—that a just society could be based upon self-interest alone, coupled by the emergence of relativism in American thought—had led to this crisis. Bloom cites Friedrich Nietzsche's actions of telling \"modern man that he was free-falling in the abyss of nihilism\", and continues to espouse Nietzsche's commentary that nihilism in our contemporary democracy stems from value relativism.\n\nFor Bloom, this created a void in the souls of Americans, into which demagogic radicals as exemplified by 1960s student leaders could leap. (Bloom made the comparison to the Nazi brownshirts, who once similarly filled the gap created in German society by the Weimar Republic.) In the second instance, he argued, the higher calling of philosophy and reason understood as freedom of thought, had been eclipsed by a pseudo-philosophy, or an ideology of thought. Relativism was one feature of modern American liberal philosophy that had subverted the Platonic–Socratic teaching.\n\nBloom contends that the failure of contemporary liberal education leads to the sterile social and sexual habits of modern students, and to their inability to fashion a life for themselves beyond the mundane offerings touted as success. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory. In \"The University\", he discusses how the environment in elite institutions has cultivated mere ambition over the search for truth. He says that proclaiming an affinity for reason does not alone define a university's worth, as the statement alone does not constitute true commitment to scholastic pursuits in the name of a greater truth. He contends that \"the mere announcement of the rule of reason does not create the conditions for the full exercise of rationality\". Universities serve as a reflection of the public and democracy at large. Because of this, they are slave to public opinion (per Alexis de Tocqueville). The public opinion—which serves as the final gatekeeper and the final headsmen for any movements the university may actually try to implement to advance the pursuit of critical thinking.\n\nBloom also explains what he believes is the dichotomy between the \"spirit of the university\" and the university itself. \"The philosophic life is not the university.\" He alludes to early philosophers, who, up until the nineteenth century, including Socrates, who he firmly believes is \"of the essence of the university\", never once made use of such institutions at all. Bloom posits that maybe, after all, free thought and commitment to a greater truth need not exist within the metaphorical four walls of a university. What matters instead, he says, what is \"uniquely human\", is the \"philosophic experience\".\n\nBloom also notices a trend in which students notice the devaluing of free thought in universities. He writes about students at Cornell University, that \"these students discerned that their teachers did not really believe that freedom of thought was necessarily a good and useful thing, that they suspected that all this was ideology protecting the injustices of our 'system'\". Bloom asserts that American professors in the sixties \"were not aware of what they no longer believed\" and that this notion gravely endangered any capacity for progress towards free thought. Bloom insists that requiring from universities empty values like \"greater openness\", \"less rigidity\", and \"freedom from authority\" are only fashionable and do not have any substantive content. And in the face of growing civil rights conflicts, universities have a duty to instead actively pursue the task of \"opening American minds\". It is not enough, Bloom contends, for universities to \"not want trouble\". It is not enough for universities to only hold reputation paramount in the face of campus disruption, and only in name espouse free thought and truth. This \"unfortunate mixture of cowardice and moralism\" will unseat the spirit of the university. Bloom concludes by reminding readers that the love of wisdom and truth must be kept alive in universities, particularly in this moment of world history.\n\n\"The Closing of the American Mind\" was published in March 1987, five years after Bloom published an essay in the \"National Review\" about the failure of universities to serve the needs of students. With the encouragement of Saul Bellow, his colleague at the University of Chicago, he expanded his thoughts into a book \"about a life, I've led\" that critically reflected on the current state of higher education in American universities. His friends and admirers imagined the work would be a modest success, as did Bloom, who recognized his publisher's modest advance to complete the project as a lack of sales confidence. Yet on the momentum of strong initial reviews, including one by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt in \"The New York Times\" and an op-ed piece by syndicated conservative commentator George Will entitled \"A How-To Book for the Independent\" it became an unexpected best seller, eventually selling close to half a million copies in hardback and remaining at number one on \"The New York Times\" Non-fiction Best Seller list for four months.\n\n\"The Closing of the American Mind\" was met with mixed reviews from scholars and the general public alike.\n\nThe art critic Roger Kimball, writing in \"The New York Times\", called \"The Closing of the American Mind\" \"an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate.\" Kimball argues that Bloom's work should not be diminished publicly simply because it is not optimistic. Instead, he writes, \"'The Closing of the American Mind' is essential reading for anyone concerned with the state of liberal education in this society. Its pathos, erudition and penetrating insight make it an unparalleled reflection on the whole question of what it means to be a student in today's intellectual and moral climate.\" He concludes that,\nMatt Feeney from \"The New Yorker\" also wrote in his article, \"Allan Bloom's Guide to College\", in 2012, that while Bloom's core arguments may have been diluted into trite conservative barbs directed at liberal educations, the essence of his argument remains true today, and his motives do too. He explains that by writing \"The Closing of the American Mind,\" \"Bloom dangles the promise of an arousing and dangerous philosophical quest, which will take the student far from his (and his friends' and parents' and other professors') settled opinions about what is good and decent.\" As for Bloom's impact on this era of politics, Feeney suggests a reframe in the way consumers perceive Bloom's work. Feeney writes,\nThe neoconservative writer Norman Podhoretz embraced Bloom's argument, noting that the closed-mindedness in his title refers to the paradoxical consequence of the academic \"open mind\" found in liberal political thought—namely \"the narrow and intolerant dogmatism\" that dismisses any attempt, by Plato or the Hebrew Bible for example, to provide a rational basis for moral judgments. Podhoretz continued, \"Bloom goes on to charge liberalism with vulgarizing the noble ideals of freedom and equality, and he offers brilliantly acerbic descriptions of the sexual revolution and the feminist movement, which he sees as products of this process of vulgarization.\" Bloom's work was also supported by a larger conservative movement. In 2005, Jim Sleeper wrote for \"The New York Times\" that \"nothing prepared [conservatives'] movement, or the academic and publishing worlds, for the wildfire success of [the book]. ... Conservatives championed Bloom then, of course, and they invoke him still.\"\n\nIn a 1989 article, Ann Clark Fehn discussed the critical reception of the book, noting that it had eclipsed other titles that year dealing with higher education (\"College\" by Ernest L. Boyer and \"Cultural Literacy\" by E. D. Hirsch), and quoting \"Publishers Weekly\", which had described Bloom's book as a \"bestseller made by reviews\". The poet Frederick Turner described \"The Closing of the American Mind\" as, \"The most thoughtful conservative analysis of the nation's cultural sickness.\"\n\nThe critic Camille Paglia called \"The Closing of the American Mind\" \"the first shot in the culture wars\", writing of Bloom that she was \"confident that in the long run he will be vindicated and his critics swallowed in obscurity\".\n\nIn her review, Martha Nussbaum questioned whether Bloom deserved to be considered a philosopher. The criticism of the book was continued by impassioned reviews by Benjamin Barber in \"Harper's\"; by the Nietzschean scholar Alexander Nehamas in the \"London Review of Books\"; and by David Rieff in \"The Times Literary Supplement\". David Rieff called Bloom \"an academic version of Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North: vengeful, reactionary, antidemocratic.\" The book, he said, was one that \"decent people would be ashamed of having written.\" The tone of these reviews led James Atlas in \"The New York Times Magazine\" to conclude \"the responses to Bloom's book have been charged with a hostility that transcends the usual mean-spiritedness of reviewers.\"\n\nWilliam Greider wrote for \"Rolling Stone\" that there were two main reasons for the roaring commercial success of Bloom's work. The first, he says, is purely due to the \"impassioned quality of Bloom's prose. The professor's rhetoric is laced with high-blown discourses on his great-books heroes and his enemies list ... The average reader is undoubtedly flattered by Bloom's intellectual name-dropping; it's always fun to be high-minded about someone else's ignorance.\" The second reason Greider credits Bloom's success to is simply timing. He writes that \"the book's appearance coincides with a surge of national concern about the disappearance of traditional education. Another current best seller, \"Cultural Literacy\", by E.D. Hirsch Jr., also taps the same anxieties.\" Ultimately, Greider concludes that Bloom's agenda is simply vicious attack on the values of young America. He writes,\n\nFor Greider, it is unfathomable how Bloom could devile the decline in prejudice and relegate that decline to a lack of imagination. He concludes, \"Bloom apparently detests the young.\"\n\nThe linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky dismissed Bloom's book as \"mind-bogglingly stupid\" for \"basically saying ... you just march the students through a canon of 'great thoughts' that are picked out for everybody\" when \"the effect of that is that students will end up knowing and understanding virtually nothing.\"\n\nThe jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's \"Sexual Personae\" (1990), finding both books to be examples of \"difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public.\" Thus, since publication, \"The Closing of the American Mind\", fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. One prominent retaliation came from the American historian Lawrence W. Levine, whose book was titled \"The Opening of the American Mind\". According to \"The New York Times\" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to \"praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised.\" But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, \"many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread.\" Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do \"with current political demarcations.\"\n\nJerry Aaron Snyder of \"The New Republic\", however, argues that the culture wars, which Bloom's work clearly helped spark a conversation about, will consistently be relevant. While it may be argued that \"The Closing of the American Mind\" may not resign itself to a political party, this does not preclude it from the impact it had on the culture wars, and how those culture wars shape life today. Snyder argues that books like Bloom's have inspired further conversations and controversies alike, such as controversy surrounding how history is taught in high schools, or the effectiveness of affirmative action or identity politics. According to Snyder, the discussions spawned by the initial culture wars in the 1980s because of books like Bloom's, \"'the soul of America' is a bottomless well. For better or worse, it will never run dry.\"\n"}

{"id": "8081269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8081269", "title": "Vix Grave", "text": "Vix Grave\n\nThe Vix Grave is a burial mound near the village of Vix () in northern Burgundy. The broader site is a prehistoric Celtic complex from the Late Hallstatt and Early La Tène periods, consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds.\n\nThe grave of the \"Lady of Vix\", dating to circa 500 BC, had never been disturbed and thus contained remarkably rich grave offerings. Known in French as the \"Trésor de Vix\", these included a great deal of jewellery and the \"Vix krater\", the largest known metal vessel from Western classical antiquity, being 1.63 m (5'4\") in height.\n\nThe sites are located near the village of Vix, about 6 km north of Châtillon-sur-Seine, in the department of Côte-d'Or, in northeastern Burgundy. The complex is centred on Mont Lassois, a steep flat-topped hill that dominates the area. It was the site of a fortified Celtic settlement, or oppidum. To the southeast of the hill, there was a 42-hectare necropolis with graves ranging from the Late Bronze Age via the Hallstatt Culture to Late La Tène. Other finds indicate activity up to Late Antiquity.\n\nDuring the sixth and fifth centuries BC, the Vix (or Mont Lassois) settlement appears to have controlled a major trading node, where the Seine, an important riverine transport route linking eastern and western France, crossed the land route leading from the Mediterranean to northern Europe. Additionally, Vix is at the centre of an agriculturally rich plain.\n\nDiscovery of archaeological material in the area, originally by a locally based amateur, began in April 1930. Increasingly systematic work throughout the following decades revealed thousands of pottery sherds, fibulae, jewellery, and other bronze and iron finds. The famous burial mound with the krater was excavated in early 1953 by René Jouffroi. In 1991 new archaeological research on and around Mont Lassois began under the direction of Bruno Chaume. Since 2001 a programme of research titled “Vix et son environnement” began, uniting the resources of several universities.\n\nExcavation of the settlement on the summit of Mont Lassois revealed extensive fortifications, with ditches and walls up to 8 m thick. The walls were built in the \"Pfostenschlitzmauer\" technique, but also yielded nails of the type common in \"murus gallicus\" walls. Excavation inside the enclosure revealed a variety of buildings, including post houses, pit dwellings, hearths, and storage units built on stilts. Geophysical work shows a large planned settlement, with a central, north–south axis and several phases of buildings.\n\nIn 2006, a remarkable architectural unit was discovered at the centre of the site. It is a large complex of two or three buildings, the main one measuring 35 by 21 m, with an estimated height of 12 m: the dimensions of a modern church. The large hall had an apse at the back and a front porch \"in antis\". Overall, the central unit resembles the megaron complex of early Greek architecture. Such a find is unprecedented in early Celtic Europe. Finds suggested domestic use or feasting uses. The structure has been described as the \"Palace\" of the Lady of Vix (\"Palais de la Dame de Vix\").\n\nThe many individual finds from the Lassois oppidum clearly demonstrate the settlement's long and wide-ranging trade contacts, as well as its own role as an economic centre. The most common finds are shards of pottery, with more than 40,000 recorded to date. Many are local products, decorated with simple geometric motifs (checkerboard patterns) and occasional depictions of animals. There also have been finds of imported Attic black figure vases from Greece. Many amphorae and bowls could be identified as coming from the contemporary Greek-settled areas of southern France. The amphorae had been used for transporting wine.\n\nJewellery included fibulae, commonly decorated with amber or coral, earrings, beads, slate bracelets, and rings. Glass ornaments also were found. Some small bronze figurines found are probably of Mediterranean origin. Little weaponry has been found as yet, the majority of it projectiles and axes.\n\nMont Lassois has all the features of a high-status settlement: large fortifications, the presence of a citadel and a lower town, rare and fine imported materials, as well as numerous rich burial mounds in the vicinity.\n\nThe burial of \"the Lady of Vix\" took place around 500 B.C. Although decomposition of the organic contents of the grave was nearly total, the gender of the individual buried has been interpreted as female: she is accompanied by many items of jewellery, but no weaponry. Her social status is not clear and other than \"Lady,\" names such as, \"Queen\", \"Princess\", or \"Priestess of Vix\" have all been used in various articles involving conjecture. There can be no doubt of her high status, as indicated by the large amounts of jewellery. She was between 30 years and 35 years old at the time of her death.\n\nThe inhumation burial was placed in a 4m x 4m rectangular wooden chamber underneath a mound or tumulus of earth and stone which originally measured 42m in diameter and 5m in height.\n\nHer body was laid in the freestanding box of a cart, or chariot, the wheels of which had been detached and placed beside it. Only its metal parts have survived. Her jewellery included a 480 gram 24-carat gold torc, a bronze torc, six fibulae, six slate bracelets, plus a seventh bracelet made of amber beads.\n\nThe grave also contained an assemblage of imported objects from Italy and the Greek world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver phiale (shallow bowl, sometimes seen as a local product), an Etruscan bronze oinochoe (wine jug), and several drinking cups from Etruria and Attica. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a \"terminus post quem\" for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.\n\nThe largest and most famous of the finds from the burial is an elaborately decorated bronze volute krater of 1.63m (5'4\") height and over 200kg (450lbs) weight. Kraters were vessels for mixing wine and water, common in the Greek world, and usually made of clay. The Vix krater has become an iconic object representing both the wealth of early Celtic burials and the art of Late Archaic Greek bronze work.\n\n\nThe enormous variety of apparently Mediterranean imports indicates wide-ranging trade connections; in particular, the Mediterranean material might have come to Vix with Greek or Etruscan traders. The wealth of imported luxury goods at Vix is, so far, unique in La Tène Europe. It has been suggested that the krater, the largest known Greek bronze vessel, should be seen in a context of high-status gift exchange connected with the trade of wine from the Mediterranean for raw materials from northern Europe.\n\nA reconstruction of the grave and the original finds are on display in the museum at Châtillon-sur-Seine.\n\nApart from this woman's grave (mound I), there are five further known large burial mounds in the area. Three of them have been excavated so far. \n\nIn 1994, fragments of two stone statues, a warrior, and a figure of a woman, were discovered in a small enclosure.\n\nIn the area, as elsewhere in Central and Western Europe, the early Iron Age led to changes in social organisation, including a marked tendency toward the development of social hierarchies. It seems that at the top of these hierarchies was an aristocracy that had developed in the context of the increasingly important trade in iron ore and iron. Whether they really were \"princesses\" or \"princes\" in a modern sense (i.e., a noble or religious aristocracy) or simply represented an economic or mercantile elite is still the subject of much discussion.\n\nEvidence for these changed social conditions is seen in the richly equipped graves of this period, which stand in sharp contrast to the preceding habit of uniform simple urn burials. It is also seen in the changing settlement patterns of the region. Whereas large open settlements had previously served as central places, smaller enclosed settlements developed, often in locally prominent locations (so called manors or \"princely sites\"). Several of these sites are known from Late Hallstatt and Early La Tène Europe, for example, the burials at Hochdorf and Magdalenenberg, the Heuneburg settlement and the Glauberg settlement and burial complex. \n\nIron ores were far more widespread than the rarer materials needed to produce the previously dominant bronze: copper, but especially, tin. Thus, economic success ceased to be determined simply by access to the raw materials, but started to depend on infrastructure and trade. The increasing economic surplus in well-situated places was invested in representative settlements (and fortifications), jewellery, and expensive imported luxury materials, a differentiation not previously possible.\n\n\n \n"}

At this time (the late 1960s), forsaking theatres and galleries for the street was unusual.\n\nIn November 2001, Welfare State International was described by the Guardian Guide as \"Britain's foremost arts and installations collective.\" Welfare State International's 'The Raising of the Titanic' (Limehouse Basin, London, 1983) has been listed among \"Productions that transformed theatre\".\n\nWelfare State International ceased operating on April Fools' Day 2006 after a performance at Ulverston.\n\n\n\n\n"}
