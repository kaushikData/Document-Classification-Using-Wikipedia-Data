Its mission was focused on economic development to create fairly-priced markets for Alaska Native art as well as to provide general awareness and public education of Alaska's indigenous cultures, and as a result offered programs to support Alaskan Native artists. Funded by a combination of government grants and private funding in the form of donations from Alaskan Native corporations, the organization distributed grant money through project support programs to provide in-residence art programs, educational programs for rural schools, funding for museum demonstrations, art workshops, and exhibitions and documentation of native artists' work.\n\nThe Native Arts Foundation gallery in Anchorage, which opened in 2006 presented and curated the works of Native artists, including visual art, spoken word, performance art and choreography, dance, fashion, and video, as well as presenting works created during privately organized workshops and business training. Outside of Alaska, the foundation also promoted Alaskan Native art at events and festivals in Pittsburgh, Washington D.C., Paris, and Miami.\n\nIn addition, the Foundation maintained extensive inventory of Native art and utilitarian handmade items of all sorts, based on the \"subsistence\" lifestyle of their makers: walrus ivory carvings, baleen etchings and baskets, whalebone sculpture, salmon and halibut skin baskets, fish skin crafts, caribou antler dolls dressed in traditional sealskin clothing, bronze sculpture and oil and acrylic paintings; and wearable art and accessories: jewelry, carved masks, traditional \"ulu\" knives, traditional mukluks made using natural material, summer parkas, beaded gowns using quills and moose hide, bolo ties, walrus whisker earrings, \"scrimshaw\" belt buckles, and silver, gold and copper jewelry.\n\nThe Foundation was dissolved in the spring of 2016 as the result of lost state funding and low markups on sold art. At the time of closure, the stock of the Foundation gallery was made available for private sale, and services were phased out to accommodate future marketing efforts. As operations ceased, the Foundation sought to distribute its intellectual property and valuable items to another organization.\n"}

The First Congress was held in 1957, resulting in these two organizations merging in a single institution: \"The Albanian League of Writers and Artists\". Sejfulla Malëshova was appointed its leader and Fan S. Noli its honorary president. Among the most known creators were Lasgush Poradeci, Nonda Bulka, Skënder Luarasi, Dhimitër Shuteriqi, Sterjo Spasse, etc. At the beginning there were by 70 members.\nIts statute describes its activities as: \n\nThe League of Writers and Artists has played a role in the development of Albanian literature and art, especially for the selection, publication and propaganda of the works with Albanian nationality content. \n\nAmong the membership of the League of Writers and Artists have been dissident-minded authors like Sejfulla Malëshova, the first leader of this organization, like the writer Kasem Trebeshina, who was imprisoned for his creativity, like Pjetër Arbnori (also called \"Albanian Mandela\"), who was re-convicted in prison for his literary anticommunist work, as the dissident Bilal Xhaferri who was expelled, exiled in communist gulags and forced to flee to the U.S., as Vilson Blloshmi who was shot and how many others who were persecuted in thousands ways. Some, like the poet Xhevahir Spahiu, Dritëro Agolli or Ismail Kadare, survived.\n\nSome members of ALWA, part of communist censorship with their reviews have affected to ban dissident literature and art and have encouraged prosecution and persecution of dissident authors, but there were periods that they have supported and encouraged young talent. The writer Dritëro Agolli, who has had longer the leader’ duty of this organization, in the 1980s followed a liberal politic to the support and promotion of the new talents. With his initiative and recommendations have been allowed to follow the university studies and have been encouraged to create talents even from the most persecuted and anti-communist classes of Albanian society, like the poets Skënder Buçpapa, Mujo Buçpapa or prosers like Faruk Myrtaj, Shefki Hysa etc.\n\nAfter 1990 ALWA contributed too much in the appreciation of art, literature and authors aforetime prohibited. However, during the post-communist period as well, with a very problematic democracy and highly politicized, the League of Writers and Artists is imposed an adulatory attitude toward the ruling party, the right one or the left one. The government tried to usurp ALWA and appointed leaders of Albanian creators taking advantage by the economical difficulties that writers, artists and organizations were experiencing.\n\nFinally, after ALWA managed to escape from politics, it was found without economic support and on the verge of bankruptcy. In this difficult situation the state turned to it its back, got the building where its headquarters was but the writers and artists did not abandoned it. Most of them have realized that they must cooperate far from the policy of powers and parties. Writers and artists are those who keep alive ALWA in this difficult period full of crisis. Today, the ALWA has approximately 1300 members. Leading authorities are: National Congress, Chairmanship and Administrative Council. In the organizational structure operate: the section of literature, music, painting, sculpture, and the section of young talents.\n\nFor more than 50 years, Albanian League of Writers and Artists has had its literary and artistic organs: the magazine \"Literatura jonë\" (English: Our Literature), followed by the monthly magazine \"Nëntori\" (English: November), later on the weekly \"Drita\" (English: The light) (1961), the magazine \"Les letters Albanaises\" (1978) in French, \"Bota Letrare\" (English: Literary World), and \"Revista Letrare\" (English: Literary Magazine), as various publications until 1990. Currently the organization of Albanian writers and artists doesn’t publishes any organ due to lack of funds.\nIn 2007, after 62 years of continuous activity, AlWA was displaced from their premises. However, ALWA currently continues its activities despite the economic burdens.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47872613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47872613", "title": "Art dans Tout", "text": "Art dans Tout\n\nThe Art dans Tout movement was a French art group which operated from 1896 to 1901. Originally called Les Cinq, because it had five founder members, artist and lace designer Félix Aubert, sculptor and craftsman Alexandre Charpentier, sculptor and medalist Jean Dampt, sculptor and medalist Henry Nocq and architect Charles Plumet, it later changed its name to Les Six when Nocq left the group in 1897, replaced by painter Étienne Moreau-Nélaton and architect and decorator Tony Selmersheim. In 1898, the group expanded further to become Art dans Tout when Carl-Albert Angst, a sculptor and student of Dampt, Jules Desbois, a sculptor, Paul Follot, a furniture designer, Alphonse Hérold, a cabinetmaker, Antoine Jorrand, a painter and tapestry designer, Henri Sauvage, an architect, and Louis Sorrel, an architect and collaborator of Aubert's, joined. The group dissolved in 1901 due to commercial necessity.\n\nThe group's philosophy can be summed up in two concepts, that the form of a work of art should always fit its function and be artistic, and that the material the work is made from should always reflect the purpose of the object and the nature of the material.\n\nWith the rise of machine production, the cost of producing object d'art and house decorations fell. In France, as around the rest of Europe, differing philosophies arose as to how to produce beautiful household objects and furniture for the masses, not just for the rich, following the philosophy of Eugène-Émmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. Followers of Viollet-le-Duc believed that banal, mediocre interiors had a negative effect on the development, morality and intellect of people who lived in them. Various attempts at collaborations between artists and industries that produced these items occurred. In France, these attempts had mostly ended in failure. Several of the artists in the group worked in a style that was part of the larger Art Nouveau style. The group was part of a tentative but determined attempt to break down the barriers between art, industry and everyday life.\n\nNocq in his role as art critic wrote an article on improvements in street design seen in England and Belgium, and encouraged France to follow their lead.\n\nLes Cinq originally came together in Autumn 1896, meeting in Charpentier's workshop on Sunday afternoons. Their first exhibition was held from December 1896 - January 1897 at the Galerie des Artistes Modern. In their preface to the exhibition catalogue of the first exhibition, the group set forth their philosophy of bringing together the major arts (painting, sculpture and architecture) and the minor arts (ceramics, furniture and decorative objects), and to produce objects that served both functional and decorative purposes. They also exhibited a furnished boudoir for the Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. In this room, Aubert designed the wall-hangings, curtains, carpet and fabric decorations, Charpentier the window-sash bolt and bottle-stoppers and Plumet, the dressing table, chair, shelf-unit, glass display case and the structure of the screens.\n\nIn December 1897, the group enlarged to become Les Six. In their 1897-1898 exhibition, Aubert and Charpentier designed a bathroom with the decorator Eugène Simas, which fulfilled the group's ideals of bringing beauty to an object that served a functional purpose, and was also part of an industrial collaboration, with the Sarreguemines factory.\n\nThe group expanded further in 1898 to include members that could not always attend the Sunday meetings. The group planned to construct and furnish an entire house for the 1900 International Exhibition in Paris, but could not accomplish this due to a lack of funding. An Aubert and Charpentier-designed bedroom (for Prince Alexandre de Chimay and his wife) was part of the group's 1899 exhibition at the Galerie des Artistes Modern. Members of the group collaborated with Léon Benoville and Édmond Socard in designing the interiors of other Parisian houses. Sorrel designed a pavilion for the International Exhibition of 1900 which Aubert decorated.\n\nAlthough the group disbanded in 1901 due to financial issues, and an inability to convince major furniture manufacturers to use their designs, several group members continued to collaborate, notably Plumet and Selmersheim.\n\n"}
{"id": "5154103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5154103", "title": "Atlantis (Donovan song)", "text": "Atlantis (Donovan song)\n\n\"Atlantis\" is a song written and recorded by Scottish singer/songwriter Donovan. It was released as a single in 1968 (see 1968 in music) and became a worldwide success; becoming a No.1 hit in Switzerland in 1969 (see 1969 in music), No.2 in Germany and South Africa, No.12 in Canada, and No.4 in Austria. In the United States, where it served as the b-side to \"To Susan on the West Coast, Waiting,\" it reached No.7, whilst in the singer's native country the single managed only a modest No.23 placing.\n\nIn 2001, Donovan and German pop band No Angels re-recorded the track for the closing credits of the Walt Disney Feature Animation picture \"\" (2001). Included on a concomitant album for the German-speaking music market, it was once more released as a single and re-entered the top five in Austria and Germany.\n\nThe introduction is a quiet monologue regarding the idea that Atlantis was a highly advanced antediluvian civilization, and that Atlantean colonists were the basis of the mythological gods of ancient times. Aware of their fate, the Atlanteans sent out ships to carry the preservation of their civilization, thereby spreading it across the world. Later on, the song conveys the message that the singer's true love may be in Atlantis. The overall theme is common for the 1960s: fanciful mythology as the symbol of the counterculture movement, with the hope that true love will be found if ever Atlantis can be reached.\n\nMany believe that the song \"Atlantis\" contains background vocals by Paul McCartney. Backing up that claim is Harry Castleman and Walter Podrazik's book, \"All Together Now: The First Complete Beatles Discography, 1961—1975\" (New York: Ballantine Books, 1976, p. 384), which states that McCartney not only provided the background vocals but also played the tambourine on the song.\n\nHowever, according to Donovan in a 2008 interview with Goldmine Magazine, McCartney did not sing the backing vocals. The album's liner notes, which state that the song was recorded in Los Angeles in November 1968, do not list McCartney as a performer on the album.\n\nAlso, the works of Beatles expert Mark Lewisohn do not support the statement. Neither \"The Complete Beatles Chronicles\" (New York: Harmony Books, 1992) nor \"The Beatles Day by Day: A Chronology 1962-1989\" (New York: Harmony Books, 1987 & 1990) mentions McCartney's participation on this song. According to Lewisohn's chronology, (Lewisohn, \"The Beatles Day by Day\", page 110) McCartney spent the month of November 1968 mostly at his farm in Scotland.\n\nContract disputes at the time caused a complicated series of different releases in the United Kingdom and United States. It was originally released in the UK as a single with \"I Love My Shirt\" as the B-side. In 1969 it was released in the US on the album \"Barabajagal\". The LP was not released in the UK, however, and \"Atlantis\" was next released in the US as the B-side to \"To Susan on the West Coast Waiting\".\n\nThe song was not deemed likely to be a hit in the US because of its length and the fact that the first third of the song is spoken prose and therefore not \"radio-friendly\". It was for this reason that, despite its success in Europe, \"Atlantis\" was demoted to B-side status. However, the record company A&R executives were proved wrong when the popularity of \"Atlantis\" far surpassed that of its A-side. The song was quite successful, reaching #7 on the Billboard charts, and the song itself became an anthem of the hippie movement.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Walt Disney Feature Animation started production on \"\", an animated science fiction/action film, based on the Atlantis saga. Interested in slipping his 1968 version into the , Donovan immediately opened negotiations with the studios; however Disney was barely interested in the song and plans eventually fell through. By 2000, Disney had committed German producer Leslie Mándoki to produce a concomitant album for the German-speaking music markets, entitled \"Stars Inspired by Atlantis\". After stumbling over the original song, Mándoki approached Donovan by phone, describing him his idea of a collaboration with German newcomers No Angels, with whom Mándoki had previously worked on their debut \"Elle'ments\" (2001), and a few days later Donovan and the band met at the Lake Starnberg to start recording.\n\n\"Atlantis\" served as the band's fourth single along with \"When the Angels Sing\", a midtempo ballad from their debut album \"Elle'ments\" (2001). Physical CD singles of the double-A single were released on November 19, 2001 by Cheyenne Records. The maxi single includes the duet version, the Submarine Mix of \"Atlantis\" and three new remixes \"When the Angels Sing\".\n\nUpon its release, \"When the Angels Sing\"/\"Atlantis\" debuted at number five on the German Singles Chart in the week of December 3, 2001. It spent six weeks within the top ten and fell out of the chart in the 14th weeks, becoming the 79th highest-selling single of 2001 in Germany. In Austria, the double-A single debuted at number ten on the Ö3 Austria Top 40. It peaked at number five in its third week and spent four more weeks within the top ten, leaving the top 75 after 14 weeks. In Switzerland, \"When the Angels Sing\"/\"Atlantis\" entered the Swiss Hitparade at number 56 in the week of December 2. It reached its peak, number 16, in its second week, becoming the band's first single to miss the top ten. It fell out of the top 100 after twelve weeks on the chart. \n\nThe single's music video was directed by Hannes Rossacher for DoRo Productions and shot in Berlin, Germany in fall 2001. It shows Donovan and the band in a recording studio accented by underwater settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by the animated movie.\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of \"Elle'ments\".\n\n"}

Bankside is located on the southern bank of the River Thames, east of Charing Cross, running from a little west of Blackfriars Bridge to just a short distance before London Bridge at St Mary Overie Dock to the east which marks its distinct status from that of 'the Borough' district of Southwark. It is part of a business improvement district known as Better Bankside.\n\nThe 'banke' was reclaimed by the Bishop of Winchester who owned the manor of the Clink of which this is part. There is a map plan in the Duchy of Lancaster archive showing 'the way to the banke'. The name is recorded in 1554 as \"the Banke syde\" and means 'street along the bank of the Thames'. It is formed from Middle English 'banke' and 'side'. In 1860 Southwark Street was created to connect the Blackfriars and London bridge crossings here and that can be regarded as the area's informal southern perimeter.\n\nBankside is the riverside of the former liberties of the Clink and Paris Garden. In the Elizabethan period, because of its location outside the jurisdiction of the City of London, the area of the Clink and Paris Garden were outside of the City of London's authority and so became occupied by the bear baiting pits and playhouses, including the Rose, the Hope Theatre, the Swan and the Globe Theatre of which a replica was constructed in the late 1990s. The history of the area is traced in a study that traces the earliest known history of a particular building on Bankside until the present day. It has experienced regeneration in recent decades, becoming a significant tourist destination, and forms a business improvement district. The skyline of Bankside is dominated by the former Bankside Power Station, which now houses the Tate Modern.\n\nA major new development in the area is the Bankside 1/2/3 complex on Southwark Street. Together, these three building house about 5,000 employees. Bankside 1, also known as the Blue Fin Building, was built-for and partially-occupied-by IPC Media, while Bankside 2 and 3 are occupied by The Omnicom Group Ltd. The architect for the buildings was Allies and Morrison.\n\nIt is part of the Borough and Bankside Community Council which corresponds to the Southwark electoral wards of Cathedrals and Chaucer. They are part of the Bermondsey and Old Southwark Parliament constituency and the Member of Parliament is Labour's Neil Coyle. It is within the Lambeth and Southwark London Assembly constituency and the London European Parliament constituency.\n\nSince 1754 the Blackfriars Bridge formed a connection to the north and in 1819 Southwark Bridge has connected the area into the City. In 2000 a direct pedestrian connection was opened between the Tate Modern and St Paul's Cathedral via the Millennium Bridge, which also hosts two Cycle Hire stations Blackfriars station on the City side north bank of the river has been redeveloped as part of the Thameslink Programme and opened a Bankside entrance in 2012. London Bridge and Southwark are the other stations closest to Bankside, located to the east and south of it respectively. It is served by bus routes 381 and RV1 which are hydrogen powered.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6385368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6385368", "title": "Cockpit Theatre", "text": "Cockpit Theatre\n\nThe Cockpit was a theatre in London, operating from 1616 to around 1665. It was the first theatre to be located near Drury Lane. After damage in 1617, it was named The Phoenix.\n\nThe original building was an actual cockpit; that is, a staging area for cockfights. Most likely a round building with a peaked roof, about in diameter, it was erected under Henry VIII, c. 1530-32, as part of a gaming complex. Records indicate a major restoration in 1581-82 and renovations in 1589-90, 1602-3, and 1608-9 (the latter under the supervision of John Best, \"cockmaster\" to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, King James I's eldest son and heir).\n\nIn August 1616, Christopher Beeston acquired the lease to the building and converted it to an indoor playhouse. In March 1617, gangs of apprentices attempted to destroy the playhouse, probably out of anger that their favorite plays had been removed from the Red Bull outdoor amphitheater, which charged only one penny for admission, to this more expensive (six-penny) venue\".\" Beeston's rapid restoration of the playhouse after this riot may be why it was sometimes called the Phoenix. Like earlier theatres, such as The Theatre in Shoreditch and The Globe in Southwark, the location was just outside the jurisdiction of the City of London. Beeston expanded the original small building; the construction work prompted complaints by neighbors, which left traces in the legal records of the time. The resulting theatre was, by one estimate, by , \"noticeably smaller than the Blackfriars.\"\n\nThe architect commissioned for the renovation is not known for a certainty, but circumstantial evidence points to Inigo Jones. Two sheets drawn by Jones and showing the interior and exterior design of \"some\" theatre have survived; John Orrell makes the case that the theatre is the Cockpit, while allowing that he cannot produce conclusive evidence to that end. (In 1629, Inigo Jones would design another \"Cockpit\" theatre, a private one within Whitehall called the Cockpit-in-Court or Royal Cockpit.)\n\nBeeston intended the Cockpit to serve as an indoor complement to the Red Bull, the outdoor theatre then home to his acting troupe, Queen Anne's Men. A winter venue was needed to compete with the Blackfriars Theatre in the possession of their rival troupe, the King's Men. After a rocky start, the company proved successful in their new locale. Wickham attributes the success more to the theatre's location and comfort and to the flair of its manager, Beeston, than to the quality of its performers.\n\nBeeston would oversee several different troupes in the Cockpit before his death in 1639. Queen Anne's Men were there from 1617 to 1619; when that company dissolved upon the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619, their place was taken by Prince Charles's Men from 1619 to 1622. Lady Elizabeth's Men were there from 1622 to 1624, and perhaps for sporadic periods as early as 1619 (the two companies, Prince Charles's and Lady Elizabeth's, had combined for a time ca. 1615). Queen Henrietta's Men had a long run at the Cockpit, from 1625 to 1636. The last troupe to occupy the Cockpit in Beeston's lifetime was one of his own creation, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially known as Beeston's Boys — the last assembly of boy actors in the period. They would continue in the theatre under the management of his son William.\n\nWilliam Beeston was forced out of the theatre when his choice of plays met with the disapproval of the Court. He was replaced by William Davenant in 1639. All theatres were closed by Parliament in 1642, under the Commonwealth. The Cockpit was used as a schoolroom, but plays continued to be shown illegally. It was raided by Puritan soldiers during a performance in 1649 and the players were imprisoned. In 1651 William Beeston paid £200 for repairs to the theatre, in the hope that he would be able to start performances there again — though the hope proved illusory. In the last years of the English Interregnum, under the common conceit that music was not acting, Davenant was permitted to present two licensed operas in the Cockpit: \"The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru\" in 1658 and \"Sir Francis Drake\" in 1659.\n\nThe theatres were permitted to reopen after the English Restoration in 1660, when Charles II granted Letters Patent to two companies to perform \"legitimate drama\" in London: the Duke's Company, led by Davenant, and the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Both companies briefly made use of the earlier generation of theatres including the Cockpit and the Salisbury Court Theatre, but quickly moved to newer and more fashionable venues — Davenant in 1661 to a theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields that was once Lisle's Tennis Court, and Killigrew in 1660 to Gibbon's Tennis Court in Vere Street. The Cockpit was also used in this era by the companies of John Rhodes and George Jolly. Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary of several visits to the theatre between 1660 and 1663.\n\nIn 1663, Killigrew's King's Company opened the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane nearby. The Cockpit was unable to compete with this relatively grand new theatre and was further hamstrung since it was shut out of the monopoly on \"legitimate drama\" granted to the two patent companies. There is no record of any play being mounted at the Cockpit after 1665; the eventual fate of the structure is unknown.\n\nThe Phoenix was located in the middle of the area bounded today by Drury Lane, Great Queen Street, Great Wild Street, and Kemble Street. The entrance to the theatre was in Cockpit Alley, which ran from Drury Lane to Great Wild Street; the present-day Martlett Court is off Drury Lane roughly opposite where the entrance to Cockpit Alley was.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2250267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2250267", "title": "Décolletage", "text": "Décolletage\n\nDécolletage (or décolleté, its adjectival form, in current French) is a term used in woman's fashion referring to the upper part of a woman's torso, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and upper chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. The term is most commonly used in Western female fashions and is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage. Low-cut necklines are a feature of ball gowns, evening gowns, leotards, lingerie and swimsuits, among other fashions. Although décolletage does not itself prescribe the extent of exposure of a woman's upper chest, the design of a décolleté garment takes into account current fashions, aesthetics, social norms and the occasion when a garment will be worn.\n\nThough neckline styles have varied in Western societies and décolletage may be regarded as aesthetic and an expression of femininity, in some parts of the world any décolletage is considered provocative and shocking.\n\nDécolletage is a French word which is derived from \"décolleter\", meaning to reveal the neck. The term was first used in English literature sometime before 1831. In strict usage, décolletage is the neckline extending about two handbreadths from the base of the neck down, front and back.\n\nIn Indonesia (especially in Java), a breast cloth known as \"kemben\" was worn for centuries until the 20th century. Today, shoulder-exposing gowns still feature in many Indonesian rituals.\n\nGowns which exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and non-controversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage. During that long period, low-cut dresses partially exposing breasts were considered more acceptable than they are today; a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders were considered more risqué than exposed breasts.\n\nIn 1450, Agnès Sorel, mistress to Charles VII of France, is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with fully bared breasts in the French court. Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included Simonetta Vespucci, whose portrait with exposed breasts was painted by Piero di Cosimo in c. 1480.\n\nBased on woodcut prints, a researcher has argued that during the 17th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. Anne of Brittany has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.\n\nIn aristocratic and upper-class circles, the display of breasts was at times regarded as a status symbol, as a sign of beauty, wealth or social position. From the Renaissance onwards, the bared breast even invoked associations with nude sculptures of classical Greece that were exerting an influence on art, sculpture, and architecture of the period.\n\nAfter the French Revolution décolletage become larger in the front and less in the back. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses which bared the bosom and shoulders.\n\nDuring the Victorian period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end of the 19th century), the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions. (See 1880s in fashion.) In 1884, a portrait painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Paris socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, was criticised when she was depicted in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884, his reputation in tatters. The painting was named \"Portrait of Madame X\".\n\nWhen it became fashionable, around 1913, for dresses to be worn with what would now be considered a relatively modest round or V-shaped neckline, clergymen all over the world became deeply shocked. In the German Empire, all of the Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions. Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more permitted in Western societies, during World War I and remained so for nearly half a century.\n\nIn 1953, Hollywood film \"The French Line\" was found objectionable under the strict Hays Code with some of Jane Russell's décolletage gowns being described as \"intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme décolletage\". But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, Gina Lollobrigida raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations.\n\nDuring a short period in 1964, \"topless\" dress designs appeared at fashion shows, but those who wore the dresses in public found themselves arrested on indecency charges.\n\nLow necklines usually result in increased décolletage. In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much body, and especially breast, exposure is acceptable in public. What is considered the appropriate neckline varies by context, and is open to differences of opinion. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, Southwest Airlines crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters, or to leave the plane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable. German Chancellor Angela Merkel created controversy when she wore a low-cut evening gown to the opening of the Oslo Opera House in 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15944015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15944015", "title": "Futurism (literature)", "text": "Futurism (literature)\n\nFuturism is a modernist avant-garde movement in literature and part of the Futurism art movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's \"Manifesto of Futurism\" (1909). Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have no place in the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.\n\nIn Marinetti's 1909 manifesto, Marinetti calls for the reawakening of \"divine intuition\" that \"after hours of relentless toil\" allows for the \"creative spirit seems suddenly to shake off its shackles and become prey to an incomprehensible spontaneity of conception and execution\". \n\nSoffici had a more earthly reasoning. Intuition was the means by which creation took place. He believed that there could be no abstraction of the values of futurist literature in logical terms. Rather, art was a language in and of itself that could only be expressed in that language. Any attempt to extrapolate from the literature resulted \"in the evaluation not of artistic qualities but of extraneous matters\". As such, the spontaneous creation brought by intuition freed one from abstracting (and therefore adding erroneous material into the literature) and allowed on to speak in the language of art.\n\nIn this way, Futurists rallied against \"intellectualistic literature…[and] intelligible poetry\". However, this idea is different from anti-intellectualism. They were not hostile to intellectual approaches, but just the specific intellectual approach that poetry had taken for so many years. Therefore, they often rejected any form of tradition as it had been tainted with the previous intellectual approaches of the past.\n\nAnalogy's purpose in Futurist writing was to show that everything related to one another. They helped to unveil this true reality lying underneath the surface of existence. That is to say, despite what the experience might show one, everything is in fact interconnected. The more startling the comparison, the more successful it is.\n\nThe means for creating these analogies is intuition. This intuition is \"the poet's peculiar quality in that it enables him to discover analogies which, hidden to reason, are yet the essentials of art\". The discovering of analogies is made possible by intuition.\n\nNow, Marinetti believed that analogies have always existed, but earlier poets had not reached out enough to bring appropriately disparate entities together. By creating a communion of two (or more) seemingly unrelated objects, the poet pierces to the \"essence of reality\". The farther the poet has to reach in terms of logical remoteness is in direct proportion to its efficacy.\n\nAs analogy thus plays such an important role, it \"offers a touchstone to gauge poetical values…: the power to startle. The artistic criterion derived from analogy is stupefaction\". While an ordinary person's vision is colored by convention and tradition, the poet can brush away this top layer to reveal the reality below. The process of communicating the surprise is art while the \"stupefaction\" is the reaction to this discovery. Thus, analogies are the essence of poetry for the Futurists.\n\nAs the Futurists advocated the aforementioned intuition and the bucking of tradition, one might assume that they would suppress the use of irony. On the contrary, irony proved to be \"so old and forgotten that it looked almost new when the dust was brushed away from it. What was new and untried, at least more so than their principles and theories, were the futurists' stylistic devices\".\n\nFuturists believed that the constraints of syntax were inappropriate to modern life and that it did not truly represent the mind of the poet. Syntax would act as a filter in which analogies had to be processed and so analogies would lose their characteristic \"stupefaction.\" By abolishing syntax, the analogies would become more effective. \nThe practical realization of this ideal meant that many parts of speech were discarded: Adjectives were thought to bring nuance in \"a universe which is…black and white\"; the infinitive provided all the idea of an action one needed without the hindrances of conjugation; substantives followed their linked substantives without other words (by the notion of analogy). Punctuation, moods, and tenses, also disappeared in order to be consistent with analogy and \"stupefaction.\"\n\nHowever, the Futurists were not truly abolishing syntax. White points out that since \"The OED defines 'syntax' as 'the arrangement of words in their proper forms) by which their connection and relation in a sentence are shown\". The Futurists were not destroying syntax in that sense. Marinetti in truth advocated a number of \"substantial, but nevertheless selective modifications to existing syntax\" and that the \"Russian Futurists' idea that they were 'shaking syntax loose'\" is more accurate.\n\nEarly Futurist poetry relied on free verse as their poetical vehicle. However, free verse \"was too thoroughly bound up with tradition and too fond of producing…stale effects\" to be effective. Furthermore, by using free verse, the Futurist realized they would be working under the rules of syntax and therefore interfering with intuition and inspiration.\n\nIn order to break free of the shackles of meter, they resorted to what they called \"\"parole in libertá\" (word autonomy)\". Essentially, all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern instead of the meter. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.\n\nFor example, in the poem entitled \"Studio\" by Soffici, he \"describes the artist's studio—and by extension, modern man himself—as becoming a 'radiotelefantastic cabin open to all messages', the sense of wonder her being transmitted by the portmanteau neologism: 'readotelefantastica'\". Here all notions of familiar language have been abandoned and in their place a new language has emerged with its own vocabulary.\n\nThere were four forms of onomatopoeia that the Futurists advocated: direct, indirect, integral, and abstract. The first of these four is the usually onomatopoeia seen in typical poetry, e.g. boom, splash, tweet. They convey the most realistic translation of sound into language. Indirect onomatopoeia \"expressed the subjective responses to external conditions\".\n\nIntegral onomatopoeia was \"the introduction of any and every sound irrespective of its similarity to significant words\". This meant that any collection of letters could represent a sound. The final form of onomatopoeia did not reference external sounds or movements like the aforementioned versions of onomatopoeia. Rather, they tried to capture the internal motions of the soul.\n\nIn order to better provide stark, contrasting, analogies, the Futurist literature promoted a kind of hyper-conciseness. It was dubbed essential and synthetic lyricism. The former refers to a paring down of any and all superfluous objects while the latter expresses an unnatural compactness of the language unseen elsewhere. This idea explains where poetry became the preferred literary medium of Futurism and why there are no Futurist novels (since novels are neither pared down nor compressed).\n\nTraditional theatre often served as a target for Futurists because of its deep roots in classical societies. In its stead, the Futurists exalted the variety theatre, vaudeville, and music hall because, they argued, it \"had no tradition; it was a recent discovery\". Vaudevillian acts aligned themselves well to the notions of \"stupefaction\" as there was the desire to surprise and excite the audience. Furthermore, the heavy use of machinery attracted the Futurists, as well as Vaudevillian acts' tendency to \"destroy\" the masterpieces of the past through parody and other forms of depreciation. \n\nBy adding other Futurist ideals mentioned above, they firmly rooted their beliefs into theatre. They wanted to blur the line between art and life in order to reach below the surface to reality. In practice, this manifested itself in various ways:\n\nHowever, the most important aspect of the work was the discrediting of the great works of theatre. These new theatrical ideal of the Futurists helped to establish a new genre of theatre: the synthetic play.\n\nThis type of play took the idea of compression to an extreme, where \"a brief performance in which entire acts were reduced to a few sentences, and scenes to a handful of words. No sentiments, no psychological development, no atmosphere, no suggestiveness. Common sense was banished, or rather, replaced by nonsense\". There did exist some plays similar to this before the Futurists, but they did not conform to the Futurist agenda. The creator of the first modern synthetic play is thought to be Verlaine, with his aptly titled work \"Excessive Haste\".\n\nVeemente dio d’una razza d’acciaio,\nAutomobile ebbra di spazio,\nche scalpiti e fremi d’angoscia\nrodendo il morso con striduli denti\nFormidabile mostro giapponese,\ndagli occhi di fucina,\nnutrito di fiamma\ne d’olî minerali,\navido d’orizzonti, di prede siderali\nIo scateno il tuo cuore che tonfa diabolicamente,\nscateno i tuoi giganteschi pneumatici,\nper la danza che tu sai danzare\nvia per le bianche strade di tutto il mondo!\nVehement god from a race of steel,\nAutomobile drunk with space,\nTrampling with anguish, bit between your strident teeth!\nO formidable Japanese monster with forge,\nNourished with flame and mineral oils,\nHungry for horizons and sidereal prey,\nI unleash your heart to the diabolical vroom-vroom\nAnd your giant radials, for the dance\nYou lead on the white roads of the world.\n\nthey were three three\nthe he and the other the other\nand the other was a real triangle a true\nyounger brother of the file\nof steel rusty stell\nthat he in the frenzy\nof possession only his only his alone\nseized abruptly and thrust theeeeere\ninto the pure white velvet of her belly\nplugging her new opening with his flesh\nwith his virile flesh\nah ah ah\nahh ahh ahh\nahe haaaahh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1117945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117945", "title": "Greek art", "text": "Greek art\n\nGreek art began in the Cycladic and Minoan civilization, and gave birth to Western classical art in the subsequent Geometric, Archaic and Classical periods (with further developments during the Hellenistic Period). It absorbed influences of Eastern civilizations, of Roman art and its patrons, and the new religion of Orthodox Christianity in the Byzantine era and absorbed Italian and European ideas during the period of Romanticism (with the invigoration of the Greek Revolution), until the Modernist and Postmodernist. \nGreek art is mainly five forms: architecture, sculpture, painting, pottery and jewelry making.\n\nArtistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek Cycladic and the Minoan civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient Egypt.\n\nThere are three scholarly divisions of the stages of later ancient Greek art that correspond roughly with historical periods of the same names. These are the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The Archaic period is usually dated from 1000 BC. The Persian Wars of 480 BC to 448 BC are usually taken as the dividing line between the Archaic and the Classical periods, and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC is regarded as the event separating the Classical from the Hellenistic period. Of course, different forms of art developed at different speeds in different parts of the Greek world, and varied to a degree from artist to artist. There was a sharp transition from one period to another.\n\nThe art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the culture of many countries from ancient times until the present, particularly in the areas of sculpture and architecture. In the West, the art of the Roman Empire was largely derived from Greek models. In the East, Alexander the Great's conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, resulting in Greco-Buddhist art, with ramifications as far as Japan. Following the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Pottery was either blue with black designs or black with blue designs.\n\nByzantine art is the term created for the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire.)\nThe term can also be used for the art of states which were contemporary with the Persian Empire and shared a common culture with it, without actually being part of it, such as Bulgaria, or Russia, and also Venice, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire despite being in other respects part of western European culture. It can also be used for the art of people of the former Byzantine Empire under the rule of Ottoman Empire after 1453. In some respects the Byzantine artistic tradition has continued in Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.\n\nByzantine art grew from the art of ancient Greece and, at least before 1453, never lost sight of its classical heritage, but was distinguished from it in a number of ways. The most profound of these was that the humanist ethic of ancient Greek art was replaced by the Christian ethic. If the purpose of classical art was the glorification of man, the purpose of Byzantine art was the glorification of God.\n\nIn place of the nude, the figures of God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs of Christian tradition were elevated and became the dominant - indeed almost exclusive - focus of Byzantine art. One of the most important forms of Byzantine art was, and still is, theded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first signiand the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Cretan School\" describes the school of icon painting, also known as \"Post-Byzantine art\", which flourished while Crete was under Venetian rule during the late Middle Ages, reaching its climax after the Fall of Constantinople, becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements; the most famous product of the school, El Greco, was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe, and also the one who left the Byzantine style farthest behind him in his later career.\n\nThe \"Heptanese School\" of painting (, also known as the \"Ionian Islands' School\") succeeded the Cretan School as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the Ottomans in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing Western European artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the Ionian Islands, which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.\n\nModern Greek art, after the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, began to be developed around the time of Romanticism. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. After centuries of Ottoman rule, few opportunities for an education in the arts existed in the newly independent Greece, so studying abroad was imperative for artists. Munich, as an important international center for the arts at that time, was the place where the majority of the Greek artists of the 19th century chose to study. Later on, they would return to Greece and pass on their knowledge. Both academic and personal bonds developed between early Greek painters and Munich artistry giving birth to the Greek \"Munich School\" (Greek academic art of the 19th century). Nikolaos Gysis was an important teacher and artist at the Munich Academy and he soon became a leading figure among Greek artists. Many of these Munich School artists chose subjects such as everyday Greek life, local customs, and living conditions. Several important painters emerged at this time. Theodoros Vryzakis specialized in historical painting and especially inspired by the 1821 Greek War of Independence. Nikiphoros Lytras concentrated on realistic depictions of Greek life. Georgios Jakobides devoted his attention to infants and children and he would laterbecome the first Director of the new National Gallery of Athens. Georgios Roilos was another leading painter of the period closely associated with the Munich School, especially in his early career. Konstantinos Volanakis was inspired mostly by the Greek sea.\n\nOther notable painters of the era are Theodore Ralli, Ioannis Altamouras and the folk painter Theofilos Hatzimichail. Notable sculptors of the era are Leonidas Drosis (his major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, Lazaros Sochos, Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, Ioannis Kossos, Yannoulis Chalepas, Georgios Bonanos and Lazaros Fytalis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Akkeringa is primarily known for his paintings and watercolours of women and playing children at the beach, women mending nets and intimate tea-time conversations.\n\nAkkeringa was born in Blinjoe in the Dutch East Indies. He was the second child of Johannes Evert Akkeringa (1829–1863), an engineer in the tin mines of the Billiton-Company at Bangka, and later at Buitenzorg. His mother, Sariedje (born in 1842), was of mixed Chinese and Javanese ethnic origin. Following the death of his father in 1864 from typhus, Akkeringa moved with his brother and sister to The Hague, where they grew up in the household of his aunt.\n\nIn the spring of 1878, at the age of seventeen, Akkeringa enrolled at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague. He quickly befriended fellow student Willem de Zwart (1862–1931) and other artists studying at the Academy, including Floris Verster (1861–1927) and Marius Bauer (1867–1932). It is likely that during this period Akkeringa met and became close to the artist Isaac Israëls (1865–1934). At the Academy the courses Akkeringa took focussed on anatomical drawing, drawing from models, as well as studying the arts of perspective and composition. After class Akkeringa, like many of his fellow students, left the city to explore and practice the art of drawing nature, discovering that he was most inspired by the landscape around The Hague. In the spring of 1883 Akkeringa received his degree, though he continued to take classes at the Academy until 1885.\n\nFrom August 1886 until the end of 1887 Akkeringa took a course at the Rotterdam Academy. In the same year he participated for the first time in the ‘Living Masters Exhibition’ at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague.\n\nLate in 1887, Akkeringa moved to The Hague. Several months later, he moved again to Loosduinen to focus entirely on his painting. During this period, the so-called ‘Loosduinse painters colony’, or ‘The Hague Barbizon’, began. Artists involved in this movement besides Akkeringa included Willem de Zwart (1862–1931), who was a great influence on Akkringas style, George Hendrik Breitner (1857–1923), Jan Toorop (1858–1928), Theo van Hoytema (1863–1917), Hendrik Otto van Thol (1859–1902), Marius Bauer (1867–1932) and several others. The artists of the Hague School were attracted to Loosduinen and the surrounding dunes, because the area was viewed as one of the last remaining authentic natural landscapes in the region.\n\nIn October 1889, Akkeringa became a member of The Hague art society, Pulchri Studio. Among others, Akkeringa and Théophile de Brock established a board for The Hague Art Circle. Unlike the Pulchri Studio, The Hague Art Circle included art forms other than painting. On 26 June 1892, Johannes Hendrik Haverman proposed Akkeringa as a friend of the art society 'Arti et Amicitiae'. On 25 February 1897 Akkeringa along with his friend Floris Arntzenius (1864–1925), was adopted as a member of the 'Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij', of which he was a board member from 1912 to 1917.\n\nIn February 1892, Akkeringa, Jan Toorop, Marius Bauer and Willem de Zwart were commissioned to illustrate a collection of fairy tales published by the Amsterdam publishing house Elsevier. The book, by Louse Ahn-De Jongh, was titled \"A Book of Imagination, Fairy Tales and Stories\" and was published in 1893. From November 1892 to October 1896 Akkeringa continued to work as an illustrator for Elsevier's 'Geïllustreerd Maandschrift' (the 'Illustrated Monthly'), to earn extra money.\n\nOn 15 September 1892 Akkeringa married his niece Willemina Suzanna (Mien) Reedijk (1866–1909), and the young couple moved to a house on the outskirts of The Hague. Shortly afterwards two sons were born, Leonard Johannes (Leo) (1893–1959) and Johannes Evert (Jan) (1894–1983). During their marriage the couple regularly moved around the growing city of The Hague and the nearby village of Scheveningen. Akkeringa preferred to live in homes on the outskirts of the city; not only did the landscapes of where he lived inspire him, but often his sons and their friends became the subjects of his paintings. In April 1903 the family, including his mother-in-law, moved to the village of Heeze in the province of North Brabant. Their home was known as 'Villa Erica'. The landscape of Heeze is the subject of many of Akkeringa’s paintings. In 1905 the family went to live in Scheveningen, where Akkeringa’s wife Mien died on 12 December 1909.\n\nOn 20 April 1917, when Akkeringa was sixty-five, he married the thirty-two-year-old Elsje Wilhelmine Enter (1895–1969). On 27 August 1921 his third son, Evert Hendrik Jan Akkeringa, was born. In 1932 Akkeringa visited his oldest son Leo, who lived in Paris; it would be the only foreign trip Akkeringa would ever make.\n\nAkkeringa died at the age of eighty-one. He was buried on 15 April 1942 at Rusthof cemetery in Amersfoort. In May that year an exhibition was held by members of the Pulchri Studio to commemorate his life and work. On 23 March 1943 the contents of Akkeringa’s studio were auctioned off by the Amsterdam auction house Frederik Muller & Cie.\n\nIn 1903, Akkringa was offered a contract by the Amsterdam-based art dealer E.J. van Wisselingh. His work was not only exhibited in Amsterdam, but also at the London branch of the company. He participated in several international exhibitions in Hamburg (1902), Budapest (1908), Berlin (1908), Pittsburgh (1904, 1907 and 1909), Buenos Aires (1910), Brussels (1910) and the Canadian city of Winnipeg (1913). From 1903 to 1914 Van Wisselingh organized a yearly exhibition at the Pulchri Studio where the work of Akkeringa was regularly shown with, in April 1904, a joint exhibition of the works of Akkeringa and fellow Dutch Indo Jan Toorop. In mid-1909 Akkeringa built a studio in the dunes at Meijendel, between The Hague and Wassenaar. The studio was financed by Van Wisselingh and served as a classroom in which Akkeringa taught his students.\n\nIn 1914 Akkeringa participated in the Venice Biennale, and the exposition ‘Tentoonstelling van werk van Nederlandsche, in Indië geboren schilders’ at the Dutch art-circle at Batavia. In 1918, Akkringa passed his secondary vocational-course at the Royal Academy of Art in The Hague, and he was appointed teacher for hand-drawing. In December 1921 Akkeringa had his first retrospective exhibition in the rooms of the Pulchri Studio. The exhibition was organized by the art dealer Van Wisselingh. In early 1924 Akkeringa’s contract with Van Wisseling, which included a monthly allowance, ended.\n\nA jubilee exhibition was organized at Pulchri Studio in January 1932 on Akkeringa’s seventy-first birthday. On 17 January 1932 an anniversary celebration was organized at Pulchri Studio, at which Akkeringa received a portfolio by his friends and admirers.\n\nIn May 1942 the last retrospective exhibition of Akkeringa's work opened in commemoration of the painter. After this exhibition Akkeringa, and mostly his work, was largely forgotten by the public. In mid-2005, the painter and his work were brought to the attention of the public again by an exhibition, organized by auction house Christie's Amsterdam, called: 'J.E.H. Akkeringa; schilders van tuin en duin'. His work is regularly sold at auction today.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "497081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497081", "title": "La haine", "text": "La haine\n\nLa haine (, \"Hate\") is a 1995 French black-and-white drama film written, co-edited, and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. It is commonly released under its French title in the English-speaking world, although its U.S. VHS release was titled Hate. It is about three young friends and their struggle to live in the \"banlieues\" of Paris. The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert, \"La haine attire la haine!\", \"hatred breeds hatred.\"\n\nThe film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French housing project (a ZUP\"\") in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot. Jewish Vinz (Vincent Cassel) is filled with rage. He sees himself as a gangster ready to win respect by killing a police officer, manically practising the role of Travis Bickle from the film \"Taxi Driver\" in the mirror secretly. His attitude towards police is a simplified, stylized blanket condemnation, also to individual police officers who make an effort to steer the trio clear of troublesome situations. Hubert (Hubert Koundé) is an Afro-French boxer and small-time drug dealer, the most mature of the three, whose gymnasium was burned in the riots. The quietest, most thoughtful and wisest of the three, he sadly contemplates the ghetto and the hate around him. He expresses the wish to leave his world of violence and hate behind, but does not know how since he lacks the means to do so. SaïdSayid in some English subtitles(Saïd Taghmaoui) is an Arab Maghrebi who inhabits the middle ground between his two friends' responses to their place in life.\n\nA friend of theirs, Abdel Ichaha, has been brutalized by the police shortly before the riot and lies in a coma. Vinz finds a police officer's .44 Magnum revolver, lost in the riot. He vows that if their friend dies from his injuries, he will use it to kill a cop, and when he hears of Abdel's death he fantasizes carrying out his vengeance.\n\nThe three go through an aimless daily routine and struggle to entertain themselves, frequently finding themselves under police scrutiny. After Vinz nearly shoots a riot police officer and the group narrowly escapes, they take a train to Paris but encounter many of the same frustrations, and their responses to interactions with both benign and malicious Parisians cause several situations to degenerate to dangerous hostility. A run-in with sadistic plainclothes police, during which Saïd and Hubert are humiliated and racially as well as physically abused, results in their missing the last train home and spending the night on the streets. They sleep in a shopping mall and wake to a news broadcast informing them that Abdel is dead. They travel to a roof-top from which they insult skinheads and policemen, before encountering the same group of racist anti-immigrant skinheads who begin to beat Saïd and Hubert savagely, now that the balance of power has shifted. Vinz arrives, and his gun allows him to break up the fight; all the skinheads flee except one (portrayed by Kassovitz himself) whom Vinz is about to execute in cold blood. His dream of revenge is thwarted by his reluctance to go through with the deed, and, cleverly goaded by Hubert, he is forced to confront the fact that his true nature is not the heartless gangster he poses as, and he lets the skinhead flee.\n\nEarly in the morning, the trio returns to the banlieue and split up to their separate homes, and Vinz turns the gun over to Hubert. However, Vinz and Saïd encounter a plainclothes police officer, whom Vinz had insulted earlier in the day whilst with his friends on a local rooftop. He grabs and threatens Vinz, making reference to the earlier incident on the roof. Hubert rushes to their aid, but as the police officer holding Vinz taunts him with a loaded gun held to Vinz's head, the gun accidentally goes off, killing Vinz instantly. Hubert and the police officer slowly and deliberately point their guns at each other, and as the film cuts to Saïd closing his eyes and cuts to black, a shot is heard on the soundtrack, with no indication of who fired or who may have been hit. This stand-off is underlined by a voice-over of Hubert's slightly modified opening lines (\"It's about a society in free fall...\"), underlining the fact that, as the lines say, \"jusqu'ici tout va bien\" (\"so far so good\"); all seems to be going relatively well until Vinz is killed, and from there no one knows what will happen, a microcosm of French society's descent through hostility into pointless violence.\n\nKassovitz has said that the idea came to him when a young Zairian, Makome M’Bowole, was shot in 1993. He was killed at point blank range while in police custody and handcuffed to a radiator. The officer was reported to have been angered by Makome's words, and had been threatening him when the gun went off accidentally. Kassovitz began writing the script on April 6, 1993, the day M'Bowole was shot. He was also inspired by the case of Malik Oussekine, a 22-year-old student protester who died after being badly beaten by the riot police after a mass demonstration in 1986, in which he did not take part. Oussekine's death is also referred to in the opening montage of the film. Mathieu Kassovitz included his own experiences; he took part in riots, he acts in a number of scenes and includes his father Peter in another.\n\nThe majority of the filming was done in the Parisian suburb of Chanteloup-les-Vignes. Unstaged footage was used for this film, taken from 1986–96; riots still took place during the time of filming. To actually film in the projects, Kassovitz, the production team and the actors, moved there for three months prior to the shooting as well as during actual filming. Due to the film's controversial subject matter, seven or eight local French councils refused to allow the film crew to film on their territory. Kassovitz was forced to temporarily rename the script Droit de Cité. Some of the actors were not professionals. The film has a documentary feel and includes many situations that were based on real events.\n\nThe music of the film was handled by French hardcore rap group Assassin, whose song \"Nique La Police\" (translated as \"Fuck The Police\") was featured in one of the scenes of the film. One of the members of Assassin, Mathias \"Rockin' Squat\" Crochon, is the brother of Vincent Cassel, who plays Vinz in the film.\n\nThe film is dedicated to those who died while it was being made.\n\nUpon its release, \"La haine\" received widespread critical acclaim and was well received in France and abroad. The film was shown at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival where it enjoyed a standing ovation. Kassovitz was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival. The film had a total of 2,042,070 admissions in France where it was the 14th highest-grossing film of the year. Based on 25 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 100%, with an average score of 8/10. Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film \"raw, vital and captivating\". Wendy Ide of \"The Times\" stated that \"La haine\" is \"One of the most blisteringly effective pieces of urban cinema ever made.\"\n\nAfter the film was well received upon its release in France, Alain Juppé, who was Prime Minister of France at the time, commissioned a special screening of the film for the cabinet, which ministers were required to attend. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that, despite resenting some of the anti-police themes present in the film, Juppé found \"La haine\" to be \"a beautiful work of cinematographic art that can make us more aware of certain realities.\"\n\nIt was ranked #32 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\n\n\"La haine\" was available on VHS in the United States, but was not released on DVD until The Criterion Collection released a 2-disc edition in 2007. The film has been shown on many Charter Communications Channels. Both HD DVD and Blu-ray versions have also been released in Europe, and Criterion released the film on Blu-ray in May 2012. The release includes audio commentary by Kassovitz, an introduction by actor Jodie Foster, \"Ten Years of \"La haine\"\", a documentary that brings together cast and crew a decade after the film's landmark release, a featurette on the film's banlieue setting, production footage, and deleted and extended scenes, each with an afterword by Kassovitz.\n\n\n"}

The first volume was published in February 2008.\n\n\n\n\nPublished in 2008\n\nAfter years of incessant fighting, the war between humanity and the High Beasts is brought to an end after the humans begin using firearms, forcing the comparatively primitive High Beasts to declare a truce. It is decided that an interspecific marriage be formed between Aube, the daughter of the human nobleman Arcan, and Loup-de-Feu, the son of the Beast Lord Loup-de-Traille. Aube is not pleased with the arrangement, believing that the product of such a union would be a blasphemy. When the time comes to consummate the marriage, Aube's brother Saliat assassinates Loup-de-Feu, and escapes with his sister while the High Beasts declare the truce null. After the High Beasts indulge in a slaughter, Arcan is approached by Griffe-Tout, a lynx who offers to give him information on his daughter on the condition that he sacrifice a pound of his own flesh to him. He reveals that Saliat has been killed by the High Beasts, while Aube escaped to the Wood of Virgins, an area from only virgins can come out alive.\n\nYears later, the war between the two races has reached a stalemate, with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Though the humans are technologically superior, the High Beasts are physically stronger, more numerous, and have faster growth rates, thus allowing troops to be replenished quicker. In order to break the stalemate, the humans send an envoy, Hugo, to find the banished Lord Clam, who is a famed wolf killer. Under similar orders from his own superior officer, Loup-de-Traille reluctantly accepts to find his eldest and most skilled son, Loup-Gris whom he previously disowned for having married a fox. Loup-de-Traille discovers that his son now has two hybrid children, and refuses to involve himself in the war. Suspecting that his son's wife Lady Goupil has softened him, Loup-de-Traille leaves heavy hearted. Along the way, he finds a band of human bandits attacking a group of foxes. Loup-de-Traille intervenes, but is decapitated by the bandit leader. His body is found by Griffe-Tout and his band of lynxes, and is taken to his son, who decides to form an alliance of High and Low Beasts in order to defeat the human forces. Meanwhile, Hugo discovers a delirious human soldier covered in plant-like growths. Hugo takes him to a monastery, where it is discovered that he found Aube in the Wood of Virgins. The abbot of the monastery reveals himself to be the disgraced Arcan, who offers to aide in the war effort on condition that his daughter be found and returned to him. Hugo crosses a cursed swamp filled inhabited by tree spirits, and finds Clam in a Church, taking a sacrament. The two depart to the Wood of Virgins.\n\nPublished in 2010\n\n2012\n\n"}
{"id": "28159341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28159341", "title": "Legends about Theoderic the Great", "text": "Legends about Theoderic the Great\n\nIn legends about Theoderic the Great that spread after his death, the Gothic king Theoderic became known as Dietrich von Bern, a king ruling from Verona (Bern) who was forced into exile with the Huns. The differences between the known life of Theoderic and the picture of Dietrich in the surviving legends are usually attributed to a long-standing oral tradition that continued into the sixteenth century. The majority of legendary material about Dietrich/Theoderic comes from high and late medieval Germany and is composed in Middle High German or Early New High German. Another important source for legends about Dietrich is the Old Norse \"Thidrekssaga\", which was written using German sources. In addition to the legends detailing events that may reflect the historical Theoderic's life in some fashion, many of the legends tell of Dietrich's battles against dwarfs, dragons, giants, and other mythical beings, as well as other heroes such as Siegfried. Dietrich also appears as a supporting character in other heroic poems such as the \"Nibelungenlied\", and is frequently referenced and alluded to throughout medieval German literature.\n\nPoems about Dietrich were extremely popular among the medieval German nobility and, later, the late medieval and early modern bourgeoisie, but were frequently targets of criticism by persons writing on behalf of the church. Though some continued to be printed in the seventeenth century, most of the legends were slowly forgotten after 1600. They became objects of academic study by the end of the sixteenth century, and were revived somewhat in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, resulting in some stories about Dietrich being popular in South Tyrol, where many of the legends take place.\n\nAlthough the lives of Dietrich von Bern and Theoderic the Great have many important differences, it was never questioned throughout the entire Middle Ages that the two were the same figure. Modern scholarship therefore generally accepts this identification and has focused on ways to explain the main differences between Theoderic and Dietrich.\n\nThe most striking difference is that, whereas Theoderic the Great conquerred Italy as an invader, Dietrich von Bern is portrayed as exiled from his rightful kingdom in Italy. Victor Millet suggests that this difference in particular shows that heroic tradition has a fundamental discontinuity with the historical events that inspire it. In effect, Theoderic's conquest has been transformed according to a literary scheme consisting of exile, then return, a story which has a relatively consistent set of recurring motifs throughout world literature. The story told in the heroic tradition is nevertheless meant to convey a particular understanding of the historical event, namely: that Dietrich/Theoderic was in the right when he conquered Italy. To some extent, the development of the \"exile-saga\" of Theoderic can be traced in early medieval chronicles, where Theoderic is said to \"reconquer\" Italy and other information known from the later saga and not history is reported. Dietrich's exile and repeated failed attempts to reconquer his rightful kingdom, as reported in the later historical poems, may also be a reflection of the destruction of the Theoderic's Gothic kingdom by the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I. This is particularly true for the figure of Witege and his betrayal at Ravenna, as told in \"Die Rabenschlacht\". Millet notes, furthermore, that Dietrich is portrayed as without any heirs and that his closest relatives and supporters die in every attempt to reclaim Italy: this too could be a way to explain the short duration of Ostrogothic rule in Italy.\n\nA particularly noticeable difference between Theoderic and Dietrich is that, in the stories about Dietrich recorded from the High Middle Ages, Dietrich/Theoderic (454-526) is a contemporary of Etzel (Attila the Hun, died 453) and his uncle is semi-legendary Gothic king Ermenrich (Ermanaric, died 370s). Their co-existence in the world of heroic legend is a process known as synchronization (\"Synchronisierung\") that is common in many oral traditions. In the case of Dietrich, its development can even be traced, to some extent: Dietrich is already associated with an exile among the Huns in the Old High German \"Hildebrandslied\" (before 900), and possibly with Etzel/Attila, depending on how one interprets the mentioned \"huneo druhtin\" (Hunnish lord). It nevertheless still retains Theoderic's historical opponent Odoacer, seemingly showing that Odoacer was the original opponent. It is also possible that the author of the \"Hildebrandslied\" altered the report in the oral saga by replacing the unhistorical Emenrich with the historical Odoacer. In the \"Annals of Quedlinburg\" (1008), Odoacer and Dietrich have both become relatives of Ermenrich; at roughly the same time, Dietrich appears together with Witege, a hero originally associated with Ermanaric, in the Old English \"Waldere\" fragment. It is possible that Ermenrich/Ermanaric was drawn into the story due to his historical enmity with the Huns, who destroyed his kingdom. He was famous for killing his relatives, moreover, and so his attempts to kill his kinsman Dietrich make sense in the logic of the oral tradition. By the 1000s, almost all figures of Germanic legend had been connected together in a heroic age, uniting the sagas of Etzel/Attila, Dietrich/Theoderic/Ermenrich/Ermanaric, Wayland the Smith, and the Nibelungen.\n\nAdditionally, Dietrich has a number of features that have been \"mythologized\" from Theoderic. In the early eleventh-century \"Waldere\" he is an enemy of giants, and in later Middle High German texts he also fights against dwarfs, and wild men. Even more notable is the fact that multiple texts record Dietrich breathing fire. It is possible that this tradition comes from ecclesiastical criticism of the Arian Theoderic, whose soul, Gregory the Great reports, was dropped into Mount Etna as punishment for his persecution of orthodox Christians. Another notable tradition, first reported in the world chronicle of Otto of Freising (1143-1146), is that Theoderic rode to hell on an infernal horse while still alive. He is attested as a ghostly rider appearing near the Moselle in the \"Chronica regia Coloniensia\" from before 1202, and as a spectral hunter of \"nymphs\" in the forest at night by the Veronese chronicler Giovanni Mansionario around 1320. Lusatian folklore in the nineteenth century may have identified Dietrich as the leader of the Wild Hunt. Other traditions record that Theoderic was the son of the devil. It is unclear whether these negative traditions are the invention of the Church or whether they are a demonization of an earlier apotheosis of the heretical Theoderic. None of the surviving heroic material demonizes Dietrich in this way, however, and presents a generally positive view of the hero. Many of the texts show a tendency to minimize or explain away traits such as Dietrich's fiery breath.\n\nAnother minor difference between Theoderic and Dietrich is that Theoderic's capital was at Ravenna, whereas Dietrich's is at Bern (Verona). This may suggest Longobardic influence, as Verona was the Longobardic capital for a time, while Ravenna was under the control of the Byzantines. The figure of Dietrich's tutor and mentor Hildebrand is also often thought to derive from Longobardic influence. Heinzle suggests that the exile-saga may have been first told among the Longobards, giving the end of the sixth century as the latest date at which the story may have formed, with the Longobardic conquest of Italy. Dietrich has been identified as \"Dietrich \"von Bern\"\" (Middle High German for Verona) or \"Theodericus Veronensis\" since at least the composition of the \"Annals of Quedlinburg\".\n\nThe non-academic researcher Heinz Ritter-Schaumburg has proposed an alternative explanation to the differences between Dietrich and Theoderic: according to Ritter-Schaumburg, Dietrich von Bern was an otherwise unattested historical Frankish king who ruled in Bonn, which sometimes is Latinized as Verona. In doing so, Ritter-Schaumburg relies on the Old Swedish version of the Thidrekssaga, believing that it is a translation of a lost German chronicle, rather than a translation of the Old Norwegian Thidrekssaga as is generally held by scholars. The Old Swedish Thidrekssaga, which Ritter-Schaumburg calls the \"Svava\", would be the only historical attestation of a series of persons who later became figures in Germanic heroic poetry; Dietrich would then later have been confused with Theoderic the Great. Ritter-Schaumburg's theory has been rejected by academic scholars, but has found some following among amateur saga-researchers. It receives no mention in the majority of introductions to either the Dietrich or Nibelungen material.\n\nOne of the earliest (quasi-)literary sources about the legend of Theoderic is the Rök Stone, carved in Sweden in the 9th century. There he is mentioned in a stanza in Eddic meter:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Þjóðríkr the bold,\nchief of sea-warriors,\nruled over the shores of the Hreiðsea.\nNow he sits armed\non his Goth(ic horse),\nhis shield strapped,\nthe prince of the Mærings.</poem>\n\nThe mention of Theoderic (among other heroes and gods of Norse mythology) may have been inspired by a no longer extant statue of an unknown emperor assumed to be Theoderic sitting on his horse in Ravenna, which was moved in 801 A.D. to Aachen by Charlemagne. This statue was very famous and portrayed Theoderic with his shield hanging across his left shoulder, and his lance extended in his right hand: the German clerical poet Walahfrid wrote a poem (De imagine Tetrici) lampooning the statue, as Theoderic was not favorably regarded by the church. Alternatively, Otto Höfler has proposed that Theoderic on the horse may be connected in some way to traditions of Theoderic as the Wild Huntsman (see the Wunderer below); rejects this interpretation.\n\nDietrich's earliest mention in Germany is the Hildebrandslied, recorded around 820. In this, Hadubrand recounts the story of his father Hildebrand's flight eastwards in the company of Dietrich, to escape the enmity of Odoacer (this character would later become his uncle Ermanaric). Hildebrand reveals that he has lived in exile for 30 years. Hildebrand has an arm ring given to him by the (unnamed) King of the Huns, and is taken to be an \"old Hun\" by Hadubrand. The obliqueness of the references to the Dietrich legend, which is just the background to Hildebrand's story, indicates an audience thoroughly familiar with the material. In this work Dietrich's enemy is the historically correct Odoacer (though in fact Theoderic the Great was never exiled by Odoacer), indicating that the figure of Ermanaric belongs to a later development of the legend.\n\nDietrich furthermore is mentioned in the Old English poems \"Waldere\", \"Deor\" and \"Widsith\". \"Deor\" marks the first mention to Dietrich's \"thirty years\" (probably his exile) and refers to him, like the Rök stone, as a Mæring. The \"Waldere\" makes mention of Dietrich's liberation from the captivity of giants by Witige (Widia), for which Dietrich rewarded Witige with a sword. This liberation forms the plot of the later fantastical poem \"Virginal\" and is mentioned in the historical poem \"Alpharts Tod\". \"Widsith\" mentions him among a number of other Gothic heroes, including Witige, Heime, the Harlungen and Ermanaric, and in connection with a battle with Attila's Huns. However, the exact relationship between the figures is not explained.\n\nDietrich von Bern first appears in Middle High German heroic poetry in the Nibelungenlied. There he appears in the exile situation at Etzel's court that forms the basis for the historical Dietrich poems (see below). Dietrich also appears in the \"Nibelungenklage\", a work closely related to the \"Nibelungenlied\" that describes the aftermath of that poem. In the \"Klage\", Dietrich returns from exile to his kingdom of Italy; the poem also alludes to the events described in the later Rabenschlacht. Poems with Dietrich as the main character begin to enter writing afterwards, with the earliest attested being the fantastical poem the Eckenlied (c. 1230). The oral tradition continued alongside this written tradition, with influences from the oral tradition visible in the written texts, and with the oral tradition itself most likely altered in response to the written poems.\n\nThe Middle High German Dietrich poems are usually divided into two categories: historical poems and fantastical (or \"fairy tale\") poems. The former concern the story of Dietrich's fights against Ermenrich and exile at Etzel's court, whereas in the latter he battles against various mythological creatures. This latter group is often called \"aventiurehaft\" in German, referring to its similarity to courtly romance. While Edward Haymes and Susan Samples believe that the distinctions between the two types are not strict, Joachim Heinzle notes that the two groups are never transmitted together in the same manuscripts. The two types are joined together in the Old Norse Thidrekssaga, based on German sources, and to a lesser extent in the Heldenbuchprosa. Despite connections made between different Dietrich poems and to other heroic cycles such as the Nibelungenlied, Wolfdietrich, and Ortnit, the Dietrich poems never form a closed poetic cycle, with the relationships between the different poems being rather loose: there is no attempt to establish a concrete biography of Dietrich. Rather, the heroic tales and their characters seem to form a sort of \"matter,\" similar to the Matter of Britain, Matter of France, and Matter of Rome, in which ever more new episodes can be invented using both new and existing characters in the situations characteristic of the tales and poems that already exist.\n\nThe historical Dietrich poems in Middle High German consist of Dietrichs Flucht, Die Rabenschlacht, and \"Alpharts Tod\", with the fragmentary poem Dietrich und Wenezlan as a possible fourth. All involve Dietrich's exile at Etzel's court except \"Alpharts Tod\", which takes place before Dietrich's expulsion, and all involve his battles against Ermenrich, except for \"Dietrich und Wenezlan\", in which he fights against Wenezlan of Poland. All four postdate Dietrich's appearance in the Nibelungenlied. They are called historical because they concern war rather than adventure, and are seen as containing a warped version of Theoderic's life. Given the combination of elements also found in these texts with historical events in some chronicles, and the vehement denunciation of the saga by learned chroniclers, it is possible that these texts-or the oral tradition behind them-were themselves considered historical.\nThe majority of preserved narratives about Dietrich are fantastical in nature, involving battles against mythical beings and other heroes. They are generally regarded as containing newer material than the historical poems, though, as the Old English Waldere's references show, Dietrich was already associated with monsters at an early date. Many of the poems show a close connect to the Tyrol, and connections between them and Tyrolean folklore are often speculated upon, even in cases where the text itself clearly originated in a different German speaking area. Most of the poems seem to take place prior to Dietrich's exile, with Witige and Heime still members of Dietrich's entourage, though not all: the \"Eckenlied\" prominently features references to the events of \"Die Rabenschlacht\" as already having taken place.\n\nDifferent exemplars of the fantastical poems often show a huge degree of variation from each other (Germ. \"Fassungsdivergenz\"), a trait not found in the historical poems. Most fantastical poems have at least two versions containing substantial differences in the narrative, including inserting or removing entire episodes or altering the motivation of characters, etc. The scholar Harald Haferland has proposed that the differences may come from a practice of reciting entire poems from memory, using set formula to fill in lines and occasionally adding or deleting episodes. Haferland nevertheless believes thattThe poems were likely composed as written texts, and thus periodically new versions were written down. Haferland relates this latter process to the psychological term confabulation, the invention of false memories to fill in stories.\n\nThe majority of the fantastical poems can be said to follow two basic narrative schemes, in some cases combining them: the liberation of a woman from a threatening legendary being, and the challenging of Dietrich to combat by some antagonist. The combinations of these schemes can at times lead to narrative breaks and inconsistencies in character motivation.\n\nAlmost all the poems about Dietrich are written in stanzas. Melodies for some of the stanzaic forms have survived, and they were probably meant to be sung. Several poems are written in rhyming couplets, however, a form more common for courtly romance or chronicles. These poems are \"Dietrichs Flucht\", \"Dietrich und Wenezlan\", most versions of \"Laurin\", and some versions of the \"Wunderer\".\n\nMuch of the poem \"Alphart's Tod\" is written in the same stanza as the \"Nibelungenlied\": it consists of four so-called \"Langzeilen.\" The first three \"Langzeilen\" consist of three metrical feet, a caesura, and an additional three metrical feet. The last line adds a fourth foot after the caesura. Several of the poems are written using a variant of this stanza, known as the \"Hildebrandston\" for its use in the \"Jüngeres Hildebrandslied\". Unlike the \"Nibelungenlied-\"stanza, all four lines in the \"Hildebrandston\" are of the same length: three metrical feet, followed by a caesura, then three additional metrical feet. Both types of stanza rhyme in couplets. Some poems use a variant of the \"Hildebrandston\" known as the \"Heunenweise\" or \"Hunnenweise\" (the Hunnish melody), in which the words before caesuras also rhyme across lines, creating a rhyme scheme ababcdcd. The \"Rabenschlacht\" uses a unique stanza consisting of three \"Langzeilen\" with rhymes at the caesuras: in this form, the first line is equivalent to a line of the Hildebrandston, the second adds an additional foot after the caesura, and the third adds two or even three additional feet. In most editions, the caesuras are reinterpreted as line-endings, so that the stanza appears as six short lines.\n\nFour of the fantastical poems, the \"Eckenlied\", \"Virginal\", the \"Sigenot\", and \"Goldemar\" are written in a complex rhyming stanza known as the \"Berner Ton.\" Originally, the stanza mixed \"Langzeilen\" with shorter lines of four feet known from Minnesang stanzas, but over time it came to be interpreted as 13 short lines. Victor Millet sees the \"Berner Ton\" as a way for these poems to distance themselves from tradition: the stanza is extremely complex and artistic rather than simple or archaic.Nevertheless, early modern melodies for the \"Berner Ton\" have survived, so that it was probably sung in the traditional manner of German heroic poetry. As the \"Goldemar\" alone among all the Dietrich poems names an author thought to be genuine, Albrecht von Kemenaten, earlier scholarship believed him to be the author of all four poems; this is no longer thought to be the case.\n\nFurther information on the metrical forms of the stanzaic poems, including examples, can be found on the pages for the individual poems.\n\nDietrichs Flucht\nIn \"Dietrichs Flucht\" (Dietrich's flight), also called \"Das Buch von Bern\" (the book of Verona), Dietrich is forced into exile by his wicked uncle Ermenrich. Dietrich goes into exile at Etzel's court. There he receives Etzel's support for three further campaigns. In each one, he defeats Ermenrich, yet is nevertheless unable to retake his kingdom.\n\nIn \"Die Rabenschlacht\" (the battle of Ravenna), Dietrich begins a new campaign to reconquer Italy, bringing his young brother Diether and the young sons of Etzel with him. Dietrich conquers Verona, where he leaves Etzel's sons and his brother, who nonetheless sneak out of the city. Dietrich's forces fight a massive battle at Ravenna, defeating Ermenrich, who escapes. At the same time, however, the young warriors encounter the Witege. They fight him and are slain. Dietrich, after the battle, chases Witege, who rather than fighting Dietrich rides into the sea, where he is saved by a sea-spirit named Wachilt. Dietrich is forced to leave Italy once again for exile.\n\nIn \"Alpharts Tod\" (the death of Alphart), Alphart, a young hero in Dietrich's army fighting the Battle of Ravenna, goes out to fight alone against Witege and Heime, who had deserted to Ermenrich, and he falls, not in fair battle, but by the treachery of Witege, whose life he had spared.\n\nIn \"Dietrich und Wenezlan\" (Dietrich and Wenezlan), Dietrich is challenged to combat while at Etzel's court by Wenezlan, King of Poland, to single combat between two armies. The poem is a fragment and ends without a conclusion.\n\n Eckenlied \nThe \"Eckenlied\" (the song of Ecke) tells the story of the giant Ecke, who sets off to find and fight Dietrich to test his mettle. Dietrich is forced to kill Ecke after they fight, and then must deal with Ecke's giant family, particularly Ecke's brother Fasolt, as they seek revenge.\n\n\"Goldemar\" tells the story of how Dietrich saved a princess from the dwarf king Goldemar. The poem is a fragment. It is the only Dietrich poem with an author accepted as genuine, Albrecht von Kemenaten, and is seen as an anti-heroic epic.\n\nThe \"Laurin\", also called \"der kleine Rosengarten\" (the small rose garden) was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich and is attested in numerous manuscripts and printed versions. The poem tells the story of Dietrich's encounter with the dwarf Laurin and the dwarf's magical rose garden, followed by a treacherous invitation to the dwarf's mountain and the subsequent defeat of Laurin.\n\n\"Der Rosengarten zu Worms\", also called \"der große Rosengarten\" to differentiate it from \"Laurin\", tells the story of a challenge, given to Dietrich by Kriemhilt, to fight her fiancé Siegfried in a rose garden. The poem was very popular, and is notable for its metaliterary aspects commenting German heroic poetry and the Nibelungenlied in particular.\n\nThe \"Sigenot\" was one of the most popular stories about Dietrich. It tells the story of a young Dietrich's fight with and capture by the giant Sigenot. He is freed by Hildebrand, who kills the giant with the help of the dwarf Eggerich.\n\nThe \"Virginal\", also called \"Dietrichs erste Ausfahrt\" (Dietrich's first quest) or \"Dietrich und seine Gesellen\" (Dietrich and his companions) tells the story of how a young Dietrich saved the dwarf queen Virginal from the invading heathen canibal Orkise. Some versions also include his capture by giants and an episode in which he saves a man who is being swallowed by a dragon.\n\nThe \"Wunderer\" (Middle High German for monster), also called \"Etzels Hofhaltung\" (the courtly feast of Etzel) tells the story of a young Dietrich's encounter with the titular Wunderer, a monstrous man who is hunting a woman, while staying at Etzel's court.\n\nThe two heroic epics \"Ortnit\" and \"Wolfdietrich\", preserved in several widely varying versions, do not feature Dietrich von Bern directly but are strongly associated with the Dietrich cycle, and most versions share the strophic form of the Hildebrandston. These two poems, along with \"Laurin\" and \"Rosengarten\", form the core of the Strassburg Heldenbuch and the later printed Heldenbücher, and are the first of the ten Dietrich poems in the Dresden Heldenbuch. In the Ambraser Heldenbuch they close the collection of heroic epics, which starts with \"Dietrichs Flucht\" and the \"Rabenschlacht\".\n\nThe basis for the association is the identification of Wolfdietrich as the grandfather of Dietrich. This connection is attested as early as 1230 in the closing strophe of \"Ortnit A\", is perpetuated by the inclusion of truncated versions of \"Ortnit\" and \"Wolfdietrich\" in \"Dietrichs Flucht\" among the stories of Dietrich's ancestors, and is repeated in the Heldenbuch-Prose of the 15th and 16th centuries, where Ortnit and Wolfdietrich are placed at the beginning of the Dietrich cycle. Scholars have sometimes supposed that \"Wolfdietrich\" tells the story of legends about Dietrich that somehow became disassociated from him. In the Old Norse \"Thidreksaga\", Thidrek (Dietrich) plays Wolfdietrich's role as the avenger of Hertnid (Ortnit), which may suggest that the two heroes were once identical.\n\nA further link is Dietrich's golden suit of impenetrable armour. This was originally received by Ortnit from his natural father, the dwarf Alberich. Ortnit is killed by a dragon who, being unable to kill him through his armour, sucks him out of it. When Wolfdietrich later avenges Ortnit by killing the dragon, he takes possession of the abandoned armour, and after his death it remains in the monastery to which he retired. In the \"Eckenlied\" we are told that the monastery later sold it to Queen Seburg for 50,000 marks, and she in turn gives it to Ecke. When Dietrich later defeats the giant, the armour finally passes into Dietrich's possession.\n\n\"Biterolf and Dietleib\" is a heroic epic transmitted in the Ambraser Heldenbuch. It is closely related to the \"Rosengarten zu Worms\". It tells the story of the heroes King Biterolf of Toledo and his son Dietleib, relatives of Walter of Aquitaine. The two heroes live at Etzel's court and receive Styria as a reward for their successful defense of Etzel's kingdom. In the second half of the work, there is a battle against the Burdundian heroes Gunther, Gernot, and Hagen at Worms, in which Dietleib avenges an earlier attempt by Hagen to prevent him from crossing the Rhine. Like the \"Rosengarten\", Dietrich is featured fighting Siegfried, but he plays no larger role in the epic.\n\nThe \"Jüngeres Hildebrandslied\" (\"Younger Lay of Hildebrand\") is a fifteenth-century heroic ballad, much like \"Ermenrichs Tod\". Dietrich plays only a small role in this poem; it is an independent version of the same story found in the Old High German \"Hildebrandslied\", but with a happy ending.\n\n\"Ermenrichs Tod\" (\"The Death of Ermenrich\") is a garbled Middle Low German heroic ballad that relates a version of the death of Ermenrich that is similar in some ways to that portrayed in the story of Jonakr's sons and Svanhild, but at the hands of Dietrich and his men.\n\nThe Heldenbücher (\"Books of Heroes\", singular \"Heldenbuch\") are collections of mainly heroic poems, in which those of the Dietrich cycle form a major constituent. In particular, the printed Heldenbücher, dating from the late 15th to the late 16th centuries, demonstrate the continuing appeal of the Dietrich tales, particularly the fantastical poems. Generally, the printed Heldenbücher show a tendency to reduce the texts of the poems they collect in length: none of the longest Dietrich poems (\"Dietrichs Flucht\", \"Die Rabenschlacht\", \"Virginal\" V) made the transition into print. Other longer Dietrich poems, such as the \"Sigenot\" and the \"Eckenlied\", were printed independently, and remained popular even longer than the \"Heldenbuch\"—the last printing of \"Sigenot\" was in 1661!\n\nAlthough not a \"Heldenbuch\" in the sense described above—the term originally included any collection of older literature—the Emperor Maximilian I was responsible for the creation of one of the most expensive and historically important manuscripts containing heroic poetry, the Ambraser Heldenbuch.\n\nAccording to the Heldenbuch-Prosa, a prose preface to the manuscript Heldenbuch of Diebolt von Hanowe from 1480 and found in most printed versions, Dietrich is the grandson of Wolfdietrich and son of Dietmar. During her pregnancy, Dietrich's mother was visited by the demon Machmet (i.e. Mohammed imagined as a Muslim god), who prophecies that Dietrich will be the strongest spirit who ever lived and will breathe fire when angry. The devil (Machmet?) then builds Verona/Bern in three days. Ermenrich, here imagined as Dietrich's brother, rapes his marshal Sibiche's wife, whereupon Sibiche decides to advise Ermenrich to his own destruction. Thus he advises Ermenrich to hang his own nephews. Their ward, Eckehart of Breisach, informs Dietrich, and Dietrich declares war on Ermenrich. Ermenrich, however, captures Dietrich's best men, and to ransom them, Dietrich goes into exile. He ends up at Etzel's court, who gives Dietrich a large army that reconquers Verona. However, once Dietrich had fought at the rose garden against Siegfried, slaying him. This causes Kriemhild, who after Etzel's wife Herche's death, marries the Hun, to invite all the heroes of the world to a feast where she causes them to kill each other. Dietrich kills Kriemhild in revenge. Later there is a massive battle at Verona, in which all the remaining heroes except Dietrich are killed. At this a dwarf appears to Dietrich and, telling him that \"his kingdom is no longer of this world,\" causes him to disappear. And no one knows what has happened to him.\n\nThe attempts to connect the heroic age with divine order and to remove Dietrich's demonic qualities are probably meant to deflect ecclesiastical criticism of heroic poetry. For instance, the author clearly attempts to hide negative characteristics of Dietrich, as with the Machmet-prophesy, which probably rests on the idea of Dietrich as the son of the devil (as claimed by some in the church) and changing Dietrich's ride to hell into a positive event – the dwarf quotes John 18,36 when he takes Dietrich away.\n\nDietrich, as Thiodrek (Þjódrekr), appears as an exile at the court of Atli (the Norse equivalent of Etzel) in two songs recorded in the so-called Poetic Edda. The most notable of these is Guðrúnarkviða III, in which Gudrun—the Old Norse equivalent of the German Krimehilt—is accused of adultery with Thiodrek by one of Atli's concubines, Herkja. Gudrun must perform an ordeal of hot water, in which she clears her name. After this, Herkja is killed. In Guðrúnarkviða II, Thiodrek and Gudrun recount the misfortunes that have befallen them. Thiodrek's presence in both songs is usually interpreted as coming from the influence of German traditions about Dietrich. Herkja's name is an exact linguistic equivalent of the name of Etzel's first wife in the German Dietrich and Nibelungen cycle, Helche. The poems also include the figure of Gudrun's mother, Grimhild, whose name is the linguistic equivalent of the German Kriemhilt and who takes on the latter's more villainous role. Most likely these two poems only date to the thirteenth century.\n\nThe Scandinavian \"Þiðreks saga\" (also \"Þiðrekssaga\", \"Thidreksaga\", \"Thidrekssaga\", \"Niflunga saga\" or \"Vilkina saga\") is a thirteenth-century Old Norse chivalric saga about Dietrich von Bern. The earliest manuscript dates from the late 13th century. It contains many narratives found in the known poems about Dietrich, but also supplements them with other narratives and provides many additional details. The text is either a translation of a lost Low German prose narrative of Dietrich's life, or a compilation by a Norwegian author of German material. It is not clear how much of the source material might have been orally transmitted and how much the author may have had access to written poems. The preface of the text itself says that it was written according to \"tales of German men\" and \"old German poetry\", possibly transmitted by Hanseatic merchants in Bergen.\n\nAt the center of the Thidrekssaga is a complete life of Dietrich. In addition to the life of Dietrich, various other heroes' lives are recounted as well in various parts of the story, including Attila, Wayland the Smith, Sigurd, the Nibelungen, and Walter of Aquitaine. The section recounting Dietrich's avenging of Hertnit seems to have resulted from a confusion between Dietrich and the similarly named Wolfdietrich.\n\nMost of the action of the saga has been relocated to Northern Germany, with Attila's capital at Susat (Soest in Westphalia) and the battle described in \"Die Rabenschlacht\" taking place at the mouth of the Rhine.\n\nNumerous ballads about Dietrich are attested in Scandinavia, primarily in Denmark, but also in Sweden and the Faroes. These texts seem to derive primarily from the Thidrekssaga, but there are signs of the use of German texts, such as the Laurin, which was translated into Danish, probably in the 1400s.\n\nOne of the most notable of the Danish ballads is \"Kong Diderik og hans Kæmper\" (King Dietrich and his Warriors, DgF 7) which is attested from the 16th century onwards, and is one of the most common ballads to be recorded in Danish songbooks. This is actually most often found in both Danish and Swedish sources as two separate ballads with different refrains; the two ballads tell stories that closely, but not exactly, mirror episodes in the Didrik Saga where Didrik and his warriors travel to Bertanea / Birtingsland to fight against a King Ysung / Isingen. The first ballad, known in Swedish as \"Widrik Werlandssons Kamp med Högben Rese\" (Widrik Werlandsson's Fight with the Long-legged Troll, SMB 211, TSB E 119), tells of the journey to Birtingsland, and a fight with a troll in a forest on the way. The second, known in Swedish as \"Tolv Starka Kämpar\" (Twelve Strong Warriors, SMB 198, TSB E 10) tells of a series of duels between the youngest of Didrik's warriors and the formidable Sivard (Sigurd).\n\nThe Danish ballad \"Kong Diderik og Løven\" (King Didrik and the Lion, DgF 9, TSB E 158) for most of its narrative closely follows an episode from near the end of the Didrik Saga, telling how Didrik intervenes in a fight between a lion and a dragon. This was also one of the most common ballads to be recorded in Danish songbooks; it is not preserved in Swedish sources.\n\nAnother Danish ballad, \"Kong Diderik i Birtingsland\" (King Dietrich in Birtingsland, DgF 8, TSB E 7), is related to \"Kong Diderik og hans Kæmper\", but it follows the Didrik Saga less closely.\n\nThe popularity of stories about Dietrich in Germany is already attested in the \"Annals of Quedlinburg\", which closes its account of Theoderic's life by saying that this is \"Thideric de Berne, de quo cantabant rustici olim\" (Dietrich von Bern, of whom the peasants once sung). Despite the statement here and in later reports about the popularity of the heroic tradition that it was peasants that sang of Dietrich, it is clear that the nobility was also deeply involved in the transmission of Dietrich's legend. This can be shown as early as 1064, when Meinhard of Bamberg wrote a letter complaining, perhaps in jest, that bishop Gunther of Bamberg preferred to study the deeds of the Amelung (that is, Dietrich) and Attila rather than Saint Augustine or Gregory the Great. The chronicler Dietrich von Deutz, writing around 1163, instead reports that Dietrich, Etzel, and Ermenrich are the kings of the Goths whose deeds \"orbe toto declamantur\" (are sung of by the whole world). High medieval courtly literature includes frequent allusions to Dietrich and the stories surrounding him by authors such as Wolfram von Eschenbach, Heinrich von Veldeke, and Eilhart von Oberg. By the end of the thirteenth century, vernacular chronicles, romances, and topical poems of praise often make comparisons of the ferocity of noble warriors with Dietrich and his men. The quality of the surviving late medieval manuscripts and the choice to decorate castle rooms with scenes from the poems all point to a noble audience, even though there are also reports of the poems being read or sung at town fairs and in taverns. Froben Christoph von Zimmern reports in the Zimmern Chronicle (c. 1552) that his uncle Gottfried Werner von Zimmern, who decorated his castle Wildenstein with frescoes from the poem \"Sigenot\", actually composed poems about Dietrich himself: \"under der zech macht er reimen von dem Berner und den risen\" (while drinking he made rhymes about the Berner (Dietrich) and the giants). The Emperor Maximilian I's interest in heroic poetry about Dietrich is well documented. Not only was he responsible for the Ambraser Heldenbuch, he also decorated his planned grave monument with a large statue of Dietrich/Theoderic, next to other figures such as King Arthur.\nAlthough the nobility maintained its interest in heroic poetry into the sixteenth century, it is also clear that the growing urban bourgeoisie of the late middle ages formed a growing part of the audience for the Dietrich poems, likely in imitation of the nobility. Heroic ballads such as \"Ermenrichs Tod\", meanwhile, lost much of their noble associations and were popular in all societal classes. Beginning in the fourteenth century, many of the Dietrich poems were also used as sources for carnival plays with an obviously bourgeois audience. In the sixteenth century, the public for the poems seems to have become primarily bourgeois, and printed \"Heldenbücher\" rather than the oral tradition become the primary point of reference for the poems. The poems that had not been printed were no longer read and were forgotten. Among the inhabitants of Tyrol, we know from an inventory held of all books in 1569 to weed out heretical material that printings of \"Sigenot\", the \"Eckenlied\", and \"Laurin\", but not of the more expensive \"Heldenbuch\", were relatively common among the burgeois of that area, in some cases being the only book a person owned. The \"Sigenot\" continued to be printed in the seventeenth century, the \"Jüngeres Hildebrandslied\" into the eighteenth, however, most of the printings of materials about Dietrich had ceased by 1600. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century folklorists were unable to find any living oral songs about Dietrich or other heroes in Germany as they could in some other countries, meaning that the oral tradition must have died before this point.\n\nDespite, or because of, its popularity among many sectors of society, including members of the church, the Dietrich poems were frequent targets of criticism, something already visible in Meinhard's letter mentioned above. Beginning with Frutolf of Michelsberg's \"Würzburg Chronicle\" (eleventh century), writers of chronicles began to notice and object to the chronology of Dietrich/Theoderic being a contemporary of Ermanaric and Attila. The anonymous author of the German \"Kaiserchronik\" (c.1150) vehemently attacks this chronological impossibility as a lie. His insistence is perhaps a reflection of the popularity of these stories among his target audience. Eventually, even the fantastical poems would come under attack: the Alsatian chronicler Jakob Twinger von Königshofen in his \"Strasbourg Chronicle\" (c. 1400) would refer to the events of these poems as lies as well, without mentioning the historical poems. He also attacks the laity's positive opinion about the heretical Theoderic. Preachers and the didactically inclined also frequently attack the laity's attachment to Dietrich: Bertold of Regensburg, in a sermon from around 1250, attacks heretics for being illiterate and able only to memorize in the manner that one memorizes a \"rumorem de Ditrico\" (unverified story about Dietrich). Hugo von Trimberg, meanwhile, in his didactic poem \"Der Renner\" (c. 1300) accuses some women of crying more for Dietrich and Ecke than for Christ's wounds, while a fifteenth-century work complains that the laypeople think more about Dietrich von Bern than their own salvation. In the sixteenth century, despite continued criticism, there is evidence that preachers, including Martin Luther, frequently used stories about Dietrich von Bern as a way to catch their audience's interest, a not uncontroversial practice. Writers from Heinrich Wittenwiler to the German translator of Friedrich Dedekind's \"Grobianus\" associated the poems with uncouth peasants, whether or not they actually formed part of the poems' audiences.\n\nScholarly reception of the Dietrich poems, in the form of the \"Heldenbuch\" began as early as the sixteenth century. The Baroque poets and scholars Martin Opitz and Melchior Goldast made use of the \"Heldenbuch\" as a convenient source of Middle High German expressions and vocabulary in their editions of medieval texts. Another notable example is the Lutheran theologian and historian Cyriacus von Spangenberg. In his \"Mansfeldische Chronik\" (1572), he explained that songs had about Dietrich/Theoderic had been composed for real historical occasions, so that they might not be forgotten, but clothed in allegory. He based this opinion on the report of Tacitus in \"Germania\" that the ancient Germans only recorded their history in songs. In Spangenberg's interpretation, dwarf king Laurin's cloak of invisibility, for instance, becomes a symbol for Laurin's secrecy and sneakiness. In his \"Adels Spiegel\" (printed 1591-1594), Cyriacus interprets the stories about Dietrich as examples for ideal noble behavior, and continues his allegorical interpretations, stating that the dragons and giants represent tyrants, robbers, etc., while the dwarfs represent the peasantry and bourgeoisie, etc. This tradition of interpretation would continue into the eighteenth century, when Gotthold Ephraim Lessing interprets the poems of the \"Heldenbuch\" in a very similar fashion, and as late as 1795 Johann Friedrich Schütze argued that the poems were allegories for medieval historical events.\nThe medieval poems about Dietrich never attained the same status as the \"Nibelungenlied\" among nineteenth-century enthusiasts for the German past, despite repeated attempts to reanimate the material through reworkings and retellings. The most ambitious of these was by Karl Simrock, the translator of the \"Nibelungenlied\", who sought to write a new German epic, composed in the \"Nibelungenstanza\", based on the \"Thidrekssaga\" and select poems of the Dietrich cyclce. He called his project the \"Amelungenlied\" (song of the Amelungs). Despite a warm reception among connoisseurs, the poem was never popular. The poem remains unpopular and unknown today, at least partially due to its strong nationalistic tone.\n\nOf all the Dietrich poems, the \"Laurin\" was most frequently rewritten and reimagined during the nineteenth-century, and it is the poem with the greatest currency today. The reworkings, which included longer poems and pieces for the theater, frequently connected \"Laurin\" to elements of other Dietrich poems, especially the \"Virginal\". This led to the \"Laurin\", together with the reimagined \"Virginal\", attaining something of the status of folktales in Tyrol and South Tyrol. Writing in the preface to their 1963 retelling of several stories about Dietrich, Ruth Sawyer and Emmy Mollès claim:\n\nMuch of the credit for the continued interest in Dietrich and Laurin in Tyrol can be given to the journalist and saga-researcher Karl Felix Wolff. In 1907, the city of Bozen (Bolzano) in South Tyrol erected a Laurin fountain, depicting Dietrich wrestling Laurin to the ground. It can be seen there to this day. A heavily altered version of the story of Laurin and Dietrich even found its way onto film in 2016, with the release of the children's film \"König Laurin\".\n\n English \n\n English \n\n"}

That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black.\n\nHowever, monochromatic also has another meaning similar to “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue fading to black), and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths (to white). This is not monochromatic in the strictly scientific meaning of the word.\n\nIt is also be recommended to use monochromatic color for Color Universal Design (CUD). An image with enough contrast ratio monochromatic color also compatible with color blindness people.\n\n"}

It was designed by Karl von Fischer, with the 1782 Odéon in Paris as architectural precedent. Construction began on 26 October 1811 but was interrupted in 1813 by financing problems. In 1817 a fire occurred in the unfinished building.\n\nThe new theatre finally opened on 12 October 1818 with a performance of \"Die Weihe\" by Ferdinand Fränzl, but was soon destroyed by another fire on 14 January 1823; the stage décor caught fire during a performance of \"Die beyden Füchse\" by Étienne Méhul and the fire could not be put out because the water supply was frozen. Coincidentally the Paris Odéon itself burned down in 1818.\n\nDesigned by Leo von Klenze, the second theater incorporated Neo-Grec features in its portico and triangular pediment and an entrance supported by Corinthian columns. In 1925 it was modified to create an enlarged stage area with updated equipment. The building was gutted in an air raid on the night of 3 October 1943.\n\nThe third and present theatre (1963) recreates Karl von Fischer's original neo-classical design, though on a slightly larger, 2,100-seat scale. The magnificent royal box is the center of the interior rondel, decorated with two large caryatids. The new stage covers , and is thus the world's third largest, after the Opéra Bastille in Paris and the Grand Theatre, Warsaw.\n\nThrough the consistent use of wood as a building material, the auditorium has excellent acoustics. Architect Gerhard Moritz Graubner closely preserved the original look of the foyer and main staircase. It opened on 21 November 1963 with an invitation-only performance of \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" under the baton of Joseph Keilberth. Two nights later came the first public performance, of \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\", again under Keilberth.\n\nDuring its early years, the National Theatre saw the premières of a significant number of operas, including many by German composers. These included Wagner’s \"Tristan und Isolde\" (1865), \"Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg\" (1868), \"Das Rheingold\" (1869) and \"Die Walküre\" (1870), after which Wagner chose to build the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth and held further premières of his works there.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 19th century, it was Richard Strauss who would make his mark on the theatre in the city in which he was born in 1864. After accepting the position of conductor for a short time, Strauss returned to the theatre to become principal conductor from 1894 to 1898. In the pre-War period, his \"Friedenstag\" (1938) and \"Capriccio\" were premièred in Munich. In the post-War period, the house has seen significant productions and many world premieres.\n\n\n"}

The Muisca and their confederation were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas; as much as the Aztec, Mayas and Incas but other than the other three, they did not construct grand architecture. Their gold working however was well-known and respected which made Nencatacoa an important deity and protector.\n\nNencatacoa was represented in the form of a forest animal, made of gold and covered with a mantle. Nencatacoa looked most like a fox or a bear, because as Pedro Simón noted, \"an animal in that shape would appear multiple times\".\n\nHe was the protector god of the weavers, an industry that was very important among the Muisca, who used a great variety of materials but mostly cotton and fique.\n\nNencatacoa was also the protector of artists and painters who realized their beautiful creations on the cloths, the ceramics, gold metallurgy, sculptures and petroglyphs with different anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and ideogramatic figures.\n\nMoreover, Nencatacoa was the god of festivities, drunkenness and dance. Traditions tell us that he partied with the people without caring about anything else. The Muisca drank \"chicha\", a type of alcoholic drink based on the fermentation and cooking of maize. When the indigenous peoples were constructing their houses he helped them with lifting the heavy poles. Even during the construction of their houses (\"bohíos\") and temples, the Muisca drank a lot of chicha.\n\nAlso to celebrate the completion of temples, houses or roads and with the arrival of new \"caciques\" the Muisca drank a lot of \"chicha\". At times of sowing and harvest, they celebrated with dancing, singing, music (with drums and flutes) and honoured the gods, in particular Nencatacoa.\n\nNencatacoa thus appeared to be similar in style and association to the Greek god Dionysus and the Roman Bacchus. Chronicler Pedro Simón described about the Muisca that when they were partying and dancing around the fire and the wind blew that was a sign that Nencatacoa was participating.\n"}

By eliminating barriers to entry, open education aids freedom of information by increasing accessibility.\n\nOpen Education advocates state people from all social classes worldwide have open access to high-quality education and resources. They help eliminate obstacles like high costs, outmoded materials, and legal instruments. These barriers impede collaboration among stakeholders. Cooperation is crucial to open education.

{"id": "175308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=175308", "title": "Paradigm", "text": "Paradigm\n\nIn science and philosophy, a paradigm () is a distinct set of concepts or thought patterns, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitutes legitimate contributions to a field.\n\n\"Paradigm\" comes from Greek παράδειγμα (\"paradeigma\"), \"pattern, example, sample\" from the verb παραδείκνυμι (\"paradeiknumi\"), \"exhibit, represent, expose\" and that from παρά (\"para\"), \"beside, beyond\" and δείκνυμι (\"deiknumi\"), \"to show, to point out\".\n\nIn rhetoric, \"paradeigma\" is known as a type of proof. The purpose of \"paradeigma\" is to provide an audience with an illustration of similar occurrences. This illustration is not meant to take the audience to a conclusion, however it is used to help guide them there. One analogy of how a \"paradeigma\" is meant to guide an audience would be a personal accountant. It is not the job of a personal accountant to tell their client exactly what (and what not) to spend their money on, but to aid in guiding their client as to how money should be spent based on their financial goals. Anaximenes defined \"paradeigma\" as \"actions that have occurred previously and are similar to, or the opposite of, those which we are now discussing.\"\n\nThe original Greek term \"παράδειγμα\" (\"paradeigma\") was used in Greek texts such as Plato's Timaeus (28A) as the model or the pattern that the Demiurgos used to create the cosmos. The term had a technical meaning in the field of grammar: the 1900 \"Merriam-Webster\" dictionary defines its technical use only in the context of grammar or, in rhetoric, as a term for an illustrative parable or fable. In linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure used \"paradigm\" to refer to a class of elements with similarities.\n\nThe Merriam-Webster Online dictionary defines this usage as \"a philosophical and theoretical framework of a scientific school or discipline within which theories, laws, and generalizations and the experiments performed in support of them are formulated; \"broadly: a philosophical or theoretical framework of any kind\".\"\n\n\"The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy\" attributes the following description of the term to Thomas Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\":\nKuhn suggests that certain scientific works, such as Newton's Principia or John Dalton's New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808), provide an open-ended resource: a framework of concepts, results, and procedures within which subsequent work is structured. Normal science proceeds within such a framework or paradigm. A paradigm does not impose a rigid or mechanical approach, but can be taken more or less creatively and flexibly.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines a \"paradigm\" as \"a typical example or pattern of something; a pattern or model\". The historian of science Thomas Kuhn gave it its contemporary meaning when he adopted the word to refer to the set of concepts and practices that define a scientific discipline at any particular period of time. In his book, \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (first published in 1962), Kuhn defines a scientific paradigm as: \"universally recognized scientific achievements that, for a time, provide model problems and solutions for a community of practitioners, i.e.,\n\nIn \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn saw the sciences as going through alternating periods of \"normal science\", when an existing model of reality dominates a protracted period of puzzle-solving, and \"revolution\", when the model of reality itself undergoes sudden drastic change. Paradigms have two aspects. Firstly, within normal science, the term refers to the set of exemplary experiments that are likely to be copied or emulated. Secondly, underpinning this set of exemplars are shared preconceptions, made prior to – and conditioning – the collection of evidence. These preconceptions embody both hidden assumptions and elements that he describes as quasi-metaphysical; the interpretations of the paradigm may vary among individual scientists.\nKuhn was at pains to point out that the rationale for the choice of exemplars is a specific way of viewing reality: that view and the status of \"exemplar\" are mutually reinforcing. For well-integrated members of a particular discipline, its paradigm is so convincing that it normally renders even the possibility of alternatives unconvincing and counter-intuitive. Such a paradigm is \"opaque\", appearing to be a direct view of the bedrock of reality itself, and obscuring the possibility that there might be other, alternative imageries hidden behind it. The conviction that the current paradigm \"is\" reality tends to disqualify evidence that might undermine the paradigm itself; this in turn leads to a build-up of unreconciled anomalies. It is the latter that is responsible for the eventual revolutionary overthrow of the incumbent paradigm, and its replacement by a new one. Kuhn used the expression \"paradigm shift\" (see below) for this process, and likened it to the perceptual change that occurs when our interpretation of an ambiguous image \"flips over\" from one state to another. (The rabbit-duck illusion is an example: it is not possible to see both the rabbit and the duck simultaneously.) This is significant in relation to the issue of \"incommensurability\" (see below).\n\nAn example of a currently accepted paradigm would be the standard model of physics. The scientific method allows for orthodox scientific investigations into phenomena that might contradict or disprove the standard model; however grant funding would be proportionately more difficult to obtain for such experiments, depending on the degree of deviation from the accepted standard model theory the experiment would test for. To illustrate the point, an experiment to test for the mass of neutrinos or the decay of protons (small departures from the model) is more likely to receive money than experiments that look for the violation of the conservation of momentum, or ways to engineer reverse time travel.\n\nMechanisms similar to the original Kuhnian paradigm have been invoked in various disciplines other than the philosophy of science. These include: the idea of major cultural themes, worldviews (and see below), ideologies, and mindsets. They have somewhat similar meanings that apply to smaller and larger scale examples of disciplined thought. In addition, Michel Foucault used the terms episteme and discourse, mathesis and taxinomia, for aspects of a \"paradigm\" in Kuhn's original sense.\n\nIn \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn wrote that \"the successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science\" (p. 12).\n\nParadigm shifts tend to appear in response to the accumulation of critical anomalies as well as the proposal of a new theory with the power to encompass both older relevant data and explain relevant anomalies. New paradigms tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, a statement generally attributed to physicist Lord Kelvin famously claimed, \"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.\" Five years later, Albert Einstein published his paper on special relativity, which challenged the set of rules laid down by Newtonian mechanics, which had been used to describe force and motion for over two hundred years. In this case, the new paradigm reduces the old to a special case in the sense that Newtonian mechanics is still a good model for approximation for speeds that are slow compared to the speed of light. Many philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it. Kuhn's original model is now generally seen as too limited .\n\nSome examples of contemporary paradigm shifts include:\n\nKuhn's idea was, itself, revolutionary in its time. It caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science; and, so, it may be that it caused (or was part of) a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognize such a paradigm shift. Being in the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.\n\nPerhaps the greatest barrier to a paradigm shift, in some cases, is the reality of paradigm paralysis: the inability or refusal to see beyond the current models of thinking. This is similar to what psychologists term confirmation bias. Examples include rejection of Aristarchus of Samos', Copernicus', and Galileo's theory of a heliocentric solar system, the discovery of electrostatic photography, xerography and the quartz clock.\n\nKuhn pointed out that it could be difficult to assess whether a particular paradigm shift had actually led to progress, in the sense of explaining more facts, explaining more important facts, or providing better explanations, because the understanding of \"more important\", \"better\", etc. changed with the paradigm. The two versions of reality are thus \"incommensurable\". Kuhn's version of incommensurability has an important psychological dimension; this is apparent from his analogy between a paradigm shift and the flip-over involved in some optical illusions. However, he subsequently diluted his commitment to incommensurability considerably, partly in the light of other studies of scientific development that did not involve revolutionary change. One of the examples of incommensurability that Kuhn used was the change in the style of chemical investigations that followed the work of Lavoisier on atomic theory in the late 18th Century. In this change, the focus had shifted from the bulk properties of matter (such as hardness, colour, reactivity, etc.) to studies of atomic weights and quantitative studies of reactions. He suggested that it was impossible to make the comparison needed to judge which body of knowledge was better or more advanced. However, this change in research style (and paradigm) eventually (after more than a century) led to a theory of atomic structure that accounts well for the bulk properties of matter; see, for example, Brady's \"General Chemistry\". According to P J Smith, this ability of science to back off, move sideways, and then advance is characteristic of the natural sciences, but contrasts with the position in some social sciences, notably economics.\n\nThis apparent ability does not guarantee that the account is veridical at any one time, of course, and most modern philosophers of science are fallibilists. However, members of other disciplines do see the issue of incommensurability as a much greater obstacle to evaluations of \"progress\"; see, for example, Martin Slattery's \"Key Ideas in Sociology\".\n\nOpaque Kuhnian paradigms and paradigm shifts do exist. A few years after the discovery of the mirror-neurons that provide a hard-wired basis for the human capacity for empathy, the scientists involved were unable to identify the incidents that had directed their attention to the issue. Over the course of the investigation, their language and metaphors had changed so that they themselves could no longer interpret all of their own earlier laboratory notes and records.\n\nHowever, many instances exist in which change in a discipline's core model of reality has happened in a more evolutionary manner, with individual scientists exploring the usefulness of alternatives in a way that would not be possible if they were constrained by a paradigm. Imre Lakatos suggested (as an alternative to Kuhn's formulation) that scientists actually work within research programmes. In Lakatos' sense, a research programme is a sequence of problems, placed in order of priority. This set of priorities, and the associated set of preferred techniques, is the positive heuristic of a programme. Each programme also has a negative heuristic; this consists of a set of fundamental assumptions that – temporarily, at least – takes priority over observational evidence when the two appear to conflict.\n\nThis latter aspect of research programmes is inherited from Kuhn's work on paradigms, and represents an important departure from the elementary account of how science works. According to this, science proceeds through repeated cycles of observation, induction, hypothesis-testing, etc., with the test of consistency with empirical evidence being imposed at each stage. Paradigms and research programmes allow anomalies to be set aside, where there is reason to believe that they arise from incomplete knowledge (about either the substantive topic, or some aspect of the theories implicitly used in making observations.\n\nLarry Laudan has also made two important contributions to the debate. Laudan believed that something akin to paradigms exist in the social sciences (Kuhn had contested this, see below); he referred to these as research traditions. Laudan noted that some anomalies become \"dormant\", if they survive a long period during which no competing alternative has shown itself capable of resolving the anomaly. He also presented cases in which a dominant paradigm had withered away because its lost credibility when viewed against changes in the wider intellectual milieu.\n\nKuhn himself did not consider the concept of paradigm as appropriate for the social sciences. He explains in his preface to \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" that he developed the concept of paradigm precisely to distinguish the social from the natural sciences. While visiting the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in 1958 and 1959, surrounded by social scientists, he observed that they were never in agreement about the nature of legitimate scientific problems and methods. He explains that he wrote this book precisely to show that there can never be any paradigms in the social sciences. Mattei Dogan, a French sociologist, in his article \"Paradigms in the Social Sciences,\" develops Kuhn's original thesis that there are no paradigms at all in the social sciences since the concepts are polysemic, involving the deliberate mutual ignorance between scholars and the proliferation of schools in these disciplines. Dogan provides many examples of the non-existence of paradigms in the social sciences in his essay, particularly in sociology, political science and political anthropology.\n\nHowever, both Kuhn's original work and Dogan's commentary are directed at disciplines that are defined by conventional labels (such as \"sociology\"). While it is true that such broad groupings in the social sciences are usually not based on a Kuhnian paradigm, each of the competing sub-disciplines may still be underpinned by a paradigm, research programme, research tradition, and/ or professional imagery. These structures will be motivating research, providing it with an agenda, defining what is and is not anomalous evidence, and inhibiting debate with other groups that fall under the same broad disciplinary label. (A good example is provided by the contrast between Skinnerian radical behaviourism and personal construct theory (PCT) within psychology. The most significant of the many ways these two sub-disciplines of psychology differ concerns meanings and intentions. In PCT, they are seen as the central concern of psychology; in radical behaviourism, they are not scientific evidence at all, as they cannot be directly observed.)\n\nSuch considerations explain the conflict between the Kuhn/ Dogan view, and the views of others (including Larry Laudan, see above), who do apply these concepts to social sciences.\n\nHanda, M.L. (1986) introduced the idea of \"social paradigm\" in the context of social sciences. He identified the basic components of a social paradigm. Like Kuhn, Handa addressed the issue of changing paradigm; the process popularly known as \"paradigm shift\". In this respect, he focused on social circumstances that precipitate such a shift and the effects of the shift on social institutions, including the institution of education. This broad shift in the social arena, in turn, changes the way the individual perceives reality.\n\nAnother use of the word \"paradigm\" is in the sense of \"worldview\". For example, in social science, the term is used to describe the set of experiences, beliefs and values that affect the way an individual perceives reality and responds to that perception. Social scientists have adopted the Kuhnian phrase \"paradigm shift\" to denote a change in how a given society goes about organizing and understanding reality. A \"dominant paradigm\" refers to the values, or system of thought, in a society that are most standard and widely held at a given time. Dominant paradigms are shaped both by the community's cultural background and by the context of the historical moment. Hutchin outlines some conditions that facilitate a system of thought to become an accepted dominant paradigm:\n\n\nThe word \"paradigm\" is also still used to indicate a pattern or model or an outstandingly clear or typical example or archetype. The term is frequently used in this sense in the design professions. Design Paradigms or archetypes comprise functional precedents for design solutions. The best known references on design paradigms are \"Design Paradigms: A Sourcebook for Creative Visualization\", by Wake, and \"Design Paradigms\" by Petroski.\n\nThis term is also used in cybernetics. Here it means (in a very wide sense) a (conceptual) protoprogram for reducing the chaotic mass to some form of order. Note the similarities to the concept of entropy in chemistry and physics. A paradigm there would be a sort of prohibition to proceed with any action that would increase the total entropy of the system. To create a paradigm requires a closed system that accepts changes. Thus a paradigm can only apply to a system that is not in its final stage.\n\nBeyond its use in the physical and social sciences, Kuhn's paradigm concept has been analysed in relation to its applicability in identifying 'paradigms' with respect to worldviews at specific points in history. One example is Matthew Edward Harris' book \"The Notion of Papal Monarchy in the Thirteenth Century: The Idea of Paradigm in Church History\". Harris stresses the primarily sociological importance of paradigms, pointing towards Kuhn's second edition of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". Although obedience to popes such as Innocent III and Boniface VIII was widespread, even written testimony from the time showing loyalty to the pope does not demonstrate that the writer had the same worldview as the Church, and therefore pope, at the centre. The difference between paradigms in the physical sciences and in historical organisations such as the Church is that the former, unlike the latter, requires technical expertise rather than repeating statements. In other words, after scientific training through what Kuhn calls 'exemplars', one could not genuinely believe that, to take a trivial example, the earth is flat, whereas thinkers such as Giles of Rome in the thirteenth century wrote in favour of the pope, then could easily write similarly glowing things about the king. A writer such as Giles would have wanted a good job from the pope; he was a papal publicist. However, Harris writes that 'scientific group membership is not concerned with desire, emotions, gain, loss and any idealistic notions concerning the nature and destiny of humankind...but simply to do with aptitude, explanation, [and] cold description of the facts of the world and the universe from within a paradigm'.\n\n"}

In ancient Greece it was the site of a sanctuary to Pan and the nymphs. It is also known as Lychnospilia for the large number of oil lamps found in the cave. It has been identified as the cave which occurs in the \"Dyskolos\" of Menander. The cave was excavated in 1901. Three votive reliefs found in the cave are now on display in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.\n\nBecause of its use for the veneration of Pan the cave is also called the Cave of Pan. It was one of the five caves of Pan in the vicinity of ancient Athens.\n\nIn Attica most cave shrines dedicated to Pan and the nymphs featured a common type of votive relief. These show three females led by Hermes, often accompanied by Pan and Achelous (for his association with water), within a rocky framework simulating a cave entrance. The female figures are often identified as nymphs or sometimes more specifically the Charites. These reliefs were also found in the Phyle Cave and are now exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens as inventory numbers 1448, 1859 and 1879.\n\nNumber 1879 is particularly complex and interesting. The relief shows a mountain god, Pan, a satyr playing the syrinx and Achelous with a cornucopia. They surround the familiar group of three females near a basin fed by a lion-head waterspout. The waterspout is pierced so that it could supply the water for the actual basin in the cave itself. Various dates have been proposed for the relief ranging from the middle of the fourth century BC to the first century BC, with the later Hellenistic date being more likely.\n\n"}
{"id": "1231196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1231196", "title": "Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros", "text": "Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros\n\nThe Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros is a cultural, political and social facility located in Mexico City as part of the World Trade Center Mexico City. It was designed and decorated by David Alfaro Siqueiros in the 1960s and hosts the largest mural work in the world called \"La Marcha de la Humanidad\". The building has a theatre, galleries and more, but the main focus is the Forum Universal, which contains the interior portion of Siqueiros' mural work. Visitors can experience the mural while standing on a rotating stage, listening to Siqueiros narrate.\n\nThe Polyforum is a decagon shaped construction with different exhibition spaces that feature David Alfaro Siqueiros’ work. The building is part of a business complex called the World Trade Center Mexico City in the Benito Juárez borough of Mexico City. This complex was designed by architects Joaquín Alvarez, Guillermo Rossel de la Lama and Ramón Mikelajáuregui, and built just outside Parque de la Lama, but the Polyforum was designed and decorated by Siqueiros, who nicknamed it “El coronelazo.” The exterior is in the form of a diamond and the inside has eight sides. The building with its murals is considered to be an “artistic heritage site” for Mexico, registered by the Centro Nacional de Conservación, Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura and Registro del Patrimonio Artístico Mueble. The Polyforum is a multiple event facility dedicated to cultural, political and social events. Its main aspects include a 500-seat theatre, two galleries, offices and the Foro Universal or Universal Forum.\n\nThe outside wall was built in 1970 as a way for patron Manuel Suárez to prevent encroachment or destruction of his property. The wall became immediately controversial because although it was built for safety purposes, it obstructed the view of the Polyforum for passersby, thus making it less accessible to the general public. The press allegedly deemed the wall defensive and antisocial, and Siqueiros tried to defend the wall by saying that it was merely an aesthetic extension of the Polyforum itself. Made into a work of art, the inner surface of the wall celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexican mural movement of which Siqueiros actively participated in with Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and others. The mural prominently features portraits of Rivera and Orozco, as well as Dr. Atl, a key figure in the start of the mural movement, and graphic artists Guadalupe Posada and Leopoldo Mendez.\n\nThe Polyforum's exterior, a 2,750 ft. area, features a twelve-faced sculptural mural painting. Each face depicts a different symbolic concept. The twelve concepts depicted are: Destiny, Ecology, Acrobats, Masses, Decalog, Christ, Indigenous Peoples, Dance, Mythology, Mingling of Races, Music, and Atom. The exterior work is meant to serve as a preview of the interior mural, to entice visitors to enter the building, and to make visitors contemplate the complex meanings of the concepts represented.\n\nThe year 1960 marked the fiftieth year of the Mexican Revolution, and the political situation in Mexico during the 1960s was quite grim. The early 1960s was marked by major control by the Left and attempts to create class equality, but these attempts unfortunately failed. In 1964, the combination of both an economic decline and an announcement that allottable land was near exhaustion led many peasants to revolt. In the late 1960s, the Right gained control, which led to many doctor and student strikes that were received with strong resistance from the government. The most shocking example of the murky political situation in 1960s Mexico happened in the form of the Tlatelolco Massacre on October 2, 1968. During a student demonstration that happened ten days before the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, police and military officers shot into a crowd of unarmed students at Tlatelolco Plaza. The final death toll remains a mystery, but it has been reported that four students died, twenty were wounded, and thousands were beaten, jailed, and disappeared. This event coincided with the intended opening of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros during the summer of 1968, and demonstrates how turbulent the political climate was in Mexico during the Polyforum’s construction.\n\nThe Polyforum was designed as part of a major redevelopment/improvement project for Mexico City entitled Mexico 2000. Because of an increase in Mexico City’s urban population, Mexico 2000 strived to generate income for the city through tourism and services at its decentralized location at Parque de la Lama. In addition to making arts more accessible to people through Siqueiros’ work at the Polyforum, some of the other contributions of Mexico 2000 included underground networks of driveways, closed circuit radio and television broadcasting, a new system of construction called “Tridilosa” that lightened the weight of the building structure as to allow for more rooms to be created, and expedited travel services for tourists coming into the city.\n<br>The plaza’s major hotel, “El Hotel de Mexico,” is 730 foot high building that was designed to house a large number of tourists. At the time, the hotel was the tallest reinforced concrete and earthquake-resistant building in the world, and featured 1,512 rooms and suites with a variety of dining options. Equally important to tourism as the Polyforum, “El Hotel de Mexico” was built for both functionality and aesthetic pleasure through its architectural grandeur.\n\nAlthough the date is rather uncertain, most agree that the initial commission of the Polyforum happened in 1960 before the radical artist Siqueiros was imprisoned for the charges of attacking police, resisting arrest, firing an illegal weapon, and inciting violence. Siqueiros officially accepted the commission from art patron and industrialist Manuel Suárez on September 7, 1964. The first request of Suárez was for a large mural to be housed in Cuernavaca. The location of the mural was then moved to Mexico City in 1966, and now is known as \"The March of Humanity\". The location change to Parque de la Lama was part of Suárez’s larger ideas to both draw people away from the urban center and to promote tourism in an effort to boost the suffering Mexican economy.\n\nCreating the Polyforum was a collective act, and required a large team of workers. Several architects, engineers, painters, sculptors, and acoustics experts from all around the world came to work on the massive project.\nThe undertaking was so large that Siqueiros purchased an additional piece of land next to his home and studio in Cuernavaca for his team to complete the project. All of the panels for \"The March of Humanity\" were created in Cuernavaca, where Rhode Island School of Design alumni Mark Rogovin worked under Siqueiros. Rogovin attests to the fact that he and a friend were the only U.S. natives to be working on the project, as most of the other members were from Japan, Italy, Argentina, and various other locations around the world. According to Rogovin, Siqueiros was constantly at the studio, putting in long days and making sure that the project was being carried out to his standard. The project was initially to be completed for the 1968 Olympic Games, but due to political and financial complications, the Polyforum was not finished and inaugurated until December 15, 1971.\n\nThe main feature of the complex at Parque de la Lama is the Forum Universal, which contains Siquieros’ mural called \"La Marcha de la Humanidad\" (\"The March of Humanity\"). The building, which contains four floors and has an area of 134,000 square feet, also contains a theatre, two joined galleries and other facilities. Siqueiros’ mural covers the dome on the top floor, and up to one thousand spectators can stand on the rotating platform beneath the mural. Accompanying the viewing experience, a light and sound program that was designed by Manuel Suárez y Suárez plays to educate the viewers about the mural. The next floor down features a space for local and international art exhibitions. Below this floor is a theater that features various performances, as well as a small shopping area called the Universal Forum Emerging Art Space (EAE). The basement of the Polyforum is an open space that can be used for storage as well as exhibitions.\n\nIn 2011, for the 40th anniversary of the structure, the Forum's two art galleries named after Dr. Atl and Mario Orozco Rivera were renovated and merged into one gallery, measuring over 300 square meters. The first served as the site museum with a space of 145 meters squared. Its permanent exhibition consisted of photographs and models and sketches related to the painting of the site’s mural. It also contained biographical information in the form of documents and photographs of Manuel Suárez y Suárez, the sponsor of the Polyforum along with that of Siqueiros. The gallery contains a statue of Manuel Suárez y Suárez. The second gallery dedicated to Orozco Rivera measured 169 meters squared and is shows mainly temporary exhibits of painting, sculpture and photography. The new gallery's first exhibition of 2011 was called “My Trend Week,\" and it was designed to display the works of new artistic talent in architecture as well as graphic, industrial and interior design. The combined space has been tentatively renamed “Espacio de Arte Emergente” (Emerging Art Space) .\n\nInside the Polyforum hosts Siqueiros’ largest mural ever to be created, which is fully titled, \"The March of Humanity on Earth and Toward the Cosmos: Misery and Science\". Including the exterior panels, the mural measures 8,700 square meters. Siqueiros described the theme as “Naked people close to the soil, a woman with a child on her lap, and smaller children raising their arms begging for bread. They are hungry, the oldest, doubled over under a bundle of firewood, walks off in search of a livelihood; groups of women running pell-mell knock each other to get a crumb of bread thrown away by others---an unending struggle to solve the basic problem of existence.” The overall theme of the mural is humanity’s endless struggle throughout history and the search for a better society. The mural is divided into four main sections: \"The March of Humanity Towards Bourgeois Democratic Revolution\"; \"The March of Humanity to the Revolution of the Future\"; \"Peace, Culture, and Harmony\"; and \"Science and Technology\".\n\nThis section depicts of the mural depicts a revolution before a time of democratic revolution, and is characterized by violence and confusion. There are many figures and forms in different positions, suggesting overall chaos. In the center, demagoguery emerges in the form of a clown who is flanked by militaristic figures. Ninety-some figures are pictured in this scene, and are compositionally stacked rather than overlapped. The upper register tells a story that begins with two dark-skinned, half-naked men shown with their knees bent. Next to them, two mothers and their several children walking through a barren landscape that features one large, tree-like form in the background. The next figure is an old man who is bent down under a pile of sticks. Next to him is a group of women huddling together who are shown covering their children with shawls. This entire group is shown to be moving toward a white-faced, dancing figure with his arms raised. This figure, who appears as a leader of some sort, is flanked by a group of people who are also raising their arms. The lower register features figures that are larger in scale than those in the upper register. The first form is an abstract, humanoid form that is more difficult to recognize than the figures from the upper register. Following him is a brutalized, black male figure who is shown armless and hanged, swinging from a noose. The next figures are two large, monstrous figures with recognizably human anatomy that are followed by a larger group of marchers that are shown in uniform, carrying spears and rifles. This procession of synchronized marchers closes out the frame.\n\nThis section represents another march toward the revolution of the future, with the ceiling above representing the space race between the Americans and the Soviets.This section represents another march toward the revolution of the future, with the ceiling above representing the space race between the Americans and the Soviets.This section depicts the future as a chaotic and confusing time, and begins with a woman being attacked by a ferocious anthropomorphic beast. Next to the woman, a man chops down a poisonous tree, and across from him, two frightened women scurry across the turbulent landscape. Above these figures is a three-dimensional figure that protrudes from the wall and is representative of metamorphosis. The next scene depicts a large grouping of women next to a large amate tree, which is representative of the new leaders who will aid the development of humanity. Two figures come out of the tree, and seem to be flying into space. In the final scene, a gender ambiguous figure, shown sitting on a rock, points back to the tree to emphasize its importance. The landscape of Section 2 is much more rough and jagged than the landscape in Section 1, suggesting that the future revolution will be a great challenge for humanity to overcome.\n\nThis section shows a man offering industrialization to the west, and on the east side, a woman offering culture to humanize society. Converging lines that come out from the wall behind the figures unify the hands of the man and woman. The man in this scene is the leader who emerged from the amate tree in Section 2, and his return with the female suggests that he has successfully mated and created a new race. These two figures have brought the tools necessary to save humanity through starting a new march towards a better future. .\n\nThe Polyforum is a private institution which is supported through its activities and through private donations to the Siqueiros Foundation. The Siqueiros Foundation is run by Siqueiros' niece Anna Siqueiros, based in Los Angeles, and its mission is \"Bringing Color into a Concrete World.\" As a memorial to the deceased David Alfaro Siqueiros, the Siqueiros Foundation strives to empower underprivileged children by providing them with materials and locations to artistically express themselves. In addition, the Siqueiros Foundation preserves a collection of periodicals, audio, video and photography related to the artist, whose digitalization was begun in 2010. This collection consists of 102,908 documents and images with elements such as correspondence with contemporary intellectuals, writers and politicians, including that from the Siquieros was incarcerated in Lecumberri from 1960 to 1964. It also includes 7,000 postcards from Germany alone, and 10,000 photographs of family and 80,000 texts written about the artist.\n\nOver its first forty years, the building suffered significant deterioration to its structure and its murals. The deterioration of the mural work is due to environmental factors and the materials Siquieros used to create the piece.(restaurant) In 2011, remodeling work was begun on the facility to mark its fortieth anniversary. Some restoration work had been performed in 2011, but lack of funds has prevented completion.\n"}

{"id": "4985419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4985419", "title": "Show choir", "text": "Show choir\n\nA show choir (originally known as a \"swing choir\") is a group of people who combine choral singing with dance, sometimes within the context of a specific idea or story. It is most prevalent in the Midwestern United States, and was popularized by the American television show Glee. Unlike sports, no official national or state sanctioning bodies exist to regulate the performances or standings.\n\nShow choir is primarily performed as a school activity in the USA. It is usually done as a co-curricular (as part of a class, as well as outside of the school day) or an extracurricular (completely outside of the school day) activity. In addition, some show choirs are formed in organizations outside of school. Though usually a high school activity, the art form has grown and expanded to all levels of school from elementary through the college/university level.\n\nOutside of the United States, show choirs can be found in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. \n\nWhile there is no standard requirement for the number of performers, show choirs typically contain between 30 and 60 singer/dancers, but it depends on the size of the school and the discretion of the director. Larger schools with a more advanced program may have more than one show choir. Unisex show choirs usually compete in a separate division, with the exception of an \"open\" division, during which unisex and mixed groups compete against each other.\n\nShow choirs traditionally wear a costume, though the definition of what is considered a costume in show choir is very broad and ranges from jeans and a T-shirt to extravagant period costumes or flashy dance-wear. It can be very conservative (such as tuxedos and ball gowns) or very edgy (such as modern or revealing clothing). Additionally, many larger show choirs include two or more costumes in their show. Participants typically wear stage makeup and shoes conducive to dancing (often \"character shoes\"). In the Midwest and on the East Coast, woman participants will generally do their hair to look identical. Californian show choirs do not generally have identical hair. Otherwise, from the costumes to the stage makeup, show choir members often look uniform during most shows.\n\nThe choir usually has a backup band (\"jazz\" or \"combo\" if it includes a Horn Section) providing instrumental music to complement the voices. The instrumentation varies from song to song and choir to choir, but a common show choir band consists of guitar, bass, drums, trumpets, trombone, alto sax, tenor sax, piano, and synthesizer. Some bands include violins or even cellos. Many larger show choirs typically have a larger combo to accompany them. The band is usually out of sight, however the occasional show will have part of the band on stage at certain points.\n\nA \"Tech Crew\" (or \"Stage Crew\") is standard with most show choirs, as they assist with and handle the lighting, sound, and stage setup. Show choir crew also help in the creation and management of costumes. During the show, the crew can do several things from helping performers change costumes, manage props, hand out microphones and other duties set out in the choreography and design of the show.\n\nOne problem that arises with show choir is a lack of male members. Due to the stigma that the performing arts is a more feminine activity, many teenage boys are discouraged from participating in show choir. Males also tend to not be drawn to show choir because the activity seems less successful than other high school activities, such as sports. A lack of males can cause choirs to lack in vocal performance because they do not have enough pitch variety. In order to achieve rich melodies, choirs need males of all voice ranges from tenor to bass. After a study done by the Choral Journal another alarming factor that has caused there to be a lack of male vocalists in show choir is choir director's lack of investment in the issue. Many choir directors have accepted the fact that they will always have less males in their choir, therefore very few make an attempt to reach out to males in the school. By not making an effort to change this issue, directors unintentionally support this issue. By reaching out to males and creating more of a supportive community for high school boy, more males will likely participate in show choir.\n\nSome participants believe that show choir is a sport due to the dancing aspect; in West Virginia and Illinois it is currently pending as a physical education credit. Some physical education teacher groups have come out against the move, saying that P. E. should be about more than one type of physical activity. Some participants of show choir also have come out against the move. However, it has failed to gain sport designation in any state to become state-sanctioned and by definition is a performing art, not a sport. \n\nMany show choirs participate in competitions, sometimes called \"invitationals\" (though most are not invitation-only events) or \"festivals\". These competitions are often held at the high school where the \"host group\" attends and sometimes performs as an exhibition, though some events are held at auditoriums or other facilities that can accommodate larger crowds and provide better acoustic performance.\n\nCompetitions can be as small as a showcase of a few groups from the immediate geographic area or they can feature many groups from multiple states. Because of the vast difference in sizes of the competitions, they can last a single afternoon or span an entire weekend. Competitions may separate competing choirs into different divisions. These divisions are often determined by age, skill level, size of the school or choir, and/or gender of the participants. The different divisions may take place at a different time, day, or at a different location or venue, though usually within the same school or close geographic area. There are three main divisions: Varsity (or Open), Unisex, and Prep (or Class A) or Large Group, Small Group, and Unisex. Within each division, there may be different subsections based on the size of the group, the size of the choir, or how successful the choir has been. Largely, the decision of where to place a choir is made by the director of the competing choir.\n\nShow choir sets can be presented in a multitude of ways from the more traditional approach to ultra theatrical performances that tell full length stories. These performances done by choirs, or \"sets,\" are created by the choir's school director and possibly outside performing arts professionals. As this art form has grown, more schools have attempted to create quality performances that can be compared to professional shows.\n\nMany competitions include a preliminary round and a finals found. The finals round commences after the preliminary awards are complete, where the top groups perform again in order to compete for the title of Grand Champion of the contest. The number of performing groups in the finals round is up to the hosting school, but typically 5-6 choirs participate. Those groups are sometimes given the opportunity to take suggestions, either from scoring judges or separate experts called in to give suggestions made during the preliminary round, and make adjustments to their finals performance in order to earn a better score. Hosting schools do not compete in the competition for ethical purposes.\n\nThe adjudicators, usually called judges, at almost any competition are experts in the show choir field. Often they are directors from other choirs, choreographers, arrangers or performers from Broadway-style musicals. The judging is subjective and is based on the scoring style selected by the hosts with some competitions placing more emphasis on strictly choral aspects, while others incorporate more emphasis on the entire show including the choreography, band, and show design. Depending on the competition, the judges may only judge in their area of expertise (a choir director judging vocals, while a choreographer judging dance), or they may judge everything. Additionally, a separate judge may be added to the panel to judge the bands, and/or to select outstanding performers for separate awards.\n\nDuring competitions there are also individual, or solo, competitions. They take place during the competition, and they take place in a different area than the main competition. Winners are announced, and they may perform at the start of the nighttime finals performance. \n\nMost show choir \"shows\" or \"sets\" consist of a variety of songs, often including several choreographed, fast-paced pieces and one slower piece performed with limited or no choreography. This slower number—usually a ballad—exists primarily to showcase the ensemble's singing ability. In California, it is a requirement that at least one minute of any one set be sung a cappella (it is usually one full song in the set), though this is not a standard in the rest of the country. More often than not, the a cappella selection is also the ballad, as it is much easier to sing unaccompanied while holding relatively still. In the Midwest, it is becoming popular to set one song aside as a \"novelty\" piece, designed to make the audience laugh. \"Concept\" or \"story\" shows that unify all of the songs together in a common theme are becoming more popular across the country, especially in California.\n\nWithin a song, vocal lines typically alternate between unison or octave singing, and two-or-more-part polyphonic harmony. Songs are chosen, adapted, and arranged from a variety of sources including popular music, jazz standards, and Broadway musicals, but rarely make use of classical music. Original music has also been performed by a small number of groups. Additionally, there is often at least one solo in each performance by a standout singer in the group.\n\nCompetitive performance sets range in length, but are usually timed to total between fifteen and twenty-five minutes. Shows generally consist of, but are not limited to, approximately five songs.\n\nShow choirs have seen a rise in popularity since the American television series, \"Glee\" was released. The television show is based around the workings of a fictional show choir. The television show does not accurately represent the environment of a real show choir. Professional baseball player Kyle Schwarber participated in show choir when he was at Middletown (Ohio) High School.\n\nFor many high school students, show choir is a large commitment that takes over a large part of a school year. For some, show choir is part of the school curriculum and is a class taught during the day. For others, it is an extracurricular activity that requires practice to take place before or after school. Practices may begin as early as the summer for some, while other choirs don’t start until much later. The competitive season takes place from January until March or April, with competitions held across the country every weekend during that time.\n"}

It has been described as the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain.\n\nThe pendant was found in 2015 by a team from the University of York during excavations led by Nicky Milner. It was excavated by Tom Bell, a student from the University of Chester on the last days of the excavation. It was found in a context from the edge of the palaeolake Lake Flixton.\n\nThe pendant is sub-triangular in shape and measures 31 mm x 35 mm x 3 mm. ED-XRF (energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence) was used to prove that it is made from shale. The front face is engraved with a series of parallel, incised lines which often cross each other. It has a perforation, made by drilling through from the engraved side at one of the lobes. \n\nOn the reverse side to the engraving there is a nick caused by a missing flake of shale in the central region. This may have happened accidentally or intentionally, presumably by something hard striking this surface before it was deposited in the lake.\n\nThe pendant is unique and is the earliest example of Mesolithic art in Britain. Whilst it is very similar to a number of other pendants from northern European sites, this pendant is unique as it is made from shale, whereas the other examples tend to be crafted from amber. It is also one of the few decorated pendants that have been found within an archaeological context and not as a stray find. Analysis by the research team suggest that there are two phases of markings on the pendant, and that it is possible that more than one person added to it over time. Different interpretations from those who have seen the engravings have suggested that it may represent a tree, a map, a leaf, tally marks, even a representation of the wooden platforms which have been found at Star Carr.\n\nThe pendant is now in the Yorkshire Museum and first went on public display in February 2016.\n\nStar Carr Pendant website\n"}

Commissioned by the French Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, the canvas hangs in Contarelli chapel altar in the church of the French congregation San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, Italy. It is one of three Caravaggio canvases in the chapel: hanging between the larger earlier canvases of \"The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew\", and \"The Calling of Saint Matthew\". This was not an easy commission for Caravaggio, and at least two of the three paintings had to be either replaced or repainted to satisfy his patron, the Cardinal Del Monte. \n\nIt is instructive to compare the two versions of the latter painting to see how provocative and controversial Caravaggio was in his time. Unfortunately, the first, rejected, version of this theme was destroyed in World War II, and we only have black and white and enhanced color reproductions. In the first version, \"Saint Matthew and the Angel\", the angel stands close to Matthew the Evangelist personal space and engages in what appears more direct intervention than divine inspiration. The angel intertwines with the old man, apparently whispering inspiration into his ear. The rejected painting can be compared to the earlier Caravaggio canvas of the \"Rest on the Flight into Egypt\".\n\nIn the work featured on the altar, the angel belongs to an aerial and sublime dimension, enveloped in an encircling rippled sheet. The restless Matthew leans to work, as the angel enumerates for him the work to come. All is darkness but for the two large figures. Matthew appears to have rushed to his desk, his stool teetering into our space. His expression is sober.\n\nIt is thought the contemporary styles of Caravaggio and Carracci were at odds with each other, and non overlapping. In this light it is instructive to compare and contrast a similar canvas, by Carracci's pupil, Giovanni Lanfranco presently in Piacenza as well as a painting on a similar theme by Rembrandt.\n"}

It is thought to be a portrait of Wolfgang Lazius, a humanist and historian who served Holy Roman Emperors of the House of Habsburg.\n\nArcimboldo became official portraitist to Emperor Ferdinand I in 1562 and later to Maximilian II and Rudolf II. \"The Librarian\" is one of a series of paintings by Arcimboldo of members of Maximilian's entourage. Skokloster Castle dates the painting to 1562, though the painting is more often dated circa 1566.\n\nArcimboldo created a number of portraits of people by painting an assemblage of objects such as fruits and vegetables, flowers, or in this case, books; the objects typically had some connection to the person's life or depiction. Benno Geiger called it a \"triumph of abstract art in the 16th century\". In 1957, art historian Sven Alfons was the first to conclude that this was specifically a portrait of Lazius. The work has been interpreted as both a celebration and a satirical mocking of librarians and scholarship. K. C. Elhard suggests that it may be specifically a parody of \"materialistic book collectors more interested in acquiring books than in reading them.\"\n\nElhard notes that \"The Librarian\" has become \"a fixture in the visual history of the library profession\". However, the original title, if any, is unknown, and its current title first appears (in Swedish as \"Bibliotekarien\") in an early 20th-century inventory.\n\n\"The Librarian\" is one of two works by Arcimbolodo in the collection of Skokloster Castle. The painting was brought to Sweden following the looting of Prague Castle by the Swedish army during the 1648 Battle of Prague and was owned by General Hans Christoff von Königsmarck.\n\nThere are three other extant versions of the painting whose attributions are uncertain. A scientific study published in 2011 concluded that \"The Librarian\" was a later copy of Arcimbolodo's original painting, whose whereabouts are unknown.\n\n"}
{"id": "15673153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15673153", "title": "Trademark distinctiveness", "text": "Trademark distinctiveness\n\nTrademark distinctiveness is an important concept in the law governing trademarks and service marks. A trademark may be eligible for registration, or registrable, if it performs the essential trademark function, and has distinctive character. Registrability can be understood as a continuum, with \"inherently distinctive\" marks at one end, \"generic\" and \"descriptive\" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and \"suggestive\" and \"arbitrary\" marks lying between these two points. \"Descriptive\" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning - consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator - to be protectable. \"Generic\" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks.\n\nIn United States trademark law, Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976) established the spectrum of trademark distinctiveness in the US, breaking trademarks into classes which are accorded differing degrees of protection. Courts often speak of marks falling along the following \"spectrum of distinctiveness,\" also known within the US as the \"Abercrombie classification\" or \"Abercrombie factors\":\n\nA fanciful / inherently distinctive trademark is prima facie registrable, and comprises an entirely invented or \"fanciful\" sign. For example, \"Kodak\" had no meaning before it was adopted and used as a trademark in relation to goods, whether photographic goods or otherwise. Invented marks are neologisms which will not previously have been found in any dictionary.\n\nAn arbitrary trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. \"Apple\" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. \"Salty\" would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in \"Salty Telephones\", as the term \"salt\" has no particular connection with such products.\n\nA suggestive trademark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer’s perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is Blu-ray, a new technology of high-capacity data storage that utilizes a \"blue\" (actually violet) laser.\n\nA descriptive mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning. An example might be \"Salty\" used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the marketplace (see further below). Lektronic was famously refused protection by the USPTO on the grounds of being descriptive for electronic goods.\n\nA generic term is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as \"salt\" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone—including other manufacturers—to refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as genericized trademarks. Marks which are a misspelling of a generic term (e.g., the elimination of a space) do not change the generic significance of the term.\n\nIn trademark litigation, courts are most frequently asked to distinguish between \"suggestive\" and \"descriptive\" marks on the one hand, and between \"descriptive\" and \"generic\" marks on the other. This is because suggestive marks, like fanciful and arbitrary marks, are presumed to be entitled to trademark protection, while descriptive marks are entitled to protection if they have become known as representing the producer of the goods, and generic marks can never receive protection. It can be seen from the examples above that the distinctive character of a term is closely related to the products or services in relation to which the term is used.\n\nA general method for assessing the distinctive character of a mark is to consider a consumer's reaction to a mark. The mark may only be inherently registrable if the consumer has never encountered the mark before. On the other hand, the mark is unlikely to be inherently registrable if it informs him about any characteristic of the relevant products or services (e.g. whether they are delicious, large, spicy, black, or sweet, in the case of fruit). In any other case the mark may not be registrable.\n\nAnother example of a descriptive mark would be a geographical word or phrase that merely indicates the origin of the product or service. For example, Houston based ice cream might find that the name \"Houston ice cream\" is denied trademark protection on the grounds that the word Houston is merely descriptive. However, they might have better luck with the name \"North Pole ice cream\". In the latter case, although North Pole is a geographical location, the ice cream is not actually made at the North Pole, and no reasonable person would assume that the phrase North Pole is literally descriptive.\n\nTherefore marks that identify or describe a product or service, or that are in common use, or that are used as geographical indications, generally cannot be registered as trademarks, and remain in the public domain for use by anyone. For example, a generic term such as \"apple\", or descriptive terms such as \"red\" or \"juicy\" could not be registered in relation to apples.\n\nPrimary consideration in the selection and use of trademarks should be given to marks which are inherently distinctive, as they possess the strongest distinctive character and do not require evidence of use to establish acquired distinctiveness. A fanciful, arbitrary, or suggestive term can be inherently distinctive and registrable without proof of acquired distinctiveness.\nAlthough these categories are most easily applied in relation to trademarks comprising words, the same general principles are applied in relation to all kinds of trademarks. For example, a pine tree shape is descriptive when used on pine-scented products.\n\nA trademark with no distinctive character (i.e. a mark which is not inherently distinctive) is prima facie unregistrable. However, most jurisdictions may still allow such marks to be registered if the trademark owner can demonstrate, typically by reference to evidence of use, that consumers in the marketplace exclusively associate the mark, as used on the identified goods or in connection with the identified services, with a particular commercial origin or source (i.e. the trademark owner). \"Use\" may include authorized use by a licensee or other party. If the trade marks office is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that a mark has \"acquired\" distinctive character \"as a matter of fact\", then the mark may be accepted for registration on the basis of acquired distinctiveness.\n\nThe nature and extent of acceptable evidence of use varies between jurisdictions, although the most useful evidence usually includes sales figures, details of advertising and promotional expenditure, and examples of promotional material. Consumer surveys may also help establish that consumers chiefly associate an otherwise non-distinctive mark with the trademark owner and its products or services. Generally, evidence of use may only be acceptable or relevant if it covers a certain period of time (e.g. three years prior to the filing date of the trademark application) and originates from within the jurisdiction where registration is sought.\n\nThe terminology of acquired distinctiveness is accepted in the European Union and Commonwealth jurisdictions such as Australia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, and the common law jurisdiction of the United States (which also uses the term secondary meaning). In the U.S., if a trademark has been used for a continuous period of at least five years after the date of registration, the right to use the mark and the registration may become \"incontestable\" (e.g. invulnerable to cancellation for non-use, but not for becoming generic). In such cases the USPTO checks and confirms whether the request for incontestability meets formality requirements, but whether a registration is incontestable at law can only be determined during legal proceedings involving the registration.\n\nThe essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, such that a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark, which can be enforced by way of an action for trademark infringement, while unregistered trademark rights may be enforced pursuant to the common law tort of passing off.\n\nIt should be noted that trademark rights generally arise out of the use and/or registration (see below) of a mark in connection only with a specific type or range of products or services. Although it may sometimes be possible to take legal action to prevent the use of a mark in relation to products or services outside this range (e.g. for passing off), this does not mean that trademark law prevents the use of that mark by the general public. A common word, phrase, or other sign can only be removed from the public domain to the extent that a trademark owner is able to maintain exclusive rights over that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections. For a case study in both concepts, see Apple Corps and its disputes with Apple, Inc.\n\nIf a court rules that a trademark has become \"generic\" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.\n\nFor example, the Bayer company's trademark \"Aspirin\" has been ruled generic in the United States, so other companies may use that name for acetylsalicylic acid as well (although it is still a trademark in Canada). Xerox for photocopiers and Band-Aid for adhesive bandages are both trademarks which are at risk of succumbing to death by becoming declared generic in certain countries, something that the respective trademark owners actively seek to prevent. In order to prevent marks becoming generic, trademark owners often contact those who appear to be using the trademark incorrectly, from web page authors to dictionary editors, and request that they cease the improper usage.\n\nThe proper use of a trademark means using the mark as an adjective, not as a noun or a verb, though for certain trademarks, use as nouns and, less commonly, verbs is common. For example, Adobe sent e-mails to many web authors using the term \"photoshopped\" telling them that they should only use the term \"modified by Adobe® Photoshop® software.\" Xerox has also purchased print advertisements declaring that \"you cannot 'xerox' a document, but you can copy it on a Xerox Brand copying on machine.\" Another popular example is the use of the word \"frappuccino\" by Starbucks customers to mean any blended coffee beverage, though employees are instructed to only say \"frappuccino blended coffee\" or \"frappuccino blended cream\" when referring to such drinks. This rule is not hard-and-fast, however; for example, Lexis-Nexis has a U.S. trademark registration for \"Shepardize,\" Reg. No. 1743711, and defines \"Shepardizing on a web page as \"the process of looking up citations\" in \"a series of books called Shepard's Citations.\" Such efforts may or may not be successful in preventing genericism in the long run, which depends less on the mark owner's efforts and more on how the public actually perceives and uses the mark. In fact, legally it is more important that the trademark holder visibly and actively seems to attempt to prevent its trademark from becoming generic, regardless of real success.\n\n\n"}
