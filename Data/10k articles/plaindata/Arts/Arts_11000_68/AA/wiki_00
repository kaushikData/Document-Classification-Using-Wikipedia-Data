{"id": "12693672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12693672", "title": "Art Workers' Coalition", "text": "Art Workers' Coalition\n\nThe Art Workers' Coalition (AWC) was an open coalition of artists, filmmakers, writers, critics, and museum staff that formed in New York City in January 1969. Its principal aim was to pressure the city's museums – notably the Museum of Modern Art – into implementing economic and political reforms. These included a more open and less exclusive exhibition policy concerning the artists they exhibited and promoted: the absence of women artists and artists of color was a principal issue of contention, which led to the formation of Women Artists in Revolution (WAR) in 1969. The coalition successfully pressured the MoMA and other museums into implementing a free admission day that still exists in certain museums to this day. It also pressured and picketed museums into taking a moral stance on the Vietnam War which resulted in its famous My Lai poster \"And babies\", one of the most important works of political art of the early 1970s. The poster was displayed during demonstrations in front of Pablo Picasso′s Guernica at the MoMA in 1970.\n\nThe AWC grew out of an incident at MoMA during the exhibition curated by Pontus Hulten, \"The Machine at the End of the Mechanical Age\": on January 3, 1969, Greek kinetic sculptor Takis, with the support of friends, physically removed his work from the exhibition. Although the work, \"Tele-sculpture\" (1960), had been purchased by the MoMA in 1963 and thus belonged to its permanent collection, Takis was unhappy with the museum's lack of consultation in choosing a work for exhibition which he considered no longer adequately represented his current artistic practice. The artist took his work into the museum's sculpture garden and remained there until he received confirmation from museum officials that his work would be withdrawn from the exhibition. The incident led to a series of meetings held at the Chelsea Hotel in which the group that had supported Takis's action discussed issues relating to the political and social responsibility of the art community. The group included Takis, American kinetic sculptor Wen-Ying Tsai, German conceptual artist Hans Haacke, American writer and independent curator Willoughby Sharp, co-founder of \"Avalanche\" Liza Bear, American artist and \"Village Voice\" art critic John Perreault, and American minimalist artist Carl Andre. On January 28, 1969, the AWC presented MoMa's director Bates Lowry with a list of 13 demands. \n\nThe 13 Demands that AWC submitted to Lowry were as follows:\n\nUpon receiving AWC's 13 Demands, MoMA met and held a dialogue with artist representatives from AWC that was publicly acknowledged. Lowry and MoMA, however, refused to meet all of the specific demands of the AWC, such as the demand to hold a public hearing on the topic \"The Museum's Relationship to Artists and to Society\". After organizing a number of demonstrations in front of the museum, the group held an open hearing at the New York School of Visual Arts on 10 April 1969. The event was retitled \"What Should Be the Program of The Art Workers Regarding Museum Reform, and to Establish the Program of the Art Workers' Coalition.\" Some three hundred artists and members of the New York art community attended the hearing. The initial demands that had been made to the MoMA were debated within the larger group that formed during the open hearing, and later refined and addressed to all New York Museums. Artists and critics subsequently debated various subjects of contention including artists' rights, museum policy and broader political issues including the Vietnam War. On 15 October 1969, the AWC organized a successful \"Moratorium of Art to End the War in Vietnam.\" The MoMA, the Whitney Museum, the Jewish Museum and a large number of commercial art galleries closed for the day. The Metropolitan Museum and the Guggenheim Museum did not comply, although, under pressure from the AWC, the Metropolitan did postpone the opening of its American painting and sculpture show scheduled for that day, while the Guggenheim was picketed. The coalition's activities eventually led to changes in how museums interact with artists, a contribution to the art world that is considered lasting in spite of the coalition's short three-year existence. The AWC ceased its activities at the end of 1971.\n\n1. http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/art-workers-coalition-demonstrates-artists-rights-1969 \n2. http://primaryinformation.org/files/FOH.pdf\n3. <http://www.leftmatrix.com/artworkerscolist.html> \n4. <Artwords: Discourse on the 60s and 70s - Page 121, by Jeanne Seigal> \n5.<Kill for Peace: American Artists Against the Vietnam War.

{"id": "17904366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17904366", "title": "Bible moralisée", "text": "Bible moralisée\n\nThe Bible moralisée is a later name for the most important example of the medieval picture bibles, called in general \"biblia pauperum\", to have survived. They are heavily illustrated, and extremely expensive, illuminated manuscripts of the thirteenth century, and from the copies that still survive it is clear that they existed in at least two versions with different contents. They were similar in the choice and order of the Biblical texts selected, but differed in the allegorical and moral deductions drawn from these passages.\n\nThough large, the manuscripts only contained selections of the text of the Bible, along with commentary and illustrations. Each page pairs Old and New Testament episodes with illustrations explaining their moral significance in terms of typology.\n\nThere are seven surviving fully illustrated manuscripts of the Bible moralisée group; all date from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries and were designed for the personal use of the French royal family. Four were created in the early thirteenth century, when church art dominated the decorative arts. As common in stained glass and other Gothic art of the time, the illustrations are framed within medallions. The text explained the theological and moral meanings of the text. Many artists were involved in the creation of each of the \"Bibles moralisées\", and their identities and shares of the work remain unclear.\n\nIn the European Middle Ages the Catholic church made use of pictures as a means of instruction, to supplement the knowledge acquired by reading or oral teaching. Books only existed in manuscript form and, being extremely costly, were beyond the means of most people. Hardly anyone could read, outside the ranks of the clergy and the monks. So frescoes of scenes from the Old and New Testaments, stained-glass windows, and the like were set up in the churches, because, as the Synod of Arras (1025) said, \"The illiterate contemplated in the lineaments of painting what they, having never learnt to read, could not discern in writing\".\n\nPictures spread abroad a knowledge of the events recorded in the Bible and of the mutual connection between the leading facts of the Old and New Testaments, whether as type and antitype, or as prophecy and fulfillment. For this purpose the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages were copied and put in circulation. Parts of these go back to the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\nThe \"Bibles moralisées\" were created to interpret and explain scripture. A broad didactic movement in the first half of the thirteenth century was one that placed an importance on pictures teaching morality. The \"Bible moralisées\" was part of this movement and attempted to do just that. Both the depiction and text must be read because the images hold an interpretation of the world or moment in history, and details within the images hold symbolic meaning.\n\nThe manuscripts were for private use, specifically the \"Bibles moraliées\" were designed to teach the French kings. The second of the bible manuscripts, Vienna 1179, may have been written in Latin for the purpose of teaching Louis VIII.\n\nThis Bible, as indeed all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, did not contain the full text of the Bible, and contained much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis of moral and allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the Psalter he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the Gospels he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused diatessaron of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there does not seem to be any very obvious connection between them. Thus the sleep of Adam, recorded in the beginning of Genesis, is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and Abraham sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for his son is a type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the Apostles to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.\n\nThe entire work contains about 5,000 illustrations. The pictures are arranged in two parallel columns on each page, each column having four medallions with pictures. Parallel to the pictures and alternating with them are two other narrower columns, with four legends each, one legend to each picture; the legends consisting alternatively of Biblical texts and moral or allegorical applications; whilst the pictures represent the subjects of the Biblical texts or of the applications of them. The illustrations are executed with the greatest skill. The painting is said to be one of the best specimens of thirteenth-century work and the MS. was in all probability prepared for someone in the highest rank of life. A specimen of the second edition of the \"Bible Moralisée\" is to be found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (MS. Français No. 167). Whilst it is identical with the copy which has just been examined in the selection and order of the Biblical passages, it differs from it in the greater simplicity and brevity of the moral and allegorical teaching based on them. Another important Bible, intended to instruct by means of pictures, was that which has been called the \"Bible Historiée toute figurée\". It was a work of the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of the fourteenth century. In general outline and plan it resembles the class of Bible which has gone before, but it differs from it in the selection of Bible passages and in the allegorical explanations derived from them. Coming to the life of Christ, the author of the \"Bible Historiée toute figurée\" dispensed with a written text altogether, and contented himself with writing over the pictures depicting scenes of Christ's life, a brief explanatory legend.\n\nThe article “The Iconography of Theophilus Windows in the First Half of the Thirteenth Century” by Cothren compares the \"Bibles moralisées\" with Theophilus Windows because both have a didactic idea to use pictures to explain ideas regarding morals as well as to juxtapose scenes from the old and new testament. The difference is that stained glass art and the Theophilus Windows are created for public viewing while the \"Bibles moralisées\" were not. Both the Theophilus Windows and the \"Bibles moralisées\" are a part of a didactic movement, wherein pictures are relied upon to teach morality.\n\nThe best known copy of the first version is one of the most sumptuous illustrated manuscripts preserved to us from the Middle Ages. It no longer as a single volume; it has been split up into three separate parts kept in three libraries. The first part, consisting of 224 leaves, is in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The second part of 222 leaves is in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris; and the third part, made up of 178 leaves, is kept in the British Library. Six leaves of the third part are missing, so that it ought to contain 184 leaves. When complete and bound together, therefore, the whole volume consisted of 630 leaves, written and illustrated on one side only.\n\nThe Oxford-Paris-London manuscripts consist of 3 volumes and artists had left evidence in their work of working under time pressure. The Oxford-Paris-London bible was the most accessible through publication for five decades in the 20th century.\n\nVienna 2554 made it to the Imperial Library in Vienna in 1783. It is the most familiar of the bibles. It has a frontispiece that is one of the most reproduced images of the Middle Ages. This manuscript is the most accessible to scholars from all the \"Bibles moralisées\", this is due to an exceptional facsimile that has been published in full colour. This facsimile was published in three thousand copies at its original size in 1973. As well, the facsimile has been republished (first in 1992 and again in 1995) twice at half the size of the original. These publications have allowed the wide exchange of Vienna 2554. The second of the bibles is also in Vienna, its codex is 1179, and it is less accessible than Vienna 2554 through publication. Some evidence shows that Vienna 1179 was a rethought version of what was first created in Vienna 2554; this reverses the usual connection that is made between the two.\n\nBecause of the close relations between France and Spain in the 13th century, there appeared several moralized Bibles in Spain at this time. One complete version, similar to that described above, is the St. Louis Bible. It was copied and illustrated between 1226 and 1234 in Paris on the orders of Blanche of Castile for her son Louis IX, who gave it to Alfonso X of Castile; it remains in good condition in the Cathedral of Toledo. The three volumes are exhibited in the Cathedral Treasury, making this 3 volume bible the easiest of all the \"bibles moralisées\" for any visitor to see, but yet it was also the most difficult for a scholar to be allowed to study. The number of requests the cathedral Chapter received from scholars seeking direct access to the Bible of St Louis in order to study and conduct research on a great many subjects, increased every day, so eventually the Chapter decided to produce a facsimile edition of the Bible of St Louis. After approaching different publishing houses, the project was finally entrusted to M. Moleiro Editor in Barcelona and since 2006 a complete facsimile edition is available.\n\nThere was also the Spanish \"Biblia moralizada\" (Biblioteca nacional de Madrid 10232) from the late 14th century, which contains independently translated passages and glosses, though it has few illuminations.\n\nOf the seven \"Bibles moralisées\" only one, manuscript Français 167 in the Bibliothèque nationale de France at Paris, has survived in its complete form. Français 167 can be traced almost without a break from its creation in Paris for King John II of France in 1349-52 up until now. The sixth of the \"Bibles moralisées\" is known now as MS Additional 18719 and is the least known of the seven, and is the work of well known late thirteenth-century English artist. Français 166 is the last of the seven fully illustrated \"Bibles moralisées\".\n\nHistorians still dispute the time, place and the intended readers of the first two bibles moralisées, though consensus seems to believe that they were created during the first three decades of the thirteenth century in Paris.\n\n\nIn the \"Bibles moralisées\" all the artists who worked on the manuscripts could not be identified, at times the number of artists who worked on a manuscript could be distinguished. For example, in the Add. 18719 manuscript, the illustrations were created by a number of craftsmen with speed and sloppiness, borders are completed crudely and in freehand. Meanwhile, in Français 167 fifteen artists were distinguished. Français 166 is different in this regard, because some of the artists were identified. Three of the five artists of Français166 were identified, including young Master of the Psalter of Jeanne de Laval, Maitre de Jouvenel, and the Master of the Geneva Boccaccio. These artists did not work at the same time but rather picking up where the one before stopped. There is a possible connection between the Limbourg brothers in 1402 -1404 and the illustrations within Français 166 first three quires.\n\nIn the four early \"Bibles moralisées\", only one side of each page of parchment was used; this procedure increased the size of the volume as well as made the creation of these bibles very expensive. Unlike the earlier \"Bibles moralisées\", Add. 18719 and other later \"Bibles moralisées\" used both sides of the parchment, hence costs as well as size of the manuscript was decreased. This change allowed for a more convenient one volume manuscript. Although this change may signal that money was a factor when creating later manuscripts.\n\nThe text/picture blocks in the \"Bibles Moralisées\" are striking for their symmetry. Each of the pages hold 8 medallions with painted gold backgrounds, these 8 medallions are arranged in pairs, so 4 rows of two medallions. Where the medallions touch one another a stylized flower joins the two, similar flowers mark where the medallions touch the outer frame and the spaces between the medallions are decorated using squares placed over quatrefoils, in these there are painted angel busts over a gold “ground”. Each of the paintings within the medallions held figures that were painted on a gold leaf background, and are set on a patterned ground of blue or rose brown.\n\nAs an example, in BnF MS Français 9561 129 pages are taken up with the Old Testament. Of these the earlier ones are divided horizontally in the centre, and it is the upper part of the page that contains the picture illustrative of some Old Testament event. The lower part represents a corresponding scene from the New Testament. further on in the volume, three pictures appear in the upper part of the page, and three below. Seventy-six pages at the end of the volume are devoted to depicting the lives of Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin.\n\nIn most of the \"Bibles moralisées\", evidence shows that scribes completed the text after the decorations were completed. The text supplemented the images, being similar to a caption. This can be seen most obviously where the text goes over the gilding or the borders that had been painted for the text to fit in. A difference between MS Additional 18719 and the earlier \"Bibles moralisées\" is that MS Additional 18719 (and Add.18719) followed the usual procedure for manuscript illumination, where the scribes worked first and then the artists added images.\n\nFrançais 166 copies the layout and text that is used in Français 167. Meanwhile, Vienna 1179 and Toledo are very similar, at times the two be told apart in photographs, since they consist of the same layout. Français 167 is similar to Add. 18719 in that unlike the other \"Bibles moralisées\" they both sides of the parchment sheets.\n\nAlmost all of the manuscripts dated to the medieval period have been rebound. For example, Add. 18719 was rebound in modern times the stitching of the new binding is characteristic of the tight stitch technique that was used by the British Museum in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nVienna 1179 was badly damaged by water at an early date; the damage was not equal to all pages but sufficient to require the rewriting of all the texts positioned in the upper part of the affected pages. This rewriting can be witnessed in that the scribe who restored the texts on Ruth was not the original scribe, his work was not angular and appeared more the inscriptions used in Toledo pr Oxford-Paris London, two other bibles of the \"bibles moralisées\", hence this damage was caused after the manuscript was completed.\n\nFrançais 167 went through an early restoration, due to extensive water damage. Three sides of the parchment leaves had been cut off in the majority of the book and replacements strips were glued on, also the text was inked again in certain places that had been affected by the replacement strips. The images that were replaced were created to imitate the originals and have been identified as having been completed by a master working for King Charles V around 1370-1380.\n\nEven the parts of Français 166 that survived were never fully completed. All the aspects of Français 166, such as the headers, drawing of the frames, paintings etc., are all in different stages of completion at different points in the manuscript. Add. 18719 was entirely illustrated using drawings, this brings up questions about whether it was left unfinished.\n\nOne of the artist who illustrated Add. 18719, identified only as artist E, used exceptional skills in his drawings. His figures were tall and thin with elongated necks. The figures are clothed in drapery that hangs and shows heavy angular folds. The heads sit at odd angles on the necks, often tilted sharply. The figures have broad foreheads and small chins. This artist’s work was compared to the Ashridge Comestor, British Library, MS Royal 3.D.VI, which is a different manuscript. The style used by artist E is reminiscent of the Carolingian Rheims School of art. The Rheims school also used elongated figures, with long necks and figures. The heads of some of the sketches also sit peculiarly on the shoulders and draperies in which the figures are clothed also have angular folds. The Rheims school of art produced art that gave much feeling of motion.\n\nThe early Bibles moralisées are an example of the move away from the Byzantine influences, this movement is part of the early gothic art movement. The early gothic style lasted until the middle of the thirteenth century and is characterized by a softer and more realistic style than the Byzantine influenced style. “In France the style is particularly noticeable in a series of magnificent Bibles Moralisées ... done probably for the French court c. 1230–40.”\n\nThe Vienna 2554 frontispiece is famous and has often been reproduced. This frontispiece shows God`s figure bent while in the work of creation. “There is no close iconographic antecedent for this image.” In this image God is utilizing a huge pair of compasses, which are carefully balanced so as to draw and define. God’s left hand seems to be in the process of putting the disk that is the cosmos into motion. In a broadly read study of Gothic architecture by Otto Von Simpson, this image is titled “The Creator as Architect,” this theme has been important from Plato and onward. Yet the meaning of this frontispiece has been widely debated. Vienna 1179 also has a full page creator image. In this image God is seated on a backless throne and he is holding the orb of the universe in his lap. With his right hand he turns the compasses. In this image he is enclosed within a rectangular frame by a mandorla supported at the corners by four flying angels. This idea of god as a creator, with images of god holding compasses has been reproduced in several of the Bibles moralisées and many debates have surrounded the meaning and origin of this idea.\n\nThe \"Bibles moralisées\" were created on high quality parchment paper. Each of the bibles was one of the most expensive books that had been created within medieval Europe. All of the bibles were created on large sheets of high- quality parchment in which the work was only done on one side of each parchment. Expensive paint and ink was used in the creation of the \"Bibles moralisées\" as well, for example the blue that was used for the borders, backgrounds, and clothes was lapis lazuli. Few held the resources to commission these works other than royalty. In each page of the \"Bibles moralisées\" there are eight images arranged within four columns. Each is a biblical and moralizing image that is accompanied by a text. Unlike most illuminated manuscripts where the images are secondary to the text, in these manuscripts the images are the dominant aspect, this is evident in that the manuscripts contain more than 24, 000 illustrations.\n\nVienna 2554 now stands apart from the other \"Bibles moralisées\" as noticeably the smallest, consisting of 131 folios. The damage and disorder of the pages now leave little evidence of the original length of the volume. Meanwhile, Vienna 1179 is almost two times the thickness of Vienna 2554, consisting of 246 folios. MS Additional 18719 now consists of 311 folios, while the original total was 321 folios and 642 pages. Français 167 is a single volume and it contains 322 numbered folios. Lastly, Français 166 consists of one volume and 169 folios, containing 1,340 illustrations.\n\nThere is a MS. existing in the British Museum (addit. 1577) entitled \"Figures de la Bible\" consisting of pictures illustrating events in the Bible with short descriptive text. This is of the end of the thirteenth, or the beginning of the fourteenth, century. Of the same date is the \"Historia Bibliæ metrice\" which is preserved in the same library and, as the name implies, has a metrical text. The Velislai biblia picta is a 14th-century Bohemiann picture bible.\n\nThere are specimens of manuscript illustrated Bibles of earlier date. Examples are the Bible preserved in the library of the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, Rome; that of the Amiens Library (MS. 108), and that of the Royal Library of The Hague (MS. 69).\n\n\n"}

Their relationship thrives until an opportunity to return to acting forces them to make life-altering decisions.\n\n\"Bloomington\" was written and directed by Fernanda Cardoso and filmed in Indianapolis, Indiana and Los Angeles, California.\n\nJackie Kirk, a former child actress, catches the eye of an infamous, predatory lesbian teacher, named Catherine Stark (McAtee), when Jackie attends college in Bloomington, Indiana. Jackie attempts to fit in with her fellow students, who are in awe of her acting background. After meeting at an on-campus mixer, Catherine and Jackie begin a secret and scandalous affair that draws Jackie away from the college social life. Catherine and Jackie grow closer as they help each other discover more about themselves, when suddenly Jackie gets the chance to return to acting. Catherine becomes uncomfortable with their situation, seeing how it could seemingly never work out, with Jackie having to constantly visit Catherine under the guise of her just being a \"friend,\" as it would be hazardous for both of them for should their romance ever got out.\n\nCatherine attempts to distance herself from Jackie by trying to declare they were never in a formal relationship, and that Jackie is not worth it in Catherine's eyes, while Jackie claims Catherine is worth it. Jackie, at odds with her friends, gets into a fight with Sandy (Erika Heidewald), jealous that Jackie is competing for a scholarship she doesn't need and angry that Jackie's affair with a teacher means she gets preferential treatment. Jackie slaps Sandy, who punches her in the face. The next day Jackie shows up at Catherine's doorstep with a black eye.

{"id": "390693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390693", "title": "Born in Flames", "text": "Born in Flames\n\nBorn in Flames is a 1983 documentary-style feminist fiction film by Lizzie Borden that explores racism, classism, sexism, and heterosexism in an alternative United States socialist democracy. The title comes from the song \"Born in Flames\" written by a member of Art & Language, Mayo Thompson of the band Red Krayola.\n\nThe plot concerns two feminist groups in New York City, each voicing their concerns to the public by pirate radio. One group, led by an outspoken white lesbian, Isabel (Adele Bertei), operates \"Radio Ragazza\". The other group, led by a soft-spoken African-American, Honey (Honey), operates \"Phoenix Radio.\" The local community is stimulated into action after a world-traveling political activist, Adelaide Norris (Jean Satterfield), is arrested upon arriving at a New York City airport, and suspiciously dies while in police custody. Also, there is a Women's Army led by Hilary Hurst (Hilary Hurst) and advised by Zella (Flo Kennedy) that initially both Honey and Isabel refuse to join. This group, along with Norris and the radio stations, are under investigation by a callous FBI agent (Ron Vawter). Their progress is tracked by three editors (Becky Johnston, Pat Murphy, Kathryn Bigelow) for a socialist newspaper, who go so far they get fired.\n\nThe story involves several different women coming from different perspectives and attempts to show several examples of how sexism plays out on the street, and how it can be dealt with through direct action. At one point, two men attack a woman on the street, and dozens of women on bicycles with whistles come to chase the men away and comfort the woman. The movie shows women, despite their various differences, organizing in meetings, doing radio shows, creating art, wheatpasting, putting a condom on a penis, wrapping raw chicken at a processing plant, etc. The film portrays a world rife with violence against women, high female unemployment, and government oppression. The women in the film start to come together to make a bigger impact, by means that some would call terrorism.\n\nUltimately, after both radio stations are suspiciously burned down, Honey and Isabel team up and broadcast \"Phoenix Ragazza Radio\" from stolen U-Haul vans. They also join the Women's Army, which sends a group of terrorists to interrupt a broadcast of the President of the United States proposing that women be paid to do housework, followed by bombing the antenna on top of the World Trade Center to prevent additional such destructive messages from the mainstream.\n\n\nThis film marks the first screen appearance of Eric Bogosian. He plays a technician at a TV station who is forced at gunpoint to run a videotape on the network feed. The movie also features a rare acting appearance by Academy Award-winning film director Kathryn Bigelow. Story contributor Ed Bowes portrays the head of the socialist newspaper that ultimately fires the female journalists.\n\nIn 1983, the film won the Reader Jury prize at the Berlin International Film Festival and the Grand Prix at the Créteil International Women's Film Festival.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that nine of twelve reviews were positive; the average rating is 6.8/10. \"Variety\" wrote that it has \"all the advantages and the disadvantages of a home movie\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Only those who already share Miss Borden's ideas are apt to find her film persuasive.\" Marjorie Baumgarten of \"The Austin Chronicle\" wrote, \"Beautifully made, courageously edited, and swift-moving, this challenging, provocative film is a work that is both humanist and revolutionary.\" Frances Dickinson of \"Time Out London\" wrote that Borden \"[handles] her story with audacity and make[s] even the driest argument crackle with humour, while the more poignant moments burn with a fierce white heat.\" \"TV Guide\" rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, \"This feminist film wins laurels for close attention to detail in a radical filmmaking effort.\" Greg Baise of the \"Metro Times\" called it \"an early '80s landmark of indie and queer cinema\". The film has had experienced somewhat of a renaissance after the 35mm restoration print premiered in 2016 at the Anthology Film Archives. Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, \"...the free, ardent, spontaneous creativity of “Born in Flames” emerges as an indispensable mode of radical change—one that many contemporary filmmakers with political intentions have yet to assimilate.\" He also wrote, \"Borden's exhilarating collage-like story stages news reports, documentary sequences, and surveillance footage alongside tough action scenes and musical numbers; her violent vision is both ideologically complex and chilling.\" Melissa Anderson of The Village Voice wrote \"this unruly, unclassifiable film — perhaps the sole entry in the hybrid genre of radical-lesbian-feminist sci-fi vérité — premiered two years into the Reagan regime, but its fury proves as bracing today as it was back when this country began its inexorable shift to the right.\"\n\n\nThe film is discussed in Christina Lane's book \"Feminist Hollywood: From \"Born in Flames\" to \"Point Break\"\".\n\nA “graphic translation” of the movie made by artist Kaisa Lassinaro, which contains an interview of Lizzie Borden, was published by Occasional Papers in 2011. The book is a collage composition made of screencaps with a selection of dialogues from the movie.\n\nIn 2013, a dossier on the film was published as a special issue of Women & Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory. With an introduction from Craig Willse and Dean Spade, the dossier includes a number of essays that address race, queerness, intersectionality, radicalism, violence, and feminism in the film.\n\nThe film was restored in 2016 by Anthology Film Archives. The 35mm restoration film premiered in Feb. 2016 at the Anthology. It was very well received, with glowing reviews, from Richard Brody in New Yorker.com, The Political Science Fiction of “Born in Flames” and from many other journalists, including Melissa Anderson in The Village Voice. Borden was invited to show the new 35mm print in Brussels, Barcelona, Madrid, San Sebastian, Milan, Toronto, The Edinburgh Film Festival, The London Film Festival, along with screenings in Detroit, Rochester, San Francisco, Los Angeles and including in series of \"films of resistance.\"\n\n\n"}

It originated as the Cardiff School of Art in 1865.\n\nCardiff School of Art & Design opened in 1865 as the Cardiff School of Science & Art with lessons initially taking place on the top floor of the Cardiff Free Library and Museum. In 1867 a distinct School of Art was formed, based on the Art Night School, with 65 young pupils aged between 9 and 17. In 1868 an older intake was accepted, of 50 'artisan' students between 17 and 25 years old.\n\nIn 1966, a new six-storey campus was built in Howard Gardens, Cardiff, with large studios facing north. The building was designed by the Cardiff City Architect, John Dryburgh.\n\nThe School merged with other colleges in 1976 to become part of South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education (later Cardiff Institute of Higher Education and the University of Wales Institute Cardiff). It is the oldest constituent part of Cardiff Metropolitan University.\n\nIn 2013, Cardiff Metropolitan University put its 2.25 acre Howard Gardens campus up for sale with the intention of moving to a new site in summer 2014. The School now occupies a brand new purpose built building at the university's Llandaff Campus. This new building has extensive purpose built studios and workshops and includes the MIT FabLab, the Perceptual Experience Laboratory, the Schools Foundry and Ceramics facilities as well as its undergraduate, postgraduate and research studios and workshops.\n\nCardiff School of Art & Design was assessed as one of the top 40 destinations to study art and design in the UK by guardian.co.uk in 2010.\n\nCSAD has thirteen 'Subject' areas: Animation, Architectural Studies, Ceramics, Fashion Design, Fine Art, Graphic Communication, Illustration, Interior Design, International Design, Photographic Practice, Product Design, Textiles and an ideas, histories and theories subject area called Constellation. \n\nAll of its 'Subjects' can be studied at undergraduate, (BA/BSc) postgraduate (MA/MDes/MFA/MSc) and at research degree level (PhD) or Professional Doctorate (PDoc). \n\nCSAD has a number of partner colleges who deliver its Art & Design Foundation Diploma, HNCs, Foundation Degrees and a further BA on its behalf as well as close links with Ffotogallery, Cardiff and Cardiff University Medical School. It has research affiliations and study exchange agreements with numerous other UK, EU and International Universities. \n\nCSAD is affiliated with the Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association, and University Alliance.\n\nThe school's Art and Design research is conducted through the Wales Institute for Research in Art and Design (WIRAD). In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the Art & Design panel rated 95% of the research submission as international standard, with 70% rated as either Internationally Excellent or World Leading.\n\nIt is home to a number of highly regarded international standard research groups which range across the humanities, art, design and sciences as well as the Centre for Ceramic studies.\n\nThe Cardiff Open Art School (COAS) is part of the School, and runs classes in photography, ceramics, life drawing, printmaking and several other disciplines for part-time students in the Cardiff area in particular through the School's relationship with FFotogallery, Cardiff.\n\nIn June 2010, the CSAD Summer Degree Show was voted the best in the UK for painting by \"Artists and Illustrators\" magazine.\n\nIn 2009, CSAD won both a HEIST bronze award and a best publication award at the Association of Commonwealth Universities Annual Marketing and Communications awards.\n\nQuality Assurance International (QAI) together with Planet EDU offer a number of awards closely based on the Cardiff School of Art & design curriculum. These awards run up to diploma level in a number of centres across India. The School has exchange partners right across the world as diverse and far afield as Australia, California, Mexico, Reunion, India, South Korea, Egypt and Lebanon as well as Erasmus partners around Europe all of whom offer Cardiff School of Art & Design students opportunities for travel and exchange.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2082902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2082902", "title": "Celtic art", "text": "Celtic art\n\nCeltic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.\n\nCeltic art is a difficult term to define, covering a huge expanse of time, geography and cultures. A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use \"Celtic\" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about \"Celtic art\" only from the La Tène period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards. Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD. The Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the Book of Kells and other masterpieces, and is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called Insular art in art history. This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.\n\nBoth styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly the few standing male figures found, like the Warrior of Hirschlanden and the so-called \"Lord of Glauberg\", were originally common in wood.\n\nAlso covered by the term is the visual art of the Celtic Revival (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by Modern Celts, mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and nationalism, and became popular well beyond the Celtic nations, and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from Celtic cross funerary monuments to interlace tattoos. Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age. Another influence was that of late La Tène \"vegetal\" art on the Art Nouveau movement.\n\nTypically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the classical tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: \"Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces\".\n\nThe ancient peoples now called \"Celts\" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples. The extent to which \"Celtic\" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial.\n\nCeltic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.\n\nThe term \"Celt\" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Κελτοι, \"Celtae\"). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic—and Goidelic—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland.\nThen in the 18th century the interest in \"primitivism\", which led to the idea of the \"noble savage\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The \"Irish revival\" came after the \"Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829\" as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the \"Celtic Revival\".\n\nThe earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture, comes from the early European Iron Age, ca. 800-450 BC. Nonetheless the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on \"Celticization\" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions. Megalithic art across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many rock drawings left by the Neolithic Boyne Valley culture in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later. Other centres such as Brittany are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today. Other correspondences are between the gold lunulas and large collars of Bronze Age Ireland and Europe and the torcs of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck. The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration.\n\nUnlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern \"Celtic nations\", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for \"town\", oppidum, is now used. The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves. The work of the German émigré to Oxford, Paul Jacobsthal, remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his \"Early Celtic Art\" of 1944.\n\nThe Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles. Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as \"Celtic\".\n\nAs Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek krater from the Vix Grave in Burgundy, which was made in Magna Graecia (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited. It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres. Another huge Greek vessel in the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others. Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.\nFigures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are \"cult wagons\" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect. There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a \"leaf crown\" — two flattish rounded projections, \"resembling a pair of bloated commas\", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.\n\nHuman heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based. Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions. In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large. There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.\n\nThe most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including reliefs, come from southern France, at Roquepertuse and Entremont, close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed. These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier.\n\nIn general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people. There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offerings), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the Waterloo Helmet, often have no similar other finds for comparison. Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear.\n\nAbout 500 BC the La Tène style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction. The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy and modern Hungary. In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all. Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including Scythian art and that of the Greeks and Etruscans among others. The occupation by the Persian Achaemenid Empire of Thrace and Macedonia around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance. La Tène style is \"a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes\".\n\nThe most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display. Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery. Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich \"princely\" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from inhumation burials to cremation.\n\nThe torc was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner. Bracelets and armlets were also common. An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant. The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, Chamalières, France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at Clermont-Ferrand.\nSeveral phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain. In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the \"early\" or \"strict\" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the \"vegetal\", \"Continuous Vegetal\", \"Waldalgesheim style\", or De Navarro II, where ornament is \"typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface\".\n\nAfter about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into \"plastic\" and \"sword\" styles, the latter mainly found on scabbards and the former featuring decoration in high relief. One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a \"Disney style\" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an \"Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC\". De Navarro distinguishes the \"insular\" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V, and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.\nThe often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. So a torc in the rich Vix Grave terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the Snettisham Hoard that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up. The 1st century BC Gundestrup cauldron, is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69 cm, height 42 cm), but though much of its iconography seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of Thracian manufacture. To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark. The Agris Helmet in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs.\n\nBy the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements.\n\nA form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.\nDespite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality. Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard chapes, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350-150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern Northern Ireland, notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion. It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.\n\nBut in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations. Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south. However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a period of instability in Ireland.\n\nAfter the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles. Roman Britain produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the fibula but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult, for example a \"hinged brass collar\" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context. Britain also made more use of enamel than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element. Enamel decoration on penannular brooches, \"dragonesque\" brooches, and hanging bowls appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.\n\nCeltic art in the Middle Ages was practiced by the peoples of Ireland and parts of Britain in the 700-year period from the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of Romanesque art in the 12th century. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe.\n\nIn Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period. The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late Iron Age La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there. With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish contacts with the Anglo-Saxons, creating what is called the Insular or Hiberno-Saxon style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before Viking raids severely disrupted monastic life. Late in the period Scandinavian influences were added through the Vikings and mixed Norse-Gael populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the Norman invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style.\n\nThe interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were in fact introduced to Insular art from the Mediterranean, both directly and via the animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art, though they were taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.\nIn the 7th and 9th centuries Irish Celtic missionaries travelled to Northumbria in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of manuscript illumination, which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon metalworking knowledge and motifs. In the monasteries of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the Anglo-Saxon art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice. New techniques employed were filigree and chip carving, while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The Book of Durrow is the earliest complete insular script illuminated Gospel Book and by about 700, with the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed carpet pages that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the Book of Kells, the most elaborate Insular manuscript. Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic art for the rest of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn the 9th and 11th century plain silver became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver penannular brooches were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. Sculpture began to flourish in the form of the \"high cross\", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice and the Ahenny High Cross.\nThe impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the Scandinavian Ringerike and Urnes styles, for example the Cross of Cong and Shrine of Manchan. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of Dublin, but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at Kilfenora and crosses at the Rock of Cashel.\n\nSome Insular manuscripts may have been produced in Wales, including the 8th century Lichfield Gospels and Hereford Gospels. The late Insular Ricemarch Psalter from the 11th century was certainly written in Wales, and also shows strong Viking influence.\nArt from historic Dumnonia, modern Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Brittany on the Atlantic seaboard is now fairly sparsely attested and hence less well known as these areas later became incorporated into England (and France) in the medieval and Early Modern period. However archaeological studies at sites such as Cadbury Castle, Somerset, Tintagel, and more recently at Ipplepen indicate a highly sophisticated largely literate society with strong influence and connections with both the Byzantine Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic Irish, and British in Wales and the 'Old North'. Many crosses, memorials and tombstones such as King Doniert's Stone, the Drustanus stone and the notorious Artognou stone show evidence for a surprisingly cosmopolitan sub-Roman population speaking and writing in both Brittonic and Latin and with at least some knowledge of Ogham indicated by several extant stones in the region. Breton and especially Cornish manuscripts are exceedingly rare survivals but include the Bodmin manumissions demonstrating a regional form of the Insular style. \nFrom the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts. The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south. After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.\n\nThe heavy silver Whitecleuch Chain has Pictish symbols on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the Norrie's Law hoard. These are thought to be relatively early pieces. The St Ninian's Isle Treasure of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of Pictland and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD. \n\nPictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes. Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror). The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others. This is often taken to symbolise a woman. Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire).\nClass II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces. The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style. On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes. Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so. The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures. Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology. Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross).\n\nClass III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols. Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire). These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century. Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife).\n\nThe following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and Tankerness House Museum, Kirkwall, Orkney.\n\nThe revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in Celtic literature. By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries. Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades. The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as Louis Sullivan, and in stained glass and wall stenciling by Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy, both based in Chicago with its large Irish-American population. The \"plastic style\" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into Art Nouveau decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the Manxman Archibald Knox, who did much work for Liberty & Co.\n\nThe Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, Thomas Bodkin, writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, \"National art all over the world has burst long ago, the \nnarrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation.\" George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. \"Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.\n\nInterlace, which is still seen as a \"Celtic\" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-Dark Ages setting. \"The Secret of Kells\" is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.\n\nBy the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th-century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance. By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries. \n\nJune 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 22nd episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 19, 1998. The episode was written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, along with Nancy M. Pimental, and directed by Parker.\n\nIn the episode, the Sundance Film Festival is moved to South Park, but it badly affects Mr. Hankey. Meanwhile, Chef tries his luck to make some money, as many visitors come to the town, by selling his new sweet treats, his chocolate salty balls.\n\nPark City, Utah is in the midst of the Sundance Film Festival. Sundance's founder, Robert Redford, has decided that Park City has become too commercialized by the annual migration of the Hollywood jet set, so he decides to move the festival to South Park, Colorado. The Sundance Festival relocates to South Park, which is immediately deluged by Hollywood tourists. In school, Mr. Garrison gives the students an assignment to see one independent film during the festival and write a report on it. Chef sets up a sales stand at the festival for his fudge cookie recipes.\n\nAt night, as Kyle uses the restroom, he hears Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo calling to him from the toilet. Kyle persuades Stan, Cartman, and Kenny to help him find Mr. Hankey; they enter the sewer system to look for him. They soon find Mr. Hankey, who tells Kyle that the influx of all the Hollywood tourists, with their health-food diets, has disrupted the ecosystem of the sewer, which has made him deathly ill.\n\nKyle and the others appear before a film's showing, and Kyle pleads with the Hollywood visitors to understand that their presence is causing the death of his friend Mr. Hankey. However, they all think Kyle is trying to pitch a script, and they offer film deals. One agent approaches Cartman to buy the rights to Kyle's story; he readily agrees. A film is produced overnight, starring Tom Hanks as Kyle and a monkey as Mr. Hankey. The South Park locals are beginning to tire of the festival, seeing that it is causing the town to become overrun with commercialism and Hollywood kitsch. However, Redford plans to sue the whole the town if they go through with ending the festival; he then reveals to his wife, Phyllis, that he will make all small towns overrun with Hollywood culture, since he cannot escape it, so he wants to inflict it on everyone else. By this time, Cartman realizes he's been cheated out by the agent and only receives three dollars from the two million dollars the Mr. Hankey movie made and Stan promptly calls Cartman a sell-out; not to be outdone, Cartman then starts selling shirts of Tom Hanks with the monkey-version of Mr. Hankey.\n\nKyle tries to show Mr. Hankey to the crowd, but Mr. Hankey is pale and near death. Chef feeds Mr. Hankey one of his Chocolate Salty Balls, causing him to return to life. Stan, Kyle, Chef, and Mr. Hankey approach Redford as he is on a podium to announce the return of the film festival the next year. After he ignores their pleas to relocate the festival, Mr. Hankey makes a passionate speech about film festivals - instead of catering to the glamor of Hollywood, they should focus more on giving new-coming filmmakers a chance and actually enjoy the films. Infuriated, Redford throws Mr. Hankey against a wall, killing him; Chef revitalizes Mr. Hankey once again. He then causes the sewers to erupt over South Park, causing Redford and Phyllis' car to fill with feces, drowning them, and all the tourists flee the town. With the town saved (albeit covered in excrement), the boys reflect on Mr. Hankey's message and admit that while a few independent films are great, \"most of them suck ass.\" As for Cartman, he feels that being a sell-out was positive for him because he wouldn't hang out with \"poor-ass losers\" like his friends and leaves with the money he earned selling shirts.\n\nA soundtrack album, titled \"\", was released in 1998, during the broadcast run of the second season. It comprises songs featured in and related to the series, including \"Chocolate Salty Balls\", performed by Isaac Hayes as Chef, from this episode.\n\nCartman refers to independent films as being about \"gay cowboys eating pudding\". This episode aired seven years before the independent film \"Brokeback Mountain\" was released in 2005, but one year after the publication of the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx in 1997. In an interview with the Associated Press in October 2005, series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone responded to questions about the prophetic statement by Cartman. Parker quipped, \"...if there’s pudding eating in there, we’re going to sue\", and Stone claimed, \"No [we're not prophets], but Cartman is. [Laughs] We went to Sundance a lot in the mid-to-late ’90s, and you could just tell it was going toward gay cowboydom.\"\n\nAll 18 episodes of the second season, including \"Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls\", were released on a DVD box set on June 3, 2003.\n\n"}
{"id": "53127501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53127501", "title": "Christis Kirk on the Green", "text": "Christis Kirk on the Green\n\n\"Christis Kirk on the Green\" is an anonymous Middle Scots poem in 22 stanzas, now believed to have been written around the year 1500, giving a comic account of a brawl at a country fair. It was for many years mistakenly attributed either to James I of Scotland or to James V of Scotland. It gave rise to a whole tradition of humorous poems on similar subjects by Scottish poets down the centuries, including Allan Ramsay and Robert Burns, and is still one of the most frequently published works in Middle Scots. \"Christis Kirk on the Green\" has been called one of the finest performances in 15th-century British poetry.\n\nThe scene opens at Christ's Kirk where a dance is in full swing on the village green. While Tom Lutar plays the music and sings, the young women flirt with their suitors. Two of the men, Jock and Robin Ray, neither of whom has been having much luck with the girls, start to quarrel over one of them, and blows are struck. The fight begins to spread, and threatens to become serious as bows are produced and arrows shot, but the marksmanship of all the archers is so wild that no-one is hit. Then a general brawl develops as pitchforks, flails and laths of wood are seized, branches are torn off, and all these weapons are brought into play. The poet turns from one character to another, and details the blows delivered and the men struck to the ground. While the fight is still in progress the poem breaks off.\n\n\"Christis Kirk\" survives in at least seven manuscripts, including the Bannatyne Manuscript, the Maitland Folio, and one of the Laing manuscripts; of these the Maitland Folio gives the best text. It was printed first in 1643 in a recension similar to that given by the Laing MS, and later in 1660, 1663, 1684, 1691 (by Edmund Gibson), and in 1706 (by James Watson).\n\nThe poet was certainly familiar with a tradition of Scots burlesque poems that included \"Peblis to the Play\" and the now-lost \"Falkland on the Green\", and he wrote for a sophisticated audience, or at least for one above the peasant level. These are almost the only reliable clues to his identity. In 1568 George Bannatyne attributed the poem to James I of Scotland, but in the next century an alternative attribution to James V was made, and in the 18th and 19th centuries a war of words between literary historians failed to decide between these two candidates. At the beginning of the 19th century James Sibbald suggested Robert Henryson as a possible author, but this idea did not find favour. In 1964 Allan H. Maclaine argued for an early 15th-century date, without committing himself to James I as author, but in 1996 he acknowledged that linguistic evidence suggested a date of around 1500. This new date, which is now widely accepted, rules out both James I and James V, and leaves \"Christis Kirk\" as an anonymous poem.\n\nThe stanzas are each of ten lines rhyming ABABABABCD. The first eight lines alternate iambic tetrameter with trimeter, the ninth is a two-syllable \"bob\", and the final line forms the refrain \"At Christis Kirk on the green\". Much alliteration is used, which, together with the recurring rhymes, gives the verse a headlong pace, while the bob line is useful in accentuating the humour. The combined effect is to make the poem well-suited to recitation or singing.\n\nMost modern commentators accept the tradition, first reported in print by William Tytler in 1783, that the Christ's Kirk of the poem is a ruined church in the parish of Leslie, near the village of Insch in Aberdeenshire. According to Tytler a fair was held by this church every May Day until the end of the 17th century. In 1715 Allan Ramsay proposed a different Leslie in Fife as the site of the poem, and was seconded by John Callander in his 1782 edition of the poem. However this identification is probably based simply on a confusion of place-names, and it is no longer believed to have any good evidence in its favour. James Sibbald identified Christ's Kirk with the church of St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews, but, as with his authorship theory, this idea has found no supporters.\n\nCritics agree that the main virtues of the poem do not lie in subtlety of descriptive detail, nor in coherence of structure, but in a fast-paced excitement and wild comic verve that suggest comparison with Dutch peasant paintings. Vividly described scenes of grotesque and earthy incident (possibly too earthy for some modern tastes) follow one after the other in rapid succession. As the literary historian George Gregory Smith wrote, \"Everybody is at fever-heat: the louder the women's voices and the harder the blows, the better the fun.\" This forms a striking contrast with the aureate manner of the poet's contemporaries, the Scottish Chaucerians. The exigencies of rhyme-scheme and alliteration that the poet faces are very rigorous, but he meets them with such inventiveness and apparent ease that it has been called a \"tour de force\" of mastery of technique.\n\n\"Christis Kirk\" and a similar earlier poem, \"Peblis at the Play\", exercised a noticeable influence on the makar William Dunbar, some of whose poems use similar metrical and stylistic techniques to achieve a fast-moving effect. Similar traces of the two older poems can be seen in the anonymous 16th-century \"Rauf Coilyear\", \"The Cursing of Sir John Rowell\" and \"Symmie and his Bruder\". In 1718 the poet Allan Ramsay published \"Christis Kirk\" together with two additional cantos of his own composition. This work reached a 5th edition in only five years, and so popularized the poem that few others were reprinted so many times in the 18th century. A fourth canto followed in 1766, published in Alexander Nicol's \"Poems on Several Subjects\". One result of the poem's success was the emergence of a whole subgenre of comic poems set at fairs, country dances and similar merrymakings, and narrated by detached and amused observers, in which horseplay, practical jokes and drunkenness play a prominent part, and colourful scene-painting makes \nup for thin story-lines. Examples include Robert Fergusson's \"Leith Races\", James Orr's \"Donegore Hill\" and \"The Passengers\", Samuel Thomson's \"The Simmer Fair\" and \"The Hawk and the Weasel\" and Robert Burns's \"The Jolly Beggars\", \"The Ordination\" and \"The Holy Fair\".\n\n\n\n"}

The core activity of the community is conducting examinations of doctoral and habilitation (higher doctorate) theses defended in Russian scientific and educational institutions since the end of the 1990s, and making the results of such examinations known to as many people as possible. The community is composed of professional scientists working in various fields of science both in Russia and abroad, and also journalists, civil activists and volunteers.\n\nLaunched in early 2013, the project had by 2016 identified around 5,600 suspected plagiarists — focusing on officials in government and academia, and other member the country's elite — and released reports on around 1,300 of them. Russian media regularly report on Dissernet's findings, and the site has been credited with raising attention for the issue of academic fraud in the country. In a 2016 exposé, Dissernet showed that 1 in 9 members of the State Duma had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.\n\nThe objective of Dissernet’s examinations is to detect gross and deliberate violations of the legally established rules for certification of scientific workers’, as well as violations of the regulations for awarding academic degrees. Dissernet deems theses containing such violations to be fraudulent, and diplomas certifying the doctoral and higher doctoral degrees conferred after defending such theses to be illegal and subject to cancellation.\n\nThe key elements of the dissertation fraud detected in the course of Dissernet’s analyses are as follows:\n\n\nWithin the active phase of Dissernet’s activity, which started in January 2013, its members have published results of examinations of thesis defended by scores of well-known and powerful Russian politicians and public figures. As of the middle of the year 2014, more than 2000 completed expertises of Doctoral and higher doctoral theses in various directions and branches of science were contained in Dissernet database. Among the people attracting Dissernet’s attention were deputies of the State Duma, members of the Federation Council, governors of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, high-ranking officials of executive authorities, heads of security and military services, etc.\n\nThe work of the Dissernet community has gained much publicity and has been broadly covered in Russian and foreign mass media.\nThe result of the research performed by the Monitoring Center Public.Ru (more than 7500 federal and regional social and political and business printed matters, Internet mass media, news feeds of Press agencies, programs of central TV- and radio-channels have been analysed) showed that at 2013 year-end the word \"Dissernet\" was accepted as third by popularity neologism of the year, after the words \"Euromaidan\" and \"titushky\". Also the magazine \"Russian Reporter\" mentioned Dissernet’s work among the most notable milestones of the year 2013, and the Internet edition \"The Village\" published an article about Dissernet in the dictionary \"Summaries of 2013: main words and phrases of the outgoing year\".\n\nThe magazine \"Kommersant\", while listing in its concluding issue the major cultural and social events of the 2013, devoted a separate article to Dissernet’s struggle with falsifications and plagiarism.\n\nThe \"Dissernet Manifest\", which was developed and agreed upon in June–July 2013, contains the declaration of the organizers and members about the basic objectives, tasks and principles of joint activity of the community members:\n\n“Dissernet” is a networking community of experts, researchers and reporters seeking to unmask swindlers, forgers and liars. With their joint efforts based on the use of modern computer technologies and principles of networking division of labor, the community members oppose abusive practices, machinations and falsifications in the fields of scientific research and education, in particular in the process of defending theses and awarding academic degrees in Russia. The analytical work and disclosures of Dissernet equally cover various categories of Russian citizens:\n\n\nThe Dissernet members act on a voluntary basis, on their own initiative and without any outside pressure. The examinations, studies and publications of Dissernet are in strict compliance with the laws of the Russian Federation and do not violate any copyright or other rights. Dissernet is under no obligations to any state authorities, governmental\nor administrative institutions, political associations or movements, commercial corporations or entities. Its members work in the community irrespective of their political, corporate or any other views, they do not pursue any commercial purposes, their efforts are not aimed at advertising or promotion of any product or trademark, and they do not set any other goals except the above-mentioned ones. Dissernet’s expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its tasks are covered by means of voluntary donations by people sympathizing with its mission and sharing its views.\n\nThe community was established in January 2013. The full Dissernet site, dissernet.org, as well as its reduced version, dissernet.ru, were opened on 23 September 2013.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, Sergey Parkhomenko received the \"Golden Pen of Russia\" award from the Russian Union of Journalists for the year 2013, recognizing his \"Dissernet\" activity in press and in Internet.\n\nOn 24 April 2014, the jury of the PolitProsvet Award 2014 conferred the Dissernet project with two awards, \"For Honor and Dignity\", and \"People's Vote\".\n\nA number of prominent doctoral theses examinations published by the Dissernet community which dealt with well-known and powerful figures on the Russian political and scientific scene:\n\n\n\nAmong examinations performed by Dissernet, there is a number of monographs.

{"id": "161228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161228", "title": "Document", "text": "Document\n\nA document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought. The word originates from the Latin \"documentum\", which denotes a \"teaching\" or \"lesson\": the verb \"doceō\" denotes \"to teach\". In the past, the word was usually used to denote a written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the computer age, \"document\" usually denotes a primarily textual computer file, including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images. Contemporarily, \"document\" is not defined by its transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. \"Documentation\" is distinct because it has more denotations than \"document\". Documents are also distinguished from \"realia\", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of \"document\" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. While documents are able to have large varieties of customization, all documents are able to be shared freely, and have the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. History, events, examples, opinion, etc. all can be expressed in documents. \n\nThe concept of \"document\" has been defined by Suzanne Briet as \"any concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental.\"\n\nAn often cited article concludes that \"the evolving notion of \"document\"\" among Jonathan Priest, Otlet, Briet, Schürmeyer, and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. Levy's thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it.\n\n\"Document\" is defined in library and information science and documentation science as a fundamental, abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence. The classic example provided by Suzanne Briet is an antelope: \"An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document[;] she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.\" This opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of actor–network theory.\n\nDocuments are sometimes classified as secret, private, or public. They may also be described as drafts or proofs. When a document is copied, the source is denominated the \"original\".\n\nStandards are accepted for specific applications in various fields, e.g.:\n\nSuch standard documents can be drafted based on a template.\n\nThe page layout of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document, e.g., on a page. If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the responsibility of a graphic designer. Typography concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document (see typesetting). Information design concerns the effective communication of information, especially in industrial documents and public signs. Simple textual documents may not require visual design and may be drafted only by an author, clerk, or transcriber.

Feminist blogs serve the purpose of spreading ideas, sparking debates, raising awareness, discussing opinions, sharing stories, and virtually spreading the notion of feminism throughout the Internet.\n\nFeministing consciously includes differing types of blogs, news sources, and organizations providing the site’s commitment to diversity in all aspects.\n\nThese blogs have also empowered women in the media field, which still remains largely male dominated.\n\nWith feminist blogging, women can have a voice to speak up about their opinions and beliefs. This also allows them to openly discuss about their situation with confidence and can help avoid being seen as silent or submissive. By blogging, it is seen as an effective method in getting the involvement of others or getting the attention of politically active people. With women discussing about events confidently, it allows a community of like minded individuals to understand what is occurring around the world and how they can get involved with different issues. With blogging, there is empowerment to make a difference within governments and international communities by getting involved through blogging. Feminist blogging is seen as a public activity that allows anyone to see a situation from a different viewpoint. Unlike traditional forms of media that discusses situations through a specific view that may appear to be male influence or avoids discussing about it, the information through feminist blogs is seen as transparent rather than edited for appeal.\n\nWith feminist blogging, there is an increase in activism. While many critics argue that nothing gets accomplished, feminist blogging encourages activism. Women use blogging as a method to get information and understanding of concepts or issues. Feminist blogging allows an individual who is in a community that does not understand or have much knowledge of the issues that many women go through. So, it allows individuals to get the information that many news resources may not cover and allows individuals to see through a difference perspective gaze. The gaze is not through a Western perspective, but rather a perspective of women living in that country with different cultural beliefs than Western societies. With women blogging about their opinions and hardships they endure, their personal problems become political and international as well.\n\nFeminist blogging can be seen as an essential method in the democratization of women through online activism. \n\nFeminist blogging allows individuals to understand that activism in the modern era has changed. It allows individuals to incorporate social issues, such as feminism, into political activism and, allows for people to discover different forms of feminist theories.\n\nThere are many different types of feminist blogs on the Internet. Some of the most common types of feminist blogs include: Personal, Topical, Collaborative, Political, Corporate, and Advice.\n\nThrough Feministing, feminism ideologies of the third-wave era conjoins with political activism to substantially reshape the way in which we look at political discourse. conventional political discourse. Feministing aims at creating awareness and serving as a platform open for blogger commentary on an array of political issues.\n\nDifferent feminist blogs have different rules for participating in the discussion boards and comment boxes. Feminist blogs aim to keep a neutral yet expressive atmosphere in the blog realm since many discussed issues can be very controversial.\n\nSince blogging is part of the World Wide Web, the atmosphere is not always positive. People of any standpoint can express their opinions and voice their thoughts on specific topics. Blogging can be dangerous in terms of discussing some controversial feminist issues such as abortion etc. because the environment is open to anyone, it can become very opinionated and discriminatory.\n"}

The fountain itself was built under Pope Gregory XIII, best known for creating the Gregorian calendar. Like the other Roman fountains of its time, it was built to provide clean drinking water to the Roman residents, who before then had to drink the polluted water of the Tiber River. Also like the other fountains of its time, it operated purely by gravity; the source of the water was higher the fountain itself, causing the water to spout into the air. \n\nThe water for the fountain first arrived at the old Trevi Fountain, then went two reservoirs at the foot of the butte of San Sebastiancello, then through a series of the channels to the corner of via Condotti and the via del Corso, to Piazza Venezia, to the foot of the column of Marcus Aurelius. The source of the water for the fountain of Piazza Colonna was only 67 feet above sea level; like the Trevi Fountain, the Fontana della Barcaccia, and the fountains of Piazza Navona, all connected to the Acqua Vergine, the fountain of Piazza Colonna was unable to jet water high into the air.\n\nThe original project of Della Porta was to place an antique Roman statue of a sea god, called Marforio, in the fountain, against a background of a rocky grotto, behind which the column of Marcus Aurelius would be seen. The final fountain was simpler: the octagonal basin of the fountain was made of pink marble from the island of Chios in Greece, the same marble that Della Porta used for frame of the doorway of St. Peter's Basilica. Della Porta also designed the sixteen carved lion heads around the basin. A circular stone vasque was placed on a pedestal in the center, and water poured from this vasque into the basin. \n\nThe fountain was slightly restored by Bernini during the pontificate of Pope Alexander VII. In 1702 Pope Clement XI placed his own coat of arms, a star with eight points, on top of the original vasque in the center, but this was removed after his death. \n\nIn 1830 the architect Alessandro Stocchi removed the original central vasque and replaced it with the current vasque, made of white marble. He also added two groups of sculptures of dolphins, their tails wrapped around seashells, spouting water from their mouths, at either end of the basin.\n\n\n\n"}

The firm maintains more than 1,700 professional staff across a global network of 24 offices and is active in all major architectural specialties. Its senior leaders are located in several different locations across the world.\n\nHOK was established in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1955. The firm's name is derived from the surnames of its three founding partners: George Hellmuth, Gyo Obata and George Kassabaum, all graduates of the School of Architecture at Washington University in St. Louis. The design firm started with 26 employees and its three founders.\n\nThe practice's first building designs were schools in St. Louis suburbs, and St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Florissant was the first private/parochial school designed by the firm. Another prominent school they designed was the Saint Louis Priory School. By the mid-1960s, the firm was winning commissions across the United States and began to open additional offices, starting with San Francisco in 1966 for the design of a library at Stanford University and Dallas in 1968 for the master planning and design of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Also in 1968, HOK launched its interior design practice. HOK also expanded into Washington, DC, after winning the commission to design the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. In 1973, HOK established a presence in New York by acquiring Kahn & Jacobs, designers of many New York City skyscrapers. By the 1970s, the firm was operating internationally and in 1975 the firm was named as architect of the $3.5 billion King Saud University in Riyadh, at the time the single largest building project in the world. In 1979, George Kassabaum was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.\n\nIn 1983, HOK formed HOK Sport Venue Event, which became a leader in designing sport stadiums, arenas and convention centers.

{"id": "44942354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44942354", "title": "L'Apparition", "text": "L'Apparition\n\n\"The Apparition\" (French: L'Apparition) is a painting by French artist Gustave Moreau, painted between 1874 and 1876. It shows the biblical character of Salome dancing in front of Herod Antipas with a vision of John the Baptist's head. The 106 cm high and 72,2 cm wide watercolor held by the Paris Musee d'Orsay elaborates an episode told in the Gospel of Matthew 14:6-11 and Mark 6:21-29. On a feast on the occasion of Herod Antipas' birthday, the princess Salome dances in front of the king and his guest, pleasing him so much he promises her anything she wished for. Incited by her mother Herodias, who was reproved by the imprisoned John the Baptist for her illegitimate marriage to Herod, Salome demands John's head in a charger. Regretful but compelled to keep his word in front of his peers, Herod fulfills Salome's demand. John the Baptist is beheaded, the head brought in a charger and given to Salome, who gives it to her mother.\n\nMoreau approached the biblical theme in 19 paintings, 6 watercolors and more than 150 drawings. Part of a series of at least 8 closely resembling paintings and more than 40 sketch drawings, it is regarded a key work of Moreau's opus, symbolism and \"fin de siècle\" art in general. Upon its first presentation 1876 in Salon (French: Salon de Paris), the painting caused a sensation. It has since made a lasting impression on various artists, notably from the Decadent movement.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a lavishly decorated palace inspired by the Alhambra Salome stands out in an array of bejeweled veils, her body facing the viewer, her left arm pointing up in the air to John the Baptist's hovering head, enclosed by a halo. At the back in the half-light stands the executioner with his sword, at his feet the silver charger. Seated in ascending position on Salome's side are a lutanist, Herodias and Herod Antipas. They face the foreground events seemingly lit by John's halo and its reflections on Salome's costume. The severed head recalls a Japanese print copied by Moreau at the Palais de l'Industrie in 1869 as well as the severed head of Medusa as held by Benvenuto Cellini's bronze \"Perseus with the head of Medusa\" in Florence (Loggia dei Lanzi). Since no one, including Salome, reacts directly to the vision central to the composition, it is unclear if it is real, imagined by the princess or a collective hallucination. This deliberately confusing technique has been attributed to an alleged consumption of opium and thereby caused hallucinations, though justification of such claims was never established. Its surreal setting and mystic air, evoked by obscure architectural and textile opulence, contrast with previous interpretations of the subject, making \"The Apparition\" a key work for the emerging symbolist movement.\n\nBelgian art dealer Léon Gauchez bought \"The Appariton\" in 1876 upon its first presentation at the Salon where it was exhibited with several other of Moreau's works\". \"The following year Gauchez sent it to be exhibited at London's Grosvenor Gallery where it hung not with the aquarelles in a separate room but in the main East Gallery with the oil paintings. Currently it is located in the Musée d'Orsay.\n\n\"The dreadful head grows eerily, bleeding all the while, so that clots of dark red form at the ends of hair and beard.\" (Joris-Karl Huysmans, A Rebours, Chap. VI. 1884)\n\n\"The Apparition\" stands apart from biblical and historic paintings of the period, incorporating elements of style which would become significant for the aesthetic and symbolist movement, while also anteceding surrealism. Whereas the bible mentions Salome as acting out Herodias' will, Moreau draws her guided by her own lust. Among his series of Salome-paintings, the climactic \"The Apparition\" is the most openly erotic with a bare-breasted princess turned towards the viewer, her naked arm directed at the object she will soon receive. By accentuating her stillness, Moreau immobilizes her to be seen alternately as idol or sexual object or both. Some critics also ascribed her statuesque posture to fear, like French writer Joris-Karl Huysmans who muses on the painting in his influential decadent novel \"A rebours\".\n\nMoreau himself described Salome as \"bored and fantastic woman, animal by nature and so disgusted with the complete satisfaction of her desires (that she) gives herself the sad pleasure of seeing her enemy degraded.\" His sensual presentation of Salome and innovative interpretation of traditional historic and mythological themes caused his art to be regarded as eccentric and provocative. Emphasizing instincts over reason, subjectivity over objectivity and suggestion over definition, the watercolor features essential qualities of symbolism as coined by French poet and critic Jean Moréas. Further, the scene's morbidity and underlying themes of necrophilia, incest and sadism associate it with the decadent movement and Fin de siecle art. These disparate elements and the use of complex techniques like highlighting, graftage and incisions, create a sublime ideal of the orient. Excessive detail given to foreign costumes and background elements as strange mural reliefs on the pallast's columns proof characteristic for Moreau who's artistic style tending towards exoticism and orientalism was often referred to as \"Byzanthine\". Together with the mysterious titular vision they both evoke fantastic art and indicate his evolution towards fauvism and abstract painting.\n\nRather than being solely a character from academic painting Moreau remained bound to despite his avant-garde-tendencies, his Salome embodies the femme fatale from Victorian imagination who was equally seductive and destructive. Defying conventions of historic and biblic painting, \"The Apparition\" became a source for surrealism as did others of Moreau's works.\n\nThe events from which Moreau draws his scene are first described in two parallel passages of the New Testament.\n\n\"...And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom. And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.\" (Mark 6:21-29, KJV)\n\nA shorter version appears in the Gospel of St. Matthew:\n\n\"But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them: and pleased Herod. Whereupon he promised with an oath, to give her whatsoever she would ask of him. But she being instructed before by her mother, said: Give me here in a dish the head of John the Baptist. And the king was struck sad: yet because of his oath, and for them that sat with him at table, he commanded it to be given. And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. And his head was brought in a dish: and it was given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.\" (Matt 14:6-11, D-R)\n\nThe unnamed dancer identified as Salome by scholars has inspired numerous artist before Moreau, among them Masolino da Panicale, Filippo Lippi, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Titian, Caravaggio, Guido Reni, Fabritius, Henri Regnault and Georges Rochegrosse. Though classic academic subjects from religion and history were superseded by everyday scenes during the 19th century, Salome remained a figure of artistic interest, appearing in Heinrich Heine's 1843 epic poem \"Atta Troll\", \"The Beheading of John the Baptist \"by\" \"Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Jean-Baptiste Regnault's \"eponymous oil painting \"and Arthur O'Shaughnessy's 1870 poem \"The Daughter of Herodias. \"In his 1875 poem \"Salomé\", Henri Cazaliz's paid homage to Moreau's earlier Salome-paintings, musing on Salome’s feelings before and after the execution. Still, it were Moreau's \"The Apparition\" and its sister piece, an oil version also called \"The Apparition \"(1875) which sparked a Salome craze lasting into the 20th century, permeating all forms of art.\n\n\"The Apparition\" quickly became Moreau's best known work, its notoriety growing with the critical and artistic attention it received. Numerous artist drew inspiration from Moreau's Salome, her mimesis infusing their works or insinuating itself in it. French poet Stephane Mallarme's envisions Salome in his \"Herodiade\" (1864 -1896) as the virgin-whore seen by many of Moreau's contemporaries\n\n\"The horror of my virginity <br>Delights me, and I would envelope me<br>In the terror of my tresses, that, by night,<br>Inviolate reptile, I might feel the white <br>And glimmering radiance of thy frozen fire,<br>Thou art chaste and diest of desire,<br>White night of ice and of the cruel snow!\"\n\nAs André Fontainas noted 1928 in \"Mes souvenirs du Symbolisme\", many artists since responded to it. Prominent works influenced by the painting include:\nWhen the renown of its creator faded, \"The Apparition\" contained its prominent place in artistic imagination, its lasting impressiveness being crucial to the rediscovery of Moreau's art in the later 20th century.\n"}

Sources may also identify her by the pseudonym, Mathilde Leusch.\n\nMathilde Danegger was born and attended school in Vienna. Her father was the Austrian character actor and stage producer (real name, Joseph Deutsch: 1865–1933) who later took over as director of the City Theatre in Zürich. Her mother, Bertha Müller, was also a stage actress.\n\nLike her elder brothers and Theodor Danegger, she decided on a stage career early in life. She started her performing with children's roles, making her debut in 1912 at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater in Berlin, with a further youthful appearance there in 1914. She would continue to return to the Berlin stage throughout her career, but by 1919 she was, with her parents, based in Zürich. In 1919/1920 she had engagements at the City Theatre in Vienna. From 1921 till 1924 she was working, primarily, at the Popular Theatre in Vienna, and between 1924 and 1928 at the Theater in der Josefstadt.\n\nMathilde Danegger's first marriage was to Herbert Waniek (1897 – 1949) whose theatre career during the 1920s was focused on the same Vienna theatres as those of his wife. Waniek also had connections with the \"German Theatre\" at Brno in Czechoslovakia, where until 1933 Mathilde Danegger was making regular guest appearances. There were also frequent guest appearances at theatres in Berlin and Vienna. Around this time she also married her second husband, the Swiss drama producer Walter Lesch (1898 – 1958).\n\nWith the German change in government at the start of 1933, Mathilde Danegger, a staunch antifascist, fled to Switzerland where she worked at the National Theatre in Zürich with Wolfgang Langhoff, like her a political exile from Nazi Germany. She took part in political cabaret, between 1934 and 1938 appearing in the \"Cornichon\" cabaret established by her husband. In 1939 she got together with who subsequently became her third husband. She was also one of the founders in Switzerland of the National Committee for a Free Germany.\n\nTwo years after the war ended, in 1947, Mathilde Danegger returned to Germany. Sources differ as to whether she settled in the American occupation zone or in East Berlin, which was in the central part of what had been Germany, and was now administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone. In reality, it was several years before the political division of occupied Germany would be matched by physical barriers. Between 1947 and 1951 she was working at the Hessische National Theatre in Wiesbaden. In East Berlin, supported by the dramatist's wife and business manager, Helene Weigel Danegger was recruited by Bertolt Brecht to work at the Berliner Ensemble where she was employed between 1951 and 1953. During these years she was active in the peace movement. In December 1948 she joined the German Communist Party. Between 1948 and 1951 she also wrote, as Cultural Editor, for \"Unsere Stimme\", a regional communist news magazine based near the frontier with Switzerland, at Schwenningen.\n\nIn 1953, four years after the foundation of two separate German states, and with the border between them becoming less permeable, she formally relocated with to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). There followed a long period as a star of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin. Among others, she took part in productions by Wolfgang Langhoff, Wolfgang Heinz, Benno Besson and .\n\nIn parallel with her theatre work, from 1960 she built up an extensive repertoire of cinema and television roles in productions by the state-owned film studio, DEFA, and Deutscher Fernsehfunk, the state television broadcaster. She had already undertaken a significant amount of acting work in front of the camera during her time in Switzerland. Of particular note was her portrayal of Frau Holle in the 1963 by Gottfried Kolditz and her television role in \"Mutter Jantschowa\" (1968).\n\nShe remained politically engaged throughout. In 1957 she wrote a letter to the party defending dissident Wolfgang Harich following his arrest.\n\nBy her second husband she was the mother of the actress Karin Lesch.\n\nHer third husband, the university lecturer and author , became caught up in the political persecution that was a feature of East Germany in the 1950s. In 1956 he was overheard criticising the arrest of in the aftermath of the remarkable the party conference of the Soviet Communist Party, and in March 1958 Crüger was himself arrested by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). At a secret trial in December 1958 he was found guilty of \"high treason\" (\"schweren Staatsverrats\") and sentenced to an eight-year jail term. In the end he was released in 1961 and rehabilitated by the High Court in May 1990.\n\nCinema films\n\nTelevision films\n\nDocumentary films (Narrator)\n\n"}
{"id": "357674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357674", "title": "Melusine", "text": "Melusine\n\nMelusine () or Melusina is a figure of European folklore and mythology (mostly Celtic), a female spirit of fresh water in a sacred spring or river. She is usually depicted as a woman who is a serpent or fish from the waist down (much like a mermaid). She is also sometimes illustrated with wings, two tails, or both. Her legends are especially connected with the northern and western areas of France, Luxembourg, and the Low Countries. The House of Luxembourg (which ruled the Holy Roman Empire from AD 1308 to AD 1437 as well as Bohemia and Hungary), the Counts of Anjou and their descendants the House of Plantagenet (kings of England) and the French House of Lusignan (kings of Cyprus from AD 1205–1472, and for shorter periods over Armenia and Jerusalem) are said in folk tales and medieval literature to be descended from Melusine. \n\nOne tale says Melusine herself was the daughter of the fairy Pressyne and king Elinas of Albany (now known as Scotland). Melusine's mother leaves her husband, taking her daughters to the isle of Avalon after he breaks an oath never to look in at her and her daughter in their bath. The same pattern appears in stories where Melusine marries a nobleman only after he makes an oath to give her privacy in her bath; each time, she leaves the nobleman after he breaks that oath. Shapeshifting and flight on wings away from oath-breaking husbands also figure in stories about Melusine. According to Sabine Baring-Gould in \"Curious Tales of the Middle Ages\", the pattern of the tale is similar to the Knight of the Swan legend which inspired the character \"Lohengrin\" in Wolfram von Eschenbach's \"Parzival\". \n\nThe most famous literary version of Melusine tales, that of Jean d'Arras, compiled about 1382–1394, was worked into a collection of \"spinning yarns\" as told by ladies at their spinning coudrette (). He wrote \"The Romans of Partenay or of Lusignen: Otherwise known as the Tale of Melusine,\" giving source and historical notes, dates and background of the story. He goes into detail and depth about the relationship of Melusine and Raymondin, their initial meeting and the complete story.\n\nThe tale was translated into German in 1456 by Thüring von Ringoltingen, which version became popular as a chapbook. It was later translated into English c. 1500, and often printed in both the 15th century and the 16th century. A prose version is entitled the \"Chronique de la princesse\" (\"Chronicle of the Princess\").\n\nIt tells how in the time of the Crusades, Elynas, the King of Albany (an old name for Scotland or Alba), went hunting one day and came across a beautiful lady in the forest. She was Pressyne, mother of Melusine. He persuaded her to marry him but she agreed, only on the promise—for there is often a hard and fatal condition attached to any pairing of fay and mortal—that he must not enter her chamber when she birthed or bathed her children. She gave birth to triplets. When he violated this taboo, Pressyne left the kingdom, together with her three daughters, and traveled to the lost Isle of Avalon.\n\nThe three girls—Melusine, Melior, and Palatyne—grew up in Avalon. On their fifteenth birthday, Melusine, the eldest, asked why they had been taken to Avalon. Upon hearing of their father's broken promise, Melusine sought revenge. She and her sisters captured Elynas and locked him, with his riches, in a mountain. Pressyne became enraged when she learned what the girls had done, and punished them for their disrespect to their father. Melusine was condemned to take the form of a serpent from the waist down every Saturday. In other stories, she takes on the form of a mermaid.\n\nRaymond of Poitou came across Melusine in a forest of Coulombiers in Poitou in France, and proposed marriage. Just as her mother had done, she laid a condition: that he must never enter her chamber on a Saturday. He broke the promise and saw her in the form of a part-woman, part-serpent, but she forgave him. When, during a disagreement, he called her a \"serpent\" in front of his court, she assumed the form of a dragon, provided him with two magic rings, and flew off, never to return.\n\nIn \"The Wandering Unicorn\" by Manuel Mujica Láinez, Melusine tells her tale of several centuries of existence, from her original curse to the time of the Crusades.\n\nMelusine legends are especially connected with the northern areas of France, Poitou and the Low Countries, as well as Cyprus, where the French Lusignan royal house that ruled the island from 1192 to 1489 claimed to be descended from Melusine. Oblique reference to this was made by Sir Walter Scott who told a Melusine tale in \"The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border\" (1802–1803) stating that\n\nThe Luxembourg family also claimed descent from Melusine through their ancestor Siegfried.\nWhen in 963 A.D. Count Siegfried of the Ardennes (\"Sigefroi\" in French; \"Sigfrid\" in Luxembourgish) bought the feudal rights to the territory on which he founded his capital city of Luxembourg, his name became connected with the local version of Melusine. This Melusina had essentially the same magic gifts as the ancestress of the Lusignans, magically making the Castle of Luxembourg on the Bock rock (the historical center point of Luxembourg City) appear the morning after their wedding. On her terms of marriage, she too required one day of absolute privacy each week. Alas, Sigfrid, as the Luxem-bourgish call him, \"could not resist temptation, and on one of the forbidden days he spied on her in her bath and discovered her to be a mermaid. When he let out a surprised cry, Melusina caught sight of him, and her bath immediately sank into the solid rock, carrying her with it. Melusina surfaces briefly every seven years as a beautiful woman or as a serpent, holding a small golden key in her mouth. Whoever takes the key from her will set her free and may claim her as his bride.\" In 1997 Luxembourg issued a postage stamp commemorating her.\n\nMartin Luther knew and believed in the story of another version of Melusine, \"die Melusina zu Lucelberg\" (Lucelberg in Silesia), whom he referred to several times as a succubus (\"Works,\" Erlangen edition, volume 60, pp 37–42). Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote the tale of \"Die Neue Melusine\" in 1807 and published it as part of \"Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre.\" The playwright Franz Grillparzer brought Goethe's tale to the stage and Felix Mendelssohn provided a concert overture \"The Fair Melusina,\" his Opus 32.\n\nMelusine is one of the pre-Christian water-faeries who were sometimes responsible for changelings. The \"Lady of the Lake\", who spirited away the infant Lancelot and raised the child, was such a water nymph. Other European water sprites include Lorelei and the nixie.\n\n\"Melusina\" would seem to be an uneasy name for a girl-child in these areas of Europe, but Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster, mistress of George I of Great Britain, was christened Melusine in 1667.\n\nThe chronicler Gerald of Wales reported that Richard I of England was fond of telling a tale according to which he was a descendant of a countess of Anjou who was in fact the fairy Melusine, concluding that his whole family \"came from the devil and would return to the devil\". The Angevin legend told of an early Count of Anjou who met a beautiful woman when in a far land, where he married her. He had not troubled to find out about her origins. However, after bearing him four sons, the behaviour of his wife began to trouble the count. She attended church infrequently, and always left before the Mass proper. One day he had four of his men forcibly restrain his wife as she rose to leave the church. Melusine evaded the men and clasped the two youngest of her sons and in full view of the congregation carried them up into the air and out of the church through its highest window. Melusine and her two sons were never seen again. One of the remaining sons was the ancestor, it was claimed, of the later Counts of Anjou and the Kings of England.\n\n\"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\" recounts a legend about Hippocrates' daughter. She was transformed into a hundred-foot long dragon by the goddess Diane, and is the \"lady of the manor\" of an old castle. She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands. Various knights try, but flee when they see the hideous dragon; they die soon thereafter. This appears to be an early version of the legend of Melusine.\n\nJacques Le Goff considered that Melusina represented a fertility figure: \"she brings prosperity in a rural area...Melusina is the fairy of medieval economic growth\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It opened on 12 March 1903 as the New Theatre and was built by Sir Charles Wyndham behind Wyndham's Theatre which was completed in 1899. The building was designed by architect W. G. R. Sprague with an exterior in the classical style and an interior in the Rococo style.\n\nIn 1973 it was renamed the Albery Theatre in tribute to Sir Bronson Albery who had presided as its manager for many years. Since September 2005, the theatre has been owned by Delfont-Mackintosh Ltd. It underwent major refurbishment in 2006, and was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre when it re-opened for the London premiere of \"Avenue Q\" on 1 June 2006. Noël Coward, one of Britain's greatest playwrights and actors, appeared in his own play, \"I'll Leave It To You\", at the then New Theatre in 1920, the first West End production of one of his plays.\n\nThe theatre seats 872 patrons on four levels. The building is now a Grade II Listed structure.\nAfter opening in 1903 with a production of \"Rosemary\" starring Charles Wyndham and his wife, Mary Moore (3 July 1861 – 6 April 1931), the Noël Coward Theatre has hosted a number productions. \"I'll Leave it to You\", in 1920, was Coward's first play. George Bernard Shaw's \"St. Joan\" with an acclaimed performance by actress Sybil Thorndike ran in 1924. \nThe 1930s saw the greatest commercial success of John Gielgud's career, \"Richard of Bordeaux\" (1933). Gielgud followed up this triumph with a legendary production of \"Hamlet\" in which he both played the title role and directed a company that included Jessica Tandy, Jack Hawkins and a young Alec Guinness in one of his first professional roles as Osric. Gielgud also appeared with Laurence Olivier, Peggy Ashcroft and Edith Evans in \"Romeo and Juliet\". With the Blitz came the destruction of the theatres that were home to the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells Theatre Companies. Both companies made the New Theatre home until their respective theatres were rebuilt in the 1950s. One of the most successful shows to play the New Theatre opened 30 June 1960. It was Lionel Bart's \"Oliver!\", which ran for 2,618 performances.\n\nA 1970 Royal Shakespeare Company production of Dion Boucicault's \"London Assurance\", directed by Ronald Eyre, with Donald Sinden as Sir Harcourt Courtly, (for which he received the 1975 Drama Desk Special Award) Roger Rees as Charles, Judi Dench as Grace and Dinsdale Landen as Dazzle, transferred to the New Theatre in 1972 for a year, prior to its 1974 run in New York.\n\nIn 1981, \"Children of a Lesser God\" won Olivier Awards for Best New Play and for actors Trevor Eve and Elizabeth Quinn. Among some of the 1980s productions is the 1994 revival of Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\" starring Helen Mirren and John Hurt.\n\nIn the 2000s the theatre has played host to several Shakespeare productions including a production of \"Twelfth Night\" set in India with an entirely Asian cast. The production played to packed houses and only closed as the Royal Shakespeare Company themselves had exclusive rights to perform their annual London season of Tragedies there. Between December 2004 and April 2005, they presented \"Hamlet\", \"Romeo & Juliet\", \"Macbeth\", \"King Lear\" and a brand new production of Euripides' \"Hecuba\" starring Vanessa Redgrave.\n\nOn 8 June 2005, Dion Boucicault's Victorian melodrama \"The Shaughraun\" opened; however, its success at the Dublin Gate Theatre was not repeated in London and it closed on 30 July. A dark period of around three months followed before the theatre was transferred to the ownership of Delfont Mackintosh Limited and reopened in October 2005 with The Right Size's new production \"Ducktastic!\". Once again this failed to live up to expectations and closed just three weeks after opening on 19 November 2005. A short Christmas season of Patrick Stewart's one-man version of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" played from 6 to 31 December 2005, before the theatre hosted the Edinburgh International Festival hit drama \"Blackbird\" starring Roger Allam. The award-winning play Enron (directed by Rupert Goold, starring Samuel West and Tim Pigott-Smith) transferred here after a sellout run at the Royal Court. The European premiere of the Broadway hit, \"Avenue Q\", started previewing on 2 June 2006 and had its opening night on 28 June 2006, finally closing on 28 March 2009 prior to transferring to the Gielgud Theatre.\n\nFollowing a production of \"Deathtrap\", directed by Matthew Warchus and starring Simon Russell Beale and Jonathan Groff, the theatre became the home of jukebox musical \"Million Dollar Quartet\" in February 2011.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The combination of high initial cost and lower maintenance cost pushed producers into building these techniques into the basic concept of a series, influencing all the artistic choices.\n\nBy the late 1990s, improved technology and more training and cross-training within the industry made all of these techniques easier to use, so that directors of individual episodes could make decisions to use one or more methods, so such artistic choices no longer needed to be baked into the series concept.\n\nSpecial effects (or \"SPFX\") have been an essential tool throughout the history of science fiction on television: small explosives to simulate the effects of various rayguns, squibs of blood and gruesome prosthetics to simulate the monsters and victims in horror series, and the wire-flying entrances and exits of George Reeves as Superman.\n\nThe broad term \"special effects\" includes all the techniques here, but more commonly there are two categories of effects. Visual effects (\"VFX\") involve photographic or digital manipulation of the onscreen image, usually done in post-production. Mechanical or physical effects involve props, pyrotechnics, and other physical methods used during principal photography itself. Some effects involved a combination of techniques; a ray gun might require a pyrotechnic during filming, and then an optical glowing line added to the film image in post-production. Stunts are another important category of physical effects. In general, all kinds of special effects must be carefully planned during pre-production.\n\n\"Babylon 5\" was the first series to use computer-generated imagery, or \"CGI\", for all exterior space scenes, even those with characters in space suits. The technology has made this more practical, so that today models are rarely used. In the 1990s, CGI required expensive processors and customized applications, but by the 2000s (decade), computing power has pushed capabilities down to personal laptops running a wide array of software.\n\nModels have been an essential tool in science fiction television since the beginning, when Buck Rogers took flight in spark-scattering spaceships wheeling across a matte backdrop sky. The original \"\" required a staggering array of models; the USS \"Enterprise\" had to be built in several different scales for different needs. Models fell out of use in filming in the 1990s as CGI became more affordable and practical, but even today, designers sometimes construct scale models which are then digitized for use in animation software.\n\nModels of characters are puppets. Gerry Anderson created a series of shows using puppets living in a universe of models and miniature sets, notably \"Thunderbirds\". \"ALF\" depicted an alien living in a family, while \"Farscape\" included two puppets as regular characters. In \"Stargate SG-1\", the Asgard characters are puppets in scenes where they are sitting, standing, or lying down. In \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", the characters of Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, two of the show's main (and most iconic) characters, are puppets constructed from random household items.\n\nAs animation is completely free of the constraints of gravity, momentum, and physical reality, it is an ideal technique for science fiction and fantasy on television. In a sense, virtually all animated series allow characters and objects to perform in unrealistic ways, so they are almost all considered to fit within the broadest category of speculative fiction (in the context of awards, criticism, marketing, etc.) The artistic affinity of animation to comic books has led to a large amount of superhero-themed animation, much of this adapted from comics series, while the impossible characters and settings allowed in animation made this a preferred medium for both fantasy and for series aimed at young audiences.\n\nOriginally, animation was all hand-drawn by artists, though in the 1980s, beginning with \"Captain Power\", computers began to automate the task of creating repeated images; by the 1990s, hand-drawn animation became defunct.\n\nIn recent years as technology has improved, this has become more common, notably since the development of the Massive software application permits producers to include hordes of non-human characters to storm a city or space station. The robotic Cylons in the new version of \"Battlestar Galactica\" are usually animated characters, while the Asgard in \"Stargate SG-1\" are animated when they are shown walking around or more than one is on screen at once.\n\nIn general, science fiction series are subject to the same financial constraints as other television shows. However, high production costs increase the financial risk, while limited audiences further complicate the business case for continuing production. \"\" was the first television series to cost more than $100,000 per episode, while \"\" was the first to cost more than $1 million per episode.\n\nThe innovative nature of science fiction means that new shows cannot rely on predictable market-tested formulas like legal dramas or sitcoms; the involvement of creative talent outside the Hollywood mainstream introduces more variables to the budget forecasts.\n\nIn the past, science fiction television shows have maintained a family friendly format that rendered them suitable for all ages, especially children, as the majority of them were of the action-adventure format. This enabled merchandising such as toy lines, animated cartoon adaptations, and other licensing. However, many modern shows include a significant amount of adult themes (such as sexual situations, nudity, profanity and graphic violence) rendering them unsuitable for young audiences, and severely limiting the remaining audience demographic and the potential for merchandising.\n\nThe perception, more than the reality, of science fiction series being cancelled unreasonably is greatly increased by the attachment of fans to their favorite series, which is much stronger in science fiction fandom than it is in the general population. While mainstream shows are often more strictly episodic, where ending shows can allow viewers to imagine that characters live happily, or at least normally, ever after, science fiction series generate questions and loose ends that, when unresolved, cause dissatisfaction among devoted viewers. Creative settings also often call for broader story arcs than is often found in mainstream television, requiring science fiction series many episodes to resolve an ongoing major conflict. Science fiction television producers will sometimes end a season with a dramatic cliffhanger episode to attract viewer interest, but the short-term effect rarely influences financial partners. \"Dark Angel\" is one of many shows ending with a cliffhanger scene that left critical questions open when the series was cancelled.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of media fandom was Star Trek fandom. Fans of the series became known to each other through the science fiction fandom. In 1968, NBC decided to cancel \"\". Bjo Trimble wrote letters to contacts in the National Fantasy Fan Foundation, asking people to organize their local friends to write to the network to demand the show remain on the air. Network executives were overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of correspondence, and they kept the show on the air. Although the series continued to receive low ratings and was canceled a year later, the enduring popularity of the series resulted in Paramount creating a set of movies, and then a new series \"\", which by the early 1990s had become one of the most popular dramas on American television.\n\nAlthough somewhat smaller, \"Doctor Who\" fandom considerably predates \"Star Trek\" fandom. Meanwhile, \"Star Trek\" fans continued to grow in numbers, and began organizing conventions in the 1970s. No other show attracted a large organized following until the 1990s, when \"Babylon 5\" attracted both \"Star Trek\" fans and a large number of literary SF fans who previously had not been involved in media fandom. Other series began to attract a growing number of followers.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay, which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave.\n\nThe 1985 series \"Robotech\" is most often credited as the catalyst for the Western interest in anime. The series inspired a few fanzines such as \"Protoculture Addicts\" and \"Animag\" both of which in turn promoted interest in the wide world of anime in general. Anime's first notable appearance at SF or comic book conventions was in the form of video showings of popular anime, untranslated and often low quality VHS bootlegs. Starting in the 1990s, anime fans began organizing conventions. These quickly grew to sizes much larger than other science fiction and media conventions in the same communities; many cities now have anime conventions attracting five to ten thousand attendees. Many anime conventions are a hybrid between non-profit and commercial events, with volunteer organizers handling large revenue streams and dealing with commercial suppliers and professional marketing campaigns.\n\nFor decades, the majority of science fiction media fandom has been represented by males of all ages and for most of its modern existence, a fairly diverse racial demographic. The most highly publicized demographic for science fiction fans is the male adolescent; roughly the same demographic for American comic books. Female fans, while always present, were far fewer in number and less conspicuously present in fandom. With the rising popularity of fanzines, female fans became increasingly vocal. Starting in the 2000s (decade), genre series began to offer more prominent female characters. Many series featured women as the main characters with males as supporting characters. \"True Blood\" is an example. Also, such shows premises moved away from heroic action-adventure and focused more on characters and their relationships. This has caused the rising popularity of fanfiction, a large majority of which is categorized as slash fanfiction. Female fans comprise the majority of fanfiction writers.\n\nU.S. television science fiction has produced \"\" and its various spin-off shows of the \"Star Trek franchise\", \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"The X-Files,\" and many others.\n\nBritish television science fiction began in 1938 when the broadcast medium was in its infancy with the transmission of a partial adaptation of Karel Čapek's R.U.R.. Despite an occasionally chequered history, popular programmes in the genre have been produced by both the BBC and the largest commercial channel, ITV. \"Doctor Who\" is listed in the \"Guinness World Records\" as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world and as the \"most successful\" science fiction series of all time.\n\nScience fiction in Canada was produced by the CBC as early as the 1950s. In the 1970s, CTV produced \"The Starlost\". In the 1980s, Canadian animation studios including Nelvana, began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation.\n\nIn the 1990s, Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television, with dozens of series like \"Forever Knight\", \"\", and most notably \"The X-Files\" and \"Stargate SG-1\". Many series have been produced for youth and children's markets, including \"Deepwater Black\" and \"MythQuest\".\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to Vancouver. Recent popular series produced in Vancouver include \"The Dead Zone\", \"Smallville\", \"Andromeda\", \"Stargate Atlantis\", \"Stargate Universe\", \"The 4400\", \"Sanctuary\" and the reimagined \"Battlestar Galactica\".\n\nBecause of the small size of the domestic television market, most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe. However, in recent years, new partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada and elsewhere.\n\nAustralia's best known Science Fiction series was \"Farscape\"; made with American co-production, it ran from 1999 to 2003. Early series made in the 1960s included \"The Interparis\" (1968) \"Vega 4\" (1967), and \"Phoenix Five\" (1970). A significant proportion of Australian produced Science Fiction programmes are made for the teens/young Adults market, including \"The Girl from Tomorrow\", the long-running \"Mr. Squiggle\", \"Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left\", \"Ocean Girl\", \"Crash Zone\", \"Watch This Space\" and \"Spellbinder\".\n\nOther series like \"Time Trax\", \"Roar\", and \"\" were filmed in Australia, but used mostly US crew and actors.\n\nJapan has a long history of producing science fiction series for television. Some of the most famous are anime such as Osamu Tezuka's \"Astro Boy\", the Super Robots such as Mitsuteru Yokoyama's \"Tetsujin 28-go\" (\"Gigantor\") and Go Nagai's \"Mazinger Z\", and the Real Robots such as Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Gundam\" series and Shōji Kawamori's \"Macross\" series.\n\nOther primary aspects of Japanese science fiction television are the superhero \"tokusatsu\" (a term literally meaning special effects) series, pioneered by programs such as \"Moonlight Mask\" and \"Planet Prince\". The suitmation technique has been used in long running franchises include Eiji Tsuburaya's Ultra Series, Shotaro Ishinomori's Kamen Rider Series, and the Super Sentai Series.\n\nIn addition, several dramas utilize science fiction elements as framing devices, but are not labeled as \"tokusatsu\" as they do not utilize actors in full body suits and other special effects.\n\nAmong the notable German language productions is \"Lexx\" and , a German series first broadcast in 1966. Movies by Rainer Erler, include the miniseries .<br>\n\"Star Maidens\" (1975, aka \"Medusa\" or \"Die Mädchen aus dem Weltraum\") was a British-German coproduction of pure SF. Danish television broadcast the children's TV-series \"Crash\" in 1984 about a boy who finds out that his room is a space ship.\n\nEarly Dutch television series were \"\" (Tomorrow it will happen), broadcast from 1957 to 1959, about a group of Dutch space explorers and their adventures, \"De duivelsgrot\" (The devil's cave), broadcast from 1963 to 1964, about a scientist who finds the map of a cave that leads to the center of the earth and \"Treinreis naar de Toekomst\" (Train journey to the future) about two young children who are taken to the future by robots who try to recreate humanity, but are unable to give the cloned humans a soul. All three of these television series where aimed mostly at children.\n\nLater television series were \"Professor Vreemdeling\" (1977) about a strange professor who wants to make plants speak and \"\" (1997) a nationalistic post-apocalyptic series where the Netherlands has been built full of housing and the highways are filled with traffic jams. The protagonist, a female superhero, wears traditional folkloric clothes and tries to save traditional elements of Dutch society against the factory owners.\n\nItalian TV shows include \"A come Andromeda\" (1972) which was a remake of 1962 BBC miniseries \"A for Andromeda\" (from the novels of Hoyle and Elliott), \"Geminus\" (1968), \"Il segno del comando\" (1971), \"Gamma\" (1974) and \"La traccia verde\" (1975).\n\nFrench series are \"\", French science-fiction/fantasy television series (both co-produced with Canada) and a number of smaller fiction/fantasy television series, including \"Tang\" in 1971, about a secret organization that attempts to control the world with a new super weapon, \"Les atomistes\" and 1970 miniseries \"La brigade des maléfices\".\n\nAnother French-produced science fiction series was the new age animated series (). Anime-influenced animation includes a series of French-Japanese cartoons/anime, including such titles as \"Ulysses 31\" (1981), \"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\" (1982), and \"Ōban Star-Racers\" (2006).\n\nThe first Spanish SF series was \"Diego Valor\", a 22 episode TV adaption of a radio show hero of the same name based on Dan Dare, aired weekly between 1958 and 1959. Nothing was survived of this series, not a single still; it is not known if the show was even recorded or just a live broadcast.\n\nThe 60s were dominated by Chicho Ibáñez Serrador and Narciso Ibáñez Menta, who adapted SF works from Golden Age authors and others to a series titled \"Mañana puede ser verdad\". Only 11 episodes were filmed. The 70s saw three important television films, \"Los pajaritos\" (1974), \"La Gioconda está triste\" (1977), and \"La cabina\" (1972), this last one, about a man who becomes trapped in a telephone booth, while passersby seem unable to help him, won the 1973 International Emmy Award for Fiction.\n\nThe series \"Plutón B.R.B. Nero\" (2008) was a brutal SF comedy by Álex de la Iglesia, in the line of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \"Red Dwarf\", or \"Doctor Who\", with 26 episodes of 35 minutes. Other series of the 2010s were \"Los protegidos\" (2010-2012), \"El barco\" (2011-2013), and \"El internado\" (2007-2010), all three inspired by North American productions, with minor SF elements.\n\nThe latest success is \"El ministerio del tiempo\" (\"The ministry of time\"), premiered on February 24, 2015 on TVE's main channel La 1. The series follows the exploits of a patrol of the fictional Ministry of Time, which deals with incidents caused by time travel. It has garnered several national prizes in 2015, like the Ondas Prize, and has a thick following on-line, called \"los ministéricos\".\n\nSerbia produced \"The Collector\" (), a science fiction television series based upon Zoran Živković's story, winner of a World Fantasy Award. Several science-fiction series were also produced in various European countries, and never translated into English.\n\nFor a list of notable science fiction series and programs on television, see: List of science fiction television programs.\n\nPeople who have influenced science fiction on television include:\n\n"}
{"id": "9280638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9280638", "title": "Solo exhibition", "text": "Solo exhibition\n\nA solo show or solo exhibition is an exhibition of the work of only one artist. The artwork may be paintings, drawings, etchings, collage, sculpture, or photography. The creator of any artistic technique may be the subject of a solo show. Other skills and crafts have similar types of shows for the creators. Having solo shows of one's artwork marks the achievement of success and usually is accompanied by receptions and a great deal of publicity. The show may be of current work being produced, those from a single time period, or representative work from different periods in the career of the artist, the latter is termed a \"retrospective\". \n\nArt exhibitions have a history that dates back to 1623. It is thought that the first solo exhibition in Britain was staged by Joseph Wright of Derby in 1785, the year after he refused to become a Royal Academician.\n\nArt Galleries became numerous in large cities during the nineteenth century and flourished during the twentieth century, often becoming included among stores in small towns as well, after the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nGenerally, as artists begin to show their work they are accepted by commercial gallery owners for display among the works of many or among others who work in the same area. The works of the artists are sold and the galleries take commissions. As artists gain stature and attract a following who will purchase their works in greater numbers, gallery owners will promote their works in solo shows with a great deal of publicity about the show. The artists with the greatest appeal to a gallery's clients may be invited to be represented by that gallery consistently, developing a constant relationship that even may develop into exclusive rights to offer the sale of the works by those artists.\n\nOnce artists become recognized for their skills among critics and collectors through representation at galleries, museum directors and staff members may begin to purchase the works of the artists for museum collections. Museums also hold exhibitions that change regularly and may choose to feature a solo show of the works of an artist as one of these exhibitions. Works that are gathered on loan from many other museums or collectors also may be scheduled for exhibition at one museum as a solo show. Planning for the exhibitions is a long process. Museums schedule their exhibitions for a given year well in advance and their negotiations may begin years before the shows are held. \n\nSome artists create a large number of works that they reserve as a traveling exhibition that generates income for them as they travel around the world for decades as solo shows at museums and galleries. Typically, the contract arrangements for booking such a large exhibition are that the hosting organization pays a fee to the artist, arranges for the safe delivery, set up, and return of the exhibition, and it charges admission to those attracted to the exhibition by extensive publicity generated by the host and approved by the artist. \n\nThe term \"one-man show\" was used at times to describe these art exhibitions, but has fallen out of favor, even though the term \"one-man show\" persists to describe a solo performance among some entertainment venues and performing arts.\n\n"}

Unlike typical sports and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, physical exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience's benefit, thus they are never practiced privately. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing.\n\nThe term \"sports entertainment\" was coined by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) chairman Vince McMahon during the 1980s as a marketing term to describe the industry of professional wrestling, primarily to potential advertisers, although precursors date back to February 1935, when \"Toronto Star\" sports editor Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as \"sportive entertainment\". In 1989 WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as \"sports entertainment\" and thus not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport.\n\nSome sports entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings.\n\nSome forms of sports entertainment involve taking competitive games usually considered minor, such as dodgeball, poker, or rock-paper-scissors, and televising them with trumped-up theatrics, involving (for example) celebrity competitors or elaborate audiovisual packages.\n\nSports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment, and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning.\n\nMany notable names in the United States openly admit enjoying certain forms of sports entertainment while many others have taken part in it or made paid contributions. Professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal has a reputation as a long time pro wrestling fan and attends WWE events several times per year, and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. expressed interest in fulfilling a WWE career after he retires from professional boxing. Both worked feuds with Big Show, Mayweather's culminating in a featured match at WrestleMania XXIV. Former American football player Brian Urlacher made an attempt to leave football to wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling full-time until his team at the time, the Chicago Bears, forced him to stop. Mixed martial artists Brock Lesnar, Bobby Lashley and Dan Severn have been booked as pro wrestling world heavyweight champions; David Arquette was briefly WCW World Heavyweight Champion, as part of a cross-promotional movie deal.\n\n"}

{"id": "451023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=451023", "title": "The Brood", "text": "The Brood\n\nThe Brood is a 1979 Canadian science fiction psychological horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg, and starring Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar, and Art Hindle. The film follows a man uncovering an eccentric psychologist's therapy techniques on his institutionalized wife, amidst a series of brutal murders committed from an offspring of mutant children that coincides with the investigation. The film's soundtrack was composed by Howard Shore, in his film score debut.\n\nReleased in 1979 from New World Pictures, the film initially received mixed reviews from critics. Over the years, later reviews were more favourable regarding the film.\n\nPsychotherapist Hal Raglan runs the Somafree Institute where he performs a technique called \"psychoplasmics\", encouraging patients with mental disturbances to let go of their suppressed emotions through physiological changes to their bodies. One of his patients is Nola Carveth, a severely disturbed woman who is legally embattled with her husband Frank for custody of their five-year-old daughter Candice. When Frank discovers bruises and scratches on Candice following a visit with Nola, he informs Raglan of his intent to stop visitation rights. Wanting to protect his patient, Raglan begins to intensify the sessions with Nola to resolve the issue quickly. During the therapy sessions, Raglan discovers that Nola was physically and verbally abused by her self-pitying alcoholic mother, and neglected by her co-dependent alcoholic father, who refused to protect Nola out of shame and denial. Meanwhile, Frank, intending to invalidate Raglan's methods, questions Jan Hartog, a former Somafree patient dying of psychoplasmic-induced lymphoma.\n\nFrank leaves Candice with her grandmother, Juliana, and the two spend the evening viewing old photographs. Later, Juliana informs Candice that Nola was frequently hospitalized as a child, and often exhibited strange unexplained wheals on her skin that doctors were unable to diagnose. While returning to the kitchen, Juliana is attacked and bludgeoned to death by a small, dwarf-like child. Candice is traumatized, but otherwise unharmed.\n\nJuliana's ex-husband Barton returns for the funeral, and attempts to contact Nola at Somafree, but Raglan turns him away. Frank invites his daughter's teacher Ruth Mayer home for dinner to discuss Candice, but Barton interrupts with a drunken phone call from Juliana's home, demanding that they both go to Somafree in force to see Nola. Frank leaves to console Barton, leaving Candice in Ruth's care. While he is away, Ruth accidentally answers a phone call from Nola, who, recognizing her voice and believing her to be carrying on an affair with Frank, insults her and angrily warns her to stay away from her family. Frank arrives to find Barton murdered by the same deformed dwarf-child, who dies after attempting to kill Frank.\n\nThe police autopsy reveals a multitude of bizarre anatomical anomalies: the creature is asexual, supposedly color-blind, naturally toothless, and devoid of a navel, indicating no known means of natural human birth. After the murder story reaches the newspapers, Raglan reluctantly acknowledges that the murders coincide with his sessions with Nola relating to their respective topics. He closes Somafree and sends his patients to municipal care with the exception of Nola.\n\nFrank is alerted of the closure of Somafree by Hartog. Mike, one of the patients forced to leave the institute, tells Frank that Nola is Raglan's \"queen bee\" and in charge of some \"disturbed children\" in an attic. When Candice returns to school, two dwarf children attack and kill Ruth in front of her class, and abscond with Candice to Somafree. Frank immediately ventures to Somafree. Raglan tells him the truth about the dwarf children: they are the accidental product of Nola's psychoplasmic sessions; Nola's rage about her abuse was so strong that she parthenogenetically bore a brood of children who psychically respond and act on the targets of her rage, with Nola completely unaware of their actions. Realizing the brood are too dangerous to keep anymore, Raglan plots to venture into their quarters and rescue Candice, provided that Frank can keep Nola calm to avoid provoking the children.\n\nFrank attempts a feigned rapprochement long enough for Raglan to collect Candice, but when he witnesses Nola give birth to another child through a psychoplasmically-induced external womb, she notices his disgust. The brood awakens and kills Raglan. Nola then threatens to kill Candice rather than lose her. The brood goes after Candice who hides in a closet, but the brood begins to break through the door and try to grab her. In desperation, Frank chokes Nola to death, and the brood dies without its mother's psychic connection. Frank carries Candice back to his car and they drive off, but it is hinted that the events she endured result in the same phenomenon her mother experienced: a pair of small bumps are seen growing on her arm.\n\n\"The Brood\" was filmed in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario, on a budget of C$1,500,000. It was a financial success, and executive producer Victor Solnicki (who also produced Cronenberg's \"Scanners\" and \"Videodrome\") called it his favorite Cronenberg picture. Cronenberg called it the most classic horror film he did, and, together with \"The Fly\" and \"Dead Ringers\", one of his most autobiographical. At the time \"The Brood\" was developed, Cronenberg fought for custody of his daughter from his first marriage.\n\nThis was the first film scored by composer Howard Shore. Shore has written the music for all but one of Cronenberg's subsequent films.\n\n\"The Brood\" had cuts demanded for its theatrical release in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom. Actress Samantha Eggar conceived of the idea of licking the new fetuses that her character Nola Carveth has spawned. \"I just thought that when cats have their kittens or dogs have puppies (and I think at that time I had about 8 dogs), they lick them as soon as they’re born. Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick…,\" Eggar said.\n\nHowever, when the climactic scene was censored, Cronenberg responded: \"I had a long and loving close-up of Samantha licking the fetus […] when the censors, those animals, cut it out, the result was that a lot of people thought she was eating her baby. That's much worse than I was suggesting.\" The US MGM DVD and UK Anchor Bay DVD, as well as the Criterion Collection Blu-ray feature the uncensored version, while most other releases feature the shorter version.\n\nReviews of \"The Brood\" were generally mixed to positive. Despite this, the film holds a 'fresh' rating of 79% on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7/10 based on 19 reviews. While \"Variety\" called it \"an extremely well made, if essentially unpleasant shocker\", Leonard Maltin reviewed the film in two sentences: \"Eggar eats her own afterbirth while midget clones beat grandparents and lovely young schoolteachers to death with mallets. It's a big, wide, wonderful world we live in!\" and rated it an outright \"BOMB\". Roger Ebert called it \"a bore\" and \"disgusting in ways that are not entertaining; as opposed, for example, to the great disgusting moments in \"Alien\" or \"Dawn of the Dead\"\", and even went as far as asking, \"Are there really people who want to see reprehensible trash like this?\" concluding with \"I guess so. It's in its second week.\" In \"Cult Movies\", Danny Peary, who openly disapproves of \"Shivers\" and \"Rabid\", calls \"The Brood\" \"Cronenberg's best film\" because \"we care about the characters\", and, although he dislikes the ending, \"an hour and a half of absorbing, solid cinema\". In his \"An Introduction to the American Horror Film\", critic Robin Wood views \"The Brood\" as a reactionary work portraying feminine power as irrational and horrifying, and the dangerous attempts of Oliver Reed's character's psychoanalysis as an analogue to the dangers of trying to undo repression in society.\n\n\"The Brood\" was listed #88 on the \"Chicago Film Critics Association's 100 Scariest Movies of All-Time\". In 2004, one of its sequences was voted #78 among the \"100 Scariest Movie Moments\" by the Bravo Channel.\n\nIn mid-2013, The Criterion Collection added \"The Brood\", as well as \"Scanners\", to their selection of films available to Hulu and iTunes customers. On July 15, 2015, the Criterion Collection announced a Blu-ray and DVD release of \"The Brood\" slated for October 13, 2015.\n\nIn 2009, Spyglass Entertainment announced a remake from a script by Cory Goodman, to be directed by Breck Eisner. Eisner left the project in 2010.\n\n"}

It is his only signed work, and has an unusual iconography for a Nativity.\n\nThe Greek inscription at the top translates as: \"This picture, at the end of the year 1500, in the troubles of Italy, I Alessandro, in the half-time after the time, painted, according to the eleventh [chapter] of Saint John, in the second woe of the Apocalypse, during the release of the devil for three-and-a-half years; then he shall be bound in the twelfth [chapter] and we shall see [him buried] as in this picture\". Botticelli believed himself to be living during the Tribulation, possibly due to the upheavals in Europe at the time, and was predicting Christ's Millennium as stated in Biblical text.\n\nIt has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of Savonarola, whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli, though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it. The painting uses the medieval convention of showing the Virgin Mary and infant Jesus larger both than other figures, and their surroundings; this was certainly done deliberately for effect, as earlier Botticellis use correct graphical perspective.\n\n\"The Mystical Nativity\" depicts a scene of joy and celebration, of earthly and heavenly delight, with angels dancing at the top of the painting. At the top of the painting stands Sandro Botticelli's name – but also the apocalyptic and troubling words. And there are dark premonitions – the helpless child rests on a sheet that evokes the shroud in which his body will one day be wrapped, while the cave in which the scene is set calls to mind his tomb. The Kings on the left bear no gifts, but their own devotion. At the top of the painting twelve angels dressed in the colours of faith, hope and charity dance in a circle holding olive branches, and above them heaven opens in a great golden dome, while at the bottom of the painting three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them up from the ground. They hold scrolls which proclaim in Latin, \"peace on earth to men of goodwill\". Behind them seven devils flee to the underworld, some impaled on their own weapons. In Renaissance times Last Judgment paintings showed viewers the reckoning of the damned and the saved at the time of Christ's Second Coming. In echoing this kind of painting the Mystical Nativity is asking us to think not only of Christ's birth but of his return..\" (Jonathan Nelson, Syracuse University in Florence).\n\nThe painting emerged from the city of Florence in a time when the fanatical preacher Savonarola held the city in its grip. He had arrived in Florence in 1490 but had been repelled by the artistic glory and enormous wealth that so impressed the world. He preached that this was a corrupt and vice-ridden place. A great scourge was approaching – and then his words had assumed a terrifying reality: the Italian War of 1494–1498. In 1494 a huge French army invaded Italy and troops entered Florence so that the Florentines feared the King of France meant to sack the city. Savonarola stepped into the political vacuum, he met with the French king and persuaded him to leave Florence peacefully. In their gratitude and relief the Florentines increasingly saw the friar as a prophet and his preaching attracted huge crowds to Florence Cathedral. Savonarola claimed that Florence could become the new Jerusalem if the citizens would repent and abandon their sinful luxuries – and that included much of their art. His beliefs were made real as groups of evangelical youths went on to the streets to encourage people to part with their luxuries, their lewd pictures, and books, their vanities, combs, mirrors. Botticelli may well have seen his own paintings fed to the flames. Yet the artist might not have objected because, like much of the city, he too had come under the sway of Savonarola. It seems that a sermon preached by Savonarola bears directly upon the Mystical Nativity.\n\nIn one sermon Savonarola preached he set forth a vision that had come to him in which he saw an extraordinary heavenly crown. At its base were twelve hearts with twelve ribbons wrapped around them and written on these in Latin were the unique mystical qualities or privileges of the Virgin Mary – she is 'mother of her father', 'daughter of her son', 'bride of God' etc. Though much of the writing on the ribbons held by the dancing angels is now invisible to the naked eye, infra-red reflectography has shown that the original words on the angels ribbons correspond exactly to Savonarola's 12 privileges of the Virgin. In his sermon, preached on Assumption Day, Savonarola went on to explore the 11th and 12th chapters of the Book of Revelation – the precise chapters mentioned in the painting's inscription. He connected the glory of Mary with the imminent coming of the power of Christ on earth.\n\nFor years Savonarola held Florence in his hand but his hard line charismatic rule made him powerful political enemies. He was challenged to prove his holiness by walking through fire and when he refused the tide of opinion turned against him. He was arrested, and under torture confessed to being a false prophet. On 23 May 1498 he was hanged with two of his leading lieutenants, their bodies burnt and their ashes scattered in the river Arno. Some see the figures of the three men at the bottom of the painting as representatives of the three executed holy men, raised up and restored to grace – but persecution not peace awaited Savonarola's followers and it was in an atmosphere of oppression that Botticelli set out to create the \"Mystical Nativity\".\n\nThe painting is on canvas – normally he would have used wood panel – perhaps for a painting with a dangerous message, canvas had the advantage that it could be rolled up and hidden. With his canvas prepared he would sketch a detailed design on paper, then he transferred this to canvas. He drew on many sources – the dancing angels echo his own three graces of \"Primavera\", the scurrying devil was inspired by a German woodcut. X-rays show that very little of the original design changed – only an angel's wing was adjusted and trees added over the roof of the stable. Botticelli was now ready to build up the image using tempera paint – the canvas was an experimental medium. To create the heavenly dome Botticelli called on the goldsmith's craft he had learned as a boy. \"The symbolism of the gold is to do with the unchanging, untarnished nature of heaven – gold doesn't decay, it doesn't darken like silver. Botticelli would have used an adhesive layer made of oil mixed with resin – not burnished, the gold just patted down on to the surface, following the surface irregularities of the canvas – a glitter, intricate, it would have helped the jewel like quality of the painting – it would have drawn the eye upwards from the Nativity into Heaven. Faith, hope and charity, [the angels clothed in] white, green and red – but the copper based green pigment has discoloured with time, to bronze. Originally it would have been vibrant.\" \n\nBotticelli died in 1510. The \"Mystical Nativity\" remained hidden for another three centuries. Rome at the end of the 18th century was very different to Renaissance Florence – except for the presence of French invaders. Many foreigners left, but not a young Englishman, William Young Ottley. He was an art lover, and wealthy with a slave plantation in the Caribbean. He bought up many paintings cheaply. At the Villa Aldobrandini he saw a small, unknown work, Botticelli's \"Mystical Nativity\". Botticelli was then in obscurity.\n\nIt arrived in London where Ottley's house became in effect a private museum of Italian masterpieces. After Ottley's death William Fuller Maitland of Stansted picked up the painting at an auction for £80. When he loaned it to the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857, it was now on open display. The exhibition's newspaper the \"Art Treasures Examiner\" printed a new engraving of it.\nFrom the moment Botticelli's art is shown in Manchester there's a real change in opinion about his work and certainly by the late 1870s, 1880s Botticelli becomes a real cult figure – somebody the artists who aspire to be on the cutting edge of the art world are looking to...Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones both adapted elements of it for their own work. Burne-Jones copied some of Botticelli's illustrations for Dante's \"Divine Comedy\" into his own sketchbooks. Rossetti demonstrated his affection for Botticelli's work by buying his portrait of \"Smeralda Bandinelli\" in 1867.\n\nJohn Ruskin helped to give the painting its name; after seeing it in London he referred to Botticelli's 'mystic symbolism'. When Maitland died the National Gallery in London stepped in. According to Nicholas Penny the Gallery \"was concerned to buy works from the earlier Renaissance – previously it had been its top priority to buy masterpieces which there would be no controversy about at all. There was an element of avant-garde excitement about buying pictures like this in the 19th century.\" The Gallery had to find £1500, being nearly 20 times what it had fetched just thirty years earlier.\n"}
{"id": "19591835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19591835", "title": "The Three Dead Kings", "text": "The Three Dead Kings\n\nThe Three Dead Kings, also known by its Latin title De Tribus Regibus Mortuis or as The Three Living and the Three Dead, is a 15th-century Middle English poem. It is found in the manuscript MS. Douce 302, and its authorship is sometimes attributed to a Shropshire priest, John Audelay. It is an extremely rare survival from a late genre of alliterative verse, also significant as the only English poetic retelling of a well-known \"memento mori\" current in mediaeval European church art.\n\nThe theme of the 'Three Living and the Three Dead' is a relatively common form of \"memento mori\" in mediaeval art. A \"Dit des trois morts et des trois vifs\" by Baudoin de Condé has been traced back to 1280.\n\nIn the poem, an unnamed narrator describes seeing a boar hunt, a typical opening of the genre of the \"chanson d'aventure\". Three kings are following the hunt; they lose their way in mist and are separated from their retainers. Suddenly, \"schokyn out of a schawe\" (42) ('Starting out of a wood') three walking corpses appear, described in graphically hideous terms. The kings are terrified, but show a range of reactions to the three Dead, ranging from a desire to flee to a resolve to face them. The three corpses, in response, state that they are not demons, but the three kings' forefathers, and criticise their heirs for neglecting their memory and not saying masses for their souls: \"Bot we haue made ȝoue mastyrs amys/ Þat now nyl not mynn us with a mas\" (103-104). Once, the three Dead were materialistic and pleasure-loving: \"Wyle I was mon apon mold merþis þai were myne\" (121) ('While I was a man upon earth, pleasures were mine'), and they now suffer for it. Eventually, the Dead leave, the red daylight comes, and the kings ride home. The final message of the Dead is that the living should always be mindful of them - \"Makis your merour be me\" (120) - and of the transient nature of life. Afterwards the kings raise a church \"with masse\" (139) and have the story written on its walls.\n\nApart from its complex structure, the poem is distinguished for its vividly descriptive and imaginative language.\n\nAlong with other poems in MS. Douce 302, \"The Three Dead Kings\" is written in a dialect of Middle English local to the area of Shropshire and west Staffordshire.\n\nThe poem has an extremely unusual structure, combining a four-stress alliterative line, a tight rhyme scheme, and regular use of assonance. The structure of the rhymes, \"ABABABAB\" in the first eight lines of each stanza and \"CDCCD\" in the final five, combines with the alliteration, and the use of the same final consonant on the fourth stress throughout the entire stanza, to produce an additional pararhyme between pairs of lines:\n\nA few other Middle English poems use a similar thirteen-line stanza, but \"The Three Dead Kings\" has the most elaborate structure: medievalist Thorlac Turville-Petre refers to it as \"the most highly patterned and technically complex poem in the language\".\n\nMS. Douce 302, now held at the Bodleian Library, is a manuscript of work by John Audelay, a chantry priest at Haughmond Abbey, Shropshire, who is known to have been alive in 1426, when the manuscript may have been compiled. By this point he stated that he was old, deaf, and blind, although this complicates the question of how he could have authored the poetry in the manuscript. Some scholars have argued that Audelay's other poetry lacks the great technical skill shown in \"The Three Dead Kings\", and that he is therefore unlikely to have written it, especially as it shows signs of a more northerly dialect. Others, however, have defended his authorship, noting that he favours both alliteration and thirteen-line stanza forms elsewhere in the manuscript.\n\n"}
