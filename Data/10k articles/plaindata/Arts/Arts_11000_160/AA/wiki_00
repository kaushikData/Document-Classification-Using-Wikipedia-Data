Amy Kitchener, a public folklorist, is the co-founder, founding director, and current Executive Director.\n\nFounded in 1997 by artists, arts administrators, and cultural arts enthusiasts, this organization began with a budget of $15,000, which has since grown to over 1.2 million annually. In 1999, ACTA became recognized as the official partner of the California Arts Council and has the distinction of being the only state organization that focuses solely on folk and traditional arts. ACTA incorporated in 2001 and achieved 501(c)(3) status in December 2002.\n\nACTA's stated mission is to ensure that “California’s future holds California’s past” by promoting and supporting ways for cultural traditions to thrive. Their main goals are to provide cultural organizations, which are often under-recognized or completely unrecognized, the necessary resources, advocacy, and connections to thrive for years to come, contributing to the cultural diversity, cultural continuity, and community health of California.\n\nACTA is funded through a diverse network of foundations, arts councils, and philanthropists. There are numerous ways for nonprofit groups to receive benefits from ACTA. Among the simplest is by listing themselves in ACTA’s statewide database, by receiving the monthly e-newsletter ACTA publishes on traditional and folk arts, and by using their website as a forum to advertise their events as well as a vehicle to learn about other national and statewide agencies committed to helping the arts. \n\nIn a more hands-on fashion, groups in the San Francisco Bay Area can benefit from the Traditional Arts Roundtable Series that ACTA curates. These meetings foster an intercultural environment where tradition bearers and arts advocates can network, exchange ideas, learn from one another, and help each other with fundraising and technical assistance in community-based arts event planning. Recent roundtable discussions have been: “Borderlands: A Conversation about Immigration and the Arts,” “Worksample Laboratory for Traditional and Tradition-Based Artists,” and “Small Business Development for Traditional Artists.”\n\nThe crux of the support that ACTA gives to local arts communities is through three separate programs offered every year: The Apprenticeship Program, the Living Cultures Grants Program, and the Traditional Arts Development Program. A fourth grant program, the Traditional Arts Sustainability Grant, was offered for the first time in 2010. \n"}

The anonymous \"Master of the Battle of Orsha\" was probably one of the court painters-cartographers, from his technique and style probably an artist from the circle of Lucas Cranach the Elder. Meticulous details suggest the artist was himself a witness to the battle. There is a self-portrait of the artist as an unarmed figure in German costume (near bottom, right of centre), sitting on a tree stump on the bank of the Dnieper river, looking at the battle, while framing his fingers to compose a view.\n\nAccording to one hypothesis the author of the picture was the German artist Hans Krell, court painter of Louis II of Hungary.\n\nThe image shows a bird's eye view of several stages of the battle; the same characters appearing in different places - Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski is shown three times. Details of equipment and weapons and portraits of the commanders have been recreated realistically and with great accuracy, showing, among others, such scenes as emptying water from armor after crossing the river. Some scenes verge on the grotesque; others emphasize the cruelty of the battle.\n\nThe image has not been preserved in its entirety. Careful analysis suggests that it was initially taller and included the horizon. Its asymmetrical composition suggests that 1/5 of the width was trimmed from the left. The two conflicting columns of heavy infantry, presumably once the center of the image, are now shifted to the left. The established date of the image is 1520-1534.\n\n"}

Pompeii’s Mediterranean climate enticed many Romans to invest in holiday villas there, so it is possible that the owner at the time of Vesuvius’ eruption in 79 AD was a wealthy tourist, not a local.\n\nThe estate is referred to as “The House of Menander” because there is a well-preserved fresco of the ancient Greek Dramatist Menander in a small room off the peristyle. Some speculate the painting is not actually of Menander but rather of the owner of the house or another person reading works by Menander.\n\nThe house included other frescoes, including one depicting the death of Laocoon.\n\nThe large columns in the peristyle of the Casa del Menandro are representative of the Doric style of architecture, an offshoot of the Classical Style, which also stems from Greece. The emphasis on Greek culture in Pompeian architecture is not surprising since Greek sailors had been using the port as a trading post before the Oscans founded the city in the 6th century BC.\n\nNumerous examples of Roman graffiti can be observed on the exterior walls of the house.\n\n"}

The circumstances of its discovery show that technically it constitutes a hoard.\n\nThe cap, hammered from a single casting of gold, is entirely covered with registers of repeated repoussé decoration, hammered over bronze molds, of repeated bosses alternating with bands of repeated concentric circles. The central point is applied with a flat-sided point in the form of a truncated cone. Its maximum diameter is 19.5 cm with a height of 15 cm to the base of the point, it weighs 270 grams.\n\nIts registers of hammered decoration present parallels with the decors of late Bronze Age conical golden hats of the Schifferstadt type and the gold bowls found at Axtroki, Guipúzcoa, or the so-called Treasure of Villena, Alicante. There is a possibility that its uses were twofold: as a ritual basin, though it is decoratively pierced with an awl, and inverted as an emblem of authority.\n\nThe casque was a chance discovery made by a fisherman, José Vicente Somoza, on 7 April 1976 at a small rocky point called Curruncho dos Porcos, by the beach at Leiro (Rianxo) in Galicia, Spain.

His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were Westerns, but he went on to specialize in crime fiction and suspense thrillers, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.\n\nAmong his best-known works are \"Get Shorty\", \"Out of Sight\", \"Swag\", \"Hombre\", \"Mr. Majestyk\", and \"Rum Punch\" (adapted as the movie \"Jackie Brown\"). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"The Tall T\", as well as the FX television series \"Justified\".\n\nLeonard was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr. Because his father worked as a site locator for General Motors, the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in Detroit.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the Seabees for three years in the South Pacific (gaining the nickname \"Dutch\", after pitcher Dutch Leonard). Enrolling at the University of Detroit in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950 with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a copy writer with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.\n\nLeonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing pulp Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when \"Argosy\" published the short story \"Trail of the Apaches\". During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing Westerns, publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, \"The Bounty Hunters\", in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972: \"The Tall T\" (Randolph Scott), \"\" (Glenn Ford), \"Hombre\" (Paul Newman), \"Valdez Is Coming\" (Burt Lancaster), and \"Joe Kidd\" (Clint Eastwood).\n\nHe went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the mystery, crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.\n\nIn 1985, his breakout novel, \"Glitz\" was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.\n\nAmong film adaptations of his work are \"Jackie Brown\" (starring Pam Grier, directed by Quentin Tarantino) which is a \"homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace\"; \"Get Shorty\" (1995, John Travolta and Gene Hackman); and \"Out of Sight\" (1998, George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, directed by Steven Soderbergh).\n\nHe married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons—before divorcing in 1977. His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent, and they divorced in 2012.\n\nLeonard spent the last years of his life with his family in Oakland County, Michigan. He suffered a stroke on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering, but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills of stroke complications. He was 87 years old. Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.\n\nCommended by critics for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with grammar in the interest of speeding the story along. In his essay \"Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing\" he said: \"My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it.\" He also hinted: \"I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip.\"\n\nElmore Leonard has been called \"the Dickens of Detroit\" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, \"If I lived in Buffalo, I'd write about Buffalo.\" His favorite epithet was one given by Britain's \"New Musical Express\": \"the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers\". His ear for dialogue has been praised by writers such as Saul Bellow, Martin Amis, and Stephen King. \"Your prose makes Raymond Chandler look clumsy,\" Amis told Leonard at a Writers Guild event in Beverly Hills in 1998. Stephen King has called him \"the great American writer.\" According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of free indirect discourse, a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, \"is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix.\" \n\nLeonard often cited Ernest Hemingway as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously. Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as George V. Higgins, that led him to will his personal papers to the University of South Carolina, where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived. Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.\n\n\nLeonard also contributed one chapter (the twelfth of thirteen) to the 1996 \"Miami Herald\" parody serial novel \"Naked Came the Manatee\" ().\n\n\nTwenty-six of Leonard's novels and short stories have been adapted for the screen (19 as motion pictures and another seven as television programs).\n\nAside from the short stories already noted, a number of Leonard's novels have been adapted as films, including \"Get Shorty\" (1990 novel, 1995 film), \"Out of Sight\" (1996 novel, 1998 film), and \"Rum Punch\" (1992 novel, 1997 film \"Jackie Brown\"). \"52 Pick-Up\" (1986 film) was first adapted very loosely into the 1984 film \"The Ambassador\" (1984), starring Robert Mitchum and, two years later, under its original title starring Roy Scheider. Leonard has also written several screenplays based on his novels, plus original screenplays such as \"Joe Kidd\" (1972).\n\nThe film \"Hombre\" (1967), starring Paul Newman, was an adaptation of Leonard's 1961 novel of the same name.\n\nHis short story \"Three-Ten to Yuma\" (March 1953) and novels \"The Big Bounce\" (1969) and \"52 Pick-Up\" have each been filmed twice.\n\nOther novels filmed include:\n\nQuentin Tarantino has optioned the right to adapt Leonard's novel \"Forty Lashes Less One\" (1972).\n\n\n"}

The most widely recognized flags associated with Earth are the flag of the United Nations and the Earth Day flag. Listed below are some of the unofficial contenders for a Flag of Earth:\n\nA flag designed by John McConnell in 1969 for the first Earth Day is a dark blue field charged with \"The Blue Marble\", a famous NASA photo of the Earth as seen from outer space. The first edition of McConnell's flag used screen-printing and used different colors: ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white. McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration.\n\nBecause of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with environmental awareness, and the celebration of the global community. It was offered for sale originally in the \"Whole Earth Catalog\", and is the only flag which was endorsed by McConnell. \n\n\"The Blue Marble\" image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc. This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it.\n\nThe One Flag in Space initiative is an offshoot of the Space Generation Congress (SGC), the Space Generation Advisory Council's yearly world meeting. It promotes usage of the \"Blue Marble\" flag for space exploration (it does not explicitly mention it being McConnell's design).\n\nAdopted in 1946, the flag of the United Nations has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the United Nations itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.\n\nJames William van Kirk, a minister from Youngstown, Ohio, designed in 1913 a peace flag with rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. With this flag, he twice made a peace tour through Europe. The Universal Peace Congress adopted this flag as its World Peace Flag.\n\nDesigned by Pierre de Coubertin in 1914 and adopted in Olympic games since 1920, the Olympic flag represents all mankind and has a white bar with 5 interlocking rings of 5 colors. The five rings represent the five continents. The six colors (including the white color of the background) represent all of the world's nations.\n\nThe World Citizen is a social movement for global citizenship under a proposed world government. In 1953, one of its activists, Garry Davis, founded the World Service Authority, which sells the World Passport (a fantasy travel document) with a proposed flag of the world.\n\nThe astrological (and astronomical) symbol of Earth is another candidate for Earth's flag, often depicted with a blue background, with the symbol at its center.\n\nAnother Earth flag was created around the same time in 1970 by a farmer from Homer, Illinois named James W. Cadle. Cadle's version of the Earth flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the sun and a small white circle for the moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular amongst SETI researchers and is used by SETI worldwide. The flag flies at the Ohio State University Radio Observatory and was lowered to half mast when Carl Sagan died. Flag of Earth Co. International was also founded by Cadle which sold the flag. The Flag of Earth became public domain in 2003.\n\nThe World Flag is an international flag created in 1988 by Paul Carroll to act as a symbol to inspire \"positive global change while continuing to embrace and celebrate cultural diversity.\" The current 2008 version of the combined World Flag has a world map 216 flags; including the flags of every UN member state, the United Nations, and several territories of larger nations.\n\nThe World Flag has been flown at the UN Headquarters for the \"A Prayer for Peace\" event, The World Trade Center, Earth Day in Central Park, and at various other events around the world.\n\nIn 2015 a Swedish artist, Oskar Pernefeldt, proposed the \"International Flag of the Planet Earth\". It was conceived to be used in space expeditions and it has two main purposes: \n\nThe creators predict that it will be eventually used in Mars landing in 2025 or in a future colony on that planet. The flag is used by space research groups with intent to implanting a base on Mars. The design of the flag consists of seven rings intersecting each other and a deep-blue-sea in the background. The rings are centered on the flag forming a flower in the middle, representing life on Earth. The intersection of the rings represent that all things on Earth are linked directly or indirectly. The rings are organized in a Borromean rings–like fashion, representing not only the seven continents, but how no part of Earth can be removed without the whole structure collapsing. Finally, the deep-blue represents the ocean and the importance of water for life on Earth.\n\nThe One World Flag is a concept published in 2018 by the German activist and visual artist Thomas Mandl. The design of the flag consists of a blue circle on a translucent blank background. Through the usage of Sheer fabrics, the environment blends into the flag background and thus becomes an integral part of the flag design representing the ever-changing nature of culture, society, politics, and environment of the planet earth. \n\n\n"}

It stars Natasha Lyonne as Crystal \"White Girl\" Van Meter, and María Celedonio as Angela \"Cyclona\" Garcia. As the original film was partly inspired by \"Little Red Riding Hood\", the second film is somewhat based on \"Hansel and Gretel\". The film achieved little attention or notoriety, unlike its predecessor.\n\nCrystal \"White Girl\" Van Meter is a 15-year-old prostitute who is sentenced to 25 years for a long list of crimes which include beating up and robbing johns. Transferred to a minimum security hospital to seek treatment for bulimia, White Girl teams up with Angela \"Cyclona\" Garcia, a lesbian teenage serial killer. Together, they escape from the hospital, despite White Girl injuring herself on a barbed-wire fence. Cyclona is convinced her beloved Sister Gomez can help \"White Girl\" with her eating disorder and they head to Tijuana. On the way, Cyclona murders a family and has sex with the dead bodies. \"White Girl\" is not happy that Cyclona has stopped taking her meds and insists she continue to take occasional doses should they continue together. They steal the family's car and make their way south. On the way, Cyclona reveals how Sister Gomez saved her from being molested by her father and possibly aliens. After drinking one too many beers and huffing some paint, they crash and fall down a hill laughing.\n\nUndaunted, the two fugitives catch a ride on a freight train only to be assaulted by a transient crack addict. Cyclona kills him to protect White Girl, and the two make off with his bag of crack and guns. Venturing into the woods, they leave a trail of crack which is picked away by shady men with crow feathers on their hats. Lost and confused, they make it to the border only to have a stand-off with two customs officials, both of whom Cyclona kills. \"White Girl\" violently pistol-whips Cyclona and after making her point, the two race to the suburbs of Tijuana.\n\nIn Tijuana, Crystal/White Girl makes money by luring men to dark alleys on the promise of a good time, and mugging them. Cyclona and White Girl check into a run-down motel where they have a moment with beer, a shower and a vibrating bed. White Girl finally gives into Cyclona's sexual advances toward her and the two of them engage in some rampant lesbian sex.\n\nAfter a few days, the two lovers find a poster that shows Sister Gomez is in town. Sister Gomez appears to be a Catholic/spiritualist healer; Cyclona is very keen that they visit her, for Sister Gomez has protected her from abuse in the past, and might be able to help them. They visit Sister Gomez at her gaudy mission house. Sister makes an enormous roast feast for her \"little movie star\" (Cyclona) and the friend \"with the hungry demon\" (Crystal), referring to her bulimia. Cyclona then disappears as White Girl is forced to work for Sister Gomez in the same way as she has been doing, in exchange for food. Finally, Crystal grows weary and makes her way to the basement, where she finds small children in a bondage room with a U.F.O shaped lantern. There is blood everywhere. Cyclona is hanging half-nude in a bondage style contraption. She tells Crystal that Sister Gomez made her watch while she chopped up children and made food out of them. She reveals that her ultimate plan for Crystal was to fatten her up with the meat of the children, and then, serve Crystal up for dinner as well. Crystal concludes that Sister Gomez is the witch-leader of a bizarre cult that rapes and eats children and then sells the child porn videos, protected by the front of a Catholic mission. Ready to deliver justice, White Girl/Crystal frees Cyclona and kills all the cult members; she also reveals Sister Gomez to be a rather well-endowed man. Not succumbing to bullets, Gomez is thrown in the oven. Burning, Gomez screams of his 100,000 years of terror and the revenge from his father Jupiter that will ensue. Crystal, keeping a promise made earlier, is forced to kill Cyclona in a tearful scene rather than allow her to be captured. Cyclona, wishing to leave behind a life of abuse and violence, hopes to be reincarnated as an eagle (we discover that Sister Gomez was her earliest abuser). White Girl makes a deal with the federales and leaves with her lawyer/pimp, stating \"I'm not hungry anymore.\"\n\n\n"}

It is worn by members of the Goth subculture. A dark, sometimes morbid fashion and style of dress, typical gothic fashion includes a pale complexion with colored black hair, black lips and black clothes. Both male and female goths can wear dark eyeliner and dark fingernail polish most especially black. Styles are often borrowed from the punk fashion, Victorians and Elizabethans. Goth fashion is sometimes confused with heavy metal fashion and emo fashion.\n\nCintra Wilson declares that \"The origins of contemporary goth style are found in the Victorian cult of mourning.\" Valerie Steele is an expert in the history of the style.\n\nGoth fashion can be recognized by its stark black clothing. Ted Polhemus described goth fashion as a \"profusion of black velvets, lace, fishnets and leather tinged with scarlet or purple, accessorized with tightly laced corsets, gloves, precarious stilettos and silver jewelry depicting religious or occult themes\".\n\nNancy Kilpatrick's \"Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined\" defines \"poseur\" for the goth scene as follows: \"goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd (...)\". Kilpatrick contributor \"Daoine O'\" denigrates poseur goths as 'Batbabies' whose clothing is bought at [mall store] Hot Topic with their parents' money\".\n\nOne female role model is Theda Bara, the 1910s femme fatale known for her dark eyeshadow. Siouxsie Sioux was particularly influential on the dress style of the Gothic rock scene; Paul Morley of \"NME\" described Siouxsie and the Banshees' 1980 gig at Futurama: \"[Siouxsie was] modeling her newest outfit, the one that will influence how all the girls dress over the next few months. About half the girls at Leeds had used Sioux as a basis for their appearance, hair to ankle.\" Robert Smith, Musidora, Bela Lugosi, Bettie Page, Vampira, Morticia Addams, Nico, Rozz Williams, David Bowie, Lux Interior, Dave Vanian, are also style icons. The 1980s established designers such as Drew Bernstein of Lip Service, while the 1990s saw a surge of US-based gothic fashion designers, many of whom continue to evolve the style through the current day. Style magazines such as Gothic Beauty have given repeat features to a select few gothic fashion designers who began their labels in the 1990s, such as Kambriel, Rose Mortem, and Tyler Ondine of Heavy Red. Influential goth models include Wednesday Mourning, Adora BatBrat and Lady Amaranth.\n\nIn 1977, Karl Lagerfeld hosted the Soirée Moratoire Noir party, specifying \"tenue tragique noire absolument obligatoire\" (black tragic dress absolutely required). The event included elements associated with leatherman style.\n\nGoth fashion has a reciprocal relationship with the fashion world. In the later part of the first decade of the 21st century, designers such as Alexander McQueen, Anna Sui, Rick Owens, Gareth Pugh, Ann Demeulemeester, Philipp Plein, Hedi Slimane, John Richmond, John Galliano, Olivier Theyskens and Yohji Yamamoto brought elements of goth to runways. This was described as \"Haute Goth\" by Cintra Wilson in the \"New York Times\". Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix have also been associated with a gothic style. In Spring 2004, Riccardo Tisci, Jean Paul Gaultier, Raf Simons and Stefano Pilati dressed their models as \"glamorous ghouls dressed in form-fitting suits and coal-tinted cocktail dresses\". Swedish designer Helena Horstedt and jewelry artist Hanna Hedman also practice a goth aesthetic.\n\nGothic lolita, sometimes shortened to in Japanese, is a combination of Gothic and lolita fashions. The fashion originated in the late 1990s in Harajuku.\n\nGothic lolita fashion is characterized by darker make-up and clothing. Red lipstick and smokey or neatly defined eyes, created using black eyeliner, are typical styles, although as with all lolita sub-styles the look remains fairly natural. Though Gothic make-up has been associated with a white-powdered face, this is usually considered poor taste within the (largely Japanese) lolita fashion scene.\n\nBrands which exemplify the Gothic lolita style include Atelier-Pierrot, Atelier Boz, Black Peace Now, H. Naoto Blood and Moi-même-Moitié. Author and TV Host La Carmina is a popular model of Gothic lolita fashion.\n\nAristocrat is a type of Japanese street fashion, championed by the visual kei rock musician Mana with his fashion label Moi-même-Moitié, and influenced by gothic and Neo-Victorian fashions. A typical outfit will combine elements of fetish wear with Victorian and sometimes steampunk fashions, including tight pants, velvet sportcoats, top hats, cravats, corsets, ankle length skirts, lace petticoats, and the frilly pirate shirts previously popularised by the New Romantics of the 1980s.\n\nThe Cybergoth and rivethead subcultures emerged in America during the late 1990s, and combined classic gothic fashions such as leather duster coats, tripp pants or Demonia brand platform boots with the clothing worn by fans of industrial metal and rave music to create a dystopian, futuristic science fiction look. Shaved heads, synthetic neon dreadlocks, camouflage, tight leather pants, chains, platform boots, stretched body piercings, sleeve tattoos, goggles, corsets, PVC or leather skirts, and black trenchcoats decorated with metal studs are frequently seen on members of this subculture.\n\n"}

It portrays Crimean Tatar test pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union Amet-khan Sultan against the background of the 1944 deportation of the Crimean Tatars. The title of the film means \"Return\".\n\nProduction of the film began in October 2012 in Crimea. The initial budget for the film was US$2.5 million. The funds were provided by Lenur İslâm, owner of Ukrainian television station ATR Channel. Much expenditure was devoted to scenic design and costume design. A preview of the film was released on March 2013. The premiere was scheduled for 18 May 2013, the 69th anniversary of the deportations; Sultan's granddaughter, Soviet Air Force pilots, and ambassadors of foreign countries were invited to attend.\n\nThe \"Kyiv Post\" gave a positive review, describing \"Haytarma\" as a \"must-see for history enthusiasts\". In Simferopol, the Kosmos Cinema estimates that six thousand people saw the film in the first week, and one thousand per day by 4 June; the cinema had begun with just two screenings per day, but added two additional ones in response to the unexpected popularity. It was screened at the International Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival in October 2013. It was one of three films which made the Ukraine Oscar selection committee's shortlist to be submitted as a nominee in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 86th Academy Awards.\n\nRussian Consul in Simferopol Vladimir Andreyev provoked public controversy for his comments that the film \"distorts the truth\" with its failure to mention alleged collaborationism by Crimean Tatars during Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine. Members of the public took offence, and on 23 May 2013 about 300 people held a protest outside the consulate demanding that Andreyev be declared \"persona non grata\", while the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described Andreyev's remarks as \"inappropriate\". Andreyev initially stood by his remarks and refused to retract them, but the following day the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also described Andreyev's words as inappropriate and incorrect.\n"}
{"id": "214829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214829", "title": "International Gothic", "text": "International Gothic\n\n<includeonly></includeonly>\nInternational Gothic is a period of Gothic art which began in Burgundy, France, and northern Italy in the late 14th and early 15th century. It then spread very widely across Western Europe, hence the name for the period, which was introduced by the French art historian Louis Courajod at the end of the 19th century.\n\nArtists and portable works, such as illuminated manuscripts, travelled widely around the continent, leading to a common aesthetic among the royalty and higher nobility and considerably reducing the variation in national styles among works produced for the courtly elites. The main influences were northern France, the Netherlands, the Duchy of Burgundy, the Imperial court in Prague, and Italy. Royal marriages such as that between Richard II of England and Anne of Bohemia helped to spread the style.\n\nIt was initially a style of courtly sophistication, but somewhat more robust versions spread to art commissioned by the emerging mercantile classes and the smaller nobility. In Northern Europe \"Late Gothic\" continuations of the style, especially in its decorative elements, could still be found until the early 16th century, as no alternative decorative vocabulary emerged locally to replace it before Renaissance revival of Classicism. \nUsage of the terms by art historians varies somewhat, with some using the term more restrictively than others. Some art historians feel the term is \"in many ways ... not very helpful ... since it tends to skate over both differences and details of transmission.\"\n\nThe important Bohemian version of the style developed in the court of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor in Prague, which for a brief period became a leading force in the development of European art. Charles came from the Luxembourg dynasty, was tutored by the future Pope Clement VI, and as a youth spent seven years at the French court, as well as visiting Italy twice. This and family relationships gave him intimate links with the various courts of France, including that of the Avignon Papacy, and from 1363 the separate Valois Duchy of Burgundy under Philip the Bold. The Bohemian style initially lacked the elongated figures of other centres, but had a richness and sweetness in female figures that were very influential. Charles had at least one Italian altarpiece, apparently made in Italy and sent to Prague, near where it remains today in his showpiece Karlštejn Castle. For St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, he first used a French architect, and then the German Peter Parler.\n\nMuch of the development of the style occurred in Italy, and it probably spread north of the Alps to influence France partly through the colony of Italian artists attached to the Papal Court at Avignon, and the works displayed from the residence there in the 1330s and 1340s of Simone Martini, a Sienese precursor of the style. Republican Siena had a large influence on the development of the style, but kept to its own dignified Gothic style throughout the period, and afterwards, while the flamboyant Visconti court at Milan, also closely related to the French royal family, was the most important Italian centre of the courtly style. As the style developed in Northern Europe, Italian artists were in turn influenced by it.\n\nThe marriage in 1384 between the young King Richard II of England and Charles IV's daughter Anne of Bohemia helped to connect Prague and London, and bring the style to England, although Anne died in 1394.\n\nA number of central works of International Gothic work are votive portraits of monarchs with a sacred figure – in some cases being received into Heaven by them, as with a miniature of Jean, Duc de Berry, and some of his relatives, being welcomed by Saint Peter in the \"Grandes Heures du Duc de Berry\". From this period come the earliest surviving panel portraits of monarchs, and royal manuscripts show a greatly increased number of realistic portraits of the monarch who commissioned them.\n\nIn architecture, where the style was long-lasting, local varieties of it are often known as Perpendicular architecture in England, and as Sondergotik in Germany and Central Europe, Flamboyant Gothic in France, and later the Manueline in Portugal, and the Isabelline in Spain.\n\nIn painting and sculpture, the style is sometimes known in German as the \"Schöne Stil\" or \"Weicher Stil\" (\"Beautiful style\" or \"Soft style\"). Stylistic features are a dignified elegance, which replaces monumentality, along with rich decorative colouring, elongated figures and flowing lines. It also makes a more practised use of perspective, modelling, and setting. Figures begin to be given more space in their settings, and interest is taken in realistically depicted plants and animals. In some works, above all the famous calendar scenes of the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the beginnings of real landscape painting are seen. Decoration became increasingly ornate as the style developed in Northern Europe, whereas in Italy the increased sophistication of figure painting was absorbed into Early Renaissance painting.\n\nIn sculpture the leading Italian artists remained closer to classicism, and were less affected by the movement; Lorenzo Ghiberti is in many respects close to the style, but already seems infused with Early Renaissance classicism. Claus Sluter was the leading sculptor in Burgundy, and was one artist able to use the style with a strongly monumental effect. Most sculptors are unknown, and the style tended to survive longer in Northern sculpture than painting, as the detailed realism of Early Netherlandish painting was harder to translate into sculpture. Smaller painted wood figures, most often of the Madonna, were significant, and being relatively portable, probably helped to disseminate the style across Europe.\nNotable painters included Master Theoderic and the Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece in Bohemia, the Master of the Parement, Jacquemart de Hesdin and the Netherlandish Limbourg brothers in France, and Gentile da Fabriano, Lorenzo Monaco and Pisanello in Italy, the last taking the style into the Early Renaissance. In Burgundy Jean Malouel, Melchior Broederlam and Henri Bellechose were succeeded by Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck who took Early Netherlandish painting in the direction of greater illusionism. Master Bertram and Conrad von Soest were leading regional masters in Germany, working largely for city burghers. Surviving panel paintings of the best quality from before 1390 are very rare except from Italy and the Prague court. Many of these artists moved between countries or regions during their careers, exposing them to the styles of other centres. In particular Broederlam had spent some years in Italy, and it has been speculated that the Master of the Parement was himself Bohemian, as his known French works are very few, and extremely close to Bohemian art.\n\nIlluminated manuscripts remained important vehicles of the style, and in works like the Sherborne Missal were the main English contribution, apart from the stained glass of John Thornton in York Minster and of Thomas Glazier in Oxford and elsewhere. Nottingham alabaster carvings, produced in considerable quantities by workshops to standard patterns, were exported all over Western Europe to value-conscious parish churches. The Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti from Milan was a key work, as was the Wenceslas Bible (with the text in German) of Charles IV's son. Both, like the Sherborne Missal, are marked by extravagantly decorated borders. John, Duke of Berry, son and brother of French kings, was the most extravagant commissioner of manuscripts, and the main employer of the Limbourg Brothers and Jacquemart de Hesdin, as well as using many other artists. Other large-scale collectors included Wenceslas, the son of Charles IV, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, son of Henry IV of England and \"Regent\" of English-occupied France, and the Dukes of Burgundy. In the fifteenth century the cities of Flanders, especially Bruges, came to outstrip Paris as a centre of both manuscript illumination and panel painting.\n\nA further vehicle of the International Gothic style was provided by the tapestry-weaving centers of Arras, Tournai and Paris, where tapestry production was permanently disordered by the English occupation of 1418–36. Under the consistent patronage of the Dukes of Burgundy, their courtly International Gothic style, elongated figures, rich details of attire, crowded composition, with figures disposed in tiers, owe their inspiration to manuscript illuminators and directly to painters: Baudouin de Bailleul, a painter established at Arras, supplied cartoons for tapestry workshops there and at Tournai, where elements of a local style are hard to distinguish (Weigert, p. 44). The Chatsworth \"Hunts\" (Victoria and Albert Museum) are inspired by Gaston de Foix's book on hunting and the many weavings of Trojan War cycles by contemporary romances.\n\nTapestry too was an art that was portable. Suites accompanied their seigneurial owners from one unheated and empty château to another. Tapestry weavers themselves could be induced to move workshops, though they remained tied to the accessibility of English wool. Religious and secular subjects vied in this essentially secular art.\n\nA medium of Late Gothic style that is easily overlooked because it has virtually entirely disappeared is that of painted hangings, which served as a less expensive substitute for woven hangings but could be produced, with appropriate themes, on short notice.\n\nIn a period lasting approximately between 1390 and 1420 there was a particularly close correspondence between works produced far apart in Europe. In the north the miniatures of the \"Très Riches Heures\" Limbourg brothers, in Italy the \"Adoration of the Magi\" of Lorenzo Monaco, and sculpture and miniatures in many countries show very stylised tall figures, the older men with imposingly long beards and swaying figures. Exotic clothes, based loosely on those of the contemporary Middle East or Byzantine Empire, are worn by figures in biblical scenes; many figures seem to be included just to show off these costumes. The number of figures in many standard religious scenes is greatly increased; the Magi have large retinues, and the Crucifixion often becomes a crowded event. This innovation was to survive the style itself.\nThe unveiling of Gentile da Fabriano's \"Adoration of the Magi\" (below) in Florence in 1423, \"the culminating work of International Gothic painting\", was almost immediately followed by the painting of the Brancacci Chapel by Masolino and Masaccio (1424–26), which was recognised as a breakthrough to a new style. In similar fashion the Limbourg brothers' masterpiece the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry was followed within a few years by the Turin-Milan Hours, a continuation of a manuscript started decades before by the Parement Master for the Duke of Berry, which despite a Gothic framework pioneered a very different style of painting.\n\nBut outside Florence and the leading courts the International Gothic still held sway, gradually developing in directions that once again diverged considerably between Italy and Europe north of the Alps. The arts and architecture transitioned into the Early Renaissance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1240005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1240005", "title": "Irish art", "text": "Irish art\n\nThe history of Irish art starts around 3200 BC with Neolithic stone carvings at the Newgrange megalithic tomb, part of the Brú na Bóinne complex, County Meath. In early-Bronze Age Ireland there is evidence of Beaker culture and a widespread metalworking. Trade-links with Britain and Northern Europe introduced La Tène culture and Celtic art to Ireland by about 300 BC, but while these styles later changed or disappeared under the Roman subjugation, Ireland was left alone to develop Celtic designs: notably Celtic crosses, spiral designs, and the intricate interlaced patterns of Celtic knotwork.\nThe Christianization of Ireland in the fifth century AD saw the establishment of monasteries, which acted as centres of scholarship, and led to the flowering of the Insular art style with its highly decorative illuminated manuscripts, metalwork and stonework (High crosses). From around 1200 to 1700, however, Irish art was relatively stagnant, and Irish culture was left comparatively untouched by the influence of Renaissance art.\n\nFrom the late 17th century, talented artists began to emerge in the fields of fine art, particularly the painting of portraiture and landscapes. The early 18th century saw increased prosperity and establishment of new cultural institutions including the Royal Dublin Society (1731) and Royal Irish Academy (1785). In the Victorian era, with a lack of patronage and better opportunities to be found abroad, many Irish artists emigrated to London (portraitists) or Paris (landscapists), which stifled the nascent indigenous scene. By the dawn of the 20th century, things began to improve. Opportunities began to spring up at home; the Celtic Revival movement saw a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture, Hugh Lane established the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art, the first public gallery of its kind in the world, and with increased patronage a new generation of homegrown talent and returning emigres gradually formed a solid basis for the regrowth of art in Ireland. The foundation of an independent Irish State in the early 1920s did not lead to vast improvement in the state of Irelands' visual arts; in the years following Independence, the arts establishment (exemplified by the committee of the Royal Hibernian Academy) was dominated by traditionalists who steadfastly opposed attempts to bring Irish art into line with modern European styles.\n\nIrish gold personal ornaments began to be produced within about 200 years either side of 2000 BC, especially in the thin crescent-shaped disks known as lunulae, which was probably first made in Ireland, where over eighty of the hundred odd known examples were found. A range of thin decorated gold discs, bands and plaques, often with pin-holes, were probably attached to clothing, and objects that appear to be earrings have also been found. By around 1400–1000 BC, heavier thin torcs and bangles have been found. The Late Bronze Age of 900–600 BC saw the peak of the surviving Irish prehistoric goldsmithing, with superbly worked pieces in simple but very sophisticated designs, notably in a type of dress-fastener that looks like a double-ended trumpet curved round so that the two bell mouths are roughly pointing in the same direction. There are also a series of grand gold collars, representing a development of the lunula, with round plates at either end, and a broad corrugated \"U\"-shaped body, decorated geometrically along the ridges and troughs of the corrugations. Goldwork all but disappears in the Iron Age, except for the late and enigmatic Broighter Hoard of the 1st century BC, which appears to mix local and Roman pieces.\n\nAlthough Ireland tends to be strongly associated in the popular mind with Celtic art, the early Continental style of Hallstatt style never reached Ireland, and the succeeding La Tène style reached Ireland very late, perhaps from about 300 BC, and has left relatively few remains, which are often described by art historians together with their British contemporaries as \"Insular Celtic\". Buried ironwork does not last long in Irish conditions, and gold is very rare, so the survivals are normally in bronze. The Petrie Crown, Loughnashade Trumpet and a series of discs whose function is mysterious are among the most striking pieces. The decoration on a number of bronze scabbards, many found in the River Bann, have inspired much discussion, as they seem close to other pieces from as far away as Hungary, and the possibility of an immigrant master has been raised. The National Museum of Ireland in Dublin holds the majority of major finds from the whole prehistoric period, with others in the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the British Museum in London.\n\nIn Ireland, \"La Tène ornamented material from the third to fifth centuries AD is difficult to demonstrate [from Ireland]\". In the 6th to 8th centuries the art of the newly Christianised Irish mixed with Mediterranean and Germanic traditions through Irish missionary contacts with the Anglo-Saxons, creating what is called Insular art (or the Hiberno-Saxon style) and such masterpieces as the Book of Kells, the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, the most spectacular of about fifty elaborate Celtic brooches in precious metal that have been found. The stone high cross was a distinctive insular type of monument, of which many examples survive. Later in the period, Scandinavian influences were added through the Vikings. These earlier styles largely came to an end with the Norman invasion of 1169–1170 and the subsequent wide adoption of Romanesque art. Through the Gothic and Renaissance periods Irish art was essentially a regional variation of wider European styles, with many works imported from England or further afield, and some English artists and craftsmen active in Ireland. Many objects of a distinctively Irish form from the first millennium, such as bell or book shrine reliquaries, were renovated or repaired in the contemporary style.\n\nThe visual arts were slow to develop in Early Modern Ireland, due to political disruption, and the lack of patrons in either government, the church, and wealthy resident landowners or business class interested in art. Yet beginning in the late 17th century, Irish painting began to develop, especially in portraiture and landscape painting. These painters typically looked outside Ireland for influence, training and clients who were wealthy enough to afford the purchase of art. For example, Walter Frederick Osborne developed his open air painting in France whereas Sir William Orpen studied in London. However, what is now the National College of Art and Design in Dublin has existed since founded as the Dublin Art School in 1746. Its founder Robert West had studied drawing and painting at the French Academy under François Boucher and Jean-Baptiste van Loo.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century a climate of cultural resurgence and nationalist ideals contributed to the development of an Irish style. A revived interest in the Irish language and Celtic history prompted a revival in the Irish visual arts as well. Belfast born Sir John Lavery may be the most internationally known painter of this generation. He trained in Glasgow and France, but unlike Orpen, maintained close ties to his native land. In 1928 he was commissioned to paint the symbol of Éire which would be used as the central image on the bank note of the new Irish Free State. Other paintings embodied the call for independence, such as Beatrice Elvery's \"Éire of 1907\" which depicts the history of Irish Catholicism with the still-nascent Irish Republic.\n\nEarly Irish masters include: Garret Morphey, Robert Carver, George Barrett, Sr., James Barry, Hugh Douglas Hamilton. The Irish impressionists included Roderic O'Conor and Walter Osborne, with other landscape artists: Augustus Nicholas Burke, Susanna Drury, Paul Henry, Nick Miller, and Pat Harris.\n\nNotable Irish sculptors have included Jerome Connor, John Henry Foley, Augustus Saint-Gaudens (born in Dublin, but emigrated to America at six months old), Mary Redmond, John Behan and Oliver Sheppard. Edward Delaney, Rachel Joynt, and Rowan Gillespie are contemporary sculptors. Harry Clarke, Sarah Purser and Evie Hone worked in stained glass.\n\nPortraitists have included Daniel Maclise, John Lavery, William Orpen (both these War Artists in WWI), John Butler Yeats (father of Jack and William Butler), and Henry Jones Thaddeus.\n\nApart from Francis Bacon, who left Ireland as a young man, the best-known 20th-century Irish artist was Jack Yeats, brother of the poet, also with an individual style that is hard to classify. The art of Seán Keating was poised between Social Realism and Romanticism, and addressed public and political themes in an emerging nation.\n\nIrish Modernism began with Mainie Jellett, with later participants being The White Stag group, The Exhibition of Living Art, Norah McGuinness, Louis le Brocquy, Patrick Scott, Patrick Swift, and John Kingerlee. Abstract expressionists included Tony O'Malley, Nano Reid, Patrick Collins (painter)) Kevin Samuel Murphy\n\nIn Northern Ireland notable artists have included John Luke, Colin Middleton, William Scott, Neil Shawcross, Gladys Maccabe (artist), Basil Blackshaw\n\nIreland's best known living artists include Brian O'Doherty an art historian, sculptor, and conceptual artist who is based in New York City, Sean Scully an abstract painter who lives and works in New York City, Dorothy Cross, a sculptor and filmmaker and James Coleman, an installation and video artist. Robert Ballagh, Willie Doherty, and Sean Hillen also work in modern media.\n\nInterest in collecting Irish art has expanded rapidly with the economic expansion of the country, primarily focussing on investment in early twentieth century painters. Support for young Irish artists is still relatively minor compared to their European counterparts, as the Arts Council's focus has been on improving infrastructure and professionalism in venues.\n\nAn exhibition called 'The Art of a Nation: Irish Works from the Allied Irish Bank and Crawford Art Gallery Collection' was held between 13–31 May 2015 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London. It celebrated the story of Irish art from 1890s to the present day and included important works by Aloysius O'Kelly, Sir William Orpen, Jack B Yeats, William Scott, Sean Scully and Hughie O'Donoghue. Admission to the exhibition was free and a fully illustrated catalogue was for sale.\n\n\nNorthern Ireland has a significant tradition of political mural painting, from both the loyalist and republican standpoints.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16340", "title": "Jean-Paul Sartre", "text": "Jean-Paul Sartre\n\nJean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (, ; ; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist, biographer, and literary critic. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology, and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism. His work has also influenced sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies, and continues to influence these disciplines.\n\nSartre was also noted for his open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer Simone de Beauvoir. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the cultural and social assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered bourgeois, in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive conformity (\"mauvaise foi\", literally, \"bad faith\") and an \"authentic\" way of \"being\" became the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work \"Being and Nothingness\" (\"L'Être et le Néant\", 1943). Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work \"Existentialism Is a Humanism\" (\"L'existentialisme est un humanisme\", 1946), originally presented as a lecture.\n\nHe was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honours and that \"a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution\".\n\nJean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in Paris as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the French Navy, and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer). His mother was of Alsatian origin and the first cousin of Nobel Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer, whose father Louis Théophile was the younger brother of Anne-Marie's father.\nWhen Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in Indochina. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents' house in Meudon, where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to classical literature at a very early age. When he was twelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to La Rochelle, where he was frequently bullied.\n\nAs a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading Henri Bergson's essay \"\". He attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school in Paris. He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his \"\" (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) in Paris at the École Normale Supérieure, an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals. (His 1928 MA thesis under the title \"L'Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature\" [\"Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature\"] was supervised by Henri Delacroix.) It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with Raymond Aron. Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was his weekly attendance at Alexandre Kojève's seminars, which continued for a number of years.\n\nFrom his first years in the École Normale, Sartre was one of its fiercest pranksters. In 1927, his antimilitarist satirical cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with Georges Canguilhem, particularly upset the director Gustave Lanson. In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland, he organized a media prank following Charles Lindbergh's successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre & Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree. Many newspapers, including \"Le Petit Parisien,\" announced the event on 25 May. Thousands, including journalists and curious spectators, showed up, unaware that what they were witnessing was a stunt involving a Lindbergh look-alike. The public's resultant outcry forced Lanson to resign.\n\nIn 1929 at the École Normale, he met Simone de Beauvoir, who studied at the Sorbonne and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship, though they were not monogamous. The first time Sartre took the agrégation, he failed. He took it a second time and virtually tied for first place with Beauvoir, although Sartre was eventually awarded first place, with Beauvoir second.\n\nSartre was drafted into the French Army from 1929 to 1931 and served as a meteorologist for some time. He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the Algerian War of Independence.\n\nFrom 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various lycées of Le Havre (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day , 1931–36), Laon (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the Lycée Pasteur, 1937–39, and at the Lycée Condorcet, 1941–44; see below).\n\nIn 1932, Sartre discovered \"Voyage au bout de la nuit\" by Louis-Ferdinand Céline, a book that had a remarkable influence on him.\n\nIn 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the Institut français d'Allemagne in Berlin where he studied Edmund Husserl's phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read Emmanuel Levinas's \"Théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl\" (\"The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology\").\n\nThe Neo-Hegelian revival led by Alexandre Kojève and Jean Hyppolite in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\".\n\nIn 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army, where he served as a meteorologist. He was captured by German troops in 1940 in Padoux, and he spent nine months as a prisoner of war—in Nancy and finally in , Trier, where he wrote his first theatrical piece, \"Barionà, fils du tonnerre\", a drama concerning Christmas. It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\", later to become a major influence on his own essay on phenomenological ontology. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and exotropia affected his balance) Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist. Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris, settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position at Lycée Condorcet in Paris, replacing a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by Vichy law.\nAfter coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group \"Socialisme et Liberté\" (\"Socialism and Liberty\") with other writers Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Toussaint Desanti, Dominique Desanti, Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with \"cheerful ferocity\" at a meeting that the \"Socialisme et Liberté\" assassinate prominent war collaborators like Marcel Déat, but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as \"none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades\". The British historian Ian Ousby observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General Otto von Stülpnagel, and the popular slogan always was \"Death to Laval!\" rather than \"Death to Hitler!\". In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of André Gide and André Malraux. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. \"Socialisme et liberté\" soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote \"Being and Nothingness\", \"The Flies\", and \"No Exit\", none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.\n\nIn his essay \"Paris under the Occupation\", Sartre wrote about the \"correct\" behavior of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural, writing:\n\nThe Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.\n\nSartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark \"We could not be \"natural\"\". French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation. Ousby wrote: \"But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life\". Sartre wrote the very \"correctness\" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the \"correct\" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the \"New Order in Europe\", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.\n\nThroughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany. Sartre wrote about the \"languid existence\" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing about how: \"Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life\". Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvior living in Anjou. The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat. Sartre also remarked on conversations at the Café de Flore between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a \"mouche\" (informer) or a writer of the \"corbeau\" (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no-one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship. Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the \"Abwehr\" alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as \"mouches\" while by 1942 the Paris \"Kommandantur\" was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the \"corbeaux\".\n\nSartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a \"sham\", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone. Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris \"was peopled by the absent\". Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation writing about how:\n\nOne day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it. If the \"concierge\" forced the door, you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words\" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].\n\nSartre wrote the \"feldgrau\" (\"field grey\") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called \"a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians\". Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans \"les autres\" (\"the others\"), which inspired Sartre's aphorism in his play \"Huis clos\" (\"No Exit\") of \"l'enfer, c'est les Autres\" (\"Hell is other people\"). Sartre intended the line \"l'enfer, c'est les Autres\" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.\n\nAfter August 1944 and the Liberation of Paris, he wrote \"Anti-Semite and Jew\". In the book he tries to explain the etiology of \"hate\" by analyzing antisemitic hate. Sartre was a very active contributor to \"Combat\", a newspaper created during the clandestine period by Albert Camus, a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus's \"The Rebel\". Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant Vladimir Jankelevitch criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.\n\nIn 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the rue Bonaparte which was where he was to produce most of his subsequent work, and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political review, \"Les Temps modernes\" (\"Modern Times\"), in part to popularize his thought. He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, \"Les Chemins de la Liberté\" (\"The Roads to Freedom\") (1945–1949).\n\nThe first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the Resistance after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the \"résistants\" were a \"band of brothers\" who had enjoyed \"real freedom\" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war. Sartre was \"merciless\" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer Robert Brasillach from being executed. His 1948 play \"Les mains sales\" (\"Dirty Hands\") in particular explored the problem of being a politically \"engaged\" intellectual. He embraced Marxism but did not join the Communist Party. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as \"provincial\" and in a 1949 essay called for a \"United States of Europe\". In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal \"Politique étrangère\", Sartre wrote: \n\nIf we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.\n\nAbout the Korean War, Sartre wrote: \"I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans\". In July 1950, Sartre wrote in \"Les Temps Modernes\" about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:\n\nAs we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.\n\nSartre held that the Soviet Union was a \"revolutionary\" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of \"bourgeois\" states were due to their innate shortcomings. The Swiss journalist François Bondy wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews \"a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary\" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges \"may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power\", deeming Sartre's position to be \"existentialist\".\n\nWhile a Marxist, Sartre attacked what he saw as abuses of freedom and human rights by the Soviet Union. In 1954, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a \"complete freedom of criticism\" while condemning the United States for sinking into \"prefascism\". Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union \"still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books\". He was one of the first French journalists to expose the existence of the labor camps, and vehemently opposed the invasion of Hungary, Russian anti-Semitism, and the execution of dissidents. About the Hungarian revolt of 1956, Sartre wrote: \"In spite of everything, the Rakosi regime stood for socialization. Only it did it badly and that is worse than not to do so at all\". Sartre came to admire the Polish leader Władysław Gomułka, a man who favored a \"Polish road to socialism\" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue. Sartre's newspaper \"Les Temps Modernes\" devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms. Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sarte's \"ultra Bolshevism\" as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader Mao Zedong as the man who lead the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.\n\nAs an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the FLN in the Algerian War and was one of the signatories of the \"Manifeste des 121\". Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary Organisation armée secrète (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s. (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and, along with Bertrand Russell and others, organized a tribunal intended to expose U.S. war crimes, which became known as the Russell Tribunal in 1967.\nHis work after Stalin's death, the \"Critique de la raison dialectique\" (\"Critique of Dialectical Reason\"), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the \"Critique\" Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of \"class\" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, Louis Althusser, who claimed that the ideas of the young Marx were decisively superseded by the \"scientific\" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by Frantz Fanon stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the \"real damned of the earth\", who would carry out the revolution. A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the \"Americanization\" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.\n\nSartre went to Cuba in the 1960s to meet Fidel Castro and spoke with Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be \"not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age\" and the \"era's most perfect man\". Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that \"he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel\". However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro's régime, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: \"In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals\".\n\nDuring a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited Red Army Faction leader Andreas Baader in Stammheim Prison and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment. Towards the end of his life, Sartre became an anarchist.\n\nIn 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, \"Les Mots\" (\"The Words\"). The book is an ironic counterblast to Marcel Proust, whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of André Gide (who had provided the model of \"littérature engagée\" for Sartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize, and remains one of only two laureates to do so. According to Lars Gyllensten, in the book \"Minnen, bara minnen\" (\"Memories, Only Memories\") published in 2000, Sartre himself or someone close to him got in touch with the Swedish Academy in 1975 with a request for the prize money, but was refused. In 1945, he had refused the Légion d'honneur. The Nobel prize was announced on 22 October 1964; on 14 October, Sartre had written a letter to the Nobel Institute, asking to be removed from the list of nominees, and warning that he would not accept the prize if awarded, but the letter went unread; on 23 October, \"Le Figaro\" published a statement by Sartre explaining his refusal. He said he did not wish to be \"transformed\" by such an award, and did not want to take sides in an East vs. West cultural struggle by accepting an award from a prominent Western cultural institution. Nevertheless he was that year's prizewinner. After being awarded the prize he tried to escape the media by hiding in the house of Simone's sister Hélène de Beauvoir in Goxwiller, Alsace.\nThough his name was then a household word (as was \"existentialism\" during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the May 1968 strikes in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for civil disobedience. President Charles de Gaulle intervened and pardoned him, commenting that \"you don't arrest Voltaire\".\n\nIn 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:\n\nI would like <nowiki>[people]</nowiki> to remember \"Nausea\", <nowiki>[my plays]</nowiki> \"No Exit\" and \"The Devil and the Good Lord,\" and then my two philosophical works, more particularly the second one, \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\". Then my essay on Genet, \"Saint Genet\". ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.\n\nSartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of amphetamine) he put himself through during the writing of the \"Critique\" and a massive analytical biography of Gustave Flaubert (\"The Family Idiot\"), both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension, and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious chain smoker, which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.\n\nSartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from edema of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at Père-Lachaise Cemetery between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at Montparnasse Cemetery. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto Boulevard Montparnasse to accompany Sartre's cortege. The funeral started at \"the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet\". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate. Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.\n\nSartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are \"condemned to be free\". This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the paper cutter. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: \"existence precedes essence\". This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. \"We are left alone, without excuse.\" \"We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us.\"\n\nSartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience \"death consciousness\" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge. Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world. In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence.\n\nAs a junior lecturer at the Lycée du Havre in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel \"La Nausée\" (\"Nausea\"), which serves in some ways as a manifesto of existentialism and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the German phenomenological movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.\n\nHe also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: \"Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances.\"\n\nThis indifference of \"things in themselves\" (closely linked with the later notion of \"being-in-itself\" in his \"Being and Nothingness\") has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the \"nausea\" referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom. The book takes the term from Friedrich Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.\n\nThe novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of Immanuel Kant's fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that morality is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying \"Condemned to be free\") as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.\n\nAlso important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions. \"When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself.\"\n\nWhile the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45. Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: \"Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined <nowiki>[with]</nowiki> women. He wrote. And he was published.\" Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where \"the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out\".\n\nSartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in \"The Age of Reason\", which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute rationalist, analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could \"recognize no allegiance except to [him]self\", though he realized that without \"responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing\". Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the Spanish Civil War, and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.\n\nThe war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: \"the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time.\" Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the \"Socialisme et Liberté\" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group, in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this \"crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature\".\n\nThe symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, \"Les Temps modernes\", in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment. Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.\n\nSartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a public intellectual. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true existential fashion, \"culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention.\" This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a pragmatist, willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in human freedom, preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work \"subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines\". Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: \"the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world.\"\n\nSartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the French Communist Party (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the Liberation the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism. From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its \"authoritarian tendencies\". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the Maoists, a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties. However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: \"If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist.\" He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.\n\nIn the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which \"reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there\". The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the \"traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior\", but there is \"a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced\" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of bourgeois political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.\n\nThe struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.\n\nThe role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics. In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian self-determination at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from Oran, Algeria.\n\nSartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, \"Huis-clos\" (\"No Exit\"), contains the famous line \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\", usually translated as \"Hell is other people.\" Aside from the impact of \"Nausea\", Sartre's major work of fiction was \"The Roads to Freedom\" trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, \"Roads to Freedom\" presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to existentialism.\n\nJohn Huston got Sartre to script his film \"\". However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits. Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in the finished film.\nDespite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the Roman Catholic Church placed Sartre's oeuvre on the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (List of Prohibited Books).\n\nSome philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory. Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. Herbert Marcuse criticized \"Being and Nothingness\" for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: \"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it hypostatizes specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory.\" In \"Letter on Humanism\", Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:\n\nExistentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking \"existentia\" and \"essentia\" according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that \"essentia\" precedes \"existentia\". Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.\n\nThe philosophers Richard Wollheim and Thomas Baldwin have argued that Sartre's attempt to show that Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud. Richard Webster considers Sartre one of many modern thinkers who have reconstructed Judaeo-Christian orthodoxies in secular form.\n\nIntellectuals associated with the political right allege that Sartre's politics are indicative of authoritarianism. Brian C. Anderson denounced Sartre as an apologist for tyranny and terror and a supporter of Stalinism, Maoism, and Castro's regime in Cuba. The historian Paul Johnson asserted that Sartre's ideas had inspired the Khmer Rouge leadership: \"The events in Cambodia in the 1970s, in which between one-fifth and one-third of the nation was starved to death or murdered, were entirely the work of a group of intellectuals, who were for the most part pupils and admirers of Jean-Paul Sartre – 'Sartre's Children' as I call them.\"\n\nSartre, who stated in his preface to Frantz Fanon's \"The Wretched of the Earth\" that, \"To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man,\" has been criticized by Anderson and Michael Walzer for supporting the killing of European civilians by the FLN during the Algerian War. Walzer suggests that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.\n\nThe critic, poet, essayist and philosopher Clive James excoriated Sartre in his book of mini biographies \"Cultural Amnesia\" (2007). James attacks Sartre's philosophy as being \"all a pose\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The theme is of beautiful women seen through different woven materials. Three prints from the series are known; whether there were more is unknown.\n\nUkiyo-e art flourished in Japan during the Edo period from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects courtesans, kabuki actors, and others associated with the \"floating world\" lifestyle of the pleasure districts. Alongside paintings, mass-produced woodblock prints were a major form of the genre. In the mid-18th century full-colour ' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour. A prominent genre was ' (\"pictures of beauties\"), which depicted most often courtesans and geisha at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts.\n\nKitagawa Utamaro (–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his \"bijin ōkubi-e\" (\"large-headed pictures of beautiful women\") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors. Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background. Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.\n\nThe series was published in by Tsutaya Jūzaburō. It is not known how many were in the series; three are known, of which very few copies are known. The bear the seal \"Utamaro hitsu\" (, \"the brush of Utamaro\").\n\nThe prints are untitled, and variations of the titles that follow exist in both English and Japanese.\n\nThe series theme is of beautiful women seen through translucent woven materials. Two women appear in each print, one in front and one behind and seen through the translucent materials. \"Kasumi-ori\" (, \"mist-woven\") is a neologism Utamaro uses to refer to materials woven so that they can be seen through unclearly, as in a mist. The translucent effect in the prints required the highest level of skill from their carvers and careful moderation of the \"baren\" burnishing tool by the printers.\n\nIn \"Kachō\" (, \"Mosquito net\", the same characters also pronounced \"kaya\"), a woman peers through a light yellowish-green mosquito net of thin silk gauze, an item of great luxury at the time; commoners made such nets of hemp or cotton. The woman wears a in a \"\" tie-dyed komono patterned with scattered circles. From above hang two \"hoso-obi\" sashes, one red and the other violet. This is the only print in the series in which the woman face each other; they appear to be in conversation.\n\nIn \"Sudare\" (, \"Reed screen\"), woman dressed as a daughter of a high-ranking samurai family sits behind a luxurious \"sudare\" reed screen hemmed with a flower pattern. The woman who stands in front of the screen wears her hair in a , a hairstyle asocciated with the women-in-waiting at high-ranked samurai homes. Utamaro has posed the women so their hairstyles contrast—the woman behind the screen's is extravagantly tied and decorated, while the woman-in waiting's is much simpler. The both have pleased, attentive expressions, and appear to be watching something—perhaps a show or presentation.\n\nThe collectors William S. and John T. Spaulding bought a copy of this print from the architect Frank Lloyd Wright while in Japan in 1913. The Spaulding brothers donated their copy along with the rest of their collection to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston on 21 December 1921.\n\nIn \"Natsu Ishō\" (, \"Summer clothing\"), an elegantly-dressed woman standing in the foreground holds a \"kanzashi\" hairpin with her right hand to her hair, which is made up in a hairstyle. She appears to have just gotten out of the bath. Another young woman looks at her from behind a translucent cloth hung on a clothes rack. The pair appear to be in conversation.\n\n"}

{"id": "295144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295144", "title": "Preppy", "text": "Preppy\n\nPreppy (also spelled preppie) or prep (all abbreviations of the word \"preparatory\") refers to a subculture in the United States associated with old private Northeastern university-preparatory schools. The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or alumnus of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past include a particular subcultural speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms, etiquette, reflective of an upper-class upbringing.\n\nThe term \"preppy\" derives from the private, university-preparatory or \"prep\" schools that some American upper class and upper-middle-class children attend. The term \"preppy\" is commonly associated with the Ivy League and oldest universities in the Northeast and the prep schools which fed students to them, since traditionally a primary goal in attending a prep school was admittance into one of these institutions. Preppy fashion derives from the fashions of these old Northeastern colleges in the early to mid-twentieth century. Lisa Birnbach's 1980 book \"Official Preppy Handbook\", which was written to poke fun at the rich lives of privileged Ivy League and socially elite liberal arts college students but ended up glamorizing the culture, portrays the preppy social group as well-educated, well-connected, and although exclusive, courteous to other social groups without fostering serious relationships with them. Being well-educated and well-connected is associated with an upper-class socioeconomic status that emphasizes higher education and high-income professional success.\n\nFor men, preppy fashion has its roots in the Ivy League style of dress, which started around 1912 and became more established in the late 1950s. J. Press represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of Ivy League schools. In the mid-twentieth century J. Press and Brooks Brothers both had stores on Ivy League school campuses, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as polo, sailing, hunting, fencing, crew rowing, lacrosse, golf, tennis, rugby, squash and swimming. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as Lacoste, Daniel Cremieux, Izod, and Dooney & Bourke became associated with preppy style in many areas of the US and Canada.\n\nFor women, preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as Perry Ellis and Lilly Pulitzer, influenced by designers such as Oleg Cassini, and popularized by female students at the Seven Sisters Colleges, sister institutions to the Ivy League. These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.\n\nThough traditional interest in preppy style fell in the 1990s, some of the newer outfitters such as Ralph Lauren, J. Crew, Vineyard Vines, Gant, and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as Marc Jacobs and Luella Bartley adding the preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s.\n\nExamples of preppy attire include argyle sweaters, crewneck sweaters, grosgrain or woven leather belts, chinos, madras, Nantucket Reds, button down Oxford cloth shirts, pearl necklaces and earrings, gold bangle or large chain bracelets, penny loafers, polo shirts (often with a popped collar), and boat shoes.\n\n\n"}

It stood on the corner of Long Acre (formerly Charles Street) and Endell Street, with entrances in Wilson Street and Long Acre. The site is within the modern Camden, part of Covent Garden.\n\nSt Martin's Hall contained a 3,000-seat main hall and a 500-seat lecture hall. It was used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings. The Queen's Theatre, one of the largest in London, had a capacity of 4,000 seats. The theatre closed after barely more than a decade, in 1878.\n\nThe name Queen's Theatre has been used for other theatres in central London, including the Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden (from 1685 to 1705), Her Majesty's Theatre (from 1705 to 1714), Scala Theatre (during the period 1831–1865) and the modern Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue (since 1907).\n\nSt Martin's Hall was built for John Hullah, in 1847, by William Cubitt, from a design by Richard Westmacott. The scheme was financed by subscription and it was built on a parallelogram of land, by wide, connected to a plot on Long Acre ( by ); and consisted of a main hall with connected anterooms, galleries and a 500–seat lecture hall. It was built in the Elizabethan style, with a large domed iron roof. The music hall was capable of seating 3,000 persons and was opened in 1850 by Hullah, the founder of a new \"school of choral harmony\". In addition to his singing classes, Hullah directed oratorios and concerts, both instrumental and vocal, at the hall. The hall was then used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings.\n\nThe German Reed Entertainments were initially presented here in 1855 – known as \"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings\" – before moving to the more intimate Gallery of Illustration and later St George's Hall. Charles Dickens first appeared as a public lecturer in St Martin's Hall, in April, 1858, speaking on behalf of the Hospital for Sick Children, in Great Ormond Street. A week or two later, he spoke on his own account.\n\nOn 26 August 1860, a fire broke out in a nearby coach factory and the hall was destroyed, together with its organ. The hall was rebuilt as a concert hall, opening in 1862. The First International was founded in St Martin's Hall in 1864. The final musical entertainment was given in 1867.\n\nIn 1867, a 4,000-seat theatre was built within the shell of the existing building by C. J. Phipps for Henry Labouchère and his partners, with interior decoration by Albert Moore and Telbin. A new company of players was formed, including Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, Ellen Terry and Henrietta Hodson. The theatre opened as the New Queen's Theatre, with a production of Charles Reade's \"The Double Marriage\" on 24 October 1867. An early success was \"Dearer Than Life\", by H. J. Byron, with Brough, Toole, Wyndham, Hodson and Irving, coupled with W. S. Gilbert's \"La Vivandière\", a burlesque of \"La fille du régiment\". The theatre continued with melodrama, adaptions and classic revivals, dropping the epithet 'new' the following year.\nInitially, the management was run by the actor Alfred Wigan, who also appeared in its productions. By 1868, Hodson and Labouchère were living together out of wedlock, as they could not marry until her first husband finally died in 1887. Labouchère bought out his partners and used the theatre to showcase Hodson's talents. The theatre hosted comedies, such as F. C. Burnand's \"The Turn of the Tide\" (1869, starring Hermann Vezin and George Rignold with Hodson), historical dramas, such as Tom Taylor's \"Twixt Axe and Crown\" (1870), popular revivals of Shakespeare (starring such famous actors as Samuel Phelps) and Tommaso Salvini, dramatisations of Dickens novels, burlesques and extravaganzas. Although the theatre was among the largest and best equipped in London, and featured some of London's most famous stars, it lacked the guidance of an actor-manager of the stature of Henry Irving or Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\n\nIn 1877, the theatre became the National Theatre and hosted a series of promenade concerts under Riviere and Alfred Cellier followed by an ambitious dramatisation of \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (Lord Lytton's eponymous novel) that was meant to feature a staged eruption of Vesuvius, an earthquake and a sybriatic Roman feast. However, the earth did not quake, the volcano did not erupt, acrobats fell onto the cast below, and the production was an expensive flop. The same year, the theatre was joined by overhead wires to the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, and public demonstrations of the Cromwell Varley telephone were given. Several simple tunes were transmitted and emitted softly from a large drum-like apparatus suspended over the proscenium.\n\nThe theatre was open for little more than a decade, closing in April 1878. The interior was converted into a department store for the \"Clerical Co-operative Society\" and later occupied by the Odhams Press. The façade remained until redeveloped into a residential block in the 1970s.\n\n\n"}

The Roman Catholic Church continues to recognize him as a saint, listing him as such in the February 14 entry in the Roman Martyrology, and authorizing liturgical veneration of him on February 14 in any place where that day is not devoted to some other obligatory celebration in accordance with the rule that on such a day the Mass may be that of any saint listed in the Martyrology for that day. Use of the pre-1970 liturgical calendar is also authorized under the conditions indicated in the motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" of 2007. Saint Valentine's Church in Rome, built in 1960 for the needs of the Olympic Village, continues as a modern, well-visited parish church.\n\nSaint Valentine is commemorated in the Anglican Communion, as well as in Lutheranism, on February 14. The Lutheran Service Book, with its penchant for the old Roman calendar, commemorates Valentine on this date. By some of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Valentine the Presbyter of Rome is celebrated on July 6 and Hieromartyr Valentine (Bishop of Interamna, Terni in Italy) is celebrated on July 30. Notwithstanding, because of the relative obscurity of these two saints in the East and since there is no commemoration of St. Valentine in the Greek Orthodox Church, members of the Greek Orthodox Church named Valentinos (male) or Valentina (female) may observe their name day on the Western ecclesiastical calendar date of February 14.\n\nThe name \"Valentinus\" does not occur in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the Chronography of 354, although the patron of the Chronography's compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus. However, it is found in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, which was compiled between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources. The feast of St. Valentine of February 14 was first established in 496 by Pope Gelasius I, who included Valentine among all those \"... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God.\" As Gelasius implies, nothing was then known about his life.\n\n\"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" and other hagiographical sources speak of three Saint Valentines that appear in connection with February 14. One was a Roman priest, another the bishop of Interamna (modern Terni, Italy) both buried along the Via Flaminia outside Rome, at different distances from the city. The third was said to be a saint who suffered on the same day with a number of companions in the Roman province of Africa, of whom nothing else is known.\n\nThough the extant accounts of the martyrdoms of the first two listed saints are of a late date and contain legendary elements, \"a common nucleus of fact\" may underlie the two accounts and they may refer to \"a single person\". According to the official biography of the Diocese of Terni, Bishop Valentine was born and lived in Interamna and while on a temporary stay in Rome he was imprisoned, tortured, and martyred there on February 14, 269. His body was hastily buried at a nearby cemetery and a few nights later his disciples retrieved his body and returned him home.\n\nΤhe \"Roman Martyrology\", the Catholic Church's official list of recognized saints, for February 14 gives only one Saint Valentine: a martyr who died on the Via Flaminia.\n\nThe name \"Valentine\" derived from \"valens\" (worthy, strong, powerful), was popular in Late Antiquity. About eleven other saints having the name Valentine are commemorated in the Roman Catholic Church. Some Eastern Churches of the Western rite may provide still other different lists of Saint Valentines. The Roman martyrology lists only seven who died on days \"other\" than February 14: a priest from Viterbo (November 3); a bishop from Raetia who died in about 470 (January 7); a 5th-century priest and hermit (July 4); a Spanish hermit who died in about 715 (October 25); Valentine Berrio Ochoa, martyred in 1861 (November 24); and Valentine Jaunzarás Gómez, martyred in 1936 (September 18). It also lists a virgin, Saint Valentina, who was martyred in 308 (July 25) in Caesarea, Palestine.\n\nThe inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him.\n\nA common hagiography describes Saint Valentine as a priest of Rome or as the former Bishop of Terni, an important town of Umbria, in central Italy. While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of Jesus. The judge put Valentinus to the test and brought to him the judge's adopted blind daughter. If Valentinus succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentinus laid his hands on her eyes and the child's vision was restored. Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentinus what he should do. Valentinus replied that all of the idols around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo baptism. The judge obeyed and, as a result, freed all the Christian inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member household (family members and servants) were baptized. Valentinus was later arrested again for continuing to proselytize and was sent to the prefect of Rome, to the emperor Claudius Gothicus (Claudius II) himself. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentinus tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity, whereupon Claudius refused and condemned Valentinus to death, commanding that Valentinus either renounce his faith or he would be beaten with clubs, and beheaded. Valentinus refused and Claudius' command was executed outside the Flaminian Gate February 14, 269.\n\nThe \"Legenda Aurea\" of Jacobus de Voragine, compiled about 1260 and one of the most-read books of the High Middle Ages, gives sufficient details of the saints for each day of the liturgical year to inspire a homily on each occasion. The very brief \"vita\" of St Valentine has him executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the \"Emperor Claudius\" in the year 269. Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of \"Valentine\", \"as containing valour\".\n\nA popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of Claudius Gothicus. He was arrested and imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius took a liking to this prisoner. However, when Valentinus tried to convert the Emperor, he was condemned to death. He was beaten with clubs and stones; when that failed to kill him, he was beheaded outside the Flaminian Gate. Various dates are given for the martyrdom or martyrdoms: 269, 270, or 273.\n\nThere are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that in the 3rd century AD it is said that Valentine, who was a priest, defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly married couples so that the husbands wouldn't have to go to war. The legend claims that soldiers were sparse at this time so this was a big inconvenience to the emperor. Another legend is that Valentine refused to sacrifice to pagan gods. Being imprisoned for this, Valentine gave his testimony in prison and through his prayers healed the jailer's daughter who was suffering from blindness. On the day of his execution he left her a note that was signed, \"Your Valentine\".\n\nSaint Valentine was not exceptionally more venerated than other saints and it seems that in England no church was ever dedicated to him. There are many churches containing the name of Valentine in other countries such as Italy.\n\nA 5th- or 6th-century work called \"Passio Marii et Marthae\" made up a legend about Saint Valentine's Basilica being dedicated to Saint Valentine in Rome. A later \"Passio\" repeated the legend and added the adornment that Pope Julius I (357–352) had built the ancient basilica \"S. Valentini extra Portam\" on top of his sepulchre, in the Via Flaminia. This church was really named after a 4th-century tribune called Valentino, who donated the land on which it is built. It hosted the martyr's relics until the 13th century, when they were transferred to Santa Prassede, and the ancient basilica decayed.\n\nEnglish 18th-century antiquarians Alban Butler and Francis Douce, noting the obscurity of Saint Valentine's identity, suggested that Valentine's Day was created as an attempt to supersede the pagan holiday of Lupercalia (mid-February in Rome). This idea has lately been dismissed by other researchers, such as Professor Jack B. Oruch of the University of Kansas, Henry Ansgar Kelly of the University of California, Los Angeles and Associate Professor Michael Matthew Kaylor of the Masaryk University. Many of the current legends that characterize Saint Valentine were invented in the 14th century in England, notably by Geoffrey Chaucer and his circle, when the feast day of February 14 first became associated with romantic love.\n\nOruch charges that the traditions associated with \"Valentine's Day\", documented in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Parlement of Foules\" and set in the fictional context of an old tradition, did not exist before Chaucer. He argues that the speculative explanation of sentimental customs, posing as historical fact, had their origins among 18th-century antiquaries, notably Alban Butler, the author of \"Butler's Lives of Saints\", and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. In the French 14th-century manuscript illumination from a \"Vies des Saints\" (\"illustration above\"), Saint Valentine, bishop of Terni, oversees the construction of his basilica at Terni; there is no suggestion here that the bishop was a patron of lovers.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, it was believed that birds paired in mid-February. This was then associated with the romance of Valentine. Although these legends differ, Valentine’s Day is widely recognized as a day for romance and devotion.\n\nThe flower-crowned alleged skull of St. Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.\n\nSt. Valentine's remains are deposited in St Anton's Church, Madrid, where they have lain since the late 1700s. They were a present from the Pope to King Carlos IV, who entrusted them to the Order of Poor Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools (Piarists). The relics have been displayed publicly since 1984, in a foundation open to the public at all times in order help people in need.\n\nSt. Valentine's remains are also claimed to be in Dublin. In 1836, some relics that were exhumed from the catacombs of Saint Hippolytus on the Via Tiburtina, then near (rather than inside) Rome, were identified with St Valentine; placed in a casket, and transported to the procession to the high altar for a special Mass dedicated to young people and all those in love. Also in 1836, Fr. John Spratt, an Irish priest and famous preacher, was given many tokens of esteem following a sermon in Rome. One gift from Pope Gregory XVI were the remains of St. Valentine and \"a small vessel tinged with his blood.\" The Reliquary was placed in Whitefriar Street Church in Dublin, Ireland, and has remained there until this day. This was accompanied by a letter claiming the relics were those of St. Valentine. \n\nAnother relic was found in 2003 in Prague in Church of St Peter and Paul at Vyšehrad.\n\nA silver reliquary containing a fragment of St. Valentine's skull is found in the parish church of St. Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland.\n\nRelics can also be found in the Greek island of Lesbos.\n\nAnother set of relics can also be found in Savona, in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta.\n\nAlleged relics of St. Valentine also lie at the reliquary of Roquemaure, Gard, France, in the St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna, in Balzan in Malta and also in Blessed John Duns Scotus' church in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, Scotland. There is also a gold reliquary bearing the words \"Corpus St. Valentin, M\" (Body of St. Valentine, Martyr) at Birmingham Oratory, UK, in one of the side altars in the main church.\n\nSaint Valentine remains in the Roman Catholic Church's official list of saints, the \"Roman Martyrology\", but, in view of the scarcity of information about him, his commemoration was removed from the General Roman Calendar, when this was revised in 1969. It is included in local calendars of places such as Balzan in Malta. Some Traditionalist Catholics observe earlier calendars of the Roman Rite, in which Saint Valentine was celebrated as a Simple Feast until 1955, when Pope Pius XII reduced the mention of him to a commemoration in the Mass of the day, a position it kept in the General Roman Calendar of 1960 incorporated in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, use of which, as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, is still authorized in accordance with Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\nFebruary 14 is also celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in other Christian Churches; in the Church of England, for example, it was included in Calendars before the Reformation, and S.Valentine, Bishop and Martyr, was restored to the Church's Calendar in the 1661–62 \"Book of Common Prayer\". He remains in the Calendars of the Church of England and in those of most other parts of the Anglican Communion, albeit sometimes noted as an ancient memorial of obscure historical character.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4161658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4161658", "title": "Shah Jo Risalo", "text": "Shah Jo Risalo\n\nShah Jo Risalo () is a poetic compendium of famous Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. In fact, it is many compendia, for Shah Abdul Latif's poetry in various forms of bayt and wai was compiled by many of his devotees during his lifetime and after his death. The devotees compiled his poetry and designated it as Shah Jo Risalo or Poetry of Shah.\n\nErnest Trumpp called it Diwan when he edited the \"Risalo\" and published it from Leipzig, Germany in 1866 A.D. Afterwards, many scholars and linguists have published the Shah Jo Risalo with their own compilations, hence many editions are available.\n\nShah Jo Risalo, written in very pure and concise Sindhi verses, is great storehouse for Muslims but also for the Hindus. Shah Abdul Latif has hidden his mystical ideas under layers of symbols taken from all spheres of life as well as from the classical Sufi tradition, and particularly from Maulana Rumi's Mathnawi.\n\nThe traditional compilations of Shah Jo Risalo include 30 Surs (chapters) which were compiled by renowned researchers. The oldest publications of Shah Jo Risalo contained some 36 Surs, but later most of the linguists discarded 6 Surs, as their language and content did not match the Shah's style. Recently, Dr. Nabi Bakhsh Baloch, a renowned linguist of the Sindhi language, has compiled and printed a new edition after 32 years of research into folk culture, language and the history of Sindhi language. Another poet Dr Aurangzeb Siyal has recently launched a book named \"Louk Zangeer\" in which he has attempted to define three Surs i-e Momal Rano, Sasui Punho and Umar Marvi in an easy manner and in different poetic style.\n\nThe word \"Sur\", from Sanskrit word Svara, means a mode of singing. The Surs are sung as Ragas In Indian classical music, its \"Ragas\" and \"Raginis\" are sung at different times of day and night. In Risalo the Surs are named according to their subject matter. The underlying theme is how the individual is to cultivate the godly attributes, negate his ego so as to evolve to a better human being.\n\nThe traditional 30 Surs included in Shah Jo Risalo are:\n\n\n\nThese Surs contain Bayts which Shah latif sang in state of ecstasy. These Bayts in the Surs concerning the life-stories of his heroines, viz. Suhni, Sassui, Lila, Mumal, Marui, Nuri and Sorath, are not in chronological sequences, for the Sufi Poet in his state of \"Wajd\" or ecstasy, was concerned with the moments of denouncements in life-stories, which he used as allegories to express his mystical experiences.\n\nThe heroines of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry are known as the Seven queens of Sindhi folklore who have been given the status of royalty in Shah Jo Risalo. The Seven Queens are celebrated throughout Sindh for their positive qualities: honesty, integrity, piety and loyalty. They are also valued for their bravery and their willingness to risk their lives in the name of love. The Seven Queens mentioned in Shah Jo Risalo are Marui, Momal, Sassui, Noori, Sohni, Sorath, and Lila. In his poetry Shah has alluded in elaborate way to these characters of Sindhi folktales and used them as metaphors for high spiritual life.\n\nPerhaps what Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai saw in his tales of these women was an idealized view of womanhood, but the truth remains that the Seven Queens inspired women all over Sindh to have the courage to choose love and freedom over tyranny and oppression. The lines from the Risalo describing their trials are sung at Sufi shrines all over Sindh, and especially at the \"urs\" of Shah Abdul Latif every year at Bhit Shah.\n\nThese romantic tales of Bhittai are commonly known as \"Momal Rano\", \"Umar Marui\", \"Sohni Mehar\", \"Lilan Chanesar\", \"Noori Jam Tamachi\", \"Sassui Punnhun\" and \"Raja Dhach\" or Seven Queens () of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai.\n\n\"Sassui Punnhun\" and \"Sohni Mehar\" aka Sohni Mahiwal in Punjabi are also celebrated in Punjab along with \"Heer Ranjha\" and \"Mirza Sahiban\" and thus form part of Punjabi traditions.\n\nThese nine tragic romances from South Asia (all from present day Pakistan) have become part of the cultural identity of Pakistan.\n\nShah Jo Risalo was first translated into German in 1866 by Ernest Trump, a German scholar and missionary when in 1860s he became fascinated by Sindhi language and culture and the jogis and singers who sang Shah Latif’s verses. With the help of Sindhi scholars he compiled a selection of the original verses and called it \"Shah Jo Risalo\" (the message of Shah). It was first translated in English by Elsa Kazi, a German lady married to Allama I. I. Kazi, who translated selections of Shah Jo Risalo in English prose. Later in 1940, Dr H.T Sorley, an English scholar learnt Sindhi, and published selections from the Risalo by the Oxford University Press entitled \"Shah Abdul latif of Bhit - His Poetry, Life and Times\".\n\nThe most recent work (1994) of translation of Risalo into English is that of Amena Khamisani, a professor in English Literature at the Sindh University. Shaikh Ayaz, the famous Sindhi poet, translated Risalo into Urdu. Risalo is also translated in Punjabi and more recently French translation was also undertaken by Cultural department of Sindh. Part of Risalo is also translated in Arabic.\nThere is one more translation of Shah Abdul Latif by name \"Seeking The Beloved\" translated by Hari Daryani 'Dilgir' a noted Sindhi poet and Anju Makhija. This book was honoured with Sahitya Akademi Award for translation in the year 2012.\n\n\n"}

The publication focuses on history, photography, art, and design, but also features articles on architecture, fashion, science, DIY, adventure, and literature. \"Smith Journal\" is published by Frankie Press, creators of popular Australian magazine \"frankie.\" The magazine is lauded for sharing the same \"inquisitive nature, intelligent copy and compelling stories\" as \"frankie\".\n\n\"Smith Journal\" was founded by frankie press editors-at-large Rick Bannister and Louise Bannister as a men’s magazine in the same vein as \"frankie.\" It was designed to attract readers interested in “real people doing real things, guys that are making stuff, creative thinkers, adventurers, whatever.”\n\nThe magazine was initially planned to be published on a bi-annual schedule, but adopted a quarterly publishing schedule following its positive reception.\n\nSimilar to \"frankie,\" the magazine is printed on premium matte paper stock, and marketed as a \"bespoke\" title suitable as both a casual read and coffee table magazine.\n\n\"Smith Journal\" is owned and published by niche publisher Morrison Media, parent owners of Frankie Press who also publish \"frankie\" magazine. Morrison Media moved production of its titles to Melbourne in February 2014 when it closed its Queensland based offices. Later that year, Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network in November 2014 for $10m AUD.\n\n\"Smith Journal's\" name is derived from the titles used for professional wordsmiths or blacksmiths; traditional artisans and craftsmen that embody the down-to-earth quality the magazine attempts to emulate.\n\nThe magazine's somewhat niche content and minimalistic approach to topics is a direct response to the salacious \"lad mags\" of the magazine industry such as \"FHM\" and \"Zoo Weekly.\" At the time of \"Smith Journal's\" launch, the men's magazine market largely consisted of populist focused titles with a very broad target audience such as \"Men's Health\", or hobby-specific titles dedicated to a singular topic. Instead of attempting to engage as many readers as possible through glossy pages filled with current events topics, the editors of \"Smith Journal\" felt that there was a \"gap in the market for guys who felt that their magazines hadn't grown or changed with them.\" According to the founding editor Nadia Saccardo, the magazine was not created with an emphasis on a specific gender, but was instead focused on \"unexpected, accessible storytelling coupled with great photography and illustration.\"\n\nMany of the articles focus on topics and individuals related to history, photography, art and design. Volume 25 profiles photographer Daniel George, whose portfolio consists of household items used for target practice; an article discussing the cultural re-evaluation of 1980s hair metal music; and an interview with former NASA scientist Robert Lang who now designs origami. Previous issues have also included interviews with American musician Henry Rollins, and professional safe-cracker Jeff Sitar, an historical article on Soviet rocket architect Galina Balashova, and Brazil's illegal hot air balloon subculture.\n\nThe stylistic design of the magazine makes use of a large amount of white space and very minimalistic photographs and illustrations with text pairings. Many articles are presented on a stark white background, some without a headline or photo to accompany it. A number of photographs are presented on a two-page spread. All of the photographs adhere to a similar editing style which includes faded blacks to complement the matte paper they are printed on.\n\nIssues will often include tear-out posters of illustrations or diagrams. For example, Volume 25 features an illustrated diagram of the 2018 lunar calendar, and Volume 18 included a twenty-sided icosahedron globe.\n\nThese content and design choices are intentionally similar in style to \"frankie,\" another Frankie Press publication. Editor-at-Large Louise Bannister stated that \"they're from the same family – lots of white space…but the treatment of pictures and text is a little different.\" During its initial creation, \"Smith Journal\" was designed by \"frankie\" magazine's Creative Director, Lara Burke, with additional input from \"frankie's\" editor, Jo Walker and Senior Contributor, Benjamin Walker. However, Bannister was quick to point out that despite the similarities, \"Smith is its own thing.\"\n\nThe first issue of \"Smith Journal\" was published in Australia on 5 September 2011. Frankie Press circulated 20,000 copies of the first issue which contained 140 pages.\n\nWhen the magazine first launched in September 2011, it was during a period when a significantly large number of men's magazines were declining in sales and reader numbers. For example, \"FHM\" had posted a 20 percent drop from 2010 to 2011 to reach a record low of 40,000 circulated copies in Australia, and \"Zoo Weekly\" had dropped 18 percent to 83,000 circulated copies. Other men's titles such as \"Alpha, Sport & Style,\" and \"Ralph\" all folded in the same span of time.\" \"\n\nIn response to the decision to launch a new men's magazine when a large number of others were closing, then editorial director Louise Bannister suggested \"Smith Journal\" was not intended to appeal to a mass audience, but instead to a smaller group of people interested in \"something they can't get on the internet.\"\n\n\"Smith Journal's\" readers are predominantly male, however, the magazine also holds a fairly sizable female reader base (70% male, 30% female). The magazine's media kit states that 58% of its readers are between 25–44 years old, and that 70% are university educated or are currently studying.\n\nFormer editor Nadia Saccardo described the magazine's reader as curious and open-minded and that the content was designed to attract readers \"who feel like they have been ignored, or would not traditionally pick up magazines.\" Editor-at-Large Rick Bannister elaborated on this statement by describing the magazine's average reader as someone who is creative and interested in reviving old traditions such as \"brewing, or making furniture, or restoring bikes.\"\n\nBesides the quarterly issue, the magazine also features an online presence through its website \"smithjournal.com.au.\" The website includes original articles and weekly blog posts not found in the magazine that cover a wider range of subjects and topics than the magazine usually focuses on. The website receives an average number of 19,900 unique visitors (six-month average), and 41,150+ average page views per month (media kit). \"Smith Journal\" also has an online shop where visitors can purchase individual copies (for domestic or international shipping), issues of the digital magazine, as well as past copies.\n\n\"Smith Journal\" has had a number of notable writers contribute to the magazine's content. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and editor Dave Eggers, author of popular novels \"A Hologram for the King\" and \"The Circle,\" contributed a personal narrative in the magazine's second issue. Elizabeth Gilbert, author of \"Eat, Pray, Love\", has contributed an opinion piece on science and adventure. Australian writer Tim Winton had an article titled \"10 Things I Believe\" also published by the magazine.\n\n"}

Their mission was to present exceptional theater performance, and to provide theatrical training and education in an urban Indigenous performance practice. The theater sprung out of the feminist movement in the 1970s. They questioned gender roles, cultural stereotypes, sexual and economic oppression. It was founded in 1976, the core of the group is formed by sisters Muriel Miguel, Gloria Miguel, and Lisa Mayo. It was the first Native American women's theater troupe and is named after the Spiderwoman deity from Hopi mythology.\n\nMuriel Miguel developed a piece with Lois Weaver based on three stories of the Hopi goddess Spiderwoman teaching people how to weave. Miguel's sisters, Lisa Mayo and Gloria Miguel, joined the group.\n\nSpiderwoman Theater was founded in 1976 and the group premiered their first work, \"Women in Violence\", at Washington Square Methodist Church. The play combined the actors' stories of violence, contrasting serious subject matter with slapstick and sexual humor. For the piece they created a simple lighting design and a backdrop made out of Native American quilts. They toured the play in the United States and Europe. At a theatre in Nancy, France, the women refused to sweep their performance space before their show. Hecklers gathered at the performance, upset that a male producer had to sweep the floor. Organizers of a later performance in Bologna, Italy cancelled it for fear of riots.\n\nSpiderwoman Theater debuted their second play, \"The Lysistrata Numbah!\", in 1977. The production melded Aristophanes' \"Lysistrata\" with group members' stories.\n\nSchisms developed in the group that led to the theater dividing in two in 1981. The offshoot lesbian performance troupe Split Britches included Lois Weaver, Peggy Shaw, and Deb Margolin. Spiderwoman Theater continued on with the three sisters and shifted its focus to Native American issues that year with the play \"Sun, Moon and Feather\".\nSpiderwoman Theater's \"Winnetou's Snake Oil Show from Wigwam City\" is a satire of the European and particularly German fascination with Native Americans. The play parodies the characters of dime-store novelist Karl May, New Ageism, and individuals who pretend to be Native American. The play includes a phony shaman workshop where white people are transformed into Indians for a weekend for $3000. According to the troupe, it was an act of resistance meant to reclaim their identity as real Native Americans. After \"Winnetou's Snake Oil Show\", the sisters had enough remaining material they had been working on to have a new show, \"Reverb-ber-ber-rations\".\n\nPerformance Documentation of the pieces \"Women In Violence\" (1976) and \"Lysistrata Numbah!\" (1977) were included in the WACK! Art and Feminist Revolution Exhibition, organized by Cornelia Butler and presented at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, March 4-July 16, 2007. Additionally, Spiderwoman founder Muriel Miguel was the subject about a short documentary by Theatre Communications Group in a series about theatre companies about people of color.\n\nIn 1997, a repository for Spiderwoman Theater, the Native American Women Playwrights Archive (NAWPA), was created. It contains promotional and personal documents associated with the theater troupe and also holds a collection of manuscripts and related items pertaining to Native American women in theater.\n\nSpiderwoman Theater was founded by sisters Muriel, Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo (born Elizabeth Miguel). They are of Kuna and Rappahannock ancestry and were born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. The sisters' mother and maternal grandmother also grew up in Brooklyn, but their father, a Kuna Indian, was a born in the San Blas Islands near Panama. According to Muriel, their father struggled to provide for his family via conventional means, and so the family would perform dances and snake oil shows for money. The three sisters were embarrassed by these performances and decided they would rather associate with more professional types of theater as opposed to being \"spectacles of cliché.\" \n\nMuriel Miguel is a founder of the Native American Theatre Ensemble at La MaMa. She is a choreographer, play writer, actor, educator, and Two-spirit woman. She gathered a diverse group of women including both of her sisters Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo, thus creating the Spiderwoman theater. She also taught theater at Bard College. In addition to Spiderwoman Theater, she was a founding member of Joseph Chaikin's Open Theater.\n\nGloria Miguel studied drama at Oberlin College. She has worked extensively in television and theater with the Spiderwoman, she has toured throughout New Zealand, Australia and Europe. She was a drama consultant for the Minnesota Native American AIDS, she was also a drama teacher at the YMCA eastern district in Brooklyn. she is also the mother of Monique Mojica, another playwright and actress.\n\nLisa Mayo (1924-2013) was trained as a mezzo-soprano at the New York School of Music. Mayo also studied dance and musical comedy. She has written and performed in more than 20 plays that were produced by The Spiderwoman Theater, and toured New Zealand, Europe, Australia, China, United States and throughout Canada. She has created two one-woman shows \"The Pause That Refreshes\" and \"My Sister Ate Dirt.\" Mayo contributed to the Minnesota Native American AIDS by teaching theater crafts to young people. She served on the Board of Directors of The American Indian Community House from 1998-2007.\n\nOf the many plays by Spiderwoman Theatre, the following plays have been printed in anthologies: \nOther works include:\n\n"}

Completed in his later years, around 1516-1517, the painting depicts Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of musicians and Church music, listening to a choir of angels in the company of St. Paul, St. John the Evangelist, St. Augustine and Mary Magdalene. Commissioned for a church in Bologna, the painting now hangs there in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, or National Painting Gallery. According to Vasari the musical instruments strewn about Cecilia's feet were not painted by Raphael, but by his student, Giovanni da Udine.\n\nEnglish Romantic poet Percy Shelley described the painting as follows:\nThe central figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter's mind; her deep, dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead — she holds an organ in her hands — her countenance, as it were, calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life. She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes, towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards her, languid with the depth of emotion. At her feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.\n\nThe altarpiece was commissioned for a chapel dedicated to St. Cecilia at the Augustinian church of San Giovanni in Monte in Bologna. According to Vasari the work was commissioned by Cardinal Lorenzo Pucci in 1513. Given the extraordinary popularity of the painter at this time in his career, it is likely that only such a highly placed church authority could have had any hope of hiring him. The patron of the chapel itself, however, was Elena Duglioli dall'Olio, an aristocratic Bolognese woman who would later be beatified for her piety. She was a close friend of Antonio Pucci, Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, and most art historians today agree that the Pucci must have served as her agents and advisers with Raphael and that the painting was more likely commissioned for her around 1516, when construction on the chapel was completed. Duglioli had a particular devotion to the cult of St. Cecilia and had been given a relic (her knucklebone) by the papal legate to Bologna, Cardinal Francesco Alidosi. She struggled to live a chaste life in emulation of the early Christian saint and persuaded her husband not to consummate their marriage.\n\nThe painting was looted to Paris in 1798. While there, it was transferred to canvas. In 1815, the painting was returned to Bologna where, after cleaning, and was hung in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna. The painting's condition is poor, as it has been damaged by repainting over the years.\n\nSt. Cecilia's companions are identified in part by their attributes. Immediately to her right, John the Evangelist has an eagle, his usual symbol, peeking out around his robes. Beside him, Paul leans on the sword with which he had come to be identified in medieval art. Augustine of Hippo holds his crosier. Mary Magdalene holds the alabaster jar by which she is most commonly identified.\n\nThe iconography of the altarpiece is unusual in that rather than portraying a figure or figures to be worshipped, it represents the act of worship itself. Each of the saints was associated with visions - as was Elena Duglioni herself - and the celestial choir that opens above the saints' heads is closely associated with the patron's own devotions, in which music was an important element. Cecilia was associated with music from the Middle Ages, but the broken instruments here appear to refer to the abandonment of earthly pleasures that resulted from Cecilia's devotion to the sacred. In this painting she personifies religious music as a route to union with God.\n\nThe painting further celebrates the theme of chastity. St. Cecilia's simple belt is a traditional Renaissance symbol for chastity; John the Evangelist was the patron saint of virginity; and Paul praised celibacy in I Corinthians. Thus the painting's iconography is closely tied to the life of the patron on many levels.\n\nThere is an engraving of the painting by Marcantonio Raimondi: it differs significantly from the work, and some scholars have suggested that it reflects a lost sketch for the altarpiece. In it Raphael depicted the angels with instruments as well — harp, triangle and violin — and the figures are in very different poses. Augustine (wearing his mitre) and Paul look downward; John looks out towards the viewer; the Magdalene looks upward to the angelic host, as Cecilia does. Raimondi's engravings are frequently known to alter Raphael's works, however, so it is not impossible that it represents a free variant of the finished altarpiece rather than a copy of a sketch of Raphael's initial intentions.\n\n"}

It is an unusually large red-brick Romanesque building, the nave and chancel having been extended in the Gothic period with a sacristy and lateral aisle. The tower is late Romanesque. There are frescos from c. 1400 in the sacristy. The carved pulpit (1645) is the work of Jørgen Ringnis.\n\nDedicated to St Michael, the church was the property of the Crown in the Middle Ages and remained so after the Reformation. In 1726, it was sold by auction to Chamberlain Christian Carl Gabel together with the Fuglsang and Priorskov estates. The Toreby market was moved to Sakskøbing in 1550.\n\nBuilt c. 1200, Toreby is one of the largest churches in the area. Built of brick with fieldstone foundations, it consists of a nave, two lateral aisles, a chancel, a sacristy and a tower. The nave and part of the chancel remain from the original Romanesque building. Traces of the old apse, removed in the Gothic period, can still be seen. The tower was constructed in late Gothic times, shortly after the church was built. The sacristy to the north of the chancel was built at the beginning of the 14th century. The aisles were added in the Gothic period, first the one on the northern side, then the one to the south. The Late-Gothic porch has been altered several times.\n\nThe chancel originally had a flat wooden ceiling, the vaulting was added later. Six-ribbed vaults were also added to the nave and the northern aisle. A fresco of a bassoon-playing angel was found on the chancel arch, probably part of a painting of the Last Judgment.\n\nThe altarpiece consists of a painting of the Entombment of Christ, copied from Pietro Perugino's original by Albert Küchler in 1849. The former altarpiece now stands at the west end of the church. The pulpit (1645) in the auricular style is the work of woodcarver Jørgen Ringnis. The north aisle contains a crucifix from c. 1250.\n\nThe frescos on the sacristy vault were discovered in 1904 and restored in 1920. Probably dating from the early 14th century, they depict the Enthroned Christ, two angels, John the Baptist with the lamb, and the prophets Zechariah and Jeremiah. Traces of other figures can also be seen including Michael fighting the dragon, the Judgment of Solomon and the Sacrifice of Isaac. There are also traces of frescos of Moses, including Moses and the Burning Bush.\n\n"}
{"id": "3450046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3450046", "title": "Virago", "text": "Virago\n\nA virago is a woman who demonstrates exemplary and heroic qualities. The word comes from the Latin word \"virāgō\" ((genitive virāginis) meaning variously 'a man-like, vigorous, heroic maiden, a female warrior, heroine..' from \"vir\" meaning 'man' (cf. virile and virtue) to which the suffix \"-āgō \" is added, a suffix that creates a new noun of the third declension with feminine grammatical gender.\n\nThe word \"virago\" has almost always had an association with cultural gender transgression. A virago, of whatever excellence, was still identified by her gender. There are recorded instances of viragos (such as Joan of Arc) fighting battles, wearing men's clothing, or receiving the tonsure. The word \"virago\" could also be used disparagingly, to imply that a virago was not excellent or heroic, but was instead violating cultural norms. Thus \"virago\" joined pejoratives such as \"termagant\", \"mannish\", \"amazonian\" and \"shrew\" to demean women who acted aggressively or like men.\n\nHistorically, the concept of a virago reaches back into antiquity where Hellenistic philosophy asserted that elite and exceptionally heroic men had \"virtus\" (). \"Virtus\" (once again linked to \"vir\", the brave man abiding by society's highest values and ethics as opposed to \"homo\", human being) defined the traits of excellence for a man in ancient Rome (and Greece), including valor and heroism, but also morality and physical strength. Women and non-elite or unheroic men (slaves, servants, craftsmen, merchants) were considered a lesser category, and believed to be less excellent in Roman morality. A woman, however, if exceptional enough could earn the title \"virago\". In doing so, she surpassed the expectations for what was believed possible for her gender, and embodied masculine-like aggression and/or excellence. Virago, then, was a title of respect and admiration. In Christianity, a nun or holy woman who had become equal in divinity to male monks through practiced celibacy, exemplary religious practice and devotion, and intact virginity, was considered to have surpassed the limitations of her femaleness and was called \"virago\". Firmicus Maternus describes virago as women who take on a man's character and desire intercourse with women like men.\n\nStandard modern dictionaries define \"virago\" as either, in order of definition, (1) a \"loud overbearing woman\"; a \"shrew\". or (2) a woman of \"great stature, strength, and courage\" Thus virago continues to be associated with both the naming of a woman who has either (1) a domineering, abrasive and spiteful manner, or (2) has risen above cultural and gender stereotypes to embody a virile heroism; for example, the British Royal Navy christened at least four warships \"Virago\".\n\nThe Vulgate Bible, translated by Jerome and others in the 4th century C.E., was an early Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible Old Testament. In Genesis 2:23, Jerome uses the words \"Vir\" for man and \"Virago\" for \"woman\" attempting to reproduce a pun on \"male\" and \"female\" (\"ish\" and \"ishah\") that existed in the Hebrew text.\n\nThe Vulgate reads:\n\n\"Dixitque Adam hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis et caro de carne mea haec vocabitur virago quoniam de viro sumpta est.\"\n<br>\n\"And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.\"\nThe Middle English poem \"Cursor Mundi\" retains the Latin name for the woman in its otherwise Middle English account of the creation:\n\n\"Quen sco was broght be-for adam, Virago he gaf her to nam; þar for hight sco virago, ffor maked of the man was sco.\" (lines 631–34)\n<br>\n\"When she was brought before Adam, Virago was the name he gave to her; Therefore she is called Virago, For she was made out of the man.\"\n\n\n"}
