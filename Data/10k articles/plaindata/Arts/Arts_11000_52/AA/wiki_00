With a cast including Paul Muni, Celia Adler and Marlon Brando, it opened on Broadway on September 4, 1946. It was written by Ben Hecht and directed by Luther Adler, with music by Kurt Weill. \"A Flag is Born\" was produced by the American League for a Free Palestine, an organization headed by Hillel Kook (known in America by the anglicized name Peter Bergson), to raise money for Zionist causes.\n\n\"A Flag is Born\" has three principal characters, with other actors playing bit roles. Tevye and Zelda (played on Broadway by Paul Muni and Celia Adler, major stars at the time) are survivors of the Treblinka death camp who are attempting to travel to British-administered Palestine, the ancient Land of Israel. David (Marlon Brando) is an angry young Holocaust survivor.\n\nThe play opens with Tevye and Zelda ushering in the Jewish Sabbath on a Friday night somewhere on their journey. Zelda lights candles on a broken tombstone. After reciting the Sabbath prayers, Tevye dreams of the town where he was born, as it was before the Nazis destroyed it. A dream sequence follows in which Tevye has visions of the biblical kings Saul and David, then imagines himself standing before the United Nations Security Council pleading for the formation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine; he is ignored.\n\nTevye awakens to find that Zelda has died in the night. He recites \"kaddish\", a Jewish memorial prayer, then welcomes the Angel of Death, who has come for him too. He bids David farewell. As David considers committing suicide, three Jewish soldiers (representing the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi) suddenly appear and implore him to join them: \"Don't you hear our guns David? We battle the English, the sly and powerful English. We speak to them in a new Jewish language, the language of guns. We fling no more prayers or tears at the world. We fling bullets. We fling barrages ... We promise to wrest our homeland out of the British claws.\"\n\nIn the play's finale, David delivers a fiery pro-Zionist speech, moves across a bridge into Palestine, and with the mixed sounds of \"Hatikvah\" and gunfire in the background, raises Tevye's prayer shawl as a makeshift flag and marches off to war.\n\n\"A Flag is Born\" was produced by the pro-Zionist American League for a Free Palestine (ALFP) to raise financial and political support for Zionist causes, including the transport of Jews from Europe. The AFLP was entirely open about its political motivations—publicity materials read: \"'A Flag is Born' is not ordinary theatre. It was not written to amuse or beguile. 'A Flag is Born' was written to make money—to make money to provide ships to get Hebrews to Palestine ... and [to] arouse American public opinion to support the fight for freedom and independence now being waged by the resistance in Palestine.\"\n\nIn promoting the play, the Bergson Group attempted to equate the Zionist organizations in Palestine with the Patriots of the American Revolution. The cover of the program showed three Zionists—one with a rifle, one with a hoe, and one with a Zionist flag—superimposed over three American Revolutionary figures. Advertisements used the slogan \"It's 1776 in Palestine!\", portrayed members of the Irgun as \"modern-day Nathan Hales,\" alluded to \"taxation without representation\" in Palestine, and quoted Thomas Jefferson's phrase, \"Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.\" When Tevye dreams about addressing the United Nations, he compares Palestine in the 1940s with the American colonies in the 1770s. \"A Flag is Born\" played in six North American cities and raised more than $400,000 for the ALFP, the largest block of funds it ever attained.\n\nBrando had already been voted \"Broadway's Most Promising Actor\" for his role as an anguished veteran in \"Truckline Café\", but that play was not a commercial success and Brando was still young, relatively unknown and impecunious. Brando contended that the survivors of the Holocaust deserved to have their own land where they could live freely; he accepted only the Actor's Equity minimum payment so more of the proceeds from \"A Flag is Born\" could go towards Zionist causes.\n\nAfter the play proved extremely popular, the Broadway run was extended and a tour was arranged. The sponsoring committee included many prominent people, including composer Leonard Bernstein, novelist Lion Feuchtwanger, New York City Mayor William O'Dwyer, and Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nFollowing the Broadway run, \"A Flag is Born\" traveled to Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Boston. It was also scheduled to play at the National Theater in Washington, D.C. However, in an early action of the civil rights movement, Americans who opposed racial discrimination began a boycott to oppose the practice of barring blacks from attending Washington theaters, and the committee moved the play to the Maryland Theater in Baltimore. A special train brought members of Congress to the performance. The American League for a Free Palestine and the NAACP cooperated to use the occasion to force the management of the Maryland Theater to abrogate its segregation policy (blacks restricted to the balcony) for the duration of the play's run which, in the context of the times, was considered a victory for civil rights.\n"}

The book received positive reviews, but Humphrey's hypothesis about consciousness has been criticized as speculative.\n\nHumphrey describes his book as \"a partial history of a part of what constitutes the human mind: an evolutionary history of how sensory consciousness has come into the world and what it is doing there.\" He discusses the views of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the philosophers Colin McGinn and Daniel Dennett.\n\n\"A History of the Mind\" was first published by Chatto & Windus in 1992.\n\n\"A History of the Mind\" received a positive review from Francisca Goldsmith in \"Library Journal\" and a negative review from John C. Marshall in \"The Times Literary Supplement\". The book was also reviewed by M. Kohn in \"New Statesman and Society\", and by \"Publishers Weekly\", \"New Scientist\", and \"The New York Times Book Review\".\n\nGoldsmith wrote that the book would appeal to both \"interested lay readers\" and scholars. Marshall criticized Humphrey's style of writing and wrote that his \"account of the evolutionary development of consciousness\" was \"highly speculative\" and so lacking in precision and detail that it was questionable whether it could be considered a theory. He added that Humphrey's comparison of the senses of vision and hearing to those of touch, pain, smell and taste was contradicted by physiological evidence.\n\n\"A History of the Mind\" received a positive review from \"The Lancet\". It described the book as an \"entertaining and well-thought out work\" and Humphrey's attempt to \"solve the riddle of perception, sensation, and consciousness\" as brave. It considered his ideas a possible basis for \"a new neurophysiology\", but criticized him for misinterpreting Coleridge.\n\nRichard Webster, writing in \"Why Freud Was Wrong\" (1995), called \"A History of the Mind\" one of the most interesting attempts to solve the mind–body problem. He suggested that Humphrey succeeded in eliminating mind-body dualism entirely, although he noted that details of Humphrey's hypothesis remain speculative and open to criticism and that the hypothesis was rejected by McGinn. The paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, writing with Blake Edgar in \"From Lucy to Language\" (1996), noted that Humphrey's hypothesis about consciousness places a different emphasis on feeling and thinking than the hypothesis about consciousness put forward by Dennett in \"Consciousness Explained\" (1991).\n\n\n"}

Investment in art has been an accepted form of deposit investment for several decades such as the purchase of works by Matisse, Van Gogh and Picasso. However these works only have an assured value as long as there is a restricted supply of works on the open market - i.e. the artist is dead or producing small numbers of works and that the authenticity of works can be verified by a small number of sources. In the case of contemporary artists it is the interest of collectors and therefore dealers to ensure a tightly controlled line of supply.\n\nThe intricacies of art world economics were exposed by the suit of the family of Mark Rothko against the Marlborough Fine Art Gallery brought during the 1970s. In an action known as the Rothko Case, it was determined that Marlborough had knowingly manipulated their management of Rothko's works to maintain a higher sale price after his death, to the detriment of Rothko's family's interest in his estate.\n\nThe art market was hit by the 2008 financial crash; sales were down about 41 per cent by 2009, compared with a market peak of almost $66bn in 2007. Contemporary art was particularly badly hit, with sales in that category plunging almost 60 per cent over the two years 2008-09. However, by 2011 the value of sales had almost reached the record level of 2007, and they have remained between $56bn and $68bn in the years since. \n\n"}

Artists receive the Awards through an open application process.\n\nCreative Capital was founded in 1999 with Ruby Lerner as the founding director, president and Executive Director. As of May 2016, the Executive Director is Suzy Delvalle. \n\nIn its first year, Creative Capital accepted 1,810 applications. It was founded in part to offer support to artists affected by the National Endowment for the Arts' (NEA) cuts to funding for individual artists in the 1990s.\n\nThe Harvard Business School published a case study of the Creative Capital business model on March 24, 2010 titled \"Creative Capital: Sustaining the Arts.\" In a description of the study, authors G. Felda Hardymon and Ann Leamon wrote about Creative Capital’s use of a venture capital model, investing in their awardees with money as well as advice on managing their careers so that they can continue improving their careers after they’ve spent the award. As part of that sustainability, Creative Capital's system stipulates that awardees whose projects make a profit return a portion of those profits to the organization. Also, many former awardees of Creative Capital become advisors for new awardees.\n\nCreative Capital's approach to artist services centers on the idea that time and advisory services are as important to the creative process as money. As the awardee's funded project develops, Creative Capital staff meets with awardees to set goals and chart progress. Creative Capital provides funding at benchmark moments for each project, including initial funding, support to build the artist’s personal and professional capacity, follow-up support for project production, funding for the project’s premiere, and support for the project’s expansion beyond its premiere presentation. Of this type of support, Sheryl Oring, a Creative Capital awarde, has said, \"For mid-career artists like me, Creative Capital can help make the difference between whether we keep making art or give up.\"\n\nEmerging Fields\n\nMoving Image\n\nLiterature\n\nPerforming Arts\n\nVisual Arts\n\nAfter each new round of awardees is announced, Creative Capital hosts a retreat for their artists, including the most recently announced awardees, those from the previous round, other awardees as consultants as well as people connected to Creative Capital in various ways who act as consultants, workshop leaders or observers. In various workshops and meetings with consultants, artists are taught how to plan the next five years of their lives, in terms of their artistic careers as well their own lives.\n\nCreative Capital hosts a variety of events for its awardees to meet each other and others within the artistic community. Paddy Johnson has written in her noted arts blog, Art Fag City, \"These conferences offer grantees an amazing opportunity to connect with other artists and a wide range of curators, distributors, and artistic directors through mixers, meetings with consultants, and artist presentations. They also ask grantees to return to the conference every couple of years, which keeps them in touch with a constantly expanding network of creative art folk.\"\n\nIn 2003, Creative Capital founded its Professional Development Program (PDP) which offers a series of evening-, one-day- or weekend-length workshops for artists on marketing, strategic planning, self-management, fundraising, web strategies. In both presenting these workshops in-person nationally and broadcasting some online in the form of \"webinars,\" the program shares skills taught to Creative Capital grantees with other artists across the U.S. These workshops have been described as a “crash course in self-management, strategic planning, fundraising and promotion.”\n\n"}
{"id": "25347757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25347757", "title": "Dexter and sinister", "text": "Dexter and sinister\n\nDexter and sinister are terms used in heraldry to refer to specific locations in an escutcheon bearing a coat of arms, and to the other elements of an achievement. \"Dexter\" (Latin for \"right\") means to the right from the viewpoint of the bearer of the shield, \"i.e.\" the bearer's proper right, to the left from that of the viewer. \"Sinister\" (Latin for \"left\") means to the left from the viewpoint of the bearer, the bearer's proper left, to the right from that of the viewer. \n\nThe dexter side is considered the side of greater honour, for example when impaling two arms. Thus, by tradition, a husband's arms occupy the dexter half of his shield, his wife's paternal arms the sinister half. The shield of a bishop shows the arms of his see in the dexter half, his personal arms in the sinister half. King Richard II adopted arms showing the attributed arms of Edward the Confessor in the dexter half, the royal arms of England in the sinister. More generally, by ancient tradition, the guest of greatest honour at a banquet sits at the right hand of the host. The Bible is replete with passages referring to being at the \"right hand\" of God.\n\nSinister is used to mark that an ordinary or other charge is turned to the heraldic left of the shield. A \"bend sinister\" is a bend which runs from the bearer's top left to bottom right, as opposed to top right to bottom left. As the shield would have been carried with the design facing outwards from the bearer, the bend sinister would slant in the same direction as a sash worn diagonally on the left shoulder.\n\nThis division is key to dimidiation, a method of joining two coats of arms by placing the dexter half of one coat of arms alongside the sinister half of the other. In the case of marriage, the dexter half of the husband's arms would be placed alongside the sinister half of the wife's. The practice fell out of use as early as the 14th century and was replaced by impalement, as in some cases, it could render the arms that are cut in half unrecognizable and in some cases, it would result in a shield that looked like one coat of arms rather than a combination of two.\n\nThe Great Seal of the United States features an eagle clutching an olive branch in its dexter talon and arrows in its sinister talon, indicating the nation's intended inclination to peace. In 1945, one of the changes ordered for the similarly arranged Flag of the President of the United States by President Harry S. Truman was having the eagle face towards its right (dexter, the direction of honor) and thus towards the olive branch.\n\nThe sides of a shield were originally named for the purpose of military training of knights and soldiers long before heraldry came into use early in the 13th century so the only viewpoint that was relevant was the bearer's. The front of the purely-functional shield was originally undecorated.\n\nIt is likely that the use of the shield as a defensive and offensive weapon was almost as developed as that of the sword itself and so the various positions or strokes of the shield needed to be described to students of arms. Such usage may indeed have descended directly from Roman training techniques that were spread throughout Roman Europe and then continued during the age of chivalry, when heraldry came into use.\n"}

{"id": "2784767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2784767", "title": "Fantastic art", "text": "Fantastic art\n\nFantastic art is a broad and loosely defined art genre. It is not restricted to a specific school of artists, geographical location or historical period. It can be characterised by subject matter – which portrays non-realistic, mystical, mythical or folkloric subjects or events – and style, which is representational and naturalistic, rather than abstract - or in the case of magazine illustrations and similar, in the style of graphic novel art such as manga.\n\nFantasy has been an integral part of art since its beginnings, but has been particularly important in mannerism, magic realist painting, romantic art, symbolism, surrealism and lowbrow. In French, the genre is called le fantastique, in English it is sometimes referred to as \"visionary art\", \"grotesque art\" or mannerist art. It has had a deep and circular interaction with fantasy literature.\n\nThe subject matter of Fantastic Art may resemble the product of hallucinations, and Fantastic artist Richard Dadd spent much of his life in mental institutions. Salvador Dalí famously said: \"the only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad\". Some recent Fantastic Art draws on the artist's experience, or purported experience, of hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThe term Fantasy Art is closely related, and is applied primarily to recent art (typically 20th century onwards) inspired by, or illustrating, fantasy literature. The term has acquired some pejorative overtones.\n\nFantastic art has traditionally been largely confined to painting and illustration, but since the 1970s has increasingly been found also in photography. Fantastic art explores fantasy, imagination, the dream state, the grotesque, visions and the uncanny, as well as so-called \"Goth\" art.\n\nGenres which may also be considered as Fantastic Art include the Symbolism of the Victorian era, and Surrealism. Works based on classical mythology, which have been a staple of European art from the Renaissance period, also arguably meet the definition of Fantastic Art, as art based on modern mythology such as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth mythos unquestionably does. Religious art also depicts supernatural or miraculous subjects in a naturalistic way, but is not generally regarded as Fantastic Art.\n\nMany artists have produced works which fit the definition of fantastic art. Some, such as Nicholas Roerich, worked almost exclusively in the genre, others such as Hieronymus Bosch, who has been described as the first \"fantastic\" artist in the Western tradition, produced works both with and without fantastic elements, and for artists such as Francisco de Goya, fantastic works were only a small part of their output. Others again such as René Magritte are usually classed as Surrealists but use fantastic elements in their work. It is therefore impossible to give an exhaustive list of fantastic artists, but a selection of major and influential figures is listed below.\n\n\nThe rise of fantasy and science fiction \"pulp\" magazines demanded artwork to illustrate stories and (via cover art) to promote sales. This led to a movement of science fiction and fantasy artists prior to and during the Great Depression, as anthologised by Vincent Di Fate, himself a prolific SF and space artist.\n\nIn the United States in the 1930s, a group of Wisconsin artists inspired by the Surrealist movement of Europe created their own brand of fantastic art. They included Madison, Wisconsin-based artists Marshall Glasier, Dudley Huppler and John Wilde; Karl Priebe of Milwaukee and Gertrude Abercrombie of Chicago. Their art combined macabre humor, mystery and irony which was in direct and pointed contradiction to the American Regionalism then in vogue.\n\nIn postwar Chicago, the art movement Chicago Imagism produced many fantastic and grotesque paintings, which were little noted because they did not conform to New York abstract art fashions of the time. Major imagists include Roger Brown, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Ed Paschke, and Karl Wirsum.\n\nNon-European art may contain fantastic elements, although it is not necessarily easy to separate them from religious elements involving supernatural beings and miraculous events.\n\nSculptor Bunleua Sulilat is a notable contemporary Asian Fantastic artist.\n\n\n"}

The plot follows three women who arrive to a village in rural Spain looking for love and to start a new life. Very well received, the film won the International Critics' Week Grand Prix award at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nA group of women arrive by bus to a small town in the depopulated central Province of Guadalajara, where there is a scarcity of single women and economic opportunities. The men have organized an annual party to get to know available ladies with the hopes of falling in love and finding a wife. Women hope to find stability, companionship, immigration papers or a combination of the three.\n\nThe group of women include: Marirrosi, a divorced nurse from Bilbao who is lonely and looking for love; Patricia, a young woman with two children from the Dominican Republic who has been in Spain illegally and having difficulties to find decent work; and (joining later) Milady, a young Cuban who wants to see the world at any cost. They come to the town filled with eager men but not lots of opportunities other than farming. Patricia settles with Damian, a hardworking farmer who lives with his mother, Gregoria. Looking to find stability for her young children and a hard worker herself, Patricia tries in vain to find common ground with her stern mother-in-law, who seems to reject her because of her skin color and the fact that her son is no longer under her control. Patricia, with more time and experience in Spain, befriends the newcomer Milady. Milady settles with Carmelo an older Spanish man who wooed her in Havana. Carmelo tries to impress her with a big television and modern kitchen, but what she really wants to do is go to discos and have fun. She is in no way ready to settle down. Her dream of a life in Europe is very different from his fantasy of life with a gorgeous young wife. Milady is flirty and does not love Carmelo. Wanting to see the sea in Valencia, she takes a ride from a truck driver. When she comes back to town, the jealous Carmelo gives her a beating. Milady wishes she could leave him, but she has few friends and no real place to go.\n\nMarirrosi, the oldest of the three women, has a grown up son and is tired of her job in Bilbao. She finds love with Alfonso, a gentle soft-spoken gardener. However, she is unwilling to give up city life for fields and cows, while he is unwilling to even consider living in a city. Unable to resolve their differences, she eventually breaks up with him.\n\nAt the farm, Patricia receives the visit of some of her friends and this creates confrontation with Gregoria, but Damian comes to Patricia’s defense and the relation between the two women improves. However the father of Patricia’s two children reappears in her life wanting to take advantage of her steadier situation. In a frank talk with Damian, Patricia admits that if she could have found work and been able to take care for herself either in the Dominican Republic or Spain, she probably wouldn't have married him. But now that she is there, she realizes that she wants to be his companion and stable love. Damian and Patricia have an argument after her honest revelation. He believes that she is taking advantage of him and he tells her to leave with her children. At the last minute, persuaded by his mother, Damian stops them from leaving and he and Patricia reconcile. Later on, we see Patricia’s daughter making her first communion in the local church.\n\nMilady captures the attention of Oscar, a young man infatuated with her. He helps her escape the town but in a stop in a hotel she also leaves him, taking the road on her own. Carmelo deals alone with his disappointment of Milady’s sudden departure.\n\nAlfonso is devastated when he receives Marirrosi’s letter breaking up with him. At the village’s bar Alfonso gives some advice to the local single men. Another bus, full of hopeful single women, is arriving in town.\n\n\nThe film was inspired by Spanish country bachelors, such as those from Plan, who organized parties to attract marriable women from cities, since rural women tended to emigrate to the cities.\nThese \"caravans of women\" took inspiration from the Western \"Westward the Women\".\n\n\"Flores de otro mundo\" (\"flowers from another world\") was released on DVD in the United States on October 18, 2005. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles. There are no extras features.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18489984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18489984", "title": "Folio", "text": "Folio\n\nThe term \"folio\", from the Latin \"folium\" (leaf), has three interconnected but distinct meanings in the world of books and printing. It is firstly a term for a common method of arranging sheets of paper into book form, folding the sheet only once, and a term for a book made in this way. Secondly, it is a general term for a sheet, leaf or page in (especially) manuscripts and old books, and thirdly, an approximate term for the size of a book, and for a book of this size.\n\nFirstly, a folio (abbreviated fo or 2°) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded once to produce two leaves. Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. Ordinarily, additional printed folio sheets would be inserted inside one another to form a group or \"gathering\" of leaves prior to binding the book.\n\nSecondly, \"folio\" is used in terms of page numbering for some books and most manuscripts that are bound but without page numbers as an equivalent of \"page\" (both sides), \"sheet\" or \"leaf\", using \"recto\" and \"verso\" to designate the first and second sides, and (unlike the usage in printing) disregarding whether the leaf concerned is actually physically still joined with another leaf. This usually appears abbreviated: \"f26r.\" means the first side of the 26th leaf in a book. This will be on the right hand side of the opening of any book composed in a script that is read from left-to-right, such as Latin (as used in English), Cyrillic, or Greek, and will be opposite for books composed in a script that is read from right-to-left, such as Hebrew and Arabic.\n\nThirdly, \"folio\" is also used as an approximate term for a size of book, typically about tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. Other common book formats are \"quarto\" and \"octavo\", which are both also printing formats, involving two and three folds in the sheet respectively.\n\nFamous folios (in both senses) include the Gutenberg Bible, printed in about 1455, and the First Folio collected edition of Shakespeare's plays, printed in 1623; however, their actual size is rather different.\n\nA folio (from Latin foliō, abl. of folium, leaf ) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves. Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a quarto, folding each sheet twice, and octavo, folding each sheet three times. Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a paper-knife.\nThere are variations in how folios are produced. For example, bibliographers call a book printed as a folio (two leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 8 leaves each, a \"folio in 8s.\" \n\nThe Gutenberg Bible was printed in about 1455 as a folio, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once. The page size is 12 x 17.5 inches (307 x 445 mm), a \"double folio\" size. Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside one another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book. Shakespeare's First Folio edition is printed as a folio and has a page height of 12.5 inches (320 mm), making it a rather small folio size.\n\nFolios were a common format of books printed in the incunabula period (books printed before 1501), although the earliest printed book, surviving only as a fragment of a leaf, is a quarto. The British Library Incunabula Short Title Catalogue currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501, of which about 8,600 are folios, representing just over 30 percent of all works in the catalogue.\n\nIn the discussion of manuscripts, a folio means a leaf with two pages, the recto being the first the reader encounters, and the verso the second. In Western books, which are read by turning the pages over from right to left, when the book is begun with the open page edges at the reader's right, the first page to be seen is \"folio 1 recto\", typically abbreviated to \"f1 r.\". When this page is turned over \"f1 v.\" is on the left and \"f2 r.\" on the right of the \"opening\", or two pages that are visible. For books in Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and other languages, where the book is begun from the back in Western terms, with the open page edges at the reader's left, the numbering also follows the sequence in which the reader encounters.\n\nIn the discussion of two-columned manuscripts, a/b/c/d can denote the left and right-hand columns of recto and verso pages (e.g. \"f. 150a\" and \"f. 150b\" are the left and right hand columns on the recto page, and \"f. 150c\" and \"f. 150d\" the left and right hand columns on the verso page). In the discussion of three-columned manuscripts, notation may make use of folio number + recto/verso + column a/b/c (e.g. \"f. 3 v. col. c\" references the third column on the verso side of the third folio).\n\nThe actual size of a folio book depends on the size of the full sheet of paper on which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, printers used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant Folio (50 inches, 127 cm), Atlas Folio (25 inches, ca 63 cm), Elephant Folio (23 inches, ca 58 cm), Royal Folio (20 inches, ca 51 cm), Medium Folio (18 inches, ca 46 cm), and (the most common) Crown Folio (15 inches, ca 38 cm).\n\nFrom the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time. As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press). The term \"folio\" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size, i.e., books that are approximately 15 inches (38 cm) tall.\n\nFrom the earliest days of printing, folios were often used for expensive, prestigious volumes. In the Seventeenth Century, plays of the English Renaissance theatre were printed as collected editions in folio. Thirty-six of Shakespeare's plays, for example, were included in the First Folio collected edition of 1623, which was followed by additional folio editions, referred to as the Second Folio, etc. Other playwrights in this period also published their plays in folio editions, such as Ben Jonson's collected works of 1616.\n\nSee further:\n\n"}

On the reverse is a label dating its completion more precisely, to 15 February 1488. It is in the basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice.\n\nIts central scene is the Madonna and Child enthroned with two angel musicians, flanked to the left by saint Nicholas of Bari and saint Peter and to the right by saint Mark (patron of Venice) and saint Benedict. The work's division into compartments is rather old-fashioned and may have been explicitly demanded by the commissioner, but Bellini uses this to his advantage, integrating the painted architecture with the frame, which he designed himself. This develops the illusionism of his San Giobbe Altarpiece, again placing the Virgin in a deep blue mantle on a high marble throne, using a golden light and a Byzanto-Venetian-style apse. To the sides thin strips of landscape suggest a vast space behind the work, whilst the trompe l'oeil apse behind the Virgin bears an inscription reading (\"Certain gate of heaven, guide [my] mind, direct [my] life: may everything I do be entrusted to your care\").\n"}

First published in 1970, it advances Althusser's theory of ideology. Where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels posited a thinly-sketched theory of ideology as false consciousness, Althusser draws upon the works of later theorists such as Antonio Gramsci, Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to proffer a more elaborate redefinition of the theory. Althusser's theory of ideology remains influential since it was written.\n\nAlthusser begins the essay by reiterating the Marxist theory that in order to exist, a social formation is required to essentially, continuously and perpetually reproduce the productive forces (Labour power), the conditions of production and the relations of production. The reproduction of production relations is ensured by the wage system which pays a minimum amount to the workers so that they appear to work day after day, thereby limiting their vertical mobility. The reproduction of the conditions of production and the reproduction of the relations of production happens through the state apparatuses which are insidious machinations controlled by the capitalist ruling ideology in the context of a class struggle to repress, exploit, extort and subjugate the ruled class.\n\nThe Marxist spatial metaphor of the edifice describes a social formation constituted by the foundational infrastructure, i.e. the economic base, on which stands the superstructure consisting of two floors: the law/the state (the politico-legal floor) and ideology. A detailed description of both structures is provided below:\n\nThe infrastructure consists of the forces, the means, and the relations of production. The following examples reflect the concept of the infrastructure in further detail: \nThe superstructure arises from the infrastructure and consists of culture and ideology. The following examples reflect the concept of the superstructure in further detail:\nMarx's theory is that the superstructure comes from the infrastructure and reconditions ways of life and living so that the infrastructure continues to be produced.\n\nAlthusser extends this topographical paradigm by stating that the infrastructural economic base is endowed with an \"index of effectivity\" which enables it to ultimately determine the functioning of the superstructure. He scrutinizes this structural metaphor by discussing the superstructure in detail. A close study of the superstructure is necessitated due to its relative autonomy over the base and its reciprocal action on the base.\n\nThe ruling class uses the repressive state apparatuses (RSA) to dominate the working class. The basic, social function of the RSA (government, courts, police and armed forces, etc.) is timely intervention to politics in favour of the interests of the ruling class, by repressing the subordinate social classes as required, either by violent or non-violent coercive means. The ruling class controls the RSA, because they also control the powers of the state (political, legislative, armed).\nAlthusser has enhanced the Marxist theory of the state, by distinguishing the repressive apparatuses of the state from the ideological apparatuses of the state (ISA), which are an array of social institutions and multiple, political realities that propagate many ideologies — the religious ISA, the educational ISA, the family ISA, the legal ISA, the political ISA, the communications ISA, the cultural ISA, etc.\n\nThe differences between the RSA and the ISA are: \n\nMoreover, when individual persons and political groups threaten the social order established by the dominant social class, the state invokes the stabilising functions of the repressive state apparatus. As such, the benign forms of social repression affect the judicial system, where ostensibly public contractual language is invoked in order to govern individual and collective behaviour in society. As internal threats (social, political, economic) to the dominant order appear, the state applies the proportionate social repression: police suppression, incarceration, and, military intervention.\n\nIdeological state apparatuses (ISA), according to Althusser, use methods other than physical violence to achieve the same objectives as RSA. They may include educational institutions (e.g. schools), media outlets, churches, social/sports clubs and the family. These formations are ostensibly apolitical and part of civil society, rather than a \"formal\" part of the state (i.e. as is the case in RSA). In terms of psychology they could be described as psychosocial, because they aim to inculcate ways of seeing and evaluating things, events and class relations. Instead of expressing and imposing order, through violent repression, ISA disseminate ideologies that reinforce the control of a dominant class. People tend to be co-opted by fear of social rejection, e.g. ostracisation, ridicule and isolation. In Althusser's view, a social class cannot hold state power unless, and until, it simultaneously exercises hegemony (domination) over and through ISA.\n\nEducational ISA, in particular, assume a dominant role in a capitalist economy, and conceal and mask the ideology of the ruling class behind the \"liberating qualities\" of education, so that the hidden agendas of the ruling class are inconspicuous to most teachers, students, parents and other interested members of society. Althusser said that the school has supplanted the church as the crucial ISA for indoctrination, which augments the reproduction of the relations of production (i.e. the capitalist relations of exploitation) by training the students to become a source of labour power, who work for and under capitalists.\n\nHowever, because ISA cannot dominate as obviously or readily as RSA, ideological state apparatuses may themselves become a site of class struggle. That is, subordinate social classes are able to find the means and occasions to express class struggle politically and in so doing counter the dominant class, either by utilizing ideological contradictions inherent in ISA, or by campaigns to take control of positions within the ISA. This, nevertheless, will not in itself prevent the dominant class from retaining its position in control of RSA.\n\nAlthusser advances two theses on ideology: \"Ideology represents the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence\"; and \"Ideology has a material existence\". The first thesis tenders the familiar Marxist contention that ideologies have the function of masking the exploitative arrangements on which class societies are based.\n\nThe second thesis posits that ideology does not exist in the form of \"ideas\" or conscious \"representations\" in the \"minds\" of individuals. Rather, ideology consists of the actions and behaviours of bodies governed by their disposition within material apparatuses. Central to the view of individuals as responsible subjects is the notion of an explanatory link between belief and action, that\n\nFor Althusser, this is yet another effect of social practice:\n\nAccording to Althusser, the obviousness that people (you and I) are subjects is an effect of ideology. Althusser believes that there are two functions of interpellation. One function of ideology is “recognition” and the other function, its inverse, is “misrecognition”. Below are a few concrete illustrations that Althusser provides to further explain the two functions:\nAlthusser uses the term \"interpellation\" to describe the process by which ideology constitutes individual persons as subjects. The ideological social and political institutions — the family, the media, religious organisations, the education system and the discourses they propagate — 'hail' the individual in social interactions, giving the individual his or her identity. Althusser compares ideology to a policeman shouting \"hey you\" to a person walking in the street. The person responds to the call and in doing so is transformed into a subject — a self-conscious, responsible agent whose actions can be explained by his or her thoughts. Althusser thus goes against the classical definition of the subject as cause and substance, emphasising instead how the situation always precedes the (individual or collective) subject. Concrete individual persons are the carriers of ideology — they are \"always-already interpellated\" as subjects. Individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities. Althusser's argument here strongly draws from Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror stage — we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves somehow mirrored in ideologies.\n\nAs a further example, Althusser depicts Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what his place in the world is and what he must do to be reconciled with Christ. Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify himself as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside of ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure.\n\nIn his essay “Considerations on Western Marxism” (1976), Perry Anderson said that:\n\nGenerally, Althusser’s perspectives on ideology remain respected; in the \"Louis Althusser\" capsule biography, the \"Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism\", 2nd. Ed., says that “Althusser’s major concepts — Ideological State Apparatuses, Interpellation, Imaginary relations, and Overdetermination — permeate the discourse of contemporary literary and cultural theory, and his theory of ideology has influenced virtually all subsequent serious work on the topic.\"\n\n\n"}

It is based on John Ball's 1965 novel of the same name and tells the story of Virgil Tibbs, a black police detective from Philadelphia, who becomes involved in a murder investigation in a small town in Mississippi. It stars Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, and was produced by Walter Mirisch. The screenplay was by Stirling Silliphant.\n\nThe film won five Academy Awards, including the 1967 awards for Best Picture and Rod Steiger for Best Actor.\n\nThe film was followed by two sequels, \"They Call Me Mister Tibbs!\" in 1970, and \"The Organization\" in 1971. In 1988, it also became the basis of a television series adaptation of the same name.\n\nAlthough the film was set in the fictional Mississippi town of Sparta (with supposedly no connection to the real Sparta, Mississippi), most of the movie was filmed in Sparta, Illinois, where many of the film's landmarks can still be seen. The quote \"They call me \"Mister Tibbs!\" was listed as number 16 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years...100 Movie Quotes\", a list of top film quotes. In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nIn 1966, a wealthy industrialist named Phillip Colbert has moved from Chicago to Sparta, Mississippi to build a factory. One night, police officer Sam Wood discovers that Colbert has been murdered.\n\nChief Gillespie leads the investigation. A doctor estimates that Colbert had been dead for a few hours. Wood finds a black man named Virgil Tibbs at the train station and arrests him. Gillespie quickly assumes that Tibbs is the culprit and tries to get Tibbs to make a confession. However, he is embarrassed to learn that Tibbs is a top homicide detective from Philadelphia. Gillespie phones Tibbs' chief, who confirms this and recommends that Tibbs should assist them. This idea does not appeal to Gillespie or Tibbs, but they reluctantly agree.\n\nGillespie arrests another suspect, but Tibbs clears him. The victim's widow is frustrated by the ineptitude of the local police and impressed by Tibbs. She threatens to stop the construction of the factory unless Tibbs leads the investigation. Despite the rocky start, the two policemen begin to respect each other as they are forced to work together.\n\nTibbs initially suspects plantation owner Endicott, a racist who publicly opposes the new factory. When Tibbs attempts to interrogate Endicott, Endicott slaps him in the face and Tibbs slaps him back. Endicott sends a gang of hooligans after Tibbs. Gillespie rescues him from the fight and tells him to leave town for his safety, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case. He examines Colbert's body and suggests the murder happened earlier than initially thought. He examines Colbert's car and deduces that Colbert was murdered elsewhere and the culprit moved the body. Tibbs asks Wood to retrace his car patrol route on the night of the murder, and Gillespie joins them. When Tibbs notices that Wood has changed his route, Gillespie starts suspecting Wood, though Tibbs hints there is another reason.\n\nGillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit into his bank account the day after the murder while Purdy, a local, files charges against Wood for getting his 16-year-old sister Delores pregnant. Gillespie arrests Wood, despite Tibbs' protests, and Delores is interrogated. Purdy is offended that a black man was present at the interrogation, and he gathers a mob to get revenge. Tibbs reveals that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory and clears Wood. He also admits that he knew why Wood had changed his route: Delores is an exhibitionist and Wood has been spying on her.\n\nTibbs visits a backstreet abortionist, who reveals that someone paid for Delores to have an abortion. When Delores arrives, Tibbs follows her outside and is confronted by the murderer, Ralph. Purdy's mob tracks down Tibbs and holds him at gunpoint; he responds by proving that Ralph got Delores pregnant. Ralph shoots Purdy dead before Tibbs disarms him. Ralph is arrested and confesses to Colbert's murder: he robbed Colbert to fund Delores's abortion but accidentally killed him.\n\nThe final scene shows Tibbs boarding a train bound for Philadelphia, as Gillespie respectfully bids him farewell.\n\n\n\n\n\nJewison, Poitier, and Steiger worked together and got along well during the filming, but Jewison had problems with the Southern authorities, and Poitier had reservations about coming south of the Mason–Dixon Line for filming. However, despite their reservations, Jewison decided to film part of the film in Dyersburg and Union City, Tennessee, anyway while the rest was filmed in Sparta, Chester (Harvey Oberst chase scene), and Freeburg (Compton's diner), Illinois.\n\nThe famous scene of Tibbs slapping Endicott is not present in the novel. According to Poitier, the scene was almost not in the movie. In the textbook \"Civil Rights and Race Relations in the USA 1850-2009 (Access to History),\" Poitier states: \"I said, 'I'll tell you what, I'll make this movie for you if you give me your absolute guarantee when he slaps me I slap him right back and you guarantee that it will play in every version of this movie.' I try not to do things that are against nature.\" However, Poitier's version of the story is contradicted by Mark Harris in his book, \"Pictures at a Revolution\". Harris states that copies of the original draft of the screenplay that he obtained clearly contain the scene as filmed, which is backed up by Jewison and Silliphant.\n\nThe film is also important for being the first major Hollywood film in color that was lit with proper consideration for a black person. Haskell Wexler recognized that standard strong lighting used in filming tended to produce too much glare on dark complexions and rendered the features indistinct. Accordingly, Wexler toned it down to feature Poitier with better photographic results.\n\nIn contrast to films like \"The Chase\" and \"Hurry Sundown\", which offered confused visions of the South, \"In the Heat of the Night\" offered a tough, edgy vision of a Southern town that seemed to hate outsiders more than itself, a theme reflecting the uncertain mood of the time as the Civil Rights Movement attempted to take hold. Canadian director Jewison wanted to tell an anti-racist story of a white man and a black man working together in spite of difficulties. Jewison said that this film proved a conviction he had held for a long time: \"It's you against the world. It's like going to war. Everybody is trying to tell you something different and they are always putting obstacles in your way.\"\n\nIn one famous scene, Gillespie mocks the name 'Virgil' by saying \"That's a funny name for a nigger boy that comes from Philadelphia! What do they call you up there?\" An irritated Tibbs replies: \"They call me Mr. Tibbs!\" The line was later listed as number 16 on the American Film Institute's \"100 Years...100 Movie Quotes\", a list of top film quotes, and was also the title of the sequel. An iconic scene that surprised and perhaps shocked audiences at the time occurs when Tibbs is slapped by Endicott. Tibbs responds by slapping him back.\n\nIn a San Francisco pre-screening, Jewison was concerned when the young audience was laughing at the film as if it were a comedy. The audience's stunned reaction to the slapping scene convinced Jewison that the film was effective as drama. That scene helped make the film so popular for audiences, finally seeing the top black film actor physically strike back against bigotry, that the film earned the nickname, \"Super-spade Versus the Rednecks\". During the film's initial run, Steiger and Poitier occasionally went to the Capitol Theatre in New York to amuse themselves seeing how many black and white audience members there were, which could be immediately ascertained by listening to the former cheering Tibbs's retaliatory slap and the latter whispering \"Oh!\" in astonishment.\n\nThen-freshman critic Roger Ebert in 1967 gave \"In the Heat of the Night\" a positive review and placed it at number ten on his top ten list of 1967 films. AD Murphy of \"Variety magazine\" felt it was a good but uneven film.\n\nThe film currently holds a 96% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, out of 46 reviews collected with an average rating of 8.2/10. Its consensus states, \"Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted by strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman Jewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to resonate today.\"\n\nThe film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones, and the soundtrack album was released on the United Artists label in 1967. The title song performed by Ray Charles, composed by Quincy Jones, with lyrics by Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman was released as a single by ABC Records and reached #33 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and #21 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart.\n\nAllmusic's Steven McDonald said the soundtrack had \"a tone of righteous fury woven throughout\" and that \"the intent behind \"In the Heat of the Night\" was to get a Southern, blues-inflected atmosphere to support the angry, anti-racist approach of the picture .. although the cues from \"In the Heat of the Night\" show their age\". The Vinyl Factory said \"this soundtrack to a film about racism in the South has a cool, decidedly Southern-fried sound with funk-bottomed bluesy touches, like on the strutting 'Cotton Curtain', the down 'n' dirty 'Whipping Boy' or the fat 'n' sassy 'Chief's Drive to Mayor'\".\n\nAll compositions by Quincy Jones\n\n\n\"Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV\" (1972–73 edition) gives \"In the Heat of the Night\" its highest rating of 4 stars, recommending it as an \"[E]xciting, superbly acted and directed film about prejudice, manners and morals in a small Mississippi town\", with the concluding sentences stating, \"[D]irector Norman Jewison does an outstanding job in creating the subsurface tension of life in a 'sleepy' Southern town, and the supporting performances are uniformly fine. A first-rate film in all respects.\" \"Leonard Maltin's TV Movies & Video Guide\" (1989 edition) follows Scheuer's example with its own highest rating of 4 stars, concluding that \"[M]arvelous social thriller hasn't dated one bit—tough, funny, and atmospheric, with unbeatable acting and splendid Quincy Jones score. Five Oscars include Best Picture...\"\n\n\"Mick Martin's & Marsha Porter's DVD & Video Guide\" (2007 edition) also puts its rating high, at 4 stars (out of 5), finding it \"[A] rousing murder mystery elevated by the excellent acting of Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier.\"\n\nBritish references likewise show high regard for the film, with David Shipman in his 1984 \"The Good Film and Video Guide\" giving 3 (out of 4) stars, noting that \"[A]s mystery or detective story this film is only fair but it has enormous tension. Within its given framework, it is good on the colour question. There is tension in the eyes of the black (Sidney Poitier), who happens to be a homicide officer, and malevolence in those of the local police chief (Rod Steiger). These are two remarkable performances, well supported by Warren Oates, Lee Grant and Larry Gates.\"\n\nAnother British film critic with a highly personal \"Film Guide\", Leslie Halliwell, gave 2 stars (out of 4) describing it in the 5th edition (1985) as an \"[O]verrated policier in which the personality clash is amusing (and was timely) but the murder puzzle is a complete throwaway.\" The \"Guide\" continued to be published after Halliwell's death in 1989 and, in the 21st edition, \"Halliwell's Film Video & DVD Guide 2007\", John Walker, who took over as the \"Guide's\" author, raised the rating to the highest level of 4 stars and rewrote the evaluation to state that it is \"[A] tense and exciting thriller that also explores racism through the explosive clash of two contrasting personalities.\"\n\n\"In the Heat of the Night\" was first released on DVD in 2001. In 2010, the film was digitized in High Definition (1080i) and broadcast on MGM HD.\n\nIn 2014, MGM released the film on Blu-ray.\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"In the Heat of the Night\" in 1997.\n\n\"In the Heat of the Night\" was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning five.

It is an account of Garner's presence at the separate trials of Anu Singh and her friend Madhavi Rao, who were accused of murdering Singh's boyfriend Joe Cinque and Garner's attempts to understand the preceding events that led to his death as well as the legal and personal responses to the crime. The book was adapted into a 2016 film of the same name.\n\nA national bestseller, the book has sold 100,000 copies.\n\nAnu Singh, a law student at Canberra's Australian National University, killed her boyfriend Joe Cinque on 26 October 1997 with a lethal dose of heroin after she laced his coffee with Rohypnol. A number of her friends and acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him and some were present at parties she held in which he was drugged; none of these friends alerted authorities or police. She was subsequently found guilty of his manslaughter. The most involved of the friends, Madhavi Rao, was acquitted of all charges. Rao moved abroad and adopted a new identity after the conclusion of the trials, while Singh was released from prison in 2001.\n\n\"Joe Cinque's Consolation\" begins with Garner being informed of Singh's second 1999 trial and its circumstances, when it was already in progress. She becomes interested and travels from her Sydney residence to attend the hearings in Canberra. She relates her impressions of the trial, including her negative reactions to Singh and her mystification at Rao's and others' lack of shock at and complicity in Singh's plans, which she determines to be a state of apathy and abandonment of compassion. As the trial progresses she becomes acquainted with Cinque's mother Maria and feels that the court system is not distributing sufficient justice to the victim or his family. \n\nAfter the trial Garner interviews Singh's family and attempts to interview Singh and Rao, but both refuse or are uncontactable. Because of Singh's refusal to be interviewed or contacted, Garner bases most of her information about the woman from erstwhile friends, anecdotal evidence and court transcripts. Singh is portrayed as somewhat narcissistic, with significant self-esteem issues. Additionally, Garner notes the accused kept diaries about her interactions with men as a teen in which she treated them as disposable commodities, wore high heels to high school, and according to anecdotal evidence from her former best friend, treated Cinque with an element of derision–sometimes mocking him and making jibes about what she thought was a lack of intellect to her friends. Many of Singh's former friends thought her to be shallow and self-obsessed. \n\nAs the book progresses, Garner becomes interested in victim's rights, interviews the presiding judge and repeatedly visits and becomes a friend of Cinque's family, and eventually concludes that the purpose of the book is to be consolation for Joe Cinque, as the trial proceedings could not be. \n\nGarner uses the case to explore far-reaching themes of human behaviour, culpability and responsibility, duty of care, victims' rights and crime/punishment. She also touches on issues that range from the nature of human memory, including how it is not explicitly clear or cohesive, nor is it linear, and thus under cross-examination in a courtroom, any kind of lapse in memory, or contradiction of a preceding statement, may portray a person as a liar or an unworthy witness. \n\nClass and cultural clashes are drawn between the working class Italian-Australian family of the Cinques, compared to the \"professional class\" Indian-Australian family of the Singhs. That comparison starkly juxtaposes the blue-collar or working class Cinques (although Joe Cinque had a degree in engineering) with the middle class status of the Singhs. \n\nFurthermore, the use of psychiatry in law, is alluded to various times. Garner questions whether a \"psychological sophistication\" that has developed in light of modern behavioural science overrides the fact that some actions are plainly wrong and should be punishable, regardless of the pathology of the person who commits them. She poses this question in reference to Anu Singh. Singh's defence team used her \"abnormality of mind\" (a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and psychotic depression was referenced in the court proceedings) as an explanation for her killing Cinque, akin to the insanity defense. \n\nFinally, Garner laments on the perfunctory decision that the Crown psychiatrist would not be given direct access to Singh, and her diagnosis would be made instead on the basis of transcripts and interviews with mental health professionals in the past – Garner admits this \"floored\" her. Additionally, one reviewer writing for the \"Australian Book Review\" opined that it was Maria Cinque who called out the \"flaky moral relativism\" of the ANU students who were indifferent to Singh's plans, as well as the Canberra courts, the defence lawyers and the judge who handled the case. The complicity of the students, and whether or not they played a role in Cinque's death by not alerting authorities, was also a topic debated extensively throughout the text.\n\n\"Joe Cinque's Consolation\" was reviewed in a number of major newspapers and magazines. It was praised for its writing and its positioning as Joe Cinque's story. Criticisms of the book centered on it failing to tell the story it set out to tell, particularly its inability to explain Singh or her actions and her failure to engage with the purpose of the adversarial justice system. Some saw this as a deliberate attempt by Garner as an author angle she chose to pursue–to honour Cinque, whose family had been not given a voice or adequate justice by the court. In his review for the \"Australian Book Review\", Peter Rose remarked that \"books such as Joe Cinque’s Consolation often dignify the parents’ agony and indignation. In Maria Cinque we have one of the great stalwarts in this literature of loss. She is always there in court – listening, occasionally hissing and weeping, raging when she must. ‘They were keeping vigil,’ Garner says, marvelling at the Cinques’ stamina. Which is what Garner becomes conscious of doing.\" He further commented on the book being Garner's conscious testament to the injustice dealt to Joe Cinque and his family: \"For what are these books but tributes to the dead, swipes at our forgetfulness, minor consolations for the living: the parents and siblings and friends who feel devastated and betrayed? One thinks of all the unattested lives, the little murders\".\n\nElisabeth Hanscombe, writing for Academia, wrote that Garner's writing, and her depiction of Anu Singh, addressed the notion that for a layperson it \"may perhaps be difficult to understand that someone can be extremely intelligent, can function well academically, be beautiful and at the same time be seriously disturbed\".\n\nOne reviewer compared it with \"The First Stone\" (1995), noting that it was less about the underlying debates and more about the story. Another, Maryanne Dever (writing for the \"Australian Women's Book Review\") criticised similarities in the themes of both books, particularly Garner's perceived hostility to the women subjects and their physical appearance.\n\nThe cover of the re-printed edition from 2006 contains a blurb extracted from a review in \"The Bulletin\", which reads: \"A book which functions at one level as a psychological mystery, but at deeper levels is an exploration of the adequacy of the law to dispense justice, and the responsibility that human beings have to each other...It is told with compassion, a singular kind of honesty, and unadorned intelligence\".\n\nBoth Singh herself and Cinque's parents gave interviews shortly after the book's release. Singh recounted her own memories of the killing and her feelings about it after her release and expressed regret at not agreeing to an interview by Garner. She told interviewers that she wished to redress some of the book's imbalance towards her. \n\nMaria Cinque said that she would never forgive Singh for killing her son and did not believe her defence against the murder charge. Garner also stated that she still did not understand or empathise with Singh, although some aspects of her behaviour resonated.\n\n\nTwelve years after publication, the book was adapted into a 2016 film by writer/director Sotiris Dounoukos and Matt Rubinstein, and produced by Matt Reeder of Night Kitchen Productions. Principal photography ran for seven weeks in Canberra during April to June 2015. There was a principal cast of around 40 main and supporting characters, plus around 300 extras.\n"}

Know-how is often tacit knowledge, which means that it is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalising it. Dubickis and Gaile-Sarkane (2017) states that the performance of know-how transfer is affected by accuracy of the stated aim, applied teaching, learning and assessment methods and both internal and external environment characteristics of the stakeholders involved in the process. The opposite of tacit knowledge is explicit knowledge.\n\nIn the context of industrial property (now generally viewed as intellectual property or IP), know-how is a component in the transfer of technology in national and international environments, co-existing with or separate from other IP rights such as patents, trademarks and copyright and is an economic asset. When it is transferred by itself, know-how should be converted into a trade secret before transfer in a legal agreement.\n\nKnow-how can be defined as \"confidentially held\", or better, \"closely held\" information in the form of unpatented inventions, formulae, designs, drawings, procedures and methods, together with accumulated skills and experience in the hands of a licensor firm's professional personnel which could assist a transferee/licensee of the object product in its manufacture and use and bring to it a competitive advantage. It can be further supported with privately maintained expert knowledge on the operation, maintenance, use/application of the object product and of its sale, usage or disposition.\n\nThe inherent proprietary value of know-how lies embedded in the legal protection afforded to trade secrets in general law, particularly, \"case law\". Know-how, in short, is \"private intellectual property\" which can be said to be a form of precursor to other intellectual property rights. The \"trade secret law\" varies from country to country, unlike the case for patents, trademarks and copyright for which there are formal \"conventions\" through which subscribing countries grant the same protection to the \"property\" as the others; examples of which are the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), under United Nations, a supportive organization designed \"to encourage creative activity, [and] to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world\".\n\nA trade- secret may be defined as\nFor purposes of illustration, the following may be a provision in a license agreement serving to define know-how:\n\nShow-how is a diluted form of know-how since even a walk-through of a manufacturing plant provides valuable insights to the client's representatives into how a product is made, assembled, or processed. Show-how is also used to demonstrate technique. \n\nAn enlarged program of show-how is the typical content of Technical Assistance Agreements where the licensor firm, if one is involved, provides a substantial training program to the client's personnel on-site and off-site. (Note: Such training does not imply any grant of \"license\".) \n\nThere are two sets of agreements associated with the transfer of know-how agreement: (a) the disclosure and (b) the non-disclosure agreements, which are not separately parts of the principal know-how agreement. \n\nThe initial need for \"disclosure\" is due to the requirement of a licensee firm to know what is the specific, unique, or general \"content\" of the know-how that a licensor firm possesses that promises value to the licensee on entering into a contract. Disclosure also aids the potential licensee in selecting among competitive offers, if any. Such disclosures are made by licensors only under non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements in which there are express undertakings that should the ultimate license not materialize, the firm to whom the disclosure is made will not reveal - and equally important - by any manner apply, any part of the disclosed knowledge which is not in the public domain or previously known to the firm receiving the information.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are undertaken by those who receive confidential information from the \"licensee\", relating to licensed know-how, so as to perform their tasks. Among them are the personnel of engineering firms who construct the plant for the licensee or those who are key employees of the licensee who have detailed access to disclosed data, etc. to administer their functions in operating the know-how-based plant. These are also in the nature of confidentiality agreements and carry the definition of know-how, in full or truncated part, on a need-to-know basis.\n\nOutside usage in terms of industrial property, know-how is viewed as procedural knowledge (a term that also reveals its nature).\n\nUnder English law, employees have a duty of good faith and fidelity until their employment ceases whereby only the former still applies. \n\nIt is sometimes unclear what forms \"know how\" that was divulged to an employee in order to carry out their functions and then becomes their own knowledge rather than a secret of their previous employer. Some employers will specify in their employment contracts that a \"grace period\" will apply to know how that starts when a person leaves them as an employee. \n\nSpecifying exactly what information this includes would increase the likelihood of it being upheld in court in the event of a breach, i.e. saying \"when your employment contract is terminated, you must keep all information about your previous employment with us secret for 4 years\" would be difficult to support because that person has to be able to use the skills and knowledge they learnt to gain employment elsewhere.\n\n"}

{"id": "11404473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11404473", "title": "Mapback", "text": "Mapback\n\nMapback is a term used by paperback collectors to refer to the earliest paperback books published by Dell Books, beginning in 1943. The books are known as mapbacks because the back cover of the book contains a map that illustrates the location of the action. Dell books were numbered in series. Mapbacks extend from #5 to at least #550; then maps became less of a fixed feature of the books and disappeared entirely in 1951. (Numbers 1 through 4 had no map, although a later re-publication of #4, \"The American Gun Mystery\" by Ellery Queen, added a map.) The occasional number in the series between #5 and #550 contains no map, but some sort of full-page graphic or text connected with the book's contents. \n\nThe artwork of the maps began with quite detailed maps, and later numbers contain more stylized ones. \"The back cover map was very popular with readers and remains popular with collectors ... the Dell 'mapbacks' are among the most well known vintage paperbacks.\"\n\n\"Dell's most memorable design innovation was not on the front but on the back covers ... the entire back covers given over to maps, or variously charts, blueprints, or what have you to represent story locale or scene of the crime: a stretch of California highway, the interior of an apartment, a sheik's 'city of stones.' It was an enjoyable if slightly goofy gimmick and, amazingly, managed to last nearly ten years.\"\n\n\"Besides distinctive front covers and back-cover maps, Dell paperbacks also had a number of other interesting features, including an \"eye-in-keyhole\" logo, front-cover blurbs, character lists, lists of key items or events in the book (\"tantalizer-pages\"), crowded title pages, and special chapter titles.\"\n\nSome publishers, including Dell, thoughtfully included brief lists of the main characters in their books -- especially in mysteries -- to allow readers to keep the characters straight. In mapbacks, \"Persons this Mystery is about\" followed the inside flyleaf, and gave a short descriptive paragraph. For instance, the protagonist of the mapback shown at right is described as follows:\n\nThe \"tantalizer-pages\" contained two features meant to entice the browsing reader. \"What this Mystery is about\" gives a list of clues and events that are found within. Those from \"Rim of the Pit\" include:\n\nAnd the enticing section, \"Wouldn't you like to Know --\"\n\nOf course, non-mysteries had somewhat less tantalizing clues and questions, but the same format was kept. The \"List of Exciting Chapters\" featured chapter titles which were frequently added or changed by Dell editors.\n\nMapbacks were primarily mysteries, but many different sorts of books found their way into this inclusive line. A few oddities were published without a map on the back cover. Dell \"War Books\" such as #26, \"The Raft\" and #32, \"This Time For Keeps\", had back covers which exhorted the reader to \"Buy War Bonds and Stamps\", as did books of jokes and cartoons such as #38, \"Liberty Laughs\" and #77, \"G.I. Jokes\". The rarest mapback of all is #278, \"Second Dell Book of Crossword Puzzles\" edited by Kathleen Rafferty, also map-less. \n\nTwo other genres which had a number of entries in the mapback line were romances and Westerns. Romances were not frequent, and were by \"name\" authors such as Faith Baldwin (#116, \"Honor Bound\") and Mary Renault (#189, \"Kind Are Her Answers\"), only occasionally descending to the level of the \"nurse romance\". The quality of Westerns was also generally high, including authors such as William MacLeod Raine (#179, \"Trail's End\") and Bliss Lomax (Harry Sinclair Drago) (#271, \"Gunsmoke and Trail Dust\"). \n\nThere are a number of movie tie-in novels in the series. One of the most significant is #262, \"Rope\" as by Alfred Hitchcock -- actually written by Don Ward -- with a cover featuring James Stewart. The second mapback edition of Gerald Butler's \"Kiss The Blood Off My Hands\" is published as \"The Unafraid\", with a cover photograph of Joan Fontaine and Burt Lancaster. Other novels in the series are those upon which well-known films were based, although without movie tie-in covers -- these include \"Tugboat Annie\", \"The Sheik\", \"Now, Voyager\", \"The Harvey Girls\" and Mary Roberts Rinehart's \"The Bat\". \n\nBut by far the largest number of mapbacks is made up of mysteries. The mapback series contains some significant first editions (\"first as such\") by famous authors such as Dashiell Hammett, and interesting editions of such authors as Rex Stout (\"\" #45; \"The Red Bull\" #70), Agatha Christie, Cornell Woolrich, Erle Stanley Gardner writing as A. A. Fair, John Dickson Carr and his alter ego Carter Dickson, and Ellery Queen. There are editions of other mysteries which have stood the test of time and are still considered moderately significant today, such as the works of Phoebe Atwood Taylor (under her own name and as Alice Tilton), Patricia Wentworth, Stuart Palmer, Clayton Rawson, Earl Derr Biggers, Patricia McGerr, Baynard Kendrick, Margaret Millar, Mary Roberts Rinehart, C. W. Grafton (father of Sue Grafton) and many others. \n\nThe Dell mapback line also contains a number of mysteries by writers who have fallen out of favor over the years -- or who were never popular. Collectors cherish the camp value of such mysteries as \"Murder Wears Mukluks\" by Eunice Mays Boyd, \"The Body That Wasn't Uncle\" by George Worthing Yates, and \"Death Wears a White Gardenia\" by Zelda Popkin.\n\nThe mapback line is also notable for what it does not contain -- mapbacks never partook of two popular trends in the 1950s that flourished at other paperback houses, namely the \"lesbian confession\" novel and the \"juvenile delinquent\" or \"juvie\" novel.\n\n"}
{"id": "13796303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13796303", "title": "Mariana (Millais)", "text": "Mariana (Millais)\n\nMariana is an 1851 oil-on-wood painting by John Everett Millais. The image is based on the solitary Mariana from William Shakespeare's \"Measure for Measure\", written between 1601 and 1606. In the play, Mariana was to be married, but was rejected when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck. Her story was retold in \"Mariana\", a poem published in 1830 by Tennyson, which provided additional inspiration for Millais' painting. The painting is regarded as an example of Millais' \"precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist\".\n\nMillais was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before Raphael—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate.\n\nWhen it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851, the display caption contained lines from Tennyson's \"Mariana\" (1830):\n\n<poem>\n    She only said, 'My life is dreary,\n      He cometh not,' she said;\n    She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,'\n      I would that I were dead!'\n</poem>\n\nThe painting is packed with details that help the viewer to read the narrative of the work along with Tennyson's poetry. Everything from the rolled embroidery that Mariana has been working on and the leaves outside of the window point the reader in the direction of the narrative which is about a young woman rejected by her fiancé because her dowry was lost at sea. It is about waiting and the passage of time, which Millais shows by the arched-back pose of the woman. The pose makes it seem like she has been sitting too long and she must stand up to stretch before she sits again. The rolled embroidery on the table gives the viewer a clue as to how long Mariana has been working on it.\n\nIn the painting \"Mariana\", Millais included many details that relate directly to Tennyson's poetry. One example is the curtain. In the poem, Tennyson wrote, \"When thickest dark did trance the sky, She drew her casement-curtain by, and glanced athwart the glooming flats\". Although there is not a curtain in Millais' painting, this line is similar to the scene that is presented outside of the window. The viewer perceives an ominous feeling, just like the dark storm that Tennyson alludes to in the line above. The little mouse that is on the floor towards the bottom right corner is a detail that Millais took from Tennyson's poem: \"the mouse behind the mouldering wainscots shriek'd or from the crevice peer'd about\". Together, Millais' painting and Tennyson's poem create an intriguing storyline for the reader to follow.\n\n"}

Founded in 1922 as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), its original goal was to ensure the viability of the American film industry. In addition, the MPAA established guidelines for film content which resulted in the creation of the Production Code in 1930. This code, also known as the Hays Code, was replaced by a voluntary film rating system in 1968, which is managed by the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA).\n\nMore recently, the MPAA has advocated for the motion picture and television industry, with the goals of promoting effective copyright protection, reducing piracy, and expanding market access. It has long worked to curb copyright infringement, including recent attempts to limit the sharing of copyrighted works via peer-to-peer file-sharing networks and by streaming from pirate sites. Former United States Ambassador to France Charles Rivkin is the current chairman and CEO of the MPAA.\n\nThe MPAA was founded as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) in 1922 as a trade association of member motion picture companies. At its founding, MPPDA member companies produced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the films made in the United States. Former Postmaster General Will H. Hays was named the association's first president.\n\nThe main focus of the MPPDA in its early years was on producing a strong public relations campaign to ensure that Hollywood remained financially stable and able to attract investment from Wall Street, while simultaneously ensuring that American films had a \"clean moral tone\". The MPPDA also instituted a code of conduct for Hollywood's actors in an attempt to govern their behavior offscreen. Finally, the code sought to protect American film interests abroad by encouraging film studios to avoid racist portrayals of foreigners.\n\nFrom the early days of the association, Hays spoke out against public censorship, and the MPPDA worked to raise support from the general public for the film industry's efforts against such censorship. Large portions of the public opposed censorship, but also decried the lack of morals in movies.\n\nAt the time of the MPPDA's founding, there was no national censorship, but some state and municipal laws required movies to be censored, a process usually oveseen by a local censorship board. Thus, in certain locations in the U.S., films were often edited to comply with local laws regarding the onscreen portrayal of violence and sexuality, among other topics. This resulted in negative publicity for the studios and decreasing numbers of theater goers, who were uninterested in films that were sometimes so severely edited that they were incoherent. In 1929, more than 50 percent of American moviegoers lived in a location overseen by such a board.\n\nIn 1924, Hays instituted \"The Formula\", a loose set of guidelines for filmmakers, in an effort to get the movie industry to self-regulate the issues that the censorship boards had been created to address. \"The Formula\" requested that studios send synopses of films being considered to the MPPDA for review. This effort largely failed, however, as studios were under no obligation to send their scripts to Hays's office, nor to follow his recommendations.\n\nIn 1927, Hays oversaw the creation of a code of \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls\" for the industry. This list outlined the issues that movies could encounter in different localities. Hays also created a Studio Relations Department (SRD) with staff available to the studios for script reviews and advice regarding potential problems. Again, despite Hays' efforts, studios largely ignored the \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls,\" and by the end of 1929, the MPPDA received only about 20 percent of Hollywood scripts prior to production, and the number of regional and local censorship boards continued to increase.\n\nIn 1930, the MPPDA introduced the Production Code, sometimes called the \"Hays Code\". The Code consisted of moral guidelines regarding what was acceptable to include in films. Unlike the \"Dont's and Be Carefuls\", which the studios had ignored, the Production Code was endorsed by studio executives. The Code incorporated many of the \"Don'ts and Be Carefuls\" as specific examples of what could not be portrayed. Among other rules, the code prohibited inclusion of \"scenes of passion\" unless they were essential to a film's plot; \"pointed profanity\" in either word or action; \"sex perversion\"; justification or explicit coverage of adultery; sympathetic treatment of crime or criminals; dancing with \"indecent\" moves; and white slavery. Because studio executives had been involved in the decision to adopt the code, MPPDA-member studios were more willing to submit scripts for consideration. However, the growing economic impacts of the Great Depression of the early 1930s increased pressure on studios to make films that would draw the largest possible audiences, even if it meant taking their chances with local censorship boards by disobeying the Code.\n\nIn 1933 and 1934 the Catholic Legion of Decency, along with a number of Protestant and women's groups, launched plans to boycott films that they deemed immoral. In order to avert boycotts which might further harm the profitability of the film industry, the MPPDA created a new department, the Production Code Administration (PCA), with Joseph Breen as its head. Unlike previous attempts at self-censorship, PCA decisions were binding—no film could be exhibited in an American theater without a stamp of approval from the PCA, and any producer attempting to do so faced a fine of $25,000. After ten years of unsuccessful voluntary codes and expanding local censorship boards, the studio approved and agreed to enforce the codes, and the nationwide \"Production Code\" was enforced starting on July 1, 1934.\n\nIn the years that immediately followed the adoption of the Code, Breen often sent films back to Hollywood for additional edits, and in some cases, simply refused to issue PCA approval for a film to be shown. At the same time, Hays promoted the industry's new focus on wholesome films and continued promoting American films abroad.\n\nFor nearly three years, studios complied with the Code. By 1938, however, as the threat of war in Europe loomed, movie producers began to worry about the possibility of decreased profits abroad. This led to a decreased investment in following the strictures of the code, and occasional refusals to comply with PCA demands. That same year, responding to trends in European films in the run-up to the war, Hays spoke out against using movies as a vehicle for propaganda. In 1945, after 24 years as president, Hays stepped down from his position at the MPPDA, although he continued to act as an advisor for the Association for the next five years.\n\nIn 1945 the MPPDA hired Eric Johnston, four-time president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, to replace Hays. During his first year as president, Johnston rebranded the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).\n\nHe also created the Motion Picture Export Association (MPEA) to promote American films abroad by opposing production company monopolies in other countries. In 1947 the MPEA voted to discontinue film shipments to Britain after the British government imposed an import tax on American films. Johnston negotiated with the British government to end the tax in 1948, and film shipments resumed.\n\nIn 1956, Johnston oversaw the first major revision of the Production Code since it was created in 1930. This revision allowed the treatment of some subjects which had previously been forbidden, including abortion and the use of narcotics, so long as they were \"within the limits of good taste\". At the same time, the revisions added a number of new restrictions to the code, including outlawing the depiction of blasphemy and mercy killings in films.\n\nJohnston was well-liked by studio executives, and his political connections helped him function as an effective liaison between Hollywood and Washington. In 1963, while still serving as president of the MPAA, Johnston died of a stroke. For three years, the MPAA operated without a president while studio executives searched for a replacement.\n\nThe MPAA hired Jack Valenti, former aide to President Lyndon Johnson, as president of the MPAA in 1966. In 1968, Valenti replaced the Production Code with a system of voluntary film ratings, in order to limit censorship of Hollywood films and provide parents with information about the appropriateness of films for children. In addition to concerns about protecting children, Valenti stated in his autobiography that he sought to ensure that American filmmakers could produce the films they wanted, without the censorship that existed under the Production Code that had been in effect since 1934.\n\nIn 1975 Valenti established the Film Security Office, an anti-piracy division at the MPAA, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films to prevent duplication. Valenti continued to fight piracy into the 1980s, asking Congress to install chips in VCRs that would prevent illegal reproduction of video cassettes, and in the 1990s supported law enforcement efforts to stop bootleg distribution of video tapes. Valenti also oversaw a major change in the ratings system that he had helped create—the removal of the \"X\" rating, which had come to be closely associated with pornography. It was replaced with a new rating, \"NC-17\", in 1990.\n\nIn 2001 Valenti established the Digital Strategy Department at the MPAA to specifically address issues surrounding digital film distribution and piracy.\n\nAfter serving as president of the MPAA for 38 years, Valenti announced that he would step down in 2004. In September of that year, he was replaced by former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. During his tenure, Glickman focused on tax issues, content protection efforts, and increasing U.S. studios' access to international markets. He led lobbying efforts that resulted in $400 million in federal tax incentives for the movie industry, and also supported a law which created federal oversight of anti-piracy efforts. Glickman stepped down in 2010.\n\nAfter a search which lasted over a year, the MPAA hired former U.S. Senator Chris Dodd to replace Glickman in March 2011. In his role as president, Dodd focused on content protection, trade, and improving Hollywood's image. He traveled to China in 2011 in an effort to encourage the Chinese government to both crack down on piracy and further open its film market. A settlement of a long-argued World Trade Organization complaint, coupled with Dodd's efforts, contributed to the United States' agreement with China in 2012 to open China's film market to more Hollywood films and to increase U.S. studios' share of box office revenues in China. In addition to this agreement with China, the U.S. signed more than 20 memos of understanding with foreign governments regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights during Dodd's tenure at the MPAA.\n\nIn 2011, the MPAA supported the passage of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). After the two bills were shelved in early 2012, Dodd indicated that Hollywood might cut off campaign contributions to politicians who failed to support anti-piracy efforts in the future.\n\nIn 2012, the MPAA launched the Diversity and Multicultural Outreach program, as part of an effort to increase diversity in the television and film industry both through employment and representation on screen. Since its inception, the Diversity and Multicultural and Outreach group has conducted outreach and partnered with more than 20 multicultural groups and national civil rights organizations in sponsoring film screenings, festivals, and other diversity-themed events.\n\nThroughout his tenure at the MPAA, Dodd also highlighted the need for movie studios to embrace technology as a means of distributing content.\n\nIn June 2017, the MPAA supported the launch of the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), a coalition of entertainment companies, including the six major studios, Netflix and Amazon, that will draw on the MPAA's resources in an effort to reduce online piracy through research and legal efforts.\n\nAs announced on April 28, 2017, former U.S. Ambassador to France and Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Charles Rivkin succeeded Chris Dodd as CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, effective September 5, 2017, and as chairman, effective December 6, 2017.\n\nIn 1968, the MPAA established the Code and Rating Administration, or CARA (later renamed the Classification and Rating Administration), which began issuing ratings for films exhibited and distributed commercially in the United States to help parents determine what films are appropriate for their children.\n\nSince the rating system was first introduced in November 1968, it has gone through several changes, including the addition of a PG-13 rating. The ratings system is completely voluntary, and ratings have no legal standing. Instead, theater owners enforce the MPAA film ratings after they have been assigned, with many theaters refusing to exhibit non-rated films. An unrated film is often denoted by \"NR\", such as in newspapers, although this is not a formal MPAA rating.\n\nIn 2006 the film \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" alleged that the MPAA gave preferential treatment to member studios during the process of assigning ratings, as well as criticizing the rating process for its lack of transparency. In response, the MPAA posted its ratings rules, policies, and procedures, as well as its appeals process, online.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study commissioned by CARA, ninety-three percent of parents in the U.S. find the rating system to be a helpful tool.\n\nThe ratings currently used by the MPAA's voluntary system are:\n\nThe original members of the MPAA were the \"Big Eight\" film studios, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Loews, Universal Studios, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, United Artists, and RKO Pictures. Two years later, Loews merged with Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Productions to form Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nUnited Artists briefly resigned from the organization in 1956 over a ratings dispute, although they rejoined later in the decade. By 1966, Allied Artists Pictures had joined the original members. In the following decade, new members joining the MPAA included Avco Embassy in 1975 and Walt Disney Studios in 1979. The next year, Filmways became a MPAA member, but was later replaced in 1986 along with Avco Embassy when the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Orion Pictures joined the MPAA roster.\n\nIn 1995 the MPAA members were: the Walt Disney Studios; Paramount Pictures; Universal Studios; Warner Bros; 20th Century Fox; MGM—which included United Artists after their 1981 merger—and Sony Pictures, which included Columbia and TriStar Pictures after their acquisition in 1989. Turner Entertainment joined the MPAA in 1995, but was purchased in 1996 by Time Warner.\n\nAs of 2017 the MPAA member companies are: Walt Disney Studios; Paramount Pictures Corporation; Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.; Twentieth Century Fox; Universal Studios LLC; and Warner Bros Entertainment Inc.\n\nThe MPAA's concerted efforts at fighting copyright infringement began in 1975 with the establishment of the Film Security Office, which sought to recover unauthorized recordings of films in order to prevent duplication. The MPAA has continued to pursue a number of initiatives to combat illegal distribution of films and TV shows, especially in response to new technologies. In the 1980s, it spoke out against VCRs and the threat that the MPAA believed they represented to the movie industry, with MPAA president Jack Valenti drawing a parallel between the threat of the VCR and that of the Boston Strangler. In 1986, the MPAA asked Congress to pass a law that would require VCRs to come equipped with a chip to prevent them from making copies. Legal efforts at stopping homemade copies of broadcast television largely ended, however, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that such copying constituted fair use.\n\nThe MPAA continued to support law enforcement efforts to stop bootleg production and distribution of videos tapes and laserdiscs into the 1990s, and in 2000 took successful legal action against individuals posting DVD decryption software on the Internet in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes. Following the release of RealDVD—an application that enabled users to make copies of DVDs—RealNetworks sued the DVD Copy Control Association and the major studios in 2008 over the legality of the software, accusing them of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. The judgment found there were no grounds for the antitrust claim and dismissed the suit. The court later found that the RealNetworks product violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nThe MPAA has continued to support law enforcement efforts to prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials online. The MPAA and its British counterpart, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT), also funded the training of Lucky and Flo, a pair of Labrador Retrievers, to detect polycarbonates used in the manufacturing of DVDs.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the MPAA began focusing its efforts to curb copyright infringement specifically on peer-to-peer file sharing, initially using a combination of educational campaigns and cease and desist letters to discourage such activity. In the first six months of 2002, the MPAA sent more than 18,000 such letters to internet service providers to forward to users engaged in copyright infringement.\n\nIn late 2004, the MPAA changed course and filed lawsuits in a concerted effort to address copyright infringement on a number of large online file-sharing services, including BitTorrent and eDonkey. The following year, the MPAA expanded its legal actions to include lawsuits against individuals who downloaded and distributed copyrighted material via peer-to-peer networks.\n\nThe MPAA also played a role in encouraging the Swedish government to conduct a raid of the Pirate Bay file-sharing website in May 2006. Swedish officials have acknowledged that part of the motivation for the raid was the threat of sanctions from the World Trade Organization, along with a letter from the MPAA.\n\nIn 2013 the Center for Copyright Information unveiled the Copyright Alert System, a system established through an agreement between the MPAA, the Recording Industry Association of America, and five of the USA's largest internet service providers. The system used a third-party service to identify content being distributed illegally. Users were then informed that their accounts were being used for possible copyright infringement and were provided with information about ways to get authorized content online. Users who received multiple notices of infringement faced \"mitigations measures,\" such as temporary slowing of their Internet service, but the system did not include termination of subscriber accounts. Subscribers facing such action had a right to appeal to the American Arbitration Association. In January 2017, the Copyright Alert System was discontinued. While no official reason was given, the MPAA's general counsel stated that the system had not been equipped to stop repeat infringers.\n\nOn December 24, 2014, the Sony Pictures hack revealed that following a lawsuit in which the MPAA won a multimillion judgment against Hotfile, a file hosting website, the MPAA colluded with Hotfile to misrepresent the settlement so that the case would serve as a deterrent. The settlement was previously believed to be $80 million and was widely reported; however, Hotfile only paid the studios $4 million and agreed to have the $80 million figure recorded as the judgment and the website shut down.\n\nIn a case resolved in 2015, the MPAA and others supported the United States International Trade Commission (ITC)'s decision to consider electronic transmissions to the U.S. as \"articles\" so that it could prevent the importation of digital files of counterfeit goods. While the case being considered by the ITC involved dental appliances, the ITC could have also used such authority to bar the importation of pirated movies and TV shows from rogue foreign websites that traffic in infringing content. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals took up the matter, and ultimately ruled against the ITC.\n\nIn 2016, the MPAA reported Putlocker as one of the \"top 5 rogue cyberlocker services\" to the Office of the United States Trade Representative as a major piracy threat; the website was then blocked in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe MPAA has also produced publicity campaigns to discourage piracy. The \"Who Makes Movies?\" advertising campaign in 2003 highlighted workers in the movie industry describing how piracy affected them. The video spots ran as trailers before movies, and as television advertisements. In 2004, the MPAA began using the slogan \"You can click, but you can't hide\". This slogan appeared in messages that replaced file-sharing websites after they had been shut down through MPAA legal action. It also appeared in posters and videos distributed to video stores by the MPAA. Also in 2004, the MPAA partnered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore to release a trailer shown before films in theaters equating piracy with theft. The trailer was later placed at the beginning of the video on many DVDs in such a way that it could not be bypassed (not being able to skip or fast-forward), which triggered criticism and a number of parodies.\n\nIn 2005 the MPAA commissioned a study to examine the effects of file sharing on movie industry profitability. The study concluded that the industry lost $6.1 billion per year to piracy, and that up to 44 percent of domestic losses were due to file sharing by college students. In 2008, the MPAA revised the percentage of loss due to college students down to 15 percent, citing human error in the initial calculations of this figure. Beyond the percentage of the loss that was attributable to college students, however, no other errors were found in the study.\n\nIn 2015, theaters began airing the MPAA's \"I Make Movies\" series, an ad campaign intended to combat piracy by highlighting the stories of behind-the-scenes employees in the film and television industry. The series pointed audiences to the MPAA's \"WhereToWatch\" website (later dubbed \"The Credits\") which provides attention to the behind-the-scenes creativity involved in making movies.\n\nThe MPAA itself has been accused of copyright infringement on multiple occasions. In 2007, the creator of a blogging platform called Forest Blog accused the MPAA of violating the license for the platform, which required that users link back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA had used the platform for its own blog, but without linking back to the Forest Blog website. The MPAA subsequently took the blog offline, and explained that the software had been used on a test basis and the blog had never been publicized.\n\nAlso in 2007, the MPAA released a software toolkit for universities to help identify cases of file sharing on campus. The software used parts of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, released under the General Public License, which stipulates that the source code of any projects using the distribution be made available to third parties. The source code for the MPAA's toolkit, however, was not made available. When the MPAA was made aware of the violation, the software toolkit was removed from their website.\n\nIn 2006, the MPAA admitted having made illegal copies of \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" (a documentary exploring the MPAA itself and the history of its rating system) — an act which \"Ars Technica\" explicitly described as hypocrisy and which Roger Ebert called \"rich irony\". The MPAA subsequently claimed that it had the legal right to copy the film despite this being counter to the filmmaker's explicit request, because the documentary's exploration of the MPAA's ratings board was potentially a violation of the board members' privacy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5166417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5166417", "title": "National Monument to the Forefathers", "text": "National Monument to the Forefathers\n\nThe National Monument to the Forefathers, formerly known as the Pilgrim Monument, commemorates the \"Mayflower\" Pilgrims. Dedicated on August 1, 1889, it honors their ideals as later generally embraced by the United States. It is thought to be the world's largest solid granite monument.\n\nLocated at 72 Allerton Street in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the monument was commissioned by the Pilgrim Society. The original concept dates to around 1820, with actual planning beginning in 1850. The cornerstone was laid August 2, 1859 by the Grand Lodge of Masons in Massachusetts, under the direction of Grand Master John T. Heard. The monument was completed in October 1888, and was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on August 1, 1889.\n\nHammatt Billings, Boston architect, illustrator and sculptor, originally conceived the monument as a structure comparable to the Colossus of Rhodes. Shortly before his death in 1874, Billings reduced the size of the monument, which was to be made entirely of granite quarried in Hallowell, Maine. The project was then passed to Billings' brother Joseph who, along with other sculptors including Alexander Doyle, Carl Conrads, and James Mahoney, reworked the design, although the basic components remained. The monument, which faces northeast to Plymouth Harbor (and, roughly, towards Plymouth, England), sits in the center of a circular drive, which is accessed from Allerton Street from the east. The plan of the principal pedestal is octagonal, with four small, and four large faces; from the small faces project four buttresses. On the main pedestal stands the heroic figure of \"Faith\" with her right hand pointing toward heaven and her left hand clutching the Bible. Upon the four buttresses also are seated figures emblematical of the principles upon which the Pilgrims founded their Commonwealth; counter-clockwise from the east are Morality, Law, Education, and Liberty. Each was carved from a solid block of granite, posed in the sitting position upon chairs with a high relief on either side of minor characteristics. Under \"Morality\" stand \"Prophet\" and \"Evangelist\"; under \"Law\" stand \"Justice\" and \"Mercy\"; under \"Education\" are \"Youth\" and \"Wisdom\"; and under \"Liberty\" stand \"Tyranny Overthrown\" and \"Peace\". On the face of the buttresses, beneath these figures are high reliefs in marble, representing scenes from Pilgrim history. Under \"Morality\" is \"Embarcation\"; under \"Law\" is \"Treaty\"; under \"Education\" is \"Compact\"; and under \"Freedom\" is \"Landing\". Upon the four faces of the main pedestal are large panels for records. The front panel is inscribed as follows: \"National Monument to the Forefathers. Erected by a grateful people in remembrance of their labors, sacrifices and sufferings for the cause of civil and religious liberty.\" The right and left panels contain the names of those who came over in the \"Mayflower\". The rear panel, which was not engraved until recently, contains a quote from Governor William Bradford's famous history, \"Of Plymouth Plantation\": \n\nThe overall scheme was designed by architect Hammatt Billings. The 36-foot figure of \"Faith\" was based on a 9-foot plaster model by William Rimmer in 1875, that was enlarged and altered by Joseph Edward Billings and a sculptor named Perry (probably John D. Perry). The subsidiary statues were executed by area sculptors including Alexander Doyle, Carl Conrads, and James H. Mahoney.\n\nThe monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1974. Originally under the care of the Pilgrim Society, it was given to the Massachusetts government in 2001. It and Plymouth Rock constitute the Pilgrim Memorial State Park. Although intended as national in scope, the Forefathers Monument is not a federal \"National Monument\" as understood today from the Antiquities Act of 1906.\n\nIn 2012, Kirk Cameron released the movie \"\" which features the monument and Cameron's interpretation of its history and the values of those it commemorates.\n\n\n"}

There were three official opening performances, on subsequent days in September: first, selected pieces by Ludvig Holberg, then \"An Enemy of the People\" by Henrik Ibsen, and on the third day \"Sigurd Jorsalfar\" by Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.\n\nThe National Theatre was founded as a private institution and weathered several financial crises until 1929, when the Norwegian government started providing modest support. A number of famous Norwegians have served as artistic directors for the theatre, but Vilhelm Krag who took over in 1911, is credited as having brought the theatre into its \"golden age.\"\n\nThe theatre is often considered the home for Ibsen's plays, and most of his works have been performed here. Notable is also the children's Christmas play, \"The Journey to the Christmas Star\" (), written by the then theatre's finance director Sverre Brandt and performed for the first time in 1924.\n\nThe main building is centrally located between the Royal Palace, Oslo and the Parliament of Norway. It is served by National Theatre Station and National Theatre metro stations. It was designed by architect Henrik Bull.\nThe theatre organisation manages four stages: the main stage (), the amphitheatre () and Painting Parlour () within the main building.

{"id": "82714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82714", "title": "Novella", "text": "Novella\n\nA novella is a text of written, fictional, narrative prose normally longer than a short story but shorter than a novel, somewhere between 17,500 and 40,000 words.\n\nThe English word \"\"novella\" derives from the Italian \"novella\", feminine of \"novello\", which means \"new\". The novella is a common literary genre in several European languages.\n\nThe novella as a literary genre began developing in the early Renaissance by the Italian and French \"literatura\", principally Giovanni Boccaccio, author of \"The Decameron\" (1353). \"The Decameron\" featured 100 tales (novellas) told by 10 people (seven women and three men) fleeing the Black Death, by escaping from Florence to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors, notably the French queen Marguerite de Navarre, whose \"Heptaméron\" (1559) included 72 original French tales and was modeled after the structure of \"The Decameron\".\n\nNot until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a realistic mode. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the \"novelle\" (German: \"Novelle\"; plural: \"Novellen\"). For the German writer, a novella is a fictional narrative of indeterminate length—a few pages to hundreds—restricted to a single, suspenseful event, situation, or conflict leading to an unexpected turning point (\"Wendepunkt\"), provoking a logical but surprising end. \"Novellen\" tend to contain a concrete symbol, which is the narrative's focal point.\n\nA novella generally features fewer conflicts than a novel, yet more complicated ones than a short story. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Novellas may or may not be divided into chapters (good examples of those with chapters are \"Animal Farm\" by George Orwell and \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells) and are often intended to be read at a single sitting, as is the short story, although in a novella white space is often used to divide the sections, and therefore, the novella maintains a single effect. Warren Cariou wrote:\n\nThe novella is generally not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.\n\nThis etymological distinction avoids confusion of the literatures and the forms, with the novel being the more important, established fictional form. Austrian writer Stefan Zweig's \"Die Schachnovelle\" (1942) (literally, \"The Chess Novella\", but translated in 1944 as \"The Royal Game\") is an example of a title naming its genre.\n\nCommonly, longer novellas are referred to as novels; Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" (1886) and Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\" (1899) are sometimes called novels, as are many science fiction works such as H. G. Wells' \"The War of the Worlds\" (1897) and Philip Francis Nowlan's \"Armageddon 2419 A.D.\" (1928). Less often, longer works are referred to as novellas. The subjectivity of the parameters of the novella genre is indicative of its shifting and diverse nature as an art form. In her 2010 \"Open Letters Monthly\" series, \"A Year With Short Novels\", Ingrid Norton criticizes the tendency to make clear demarcations based purely on a book's length:\n\nOn a web search engine, input \"novels\" and \"length\" and you will find tables of word counts, separating out novels from novellas, even from the esoteric and still shorter \"novelette\"—as though prose works were dog show contestants, needing to be entered into proper categories. But when it comes to writing, any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size are bound to be misleading. The delicate, gem-like jigsaw of Thornton Wilder's \"The Bridge of San Luis Ray\" could not be more unlike the feverishly cunning philosophical monologue of Albert Camus' \"The Fall\", but both novels are about the same length.\n\nStephen King, in his introduction to \"Different Seasons\", a collection of four novellas, has called the novella \"an ill-defined and disreputable literary banana republic\"; King notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the commercial publishing world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers. Despite these problems, however, the novella's length provides unique advantages; in the introduction to a novella anthology titled \"Sailing to Byzantium\", Robert Silverberg writes:\n\nIn his essay, \"Briefly, the case for the novella\", Canadian author George Fetherling (who wrote the novella \"Tales of Two Cities\") said that to reduce the novella to nothing more than a short novel is like \"insisting that a pony is a baby horse\".\n\nThe sometimes blurry definition between a novel and a novella can create controversy, as was the case with British writer Ian McEwan's \"On Chesil Beach\" (2007). The author described it as a novella, but the panel for the Man Booker Prize in 2007 qualified the book as a \"short novel\". Thus, this \"novella\" was shortlisted for an award for best original novel. A similar case is found with a much older work of fiction: \"The Call of the Wild\" (1903) by Jack London. This book, by modern standards, is short enough and straightforward enough to qualify as a novella. However, historically, it has been regarded as a novel.\n\nDictionaries define novelette similarly to \"novella\"; sometimes identically, sometimes with a disparaging sense of being trivial or sentimental.

{"id": "1963680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963680", "title": "Pauline Fowler", "text": "Pauline Fowler\n\nPauline Fowler is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", a long-running serial drama about working class life in the fictional London borough of Walford. She was played by actress Wendy Richard between the first episode on 19 February 1985 and 25 December 2006. Pauline was created by scriptwriter Tony Holland and producer Julia Smith as one of \"EastEnders' \"original characters. She made her debut in the soap's first episode on 19 February 1985, and remained for twenty-one years and ten months, making her the second longest-running original character, surpassed only by her nephew, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt).\n\nPauline is a member of the Beale family. Her storylines focus on drudgery, money worries and family troubles. The matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London community of Albert Square, she is portrayed as a loving, doting mother who is very family-oriented. In later years however, she becomes a more stoic, opinionated battle-axe who alienates her relatives through overbearing interference. Pauline is married to the downtrodden Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), though she finds out he has had a one-night stand with Christine Hewitt (Elizabeth Power) which leads to her hitting him with a frying pan. Their marriage remains rocky until his death in 1996. She is used for comedic purposes in scenes with her launderette colleague, Dot Cotton (June Brown), and scriptwriters included many feuds in her narrative, most notably with her daughter-in-law, Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), a family friend who got her daughter, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), pregnant at 16. A famous episode in 1986, which includes Pauline discovering that Den is the father of Michelle's baby, drew over 30 million viewers, and was listed at number 36 in \"The Times\"' 1998 list of \"Top 100 cult moments in Film\". Richard announced Pauline's retirement from the serial in July 2006, and the character was killed off in a \"whodunnit?\" murder storyline, with Richard making her final appearance on 25 December 2006.\n\nPauline was a staple in the UK press during her time in \"EastEnders\", representative of the symbiosis between Britain's soaps and tabloid newspapers. Widely read tabloids, such as \"The Sun\" and \"Daily Mirror\", would routinely publish articles about forthcoming developments in Pauline's storylines. Critical opinion on the character differs. She has been described as a \"legend\" and a television icon, but was also voted the 35th \"most annoying person of 2006\" (being the only fictional character to appear on the list). The character is well-known even outside of the show's viewer-base, and away from the on-screen serial, Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books, tie-in novels, and comedy sketch shows.\n\nPauline Fowler is one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of \"EastEnders\", Tony Holland (1940–2007) and Julia Smith (1927–1997). Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of the original characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou and her children, Holland's cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named Lou Beale, with twin children Pete and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of \"EastEnders\", the Beales and Fowlers.\n\nPauline's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appears in an abridged form in their book, \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\".\n\nFrom the beginning, Smith considered the role ideal for Wendy Richard, with whom she had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, \"The Newcomers\"; Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use \"stars\"—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as Shirley Brahms in the successful sitcom \"Are You Being Served?\" At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not \"duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects.\" In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that \"powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened\" had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, \"If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the launderette, voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life.\" Richard thought it sounded like a challenging role.\n\nThere were initial fears that Richard's glamorous image would not work for the character and Smith also feared that Richard would be apprehensive about playing Pauline, who would be anything but glamorous, but these fears were swept aside when Richard announced that she was sick of glamour and wanted to play her own age. Richard has commented, \"although it would be such a huge transformation of my screen image, it was after all my twenty-fifth year in showbusiness, and I'd realised that I couldn't go on playing dolly birds forever ... I knew right away I would be mad to turn down the part of Pauline.\"\n\nAfter she accepted the role, Richard was told by Julia Smith that she would have to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, \"I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed ... I cried my eyes out for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut.\" From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: \"It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations' ... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have.\" Richard's casting was considered to be \"a giant leap of faith\" by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately \"landed on its feet\", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in \"EastEnders\"' history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.\n\nThe character of Pauline was a cornerstone of \"EastEnders\"; the lynchpin of the Fowler/Beale family around whom the soap was originally structured. At the beginning of the serial in 1985, Pauline was a 40-year-old married mother with two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, and another child on the way. The fictional history of her younger years has been told via behind-the-scenes books such as \"EastEnders: The Inside Story\", and the second tie-in novel by Hugh Miller, \"Swings and Roundabouts\", which explains that Pauline was born and raised at 45 Albert Square, where she lived for her entire life. She married Arthur Fowler in 1965, raising her own children in the same house where she grew up.\n\nWhereas most of the other female characters in \"EastEnders\" were portrayed in a somewhat more glamorous working class way, Pauline Fowler was the exception to the rule, being the sole character to represent the \"homely and domestic\" side of the Beale family. As the serial progressed, the character altered from her original outline. Instead of being the jolly, warm character she was during the show's early years, she became a sombre battle-axe, hardened by a life of misery in Albert Square. Other characters refer to her as \"Fowler the growler\", and in the \"Evening Gazette\" she was described as \"the Boadicea of battle-axes.\" The initial change in her demeanour is traced back to the death of her mother, Lou Beale (Anna Wing), a fierce dowager, who ruled over her family with a \"rod of iron\". Following Lou's screen funeral in July 1988, Pauline retorts, \"Shut up Arthur Fowler, no one interrupts Pauline Beale when she's in full flow,\" a line that was used similarly by Lou in the episode that preceded her own death. This parallel symbolised the transference of the family's matriarchal role from Lou to Pauline. Wendy Richard has indicated that both she and show creator, Julia Smith, had always intended for Pauline to become like her mother, and former \"EastEnders\" executive producer John Yorke has commented on the importance of the lineage between the two characters: \"[Pauline] endures, stoically and heroically, whatever life may throw at her, just as her mother did before her. This sense of lineage is vitally important, too. Pauline has been in the show since its start and was handed the role of matriarch on Lou Beale's death.\"\n\nIn the first episode, it is revealed that Pauline, aged 40, is pregnant with her third child. The character's pregnancy quickly became a prominent storyline within the series. Pauline, against her mother's opposition, is determined to keep the baby. The storyline was used to spread a public message on the increased risk of genetic defects in late pregnancies, with Pauline undergoing amniocentesis tests. The storyline culminates with the birth of the serial's first baby, Martin, in July 1985.\n\nPauline's early storylines concentrate on family and money troubles: coping with her husband Arthur's redundancy, mental breakdown and imprisonment; eldest son Mark's delinquency; and daughter Michelle's teenage pregnancy.\nIn 1989, the character was used to highlight another important gynaecological health issue, fibroids. The storyline sees Pauline ignoring health problems, such as chronic fatigue, and using homoeopathic preparations rather than seeking medical assistance. Her fibroids are discovered by chance, when the character Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) knocks her down in his Austin Mini. In the 1989 Boxing Day episode, Pauline spends time in hospital, recovering from a necessary hysterectomy. Wendy Richard has since revealed that the storyline had originally been scripted differently. Before the outcome of Pauline's illness was screened, producers had decided that the character was to be killed off with cancer. This was a decision that had been made by the show's boss, Mike Gibbon, to refresh the format by replacing some of the serial's older characters. The scriptwriters went as far as giving Pauline a mystery illness. The newly appointed executive producer, Michael Ferguson, decided to scrap the original storyline, believing that Pauline, as one of the soap's original characters, was too valuable an asset to lose. The storyline was rewritten and the character was given a different gynaecological ailment that was treatable.\n\nPauline's marriage to the luckless Arthur is central to her character, remaining one of her defining traits even after his death in 1996. The dynamics of the relationship were clear from the beginning of the programme, with Pauline depicted as the matriarchal force that holds the Fowler family together, while Arthur is depicted as weak, emotionally unstable and easily dominated by the stronger females of his family. Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that \"[Pauline and Arthur] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man ... Arthur, only sporadically employed and disabled by a breakdown, often behaved like a little boy, while Pauline had to make the decisions and keep the family functioning in the face of poverty and unemployment, teenage pregnancy and depression.\"\nPauline and Arthur were generally seen as the most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's affair with Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) came as a shock to viewers. The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence—she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother Kenny in early June, and she does not return until late September—in reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of \"EastEnders\" to allow her to act in \"Grace and Favour\". The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling \"strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, who obviously drank too much\". The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992; it was labelled \"The Bonk of the Year\" by the British press, and was watched by 24.3 million viewers. In 2005, it was reported as the eleventh most highly viewed UK television programme of all time.\n\nThe storyline continued throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater demands on Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless he does so himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline would find out about the affair; \"should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?\" In the end it was felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, \"an act of betrayal on a massive scale.\" Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this \"iconic\" scene: \"It was one of the few times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip ... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did.\" This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in \"EastEnders: The First Ten Years\" and is described by Wendy Richard as \"Pauline's crowning moment.\"\n\nFor a while it seems that \"EastEnders\"' \"most solid\" marriage is over, but Arthur spends the rest of 1993 trying to convince Pauline that it is worth saving and they eventually reconcile. However, more tragedy follows, when Arthur is framed by a conman, Willy Roper (dubbed \"Wicked Willy\" by the British press), and wrongfully imprisoned for embezzlement in 1995. The storyline captured the public's imagination and a nationwide \"Free Arthur Fowler\" campaign was launched. \"Arthur Fowler Is Innocent\" T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign.\n\nArthur's imprisonment was a precursor to the final exit of actor Bill Treacher, who decided to leave \"EastEnders\" after 11 years playing Arthur. While Arthur goes to pieces in prison, Pauline is heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovers his deception and then resorts to uncharacteristic seduction to gain his confession. A critic for the \"Sunday Mirror\" commented, \"Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in \"EastEnders\". The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole was nothing short of brilliant.\" Arthur is exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline is brief, as an injury he sustained in prison leads to a brain haemorrhage and he dies shortly after his release. His death ends an 11-year screen marriage, the longest run of any marriage in the serial.\n\nPauline remains a family-oriented character throughout the course of the show. A \"fiercely loyal, but overbearing mother\"; sheltering and taking on the major responsibilities of her children and frequently stressing the importance of family. She is portrayed as a traditionalist, with strict rules and beliefs—the first to criticise, but also the first to defend her children, often interfering in their issues and causing rifts in their relationships. The quintessential matriarch, she has also been compared with Queen Elizabeth, with the storylines in the fictional Albert Square, mirroring the troubles of England as a whole. In \"Monarchies: What Are Kings and Queens For\", the author points out similarities between the matriarchal nature of Pauline's character, and that of the Queen. \"Both exhibit a rich mix of suffering and duty. Pauline has tried to bring up her family as best she can, even though it hasn't always been easy. Her offspring have caused her nothing but trials and tribulations; her husband has been wayward at times and caused her several eyebrow-raising moments. But Pauline has steadfastly carried on ...\"\n\nEarly storylines between Pauline and her two teenage children, Mark and Michelle, show her to be a doting mother, forgiving of Mark's wayward behaviour, and supportive when Michelle decides to become a teenage mum. Pauline is devoted to her twin brother Pete, dutiful to her mother Lou, allegiant to her husband Arthur, and a shoulder for her nephew, Ian, to cry on. Wendy Richard commented in 1990, \"It's important for her to keep the family together. That's why when her problem son Mark suddenly came home [in 1990], it was like her winning the pools ... She had to take a lot of shocks from Michelle and I think she coped remarkably well.\"\n\nAs the serial progressed, Pauline contends with a plethora of family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, attracting 19 million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: \"To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment.\" The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles to come to terms with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when \"EastEnders\" tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: \"The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS are not exactly the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across.\"\n\nThe HIV storyline came to an end on-screen in 2003, when executive producer Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: \"I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go.\" Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.\n\nIn the latter years of her time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more inflexible battle-axe. Pauline's relationship with Martin is often shown to be strained by Pauline's refusal to release control over his life. Though initially a teenage delinquent, following Mark's death in 2004, Martin becomes Pauline's \"dutiful son\", forced to put his mother's wishes above those of his wife—a recurring theme within the serial. Eventually, this causes a rift between the two characters. When Martin goes against his mother's wishes in 2006 and rekindles a romance with his adulterous ex-wife Sonia, Pauline cuts him out of her life. Television personality Paul O'Grady addressed Pauline's refusal to \"share her son like a normal mother\", commenting, \"she's suspicious of anybody that comes into the family who wants to take her son away from her. She has already lost one son; she has lost her husband, so she's hanging onto the last [son] like a mother tiger with her cub.\"\n\nThe character's narrative also included various feuds, most notably with the soap's lothario Den Watts, a family-friend who gets Pauline's daughter Michelle pregnant at the age of 16. \"EastEnders\" pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when over 30 million people watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode in which Pauline discovers that Den is the father of her granddaughter, Vicki. Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters \"once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was out to get him one way or another\" and actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den, added \"from then on it was out and out war, which was great!\" An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline occur, as she tries to force him to leave Walford and keep him away from her family. The feud appears to end in 1989 when the character Den is shot and presumed dead, but it is ignited once again in 2003 when Den is re-introduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline is not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog-shaped iron doorstop, which has been described as \"a nice touch of pathos\".\n\nA large proportion of the character's scenes take place on the set of Walford's launderette, where Pauline works as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in \"EastEnders\". Here, Pauline is frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Dot Cotton. The two characters share one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour. Particular emphasis is placed on their differences, which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them \"buried alive\" underneath a collapsed fairground ride, in the midst of a cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot are most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a \"fabulous double-act\": \"Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else.\"\n\nPauline is shown to be particularly hostile to the various female characters that feature in her sons' lives, and she epitomises the archetypal \"mother-in-law from hell\". One of Pauline's most notable feuds is with her youngest son Martin's wife, Sonia. Animosity between the characters begins in 2000, when Sonia gives birth to Pauline's grandchild and decides to give the baby Chloe (later renamed Rebecca) up for adoption. In the storyline, Pauline tries unsuccessfully to fight for custody, leading Sonia to retort \"YOU want to bring up Chloe? You couldn't bring up phlegm!\" The feuding over Chloe is revisited in storylines throughout 2005 and 2006, when first Pauline is shown to visit her adopted granddaughter against Sonia and Martin's wishes, and then, following Sonia's affair with Naomi Julien, Pauline refuses to give Sonia access to the child after Martin regains custody. Critic for \"The Guardian\", Grace Dent, commented \"At one point, you couldn't move around Walford for hitmen and gangsters, but now they've all been written out ... leaving Pauline Fowler to reign the square like sodding Pablo Escobar in a sky-blue tabard and ski-pants, decreeing who can see their own kids, who can drink where and what everyone's eating in the cafe so as they won't spoil their teas. If I was Sonia, I'd have ransacked the hospital's dangerous drugs box by now and given that old crone a renal meltdown.\" Various rows, slaps and insults were featured between the characters, caused by Pauline's continuous interference in Sonia's relationships with Martin and Rebecca. As Martin began to cede, allowing Sonia access to their daughter, Pauline was shown to concoct ever more elaborate ways to obstruct Sonia's involvement.\n\nDuring her latter years in \"EastEnders\", Pauline is rarely without her Cairn Terrier, Betty. The dog is a stray taken in by the Fowler family in 2004, who quickly becomes Pauline's inseparable sidekick. Wendy Richard has since revealed that it was her decision for Pauline to own a Cairn: \"When EastEnders asked if Pauline should have a dog I said it had to be a Cairn Terrier—and Betty joined us! She's wonderful, she loves me and I love her.\" In the on-screen story, the dog is named after Pauline's aunt Betty, but in reality, Wendy Richard named her after Mollie Sugden's fictional character Betty Slocombe, who appeared along with Richard's Shirley Brahms in the sitcom, \"Are You Being Served?\"\n\nSeveral eligible bachelors are shown to express their interest in Pauline over the years, including the characters Derek Taylor in 1987, Danny Taurus in 1993, Jeff Healy (who proposes) in 1999, Eddie Skinner in 2000, and Terry Raymond, with whom she goes on a blind date in 2001. However, the character remains staunchly faithful to her late husband's memory, refusing to let the relationships progress beyond companionship. In 2001 Derek Harkinson (Ian Lavender) is introduced, an old school friend of Pauline's. Initial scripts indicated that Derek was being groomed as a romantic interest for Pauline, which she is shown to welcome. However, the storyline takes a twist when he reveals, to her shock, that he is gay. 2002 sees Derek move in with the Fowler family, unconventionally settling into the show as a replacement father figure for Mark and Martin and as Pauline's best friend. \n\nIn 2005, Pauline embarks on a romance with a new character, Joe Macer (Ray Brooks), whom she meets at salsa classes. A relationship develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe was an attempt to give the character a \"new lease of life\", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with \"EastEnders\"' 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the \"Fowler\" surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving \"EastEnders\"; she quit due to \"creative differences\" with the show's producers regarding Pauline's remarriage, which she felt was \"disloyal\" to her character's beloved first husband, Arthur. According to an interview in \"The Sun\", Richard commented, \"I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong ... I just couldn't believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody ... I would have stayed a bit longer if Pauline hadn't got married.\" Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe \"looked good together\" and felt that she and Brooks had to work very hard to turn them into a \"realistic-looking couple.\"\n\nWithin the storyline, just two months after the wedding, Pauline's marriage is shown to sour after she discovers Joe's criminal past. Their relationship steadily deteriorates throughout the year, and in December 2006 Pauline ends the marriage—removing her wedding ring and informing Joe that he \"was half the man that Arthur had been, that she had never really loved him and that their sex life was a sham.\" The resulting row sees Joe insult Pauline's family—suggesting that her \"perfect marriage\" with Arthur was \"nothing but a fantasy\" and branding Mark \"diseased\", Michelle a \"scrubber\" and Arthur a \"con\"—to which Pauline responds by smashing a plate over his head. Wendy Richard commented, \"It was not just the memory of Arthur that stopped the marriage to Joe being a success. He was proven to be a weak and untruthful man. That is what caused the marriage to be a non-starter. Pauline was not mean to Joe, he used her ... and lied to her.\"\n\nViewers saw the slow build-up to Pauline's climactic exit throughout the latter part of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: \"she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia is more than just a thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will blame her decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times ... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story.\"\n\nThe character was killed off in a dramatic storyline, which aired on Christmas Day 2006 and was watched by an estimated 10.7 million viewers. It was the second most highly watched programme of the day. The episode sees Sonia denouncing Pauline as \"sick\" for not wanting to share her son with the woman he loved, to which Pauline retorts, \"I'll tell you what's sick. You. Daughter of a scrubber, lesbian, under-age mother who gave away her own baby.\" The row culminates with Sonia slapping Pauline, causing her to fall to the floor and break the Fowler fruit bowl—\"the enduring symbol of her family, which smashed, significantly, into smithereens.\" Though Pauline resolves to stay and reunite with her family in the end, she does not get the chance, as she collapses and dies in the middle of Albert Square, leaving both characters and viewers in uncertainty about the cause of her demise.\n\nThe Christmas Day episodes, written by Simon Ashdown, drew on the show's early history to mark the occasion of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised by the use of flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for \"The Times\", Tim Teeman, commented that \"Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl.\" In addition, her parting scene with the other \"EastEnders\" long-serving \"grand dame\" Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: \"The really choking scene came in the launderette between Pauline and Dot ... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved.\"\n\nRichard herself has been less complimentary about her alter ego's departure. She has spoken of her disappointment regarding Pauline's \"changing character\" and \"depressing final storyline\". In an interview with the Biography Channel she explained: \"I did say, promise me you won't make Pauline nasty before she goes, and unfortunately they did ... I wasn't too happy with the way it was done. They were changing Pauline's character ... Pauline would never have remarried. She would have remained a widow, sitting in that chair in the corner. That's what [show creator] Julia Smith wanted, and that's what I felt was right, so I resigned ... I think it's a shame because the Fowlers have gone completely now ... There was so much history with that family.\"\n\nThe storyline—dubbed \"who killed Pauline?\" by the British press—continued into 2007, as first Pauline's funeral is interrupted by the police in order to perform an autopsy on her body, and then Pauline's nemesis Sonia is arrested for the murder. It is later revealed that the killing blow had actually come from Pauline's husband Joe, who breaks down and confesses to Dot that he had rowed with Pauline on Christmas Day (off-screen) and, in a fury, struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. The plot's eventual climax in February 2007 led to the exits of several established characters connected with Pauline. This included Martin, Sonia, and Joe, who is dramatically killed off after confessing to Pauline's murder, by falling out of the Fowlers' first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical Dot. Pauline is cremated, and her ashes buried at Arthur's graveside, by Dot, in an episode that aired in June 2007.\n\nAs a final tribute to Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special television programme, \"EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline\", which provided an emotional look back at Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and \"EastEnders\" actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how \"proud\" she was of her character, commenting: \"Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems ... She wasn't always grumpy ... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame ... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That was the most important thing in her life.\"\n\nAt the time of her departure from the serial, Pauline was the second-longest running character to feature in \"EastEnders\" and one of only two original characters to remain in the show for almost 22 years. Her baggy woolly cardigan and long-suffering nature have led to her being labelled as a soap institution, a \"soap legend\" and a \"television icon\". Actress Wendy Richard was awarded an Order of the British Empire MBE medal in 2000 by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, and when the Queen visited the set of \"EastEnders\" in 2001, Wendy Richard was the first actress introduced, who then accompanied her and Prince Philip on their tour of the set.\n\nDespite being popular with many, the character of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism has been given to the character's dowdy attire, particularly the perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan; a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes. In addition, Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour—\"a face like a month of wet weekends\" and \"a voice that could curdle milk.\" She has been described as the \"Wicked Witch of Walford\" and \"a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery.\"\n\nLucy Mangan, the culture critic from \"The Guardian\" newspaper, summed up the character: \"Pauline Fowler is surely one of the oddest soap creations ever. She is a character without humour, charisma or indeed any redeeming features who became progressively, unrelentingly miserable ... She was presumably intended to be the anchoring force for \"EastEnders\", but because of the writers' unprecedented decision to break with traditional narrative rules and give her not a single redeeming feature, she became more of a sucking chest wound than the heart of the show.\" This opinion is perhaps shared by a proportion of viewers, as Pauline was voted the 35th most annoying person of 2006 in a BBC Three poll, being the only fictional character to appear on the list. In a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 13% chose Pauline Fowler as the soap character they would most like to see retired. She came third in the poll, behind \"EastEnders\"' Den Watts (17%) and \"Coronation Street's\" Ken Barlow (15%).\n\nAlthough it had been suggested that Pauline's presence in \"EastEnders\" was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented \"it's so sad, because I've watched her for 20 years. She's such a large character\", and another said \"If she goes then I think \"EastEnders\" is finished.\" BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard \"occupies a huge place in people's hearts\", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, \"For many years Wendy simply was \"EastEnders\" for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the \"EastEnders\"' spirit ... We thank her for everything she has done for the show.\"\n\n\"Inside Soap\" editor, Steven Murphy, said that the fact Pauline has been such an \"enduring staple\" will make it hard for fans to cope with her departure. \"It's huge in soap terms ... She's a character people love to hate—you just assumed she would be there forever.\" When addressing the repercussions that Pauline's exit would have on the soap, Murphy had this to say: \"characters like Pauline are like glue, because they're connected to so many other characters and they can help hold stories together. In terms of that [EastEnders] has very few of those now.\" Jonathan Hughes, editor of \"All About Soap\" magazine, added \"[Pauline's] an absolute legend ... You can't imagine the show without her ... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of \"EastEnders\" for so many years.\" However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting \"How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [getting rid of her]. Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago\".\n\nPauline's exit in December 2006 was described by \"The Times\" critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a \"significant sayonara\". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as \"the most moving in a soap this year\" and added that \"it was a delight to finally alight on an episode ... that was so satisfying.\" Conversely, Pauline's exit was described as a \"mess\" by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the \"Sunday Mirror\" newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: \"the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead.\"\n\nTo mark Pauline's 22-year reign in \"EastEnders\", Wendy Richard was awarded with a 'Lifetime Achievement' award at the British Soap Awards in May 2007. The award was presented by Todd Carty, who played her on-screen son Mark. Carty described Richard as the \"heart and soul of \"EastEnders\"\" and hailed her as an inspiration to everyone in the \"EastEnders\" cast. Richard was moved to tears when she collected the award.\n\nWhen the series was launching in 1985, since Wendy Richard was the most recognisable actor from the original cast, she and her character Pauline were used heavily to promote \"EastEnders\" in the media. Wendy Richard, in character as Pauline, was chosen to narrate a special \"dial-a-soap\" service for \"EastEnders\". Run by British Telecom, the facility allowed people who had missed an episode to ring a number and get an instant update, up to 88 seconds long. It was the first television show to provide such a service. Between 1985 and 2006, Pauline was featured in much \"EastEnders\"-related merchandise and promotional material, including calendars, cast-cards, annuals, novels, a knitting pattern book and a greeting card.\n\nThe well-known character of Pauline Fowler has also been referenced in various television programmes, unrelated to the \"EastEnders\" universe. In 1997 she was mentioned in an episode of the successful BBC drama \"This Life\". Two key characters, Anna and Ferdy, watch an episode of \"EastEnders\" on television and mock Pauline's hysterics and her well-documented tendency to wear cardigans. The character was also regularly spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show, \"The Real McCoy\" (1991–1995). One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of \"EastEnders\", with black comedians taking over roles of well known \"EastEnders\" characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. The comedian Llewella Gideon played the role of Pauline. The sketches placed considerable emphasis on the character's high-pitched voice and her tendency to whine. The character's fashion sense has also been referred to in BBC Two sitcom \"Beautiful People\" (2008).\n\n\n"}

In Austin, the six flags fly in front of the Bullock Texas State History Museum; the Texas State Capitol has the six coats of arms on its northern facade, and the University of Texas at Austin Life Sciences Library, previously the location of the central library in the Main Building, has each coat of arms displayed in plaster emblems with short excerpts representative of the constitutions of each country. The six flags are also shown on the reverse of the Seal of Texas.\n\nIn 1997 the Texas Historical Commission adopted standard designs for representing the six flags.\n\nThe first flag belonged to Spain, which ruled most of Texas from 1519 to 1685 and 1690 to 1821. There were three Spanish flags used during this period: the \"castle and lion\" arms of the Crown of Castile (see Flag of Castile and León); the Cross of Burgundy, a military and maritime flag also used by the viceroys of New Spain; and the \"Rojigualda\" introduced by King Charles III in 1785, containing horizontal stripes of red-gold-red and the simple arms of Castile and León. This third flag has been used by Spain in various forms to the present day, and is the flag used in the reverse of the Seal of Texas and adopted by the Texas State Historical Commission.\n\nThe second flag was the royal banner of the Kingdom of France from 1684 to 1690. In 1684, French nobleman René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, founded a colony on the Texas Gulf Coast called Fort Saint Louis. The colony was unsuccessful, and after La Salle's murder, was soon abandoned. During this time, there was no official French flag, so a number of designs are used in displays of the \"six flags\".\nLater on in 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France under the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. French Louisiana included northern sections of Texas. It remained in the hands of France until 1803, when France sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States. However, what would later be northern Texas was sold back to Spain years later.\n\nThe third flag flown (1821 through 1836) was the flag of Mexico. Mexico's independence was recognized by Spain in 1821. The Mexican flag displayed in the Austin Capitol is the one of the Mexican Republic of 1823 through 1864.\n\nThis flag was in use in Texas until its independence from Mexico in 1836 (Texas' declaration of independence).\n\nThe fourth flag belonged to the Republic of Texas from 1836 to 1845. The Republic had two national flags during its history, the first being the so-called \"Burnet Flag\". The \"Lone Star Flag\", the final national flag, became the state flag when Texas joined the United States as a U.S. state in 1845.\n\nThe fifth and current flag is that of the United States of America, which Texas joined in 1845. Upon secession Texas abandoned this flag for its sixth, until readmission to the Union in 1865.\n\nThe sixth flag belonged to the Confederate States of America from 1861 to 1865. During this time, the Confederacy had three national flags.\n\n\n"}

Inaugurated in 1864, it is the second oldest theater of its kind in Puerto Rico, but \"the largest and most historic in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean.\" The theater was named \"La Perla\" in honor of the Virgin of Montserrat (Spanish: \"La Virgen de Montserrat\"), known as \"The Pearl of the Mediterranean.\" It is located in barrio Tercero, in the Ponce Historic Zone.\n\nThe theater was designed in the 1860s by Juan Bertoli Calderoni (a Ponceño of Italian heritage resident of the city) and it bears a neoclassical structure with an impressive six-column entrance. The building was badly damaged by the 1918 earthquake. However, it was rebuilt in 1940 using the original plans and reopened in 1941 with better acoustics technology. It closed in 2006 for renovations and reopened on March 14, 2008.\n\nTeatro La Perla was built under the initiative of Francisco Parra Duperón and Pedro Garriga in May 1864. It was inaugurated on 28 May 1864 with the play \"La campana de la Almudaina\" of the Majorcan writer Juan Palou y Coll by the theatrical company of Segarra & Argente.\n\nTeatro La Perla served as a stage not only to give life to the theatrical artistic culture in the region, but it also served as a place of assembly for those who were dedicated to the social issues in Ponce and in Puerto Rico as a whole. It served this function both at the end of the Spanish regime and in Puerto Rico’s early years as a United States territory.\n\nIn this theater, in 1901, Frenchman Eduardo Hervet showed the first silent film ever to be run in Puerto Rico. The theater's first illumination technical director was Félix Juan Torres Ortiz. \n\nIt was reconditioned between 1977 and 1979 at a cost of over $500,000. \n\nThe theatre has a seating capacity of 1,047 and it is now a regular venue for concerts, opera, plays, and various civic and educational activities such as school graduations. The lobby of the theater has a small museum dedicated to the history of the building and past shows.\n\n\n"}

Textile arts are one of the earliest known industries. Basketry is associated with textile arts.\n\nWhile humans have created textiles since the dawn of culture, many are fragile and disintegrate rapidly. Ancient textiles are preserved only by special environmental conditions. The oldest known textiles in the Americas is some early fiberwork found in Guitarrero Cave, Peru dating back to 10,1000 to 9,080 BCE.\n\nThe oldest known textiles in North America are twine and plain weave fabrics preserved in a peat pond at the Windover Archaeological Site in Florida, the earliest dating to 6,000 BCE.\n\nAs previously mentioned, fragments of rope and textiles dating back between 12,100 and 11,080 years ago have been unearthed from Guitarrero Cave in Peru. Because of the extremely dry conditions of the desert sands, twined textiles from the Norte Chico civilization in Peru have survived, dating back to 2500-1800 BCE. Cotton and wool from alpaca, llamas, and vicuñas have been woven into elaborate textiles for thousands of years in the Andes and are still important parts of Quechua and Aymara culture today. Coroma in Antonio Quijarro Province, Bolivia is a major center for ceremonial textile production. An Aymara elder from Coroma said, \"In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization... The sacred weavings are also important in differentiating one community, or ethnic group, from a neighboring group...\"<nowiki> </nowiki>Aguayos are clothes woven from camelid fibers with geometric designs that Andean women wear and use for carrying babies or goods.\n\nKuna tribal members of Panama and Colombia are famous for their molas, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse appliqué technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including pop culture. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can dissemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.\n\nMayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as \"huipils\" or traditional blouses. Elaborate Maya textiles featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history. In modern times, weaving serves as both an art form and a source of income. Organizing into weaving collectives have helped Mayan women earn better money for their work and greatly expand the reach of Mayan textiles in the world.\n\nPieces of 7,000- to 8,000-year-old fabric have been found with human burials at the Windover Archaeological Site in Florida. The burials were in a peat pond. The fabric had turned into peat, but was still identifiable. Many bodies at the site had been wrapped in fabric before burial. Eighty-seven pieces of fabric were found associated with 37 burials. Researchers have identified seven different weaves in the fabric. One kind of fabric had 26 strands per inch (10 strands per centimeter). There were also weaves using two-strand and three-strand wefts. A round bag made from twine was found, as well as matting. The yarn was probably made from palm leaves. Cabbage palm, saw palmetto and scrub palmetto are all common in the area, and would have been so 8,000 years ago.\nSeminole seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.\n\nGreat Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their ribbonwork, found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliquéd in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. Powwow and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their fingerwoven sashes.\n\nExperimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf (Ho-Chunk), whose work addresses historic injustices against native peoples, and Marie Watt (Seneca), who creates installations and interactive artworks using blankets as a metaphor.\n\nPueblo men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.\n\nNavajo rugs are woven by Navajo women today from Navajo-Churro sheep or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th century Navajo weavers include Clara Sherman and Hosteen Klah, who co-founded the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.\n\nValencia, Joseph and Ramona Sakiestewa (Hopi) and Melissa Cody (Navajo) explore non-representational abstraction and use experimental materials in their weaving.\n\nTraditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. Chilkat weaving and ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear formline designs. Tlingit weaver Jennie Thlunaut (1892–1986) was instrumental in this revival.\n\nButton blankets are wool blankets embellished with mother-of-pearl buttons worn on significant occasions, such as potlatches.\n\n\n"}

It provides interactive in-school and after-school programs presenting and discussing student-written work to promote community dialogue and respect for young artists. \n\nYoung Playwrights' Theater was founded in 1995 by Karen Zacarías. Now a Helen Hayes Award-winning Playwright-in-Residence at Arena Stage, Zacarías began volunteering her time teaching playwriting workshops in DC classrooms after returning to her hometown with a M.F.A. in playwriting from Boston University. By 1997, her workshops were so successful that she incorporated YPT as a 501c3 nonprofit organization.\n\nIn 2005, when Zacarías transitioned to Arena Stage, David Andrew Snider took over as Producing Artistic Director and CEO. Since then the organization has grown to employ six full-time staff members, eight professional teaching artists, and dozens of professional actors, directors and designers supporting its work on-stage and in the classroom. YPT provides thousands of students and community members annually with free in-school and after-school theater arts workshops and professional performances of student-written plays, and has created a continuum of programming at the Columbia Heights Education Campus through programming for students of Bancroft Elementary School, Lincoln Middle School and Bell Multicultural High School to gauge the long-term effects on students as they progress.\n\nSnider followed Zacarías to Arena Stage in July 2012 as Director of Artistic Programming. Former Deputy Director Brigitte Pribnow Moore stepped in as Acting Executive Director and former Program Manager Nicole Jost assumed the role of Associate Artistic Director. YPT's staff operates out of the Josephine Butler Parks Center, adjacent to Meridian Hill Park in the Columbia Heights neighborhood and regularly stages performances at nearby Tivoli Theatre, a renovated 1920's Italian Renaissance Revival theater, now home to GALA Hispanic Theatre. The organization receives federal and private sector funding, as well as individual donations.\n\nYPT's flagship program integrates the art of playwriting into the classroom in order to enhance student literacy, creative expression and communication. During 12 in-class workshops led by teaching artists, students explore the mechanics of language, drama, and self-expression, culminating with each student writing his or her own short play. Professional actors and directors visit the classroom throughout the process, reading students' plays and helping to bring their words to life. The most dynamic plays are chosen by a reading committee composed of professional playwrights, directors, and actors, to be performed at Tivoli Theatre by YPT's acting company in the New Play Festival and at satellite locations during the New Writers Now! series. The young authors work with a dramaturge to polish their scripts, attend rehearsals, and offer input to actors and a director during their plays' development and production. In 2012, YPT published some of the best student works.\n\nSince 2008, YPT has hosted an after-school Young Playwrights' Workshop at its facilities in the Josephine Butler Parks Center, aimed at developing students' creative expression and collaboration by exploring theater as an ensemble. Students have written plays and performed them at the Capital Fringe Festival, Intersections at Atlas Performing Arts Center, the Source Festival and Tivoli Theatre. The workshop hosted arts delegations from China and Russia in 2012. Several schools host YPT's After-School Playwrighting Program, providing a similar collaborative, explorative writing and performance experience. Additionally, the Summer Playwriting Series, a series of playwriting workshops for local youth, is conducted at partner schools, camps and community centers, culminating in community sharing and staged readings.\n\nEach fall, YPT's professional acting company tours the Greater Washington, D.C. area performing student-written plays at schools, nursing homes, hospitals, community centers and theaters, free of charge. Plays are selected from the previous school year to align with an overarching theme chosen for that year's tour. Audiences participate with actors in post-performance interactive workshops to develop their own artistic interpretations and customized storytelling experiences. The tour usually concludes with a public showcase performance at Tivoli Theatre.\n\nYPT has received commissions and enjoyed partnerships with regional and international institutions including the White House, Kennedy Center, National Geographic Society, Smithsonian Institution's Discovery Theater, Folger Shakespeare Library, Woolly Mammoth, Carnegie Institute, Theater J, Round House Theatre, African Continuum, Busboys and Poets, Washington Parks and People, Capitol Hill Arts Workshop (CHAW), the Canadian Embassy, EsArtes of Suchitoto, El Salvador, and a Youth Village in Israel.\n\nWritten literacy evaluations and self-assessments are conducted during initial and final workshop visits at program sites, and assessment results are judged via a specific rubric developed by YPT's outside evaluator, faculty and staff, aimed at showing the changes in students' literacy, their abilities with language and addressing District of Columbia Public Schools and national English Language Arts Standards, as well as measurable changes in attitude/engagement in their own education. The President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts have called on YPT to share their successful evaluations and assessments to advance the field of arts education on a national level.\n\nYPT has received several regional and national awards, most notably the 2006 District of Columbia Mayor's Arts Award for Outstanding Contribution to Arts Education, a 2009 Helen Hayes nomination for Best New Play for Chasing George Washington: A White House Adventure, the Eugene and Agnes Meyer Foundation 2009 Exponent Award, the 2010 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Award (formerly the Coming Up Taller Award), the HandsOn Greater DC Cares Essence of Leadership Award in 2011 and Community Impact Award in 2012, recognition in the 2009-2010 Catalogue for Philanthropy, and most recently an honorable mention for The Washington Post 2012 Award for Excellence in Nonprofit Management. YPT is a member of the League of Washington Theaters and the Theatre Communications Group.\n\n\n"}
