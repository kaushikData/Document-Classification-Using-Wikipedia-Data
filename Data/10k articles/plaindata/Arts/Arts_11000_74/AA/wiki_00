{"id": "2966372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2966372", "title": "Alhambra Theatre", "text": "Alhambra Theatre\n\nThe Alhambra was a popular theatre and music hall located on the east side of Leicester Square, in the West End of London. It was built originally as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts opening on 18 March 1854. It was closed after two years and reopened as the Alhambra. The building was demolished in 1936. The name was also adopted by many other British music hall theatres located elsewhere; in Bradford, in Hull and in Glasgow etc. The name comes from association with the Moorish splendour of the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain.\n\nThe Alhambra was originally known as the Royal Panopticon and was a landmark building at 23–27 Leicester Square, completed in 1854 by T. Hayter Lewis as a venue for showcasing the finest in the arts and for scientific demonstrations and popular education. This lasted for two years, and then the decision to add a circus ring was taken. When it reopened on 3 April 1858 it was renamed the Alhambra.\n\nThe 1858 building conversion to the \"Alhambra Circus\", was also by T. Hayter Lewis. It had a frontage and was very tall for the time. It was built in a Moorish style, with lavish fenestration, two towers and a dome, similar to the eponymous Bradford theatre in architectural style. It was a complete contrast with the neighbouring buildings. Inside there was a central rotunda in diameter and high. There was a secondary entrance to the rear on Charing Cross Road.\nThe Leicester Square theatre's name was changed frequently, but usually reflected the building's (very loose) stylistic associations with the celebrated Alhambra in Granada, Spain. By 1864, the circus had become the Alhambra Music Hall. Rebuildings occurred in 1866 and 1881, by Perry and Reed. From 1871, when it obtained a licence, an equestrian ballet was performed. The Alhambra was destroyed by fire in 1882, and was rebuilt in a more restrained style by Reed, reopening in 1884 as the Alhambra Theatre. Further rebuildings were in 1888 by Edward Clark, 1892 by Clark and Pollard, 1897 by W. M. Brutton, and in 1912 by the prolific theatre architect, Frank Matcham. Other names used during the life of the theatre were the Royal Alhambra Palace; Alhambra Theatre of Varieties; Theatre Royal, Alhambra; Great United States Circus and New Alhambra Theatre.\n\nLondon's Alhambra was predominantly used for the popular entertainment of the day, music hall. The usual music hall acts were performed, as well as the début of Jules Léotard performing his aerial act, above the heads of diners in May 1861. Other entertainments included \"patriotic demonstrations\" celebrating the British Empire and British military successes. The theatre also staged ballet and light opera. In the 1860s, John Hollingshead took over management at the Alhambra and made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring corps de ballet and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar. At its bars, the attractions of the Alhambra's ballet were not merely artistic:\n\nThe \"Can-Can\" as presented at the Alhambra by the 'Parisian Colonna' troupe proved so sexually provocative that in October 1870 the Alhambra was deprived of its dancing licence.\n\nAnother example of the fare on offer was this 1882 production, written by Dion Boucicault and J. R. Planche:\n\nEarly films were also a part of the entertainment, with Robert W. Paul, a former collaborator of Birt Acres, presenting his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. This included films featuring cartoonist Tom Merry drawing caricatures of the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II (1895), and Prince Bismarck (1895). Merry had previously performed his lightning fast drawing as part of a music hall stage act.\n\nDuring World War I, a series of hit revues played at the Alhambra that included \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" (1916), which featured the first performances of the song \"If You Were The Only Girl In The World\", performed by Violet Lorraine and George Robey . This was followed by \"The Bing Boys on Broadway\" (1917) and \"The Bing Boys are There\" (1918). The music for the revues was written by Nat D. Ayer with lyrics by Clifford Grey, and the text was by George Grossmith, Jr.\n\nLike many other theatres, the Alhambra went into decline after World War I owing to the increasing popularity of cinema and radio. It was demolished in 1936 to make way for the Odeon Leicester Square, which remains on the site. The entrance on Charing Cross Road has also been demolished and is now a modern office block.\n\n\n"}

Translated as \"grasslands\" in Mandarin, Caochangdi was home to a diverse group of residents, including migrant workers, farmers, students and artists, most notably, Ai Weiwei. Caochangdi developed into a thriving arts and cultural hub when artists began to move into the area around 2000, attracting international attention similar to the nearby 798 Art Zone. Demolition of the village began in July 2018.\n\nCaochangdi has changed dramatically over its history. Once unoccupied grazing land used as hunting grounds by the Imperial Court, it later became an imperial grave and garden site. During the Cultural Revolution, the region became an Agricultural People's Commune and transitioned into a farming village. When the Chinese economy opened up to the global market under Deng Xiaoping, farmers became landlords and began leasing the land to private companies, artists and galleries.\n\nIn 2009, the architects Mary-Ann Ray and Robert Mangurian published a book on the village, titled \"Caochangdi, Beijing Inside Out: Farmers, Floaters, Taxi Drivers, Artists, and the International Art Mob Challenge and Remake the City\". It is a study of the village's history and architecture, and includes interviews with Caochangdi residents.\n\nFor many years Caochangdi was under threat of demolition. In May 2011, after petitions by its residents and businesses, Chinese authorities officially announced the village would be spared. However, in July 2018 evictions were announced in preparation for demolition And Ai Weiwei's studio was demolished shortly thereafter. \n\n\"Caochangdi (CCD) – The Community\" was launched on September 28, 2012, as a research-driven program that hosts a series of art, design and technology events throughout Caochangdi. Consisting of gallery exhibitions, public art installations, live events, educational programs, workshops and seminars, CCD – The Community seeks to cultivate the diversity of Caochangdi through long-term curatorial projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1061223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1061223", "title": "Closet drama", "text": "Closet drama\n\nA closet drama is a play that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is \"a quite legitimate product of literary art.\" \nA closet drama (or closet play) is a play created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, playwrights might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid censorship of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[4] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including \"dramatis personae\" and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[5] This created an \"unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination.\" The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.]\n\nMarta Straznicky describes the form as \"part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned.\" Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: \"a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere\" through this medium.\n\nIn the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to \"engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public,\" since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.\n\nMargaret Lucas Cavendish, author of fourteen folio volumes, explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. ] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.\n\nOther notable women involved in closet drama include Anne Finch, Jane Lumley, and Elizabeth Cary.\n\nThe philosophical dialogues of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as Plato (see Socratic dialogue) were written in the form of conversations between \"characters\" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.\n\nBeginning with Friedrich von Schlegel, many have argued that the tragedies of Seneca the Younger in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed. Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor Nero, a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the Middle Ages was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of Hroswitha of Gandersheim and debate poems in quasi-dramatic form.\n\nFulke Greville, Samuel Daniel, Sir William Alexander, and Mary Sidney wrote closet dramas in the age of Shakespeare and Jonson.\n\nBetween 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a \"substitute\" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on \"propagandist aims\" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. Thomas Killigrew is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the English Civil War.\n\nFollowing the Restoration in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form \"served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama.\" John Milton's play \"Samson Agonistes\", written in 1671, is an example of early modern drama never intended for the stage.\n\nSeveral closet dramas in verse were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models. \"Faust, Part 1\" and \"Faust, Part 2\" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of German literature, were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Alexander Pushkin devoted much time to the closet drama.\n\nThe popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse tragedy on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward melodrama and comedy and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though Coleridge, Robert Browning, and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.\n\n"}
{"id": "4865884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4865884", "title": "Colab", "text": "Colab\n\nColab is the commonly used abbreviation of the New York City artists' group Collaborative Projects, which was formed after a series of open meetings between artists of various disciplines.\n\nColab came together as a collective in 1977, first using the name Green Corporation, and initially received an NEA Workshop Grant through Center for New Art Activities, Inc., a small not-for-profit formed in 1974.\n\nIn 1978, Collaborative Projects was incorporated as a not-for-profit and later received its tax-exempt status from the IRS, so that it could apply for grants from the NEA and other sources independently. Colab was active for about 10 years and became distinguished by the raw energy of its members and sometimes politically engaged open membership. By raising its own sources of funding, Colab was in control of its own exhibitions and cable TV shows.\n\nAdvocating a form of cultural activism that was purely artist driven, the group created artworks, negotiated venues, curated shows, crafted their own PR, and engaged in discourse that responded to the political themes and predicaments of their time, among them the recessions of the 1970s, the Reagan era of budget cuts and nuclear armament, the housing crisis and gentrification in New York City, and other pressing social issues.\n\nFrom November 1978, different artist members organized and installed original one-off group shows in their own studios or other temporary sites, such as \"The Batman Show,\" (591 Broadway 1979), \"Income and Wealth Show\" (5 Bleecker Store 1979), \"Doctors & Dentists Show\" (591 Broadway 1979), \"The Manifesto Show\" (5 Bleecker Store 1979), \"The Dog Show\" (591 Broadway 1979), \"Just Another Asshole Show\" (5 Bleecker Store), \"The Real Estate Show\" (Delancey Street, Jan. 1980), Jay St film shows 1979, \"Exhibit A\" (93 Grand Street, 1979) and, notably, \"The Times Square Show\" (201 W 41st, June 1980), a large open exhibition near the center of New York's entertainment (and pornography) district (Times Square) put on with Bronx-based Fashion Moda.\nSeed money from the first Colab (Green Corp.) workshop grant through Center for New Art Inc. led to the creation of Colab artists' TV series on Manhattan Cable (1978–1984) \"All Color News,\" \"Potato Wolf\" and \"Red Curtain\", New Cinema, a screening room on St. Mark's Place for narrative Super 8 films transferred to video and projected on an Advent screen; the continued publication of X Motion Picture Magazine(1979), whose first issue preceded the formation of Colab; support and inspiration for the ABC No Rio cultural center (1980-82 (ongoing) created from the Real Estate Show; support of the Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine (1984), NightShift Theater 1979, Spanner Magazine (3 issues 1979), MWF Video Club (established in 1986) and Bomb Magazine (1981). Members of the original group are presently highly active making art, and the membership has shifted and evolved. ABC No Rio was recently awarded a $1.6 million capital construction grant from the City of New York.\n\n\"We [Collaborative Projects] are functioning as a group of artists with complementary resources and skills providing a solid ground for collaborative work directed to the needs of the community-at-large. Specifically we are involved in programs facilitating development, production, and distribution of collaborative works. These works are realized in various media including film and video for distribution and cable-cast, and live cable TV broadcasts, as well as other more conventional art media such as graphics and printed materials.\"\n\n\"This statement (the one above) defines three fundamental aspects of Colab - members' desire to create and distribute \"collaborative work\" under the umbrella of an artist-run organization, their focus on new media versus traditional art objects and their openness to a range of aesthetic styles that would meet the \"needs of the community-at-large.\" This last point was critical to the group's identity and served as the foundation of a workshop-oriented administration that encouraged experimentation in many different areas, including but not limited to TV production, video editing, film, and performance art. With various workshops operating simultaneously and the participants' ability to draw on like-minded members as partners, Colab could produce many projects without the burden of an institutional identity. Typically, individual members worked together on more than one project in small subgroups that changed and over lapped from one project to the next.\"\n\nIn 1980, artists emulating 1970s Puerto Rican activists seized a building on New York's Lower East Side and opened it as a collectively run cultural center. ABC No Rio was passed on to successive managements until today it is an anarchist cultural center run by a collective with close ties to the publishing group Autonomedia.\"\n\n\"In the bohemia of downtown Manhattan, the band - and crew - based practices of art rock and super-8 film making thrived. The first artists' group to achieve prominence in New York was Colab (Collaborative Projects), which produced a show in Times Square in 1980. This exhibition was a groundswell of popularly accessible socially themed artworks held in an empty building that has housed an erotic massage parlor. Critics called it \"punk art\" -- \"three cord art anyone can play.\" The South Bronx art space Fashion Moda. participated in the Times Square Show, bringing in some of the new generation of graffiti artists who had been exhibiting in the Bronx as part of the hip-hop culture of writers, rappers, and break dancers. A forty-member democratically run membership group; Colab inspired other artists to form groups and mount huge shows in Brooklyn lofts, not to mention collaboration with the Washington Project for the Arts, for the Ritz Hotel Project in Washington, D.C. in 1983.\n\nIn 2016 \"A Book About Colab (and Related Activities)\" was published by Printed Matter, Inc. It was edited by Max Schumann, the director of Printed Matter, and contained a Foreword and Afterword by art writer and Colab member Walter Robinson. The book traces the output of Collaborative Projects from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s and serves as an exhaustive homage to the group’s work and a testimonial about their particular practice of collaboration, collectivity, and social engagement, while reflecting an iconic period of NYC cultural history.\nIn keeping with the democratic \"by and for artists\" ethos of Colab, the publication places this material alongside newly solicited texts from many of the group’s members – a mix of reflections and anecdotes, statements, manifestos, and excerpts from the ‘Colab Annual Report’, which provide a close perspective on the meaning of Colab for those who came into its orbit.\n\nIn 2008, a small partial retrospective exhibition called \"Colab Redux\" was held at Brooke Alexander Gallery.\n\nIn 2011, Printed Matter, Inc. presented an exhibition entitled \"A Show about Colab (and Related Activities)\". This overarching survey presented a wide range of materials and artworks from various Colab activities from the late 1970s through the mid 1980s, including screenings of film and video works, and cable broadcasts.\n\nIn 2012, The Hunter College Art Galleries presented \"Times Square Show Revisited\", an in-depth look at the original \"Times Square Show\" (1980). \"Times Square Show Revisited\" was the first focused assessment of the landmark exhibition organized by the artist group Collaborative Projects, Inc. Bobby G's audio piece \"Times Sq. Show Audio\" (0:38) appears on \"Just Another Asshole\", a compilation anthology LP that was released in 1981 and reissued in 1995 on Atavistic Records.\n\nIn 2013, an exhibition workshop entitled \"XFR STN (Transfer Station)\" was held at the New Museum. The opening night featured \"Moving Image Artists' Distribution Then & Now\" an assembly of participants in the \"MWF video club\", introduced by Andrea Callard, Michael Carter, Alan W. Moore, Nick Zedd and Coleen Fitzgibbon. Alan W. Moore created \"MWF Club\" in 1986 as a distribution company for \"Potato Wolf and All Color News\" Colab's television programs that aired on public access TV. \"MWF Club\" expanded to include programs from various other groups such as Communications Update, Downtown TV, Glenn O'Brien's TV Party, New Cinema, Cinema of Transgression, Naked Eye Cinema and numerous artists and filmmakers.\n\nAlso in 2013 Tom Warren's \"Photo Portfolio of Colab Artists Portraits (1981-1984)\" were featured at Gallery 98 and The Film-Makers' Cooperative presented a mini video retrospective entitled \"Colab TV Video Excerpts\" on November 15 at Soho House in New York City with discussion with Tom Otterness.\n\nIn early 2014, there were four concurrent art exhibitions in New York City around \"The Real Estate Show\": at James Fuentes Gallery, ABC No Rio, the Lodge Gallery, and Cuchifritos Gallery/Essex Street Market. That year also Art International Radio featured an interview and conversation between Jane Dickson, Coleen Fitzgibbon, and Becky Howland about Colab and the 1980 The Real Estate Show which birthed the ABC No Rio cultural center.\n\nFrom April 15 to May 15, 2016, Printed Matter, Inc presented a restating of \"The A. More Store\", a Colab-sponsored artists’ outlet for low-priced multiples from the early 1980s The selling exhibition included over 100 artworks from over 50 participating Colab members, including works on loan from historic \"A. More Stores\". The first \"A. More Store\" evolved from the Gift Shop at the legendary Colab-organized \"Times Square Show\" and appeared shortly after on Broome Street in 1980 with the tag-line “You won’t pay more at the A. More Store”. Other iterations of the store were later presented at Barbara Gladstone Gallery, Jack Tilton Gallery, White Columns, and Printed Matter, Inc.\n\nClocktower Productions web exhibited \"The Colab Vinyl Mix\", an 80-minute audio mix (aired 5/9/16) of no wave, hip hop, anti-pop, punk, funk, and noise music. These sounds provided the soundtrack to Colab art productions in the 1980s. The playlist was assembled by Sandra Seymour, Mark C of Live Skull, and Robert Goldman (Bobby G). The audio files were captured from the original vinyl record by the producers and illustrate the world of such legendary projects as \"The Times Square Show\", \"The Real Estate Show\", ABC No Rio, Fashion Moda. The mix includes the post-punk sounds of Y Pants, DNA, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Alan Vega, The Lounge Lizards, Bush Tetras, Glenn Branca as The Static, ESG, Robin Crutchfield, Afrika Bambaataa and others.\n\nBetween April 20 and May 15, 2016 an art historic street posters show from 1984 called \"Talk is Cheap\" at Printed Matter, Inc. Sponsored by Colab and organized by John Hogan in 1984, the show featured 47 two-color broadsides posted in the streets around downtown New York. The posters addressed political and economic issues of the time. The original ephemeral exhibition lasted a few days, as the posters were covered by signage and eventually posted over. Colab collaborators include Charlie Ahearn, Jane Dickson, Kiki Smith, Joseph Nechvatal, Jolie Stahl, Mitch Corber, Andrea Callard, Christy Rupp, Alan W. Moore, and others.\n\nIn June 2017, Becky Howland & Matthias Mayer curated \"The Real Estate Show\" at Spor Klubu in Berlin, drawing from documentation of the original \"Real Estate Show\" (1980) from the Archive Collection of the extant project space ABC No Rio. Included in the show were Robert Cooney, Mitch Corber, Peter Fend, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Bobby G (Robert Goldman), Ilona Granet, Becky Howland, Christof Kohlhofer, Gregory Lehmann, Ann Messner, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, Joseph Nechvatal, Cara Perlman, Scott Pfaffman, Christy Rupp and Robin Winters. In conjunction with this show, another exhibition called \"The Real Estate Show Extended/Berlin: Group exhibition on the subject of Gentrification, Real Estate Speculation and Selling out the City\" was presented at Kunstpunkt Berlin. This show included many Berlin artists along with four original members of the \"Real Estate Show\" (1980): Becky Howland, Peter Mönnig, Alan Moore, and Joseph Nechvatal. Howland, Mönnig, Moore and Nechvatal also participated in a panel discussion on Real Estate and Art on June 3, 2017 that was moderated by Howard McCalebb of Dada Post, Berlin.\n\nVarious artists who were associated with Colab, include:\n\n\n\n"}

It is also known as De Causis Proprietatum Elementorum, De Proprietatibus Elementorum et Planetarum or simply De Elementis. It was probably written in the ninth or tenth century. The author of the work claimed to be Aristotle, but eventually it was determined that it was an original work by an Arab author. Consequently, the work is now attributed to a Pseudo-Aristotle.\n\nThe work did not have a lasting impact on science in the medieval Islamic world, but it became important in Europe after it was translated to Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the twelfth century. By the thirteenth century, it had become one of the three main sources for medieval knowledge on geology, together with Aristotle's \"Meteorology\" and Avicenna's \"De Mineralibus\". These three treatises were an important influence on the study of geology by Albertus Magnus. When scholars started to recognize during the Renaissance that \"De Proprietatibus Elementorum\" was not written by Aristotle, it was removed from the academic curriculum.\n\nIn his work \"Meteorology\", Aristotle explained that the earth as an element was cold and dry. He did not cover phenomena related to terrestrial heat. \"De Proprietatibus Elementorum\" filled this lacuna with its inquiry on volcanoes and hot springs. According to the work large quantities of sulfur in the interior of a mountain caused volcanic eruptions. Winds and waters present at the foot of the mountain could set fire to this sulfur, particularly in the case of Mount Etna.\n\nIts explanation of hot springs seems to have been taken by an unknown work from Theophrastus. Theophrastus or the pseudo-Aristotle first dismisses several explanations provided by Democritus, Mileus and Rentifolus, the latter two possibly Thales and Xenophanes. The opinion of the author follows, that water gets heated by beds of sulfur before it emerges on the surface. Naphtha is associated with this process, because together with sulfur it forms a kind of burner to transport fuel to the fire. \n"}

She was also known as Mary Alwyn.\n\nDoreen Carwithen was born in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire on 15 November 1922. As a child she had her first music lessons from her mother, a music teacher, starting both piano and violin with her at the age of four. At age 16 she began composing by setting Wordsworth's \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud (Daffodils)\" for voice and piano.\n\nIn 1941 she entered the Royal Academy of Music and played the cello in a string quartet and with orchestras. She was a member of the harmony class of William Alwyn, who began to teach her composition. Her overture \"ODTAA (One Damn Thing After Another)\" was premiered at Covent Garden by Adrian Boult in 1947. The same year she was selected by the Royal Academy to train as composer of film music.\n\nIn 1961 she became William Alwyn's devoted secretary and amanuensis, becoming his second wife in 1975, adopting Mary Alwyn as her married name, as she disliked the name Doreen, and Mary was her middle name. She later worked as a Sub Professor of Composition at the RAM. After her husband's death in 1985, she founded the William Alwyn Archive and William Alwyn Foundation to promote his music and facilitate related research projects.\n\nShe then also resumed interest in her own music. In 1999 a stroke left her paralysed on one side.

It is believed it was used to remove chunks of meat from a stew in a large cauldron for serving. It dates to the Late Bronze Age, between 1050 and 900 BC. Since 1856, it has been in the British Museum in London.\n\nAlong the top of the flesh-hook are five birds, two large ones next to three smaller ones. At the bottom of the shaft, facing the family of five, are two birds. The group of two birds, presumably an adult pair, can be identified as corvids, perhaps ravens, the family of five as swans and cygnets. The two sets of birds seem to invoke opposites: birds of water versus birds of the air; white ranged against black, fecundity as opposed to death (implied by the predatory character of ravens). Perhaps, in the mind of the Bronze Age inhabitants, the two sets of birds denoted a fable of opposites between good and bad. The flesh-hook was originally linked by pieces of oak shaft, only one fragment of which remains extant.\n\nThe Dunaverney Flesh-Hook was discovered in 1829 by workmen who were cutting turf at Dunaverney Bog to the north of Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland. At the time of its discovery, the Dunaverney Flesh-Hook was unparalleled and for a long time many experts could not agree on its age and function. However, as more examples were found, not only in Ireland and Britain, but along the Atlantic seaboard of the European continent, it became clear from their style, technology and context that they belonged to the Bronze Age and were clearly important instruments used during ceremonial feasts. To this day, the representation of birds seen on the Dunaverney Flesh-Hook remains unique in north-west Europe.\n\n"}

{"id": "2256589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2256589", "title": "El Paso (song)", "text": "El Paso (song)\n\n\"El Paso\" is a country and western ballad written and originally recorded by Marty Robbins, and first released on \"Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs\" in September 1959. It was released as a single the following month, and became a major hit on both the country and pop music charts, reaching number one in both at the start of 1960. It won the Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording in 1961, and remains Robbins' best-known song. It is widely considered a genre classic for its gripping narrative which ends in the death of its protagonist, its shift from past to present tense, haunting harmonies by vocalists Bobby Sykes and Jim Glaser (of the Glaser Brothers) and the eloquent and varied Spanish guitar accompaniment by Grady Martin that lends the recording a distinctive Tex-Mex feel. The name of the character Feleena was based upon a schoolmate of Robbins in the fifth grade; Fidelina Martinez.\n\nMembers of the Western Writers of America chose \"El Paso\" as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.\n\nThere have been three versions of Robbins' original recording of \"El Paso\": the original full-length version, the edited version, and the abbreviated version (briefly described below), which is an alternate take in stereo. The original version is in mono and is around 4 minutes and 38 seconds in duration, far longer than most contemporary singles at the time, especially in the country genre. Robbins' longtime record company, Columbia Records, was unsure whether radio stations would play such a long song, so it released two versions of the song on a promo 45: the full-length version on one side, and an edited version on the other which was nearer to the three-minute mark. This version omitted some excerpts of lyrics of the original. Most of the record-buying public, as well as most disk jockeys, overwhelmingly preferred the full-length version. \n\nThe song is a first-person narrative about an ill-fated love triangle, as sung by a cowboy in El Paso, Texas, in the days of the Wild West. The singer recalls how he frequented a nightclub called \"Rosa's Cantina,\" where he became smitten with a young Mexican dancer named Feleena. When the singer notices another cowboy sharing a drink with \"wicked Feleena,\" he challenges the newcomer to a gunfight out of jealousy over the young woman. The singer kills the newcomer, then flees El Paso for fear of being hanged for murder or killed in revenge by his victim's entourage. (The abbreviated version of the song, often found on compilations, omits a verse in which the singer expresses shock and remorse over the \"foul evil deed I had done\" before realizing he has to flee.) In the act of fleeing, the singer commits the additional and potentially hanging offense of horse theft (\"I caught a good one, it looked like it could run\"), further sealing his fate in El Paso. Departing El Paso, the singer hides out in the \"badlands of New Mexico.\"\n\nThe song then fast-forwards to an undisclosed time later, when the singer describes his yearning for Feleena that drives him to return to El Paso, without regard for his own life: \"It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden / My love is stronger than my fear of death.\" Upon arriving, the singer is chased and fatally wounded by a posse. At the end of the song, the singer recounts how Feleena has \"found me,\" and he dies in her arms after \"one little kiss.\"\n\nCoincidentally, \"El Paso\" was followed in the Hot 100 No. 1 position by Johnny Preston's \"Running Bear\", another song in which the protagonist of the song dies although the story of Running Bear is not told in the first person.\n\n\"El Paso\" was frequently performed by the Grateful Dead in concert. The song entered the band's repertoire in 1969, and remained there until the band's demise in 1995; in total, it was performed 389 times. It was sung by rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, with Jerry Garcia contributing harmony vocals. On the album \"Ladies and Gentlemen... The Grateful Dead\", Bob Weir introduces the song as the Dead's \"most requested number\".\n\nThe alternative country band Old 97's have also covered this song but instead of in the traditional 3/4 time, they hammered it out in 4/4. Their cover appears on as well as the \"King of the Hill\" original TV soundtrack.\n\nGrady Martin released an instrumental version in 1965 on his \"Instrumentally Yours\" album.\n\nEl Paso has also been recorded by Max Stalling, Michael Martin Murphey, Tom Russell, The Mills Brothers, and Jason and the Scorchers.\n\nAfter Lolita along with her Western Trio had a hit in the US with Seemann (Deine Heimat ist das Meer) she reciprocated by recording a German version of the song which became a hit in the German world and contributed to a long series of bi-national songs such as \"Wenn der Sommer Kommt\" and two songs which would top the U.S. country charts thirteen years later as performed by Marie Osmond \"Lieber Jonny, Komm doch Wieder\" and \"Das einsame Haus in Waikiki\".\n\nA parody version, \"El Pizza\" by H. B. Barnum, was a radio hit in 1960. It moved the action to Azusa, California, where Rosa's Cantina became a pizza place where Feleena worked as a waitress.\n\nHomer and Jethro also parodied the song (\"Velvita's Cafe had standing room only; wall-to-wall drunks all the way to the door. I looked around for a place I could sit down; a lady got up, and I grabbed her char . . . .\"[not \"chair\"). \"I asked her where have you been all my life; she answered, 'Most of it I wasn't born'.\"\n\nBlaine L. Reininger, a founding musician of San Francisco band Tuxedomoon, included this song on his 1989 solo album Book of Hours.\n\nIn the late 1980s a modified version of \"El Paso\" (Miners Fight) became known as the Official Fight song of the University of Texas at El Paso Miners.\n\nRobbins wrote two songs that are explicit sequels to \"El Paso\", one in 1966, one in 1976. (He also wrote other songs that told Western stories in a similar vein, but they are not sequels to \"El Paso\", as they involve none of the same characters.)\n\nIn 1966, Robbins recorded \"Felina (From El Paso)\", telling the life story of Felina, the \"Mexican girl\" from \"El Paso\", in a third-person narrative. This track was over eight minutes long. Robbins wrote most of it in Phoenix, Arizona, but went to El Paso seeking inspiration for the conclusion.\n\nBorn in a desert shack in New Mexico during a thunderstorm, Felina runs away from home at 17, living off her charms for a year in Santa Fe, before moving to the brighter lights of El Paso to become a paid dancer. After another year, the narrator of \"El Paso\" arrives, the first man she did not have contempt for. He spends six weeks romancing her, before shooting another man with whom she was flirting through \"insane jealousy\" in a retelling of the key moment in the original song. Her lover's return to El Paso comes only a day after his flight (the original song suggests a longer timeframe before his return) and as she goes to run to him, the cowboy motions to her to stay out of the line of fire and is shot; immediately after his dying kiss, Feleena shoots herself with his gun. Their ghosts are heard to this day in the wind blowing around El Paso: \"It's only the young cowboy showing Feleena the town\".\n\nIn 1976 Robbins released another reworking, \"El Paso City\", in which the present-day singer is a passenger on a flight over El Paso, which reminds him of a song he had heard \"long ago,\" proceeding to summarize the original \"El Paso\" story. \"I don't recall who sang the song,\" he sings, but he feels a supernatural connection to the story: \"Could it be that I could be the cowboy in this mystery...,\" he asks, suggesting a past life. This song was a country number one. The arrangement includes riffs and themes from the previous two El Paso songs. Robbins wrote it while flying over El Paso in, he reported, the same amount of time it takes to sing--four minutes and fourteen seconds. It was only the second time that ever happened to him; the first time was when he composed the original \"El Paso\" as fast as he could write it down. Robbins intended to do one more sequel, “The Mystery of Old El Paso,” but he died in late 1982 before he could finish the final song.\n\n"}

Patronised by the Medici, he aspired to become the new Vasari by renewing and expanding his biographies of artists, to which Baldinucci added lives of French and Flemish artists omitted by Vasari. His most important work was this biographical dictionary of artists, \"Notizie de' professori del disegno da Cimabue in qua\", of which the publication began in 1681 and continued after his death. \n\nHis biography of Gian Lorenzo Bernini was published in 1682. \n\nBaldinucci came from a prominent and wealthy family of the Florentine merchant elite. As well as writing he drew portraits in chalk and modeled in clay; many of his deft and lively chalk portraits of friends are in the collection of the Uffizi. For Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, brother of Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and a scholar and patron of the arts, he began as bookkeeper in 1664 and developed, after the Cardinal's death, into virtually the curator of the Grand Ducal collections. In this way Baldinucci made a name as one of Italy's leading connoisseurs. His work recataloguing and adding to the Medici collections, first of drawings and then of paintings, was groundbreaking, using new ideas about organisation and completeness to make these the most modern collections of the time—collections in large part the foundation of the Uffizi's art holdings. \n\nThis meticulous work was based on an ability to distinguish between the hands of different painters—an idea then new and untested, and one that opened up the field of connoisseurship that enabled the attributions of Italian drawings, which are generally unsigned. In his \"Vocabolario\", the first dictionary of artistic terms, Baldinucci provided fourteen definitions of style using eighty different terms, and applied some of his terms to \"bad\" art. \n\nFrom this grew his \"Notizie\", in which he consciously intended to build upon the \"Vite\" of Giorgio Vasari; Baldinucci's was the first art history to trace the lives and work of artists not only of one region (Vasari was prejudiced towards Tuscan artists) but all Italy, and indeed beyond. He studied closely the stylistic debts of the great masters to one another, and in this, and his meticulous use of documentation and archives, he was centuries ahead in the discipline of art history.\n\nIn his \"Vocabolario\" (1681) he presented terms of art and technical terms, not only for the fine arts but for goldsmith's work, \"pietre dure\", color pigments and tools.\n\nIn other ways Baldinucci was very much a man of his time, of the Counter-Reformation and of the Baroque. Educated at a Jesuit school, he was intensely pious—before marrying, he completed the whole of Ignatius of Loyola's \"Spiritual Exercises\" to discover whether he should in fact devote himself to a single life. Three of his sons went into the church, and one, Antonio, was a Jesuit missionary later beatified.\n\nHe had great appreciation of the Baroque, and wrote in a periodic style which reflected it, each phrase opening from the preceding, full of periphrasis and other flourishes of rhetoric, though flowing. His understanding of art stemmed largely from his religion, for he believed that it came as divine inspiration into special lives, the lives of the artists he so painstakingly recorded.\n\nBaldinucci's son wrote the first biography of his father; Baldinucci's notes are conserved in the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence (MSS Fondo Nazionale II.II.110)\n\n\nFilippo Baldinucci on the Privilege of Burial is the title of a poem by Robert Browning from his 1876 collection, \"Pacchiarotto, and How He Worked in Distemper\". It is based on an anecdote contained in Baldinucci's life of the artist Lodovico Buti.\n\n"}

Turner became a regular performer in a variety of productions.\n\nIn 1906 she joined the fledgling motion picture business, signing with the pioneering Vitagraph Studios and making her film debut in \"How to Cure a Cold\" (June 8, 1907).\n\nAt the time there were no stars per se, unless an already famous stage star made a movie. Performers were not even mentioned by name. Long, drawn out screen credits were not thought of. There was nothing but the name of the company and the picture. As the content of movies evolved from simple incidents, or situations, into definite stories, some of the heroes and heroines were conceded a vague identity, such as the \"Edison Girl\", etc.\nThough she was known only as the \"Vitagraph Girl\" in the early motion picture shorts, Turner became the most popular American actress to appear on screen (at that time still dominated by French pictures, especially from the Pathe and Gaumont companies). Her worth to the studio, as its biggest box-office draw, was recognised in 1907 when her pay was upped to $22 a week, as proto-star plus part-time seamstress. It was somewhat less than the male leading players, especially those with stage experience, particularly the super-popular Maurice Costello. In March 1910 she and Florence Lawrence became the first screen actors not already famous in another medium to be publicized by name by their studios to the general public.\n\nLater that year, Florence was paired several times with heart throb Wallace Reid, who was on his way to stardom. But with the rise of more stars such as Gene Gauntier and Marin Sais at Kalem Studios, Marion Leonard and Mary Pickford at Biograph Studios, and Florence Lawrence (Biograph, moving to IMP in 1910), Florence Turner was no longer quite as special. By 1913 she was looking for new pastures and left the United States accompanied by longtime friend Laurence Trimble, who directed her in a number of movies. They moved to England, where she and Larry began performing together in London music halls.\n\nTurner sometimes wrote screenplays and directed her own movies, including a number of comedies. She also organized her own production company, Turner Films, for which she made more than thirty shorts.\n\nTurner entertained Allied troops during World War I. She returned to the U.S. after the Armistice, but was not as successful as before. In 1920, she again went to England, where she remained until moving to Hollywood, virtually forgotten, in 1924.\n\nBy then she was thirty-nine years of age and her starring days were long behind her. She continued to act in supporting roles into the 1930s.\n\nIn 1928 she acted in a minor role on Broadway in \"Sign of the Leopard\", which ran for 39 performances. Turner was placed on the payroll at MGM by Louis B. Mayer in the 1930s, but was limited in the assignments offered. She mostly played bit or small parts and worked as an extra.\n\nShe later moved to the Motion Picture Country House, a retirement community for the industry in Woodland Hills, California.\n\nAfter appearing in more than 160 motion pictures, Florence Turner died at 61 in Woodland Hills. She was cremated at a mortuary in Hollywood and, at her request, there was no funeral service. She was buried at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.\n\n"}

The movie is also based on the DC program called City at Peace. The title is a play on the term \"Freedom Riders\", referring to the multiracial civil rights activists who tested the U.S. Supreme Court decision ordering the desegregation of interstate buses in 1961.\n\nThe idea for the film came from journalist Tracey Durning, who made a documentary about Erin Gruwell for the ABC News program \"Primetime Live\". Durning served as co-executive producer of the film. The film was dedicated to the memory of Armand Jones, who was killed after wrapping up \"Freedom Writers\". He was 18 and was shot to death in Anaheim, California after a confrontation with a man who robbed Jones of a necklace in a Denny's restaurant.\n\nIn 1994, in Long Beach, California, Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) has been accepted to teach English for at-risk students at Woodrow Wilson High School, a once highly acclaimed school, but where racial tensions have increased since the Los Angeles Riots two years prior. Erin struggles to connect to her students and she experiences numerous fights between some students, who are in rival gangs.\n\nOne night, Eva Benitez (April L. Hernandez), her boyfriend, and a friend go to a convenience store. Sindy (Jaclyn Ngan), a Cambodian refugee, frequents the same convenience store. Grant Rice (Armand Jones), an African-American student at Woodrow Wilson, frustrated at losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant storms out of the store, Eva's boyfriend, Paco (as retaliation for losing a fight against Grant that took place earlier during a gang fight at Woodrow Wilson), attempts a drive-by shooting to kill Grant, but misses accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend. As a witness, Eva must testify at court; she intends to guard \"her own\" in her testimony.\n\nAt school, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and utilizes it to teach them about the Holocaust, most of whom have no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys them composition books to record their diaries, in which they talk about their experiences of being abused, seeing their friends die, and being evicted. Determined to reform her high school students, Gruwell takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband (Patrick Dempsey). Her students start to behave with respect and discover a lot more. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus (Jason Finn). Gruwell invites various Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the Museum of Tolerance. Meanwhile, her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell (Imelda Staunton).\n\nThe following school year comes, and Gruwell teaches her class (now sophomores) again, making it the second year that she is their teacher. On the first day of semester, Gruwell makes her class do a \"Toast for Change\", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves. Later on, the class makes enough money to have Miep Gies to arrive to the United States and tell her experience when she helped Anne Frank, her family, and the Van Pels hide from the Nazis; she then also persuades the students that they are heroes and that they \"within their own small ways, [can] turn on a small light in a dark room.\" These two events inspire Eva to break free of the demands of her father to always protect her own rather than tell the truth. At Grant's trial, she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend in the store; Grant is spared of being convicted and Sindy later forgives Eva. On leaving the court, Eva is attacked and threatened but ultimately spared by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe.\n\nMeanwhile, Gruwell asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it \"The Freedom Writers Diary\". Her husband divorces her and Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. Gruwell fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids during their junior and senior years, much to their elation. The film ends with a note that Gruwell successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college, for many the first in their families to do so.\n\n\n\"Freedom Writers\" had a domestic gross of $36,605,602 and had a foreign gross of $6,485,139 bringing the movie to a total gross of $43,090,741 worldwide. On the film's opening weekend it grossed a total of $9,405,582 ranking 4th behind \"Children of Men\" (3rd), \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" (2nd), and \"Night at the Museum\" (1st).\n\n\"Freedom Writers\" has received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes provides links to 124 reviews, 70% of which are positive. The critical consensus is that \"\"Freedom Writers\" is a frank, formulaic entry in the inspirational inner-city teacher genre, with an energetic Hilary Swank leading the appealing cast of unknowns.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 64/100 based on 29 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Cynthia Fuchs of Common Sense Media gave the film three out of five stars, writing in her review that \"the plot is predictable, the actors too old to play high school students, and the pacing too slow. And really, the camera circles around deep-thinking faces a few too many times. But \"Freedom Writers\" also argues for listening to teenagers. That in itself makes it a rare and close-to-wonderful thing.\" The film received a positive rating from \"Fox Weekly\", giving the film a 9 out of 10.\n\nChloé Valdary says that seeing the film inspired her to become politically active.\n\nCommon lent his talents to the soundtrack with \"A Dream\", featuring and produced by The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am. The soundtrack also includes the Tupac Shakur song \"Keep Ya Head Up\".\n\nInstrumental sections of Sia's \"Breathe Me\" accompany the film's television trailer.\n\nThe Freedom Writers soundtrack contains the following songs:\n\n\n"}

(GVU, Society for the Prosecution of Copyright Infringement) is a registered association under German law. According to its own description it works for the game and film industry and helps to protect intellectual property and to counter the illegal distribution of copied materials. For this purpose, the association cooperates with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).\n\nThe GVU was founded in the spring of 1984 and entered the register of associations in February 1985 for the first time. The headquarters were located first in Hamburg, since 2008 they have been in Berlin-Mitte. The GVU became known to a wider public by participating in campaigns such as \"pirates are criminals“ and investigations in the Kino.to case.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a rapidly increasing demand for movies on VHS and an increase in \"piracy\" at the same time, film industry representatives agreed in early 1984 to set up a separate company to combat illegal distribution of copyrighted material. The decision was primarily driven by the motivation of the industry, to detach from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The longtime chairman of the Bundesverband Audiovisuelle Medien (BVV, Federal Association of Audiovisual Media) and Managing Director of the German subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Bodo Schwartz, was key in the establishment of GVU.\n\nThe establishment of the GVU as a legally registered association was formally announced in the autumn of 1984 at the HiFi trade fair in Düsseldorf. The first constitution was adopted on December 17, 1984. It first entered the register of the city of Hamburg on February 27, 1985, finalising the establishment of the association on that day. Next to Bodo Schwartz, Paul Miller of the Cinema International Corporation (CIC) and Manfred Goller of the Verband der Filmverleiher (VDF, Association of Film Distributors) were members of the founding board.\n\nAfter exclusive funding of the GVU by the movie industry in its initial years, the organisations range of tasks expanded in 1997 to include computer games. On the one hand this was due to the parallels between illegal copies of films and games - both in the production and distribution - and on the other hand, the simpler distribution of unauthorized material over the emerging Internet. Sony Computer Entertainment’s membership of the GVU in 1997 initiated the membership of the entire Entertainment Software Association in the GVU in the following year.\n\nIn 2000, Microsoft entered the GVU as the first member of the software industry, which represented a significant milestone for the work of the GVU and directed the attention of the general public to the association. Simultaneously, this resulted in an expansion of the range of GVU’s tasks. As early as in 2001, the GVU took over the administration of the organization SAFE, which is responsible for the fight against copyright infringement in Switzerland. At the same time, cooperation intensified with the Austrian Verein für Anti-Piraterie (VAP, Association for Anti-Piracy) in the film and video industry, so the entire German-speaking area was fully covered.\n\nThe statutes of the GVU provides that the board consists of a chairman and at least three others. The GVU is represented jointly by at least two board members. Currently (as of November 2012) the committee includes Vincent de La Tour (Chairman), Dr. Holger Ensslin, Violetta Psofiou, Ralph Tübben, Alexander Skipis and Dr. Bernd Fakesch. According to the Commercial Register there are committees for finance, legal and technology. Next to the executive board the association has a full-time executive director who is responsible for the daily operations and reports to the Board. Dr. Matthias Leonardy currently holds this position, who previously worked as a general counsel for the German eBay Group.\n\nWork and structure of the GVU was mainly characterized by Bodo Schwartz, who was on the executive board for over 20 years and led it as Chairman for a long time. He also represented the GVU to media and shaped the image of the association in the public, including through various interviews. Schwartz retired from his position of CEO of Twentieth Century Fox in 2002, and retired from the GVU in October 2006. His retirement speech in late January 2007 was held by Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.\n\nIn 2011, a total of about 50 companies and organizations were represented as a member of the GVU. In the field of film this includes virtually all major Hollywood studios, such as Sony Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Studios. Members from the gaming industry include Ubisoft, Microsoft, Activision, Konami and Koch Media as well as respective affiliates of the major film studios. In addition, in its Annual Report 2011, the service providers arvato, Cinram, OpSec and Rovi got quoted as members.\n\nA special role is played by the membership of numerous professional organizations, in which the interests and positions of certain industries are bundled. So for example currently the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI, Federal Association of Music Industry), the Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien (BITKOM, German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media) and the Bundesverband Interaktive Unterhaltungssoftware (BIU, Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software) belong to the GVU. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), one of the foremost organizations against copyright infringement in the English speaking world, is a full member too.\n\nOverall, in 2011, nine organizations, 21 films- and 15 games providers and five other companies supported the GVU. Over the last five years the number of members has remained largely constant. However, as a result of the economic and financial crisis, the association lost some companies from the movie industry. The most prominent example in this case is the production and distribution company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which in 2007 was still listed as a member of the GVU, but no longer in the following year. MGM went into administration in 2010 and withdrew from other industry associations.\n\nSince 2007, the GVU has published annually a list of its members. Organizations and companies indirectly involved in the GVU through third-party associations are not explicitly listed in it.\n\nThe activities of the Association focuses on preventing economic losses of its members, resulting from unauthorized copying and its dissemination. The GVU estimated the loss at several hundred million euros annually. In addition to those defined in the constitution, the association based its efforts primarily on copyright law.\n\nThe association applies a large part of its resources to the actual detection of copyright infringements. The action is driven by the view that government agencies alone cannot monitor the entire market for unlicensed content, which is why the GVU tries to fill this gap. The employees of the GVU, including former police officers and commissioners, systematically scour the relevant sources of illegal copies, especially on the Internet. Unlike other organizations, by its own admission the GVU does not primarily aim at end-consumers, rather, it targets mainly the \"big fishes\". Besides those people who for example record a movie at the cinema or make copies from a computer game, these increasingly include the operators of so-called Trackers.\n\nThe GVU mainly focuses on large, internationally active release groups where copyrighted products are reproduced and distributed systematically, especially for profit. In its work, the association - if possible - accesses to public registers, for example, to reveal the real people behind a shell company. Due of their private-sector activity, the GVU may not identify IP addresses directly. Instead the association directs this as evidence to the relevant authorities. This is usually done as part of criminal procedure, which then leads to public prosecutorial investigations. Unless a criminal procedure is actually opened, an employee of the association often act as an expert witness. Not every complaint will automatically lead to a successful prosecution, for example the GVU had to make a total of three applications in the case of Kino.to.\n\nAs far as it is known to date, the GVU does not claim damages from warez users according to civil law. Instead the association allows its members the freedom to make possible claims for losses incurred. However, the association engages in strongly communicating its legal opinion in individual cases. Particularly in cases related to so-called illegal streaming of copied content, many legal assessments and opinions remain debatable.\n\nIn addition to its investigative activities the GVU does intensive public relations, which aims to raise awareness of copyright infringement. In the years 2009 to 2011 members of the association participated in nearly 100 events and reached about 2.000 participants through their speeches. In addition, since the late 80s the GVU has offered seminars for police officers and prosecutors, where they can learn about the consequences of \"piracy\" as well as the activities of the association.\n\nIn 1990, the GVU launched a prevention program on the topic of holography, a technology making it easier for retailers and consumers to identify unauthorized copied media. In addition, the association was known to a wider audience through the campaign \"Pirates are criminals\". This was produced by a subsidiary of the Central Association of German Film Theatres, where the GVU sits on the advisory board. During the World Cup 2006 an action of the umbrella organization MPAA was supported by Pelé.\n\nSince 2008, the GVU has performed annually the so-called ROOF-industry forum together with VAP and SAFE, which recently took place in the Kalkscheune venue in Berlin. At the event, lawyers, representatives of the games and movie industries are brought together with trade associations and other stakeholders under the slogan \"prevention and education\". In 2011, the study of digital content usage (short DCN study) received large attention, since it was the first to cover the specific uses of legal and illegal online content. The study was prepared by the GVU and the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (Federal Association of Music Industry) as well as the Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels (Association of German Book Trade).\n\nBeside the main activities, GVU also gives advice to politicians and represents its interests there. For example, the association - as well as others around the globe - requested a \"piracy\" warning. This should be presented to an Internet user as soon as it first wants to call a pirated copy, but this remains controversial in Germany. In the course of this particular position, the GVU criticized the Federal Ministry of Justice. Furthermore, the association has complained for years that in case of copyright infringement there is a right of access to Internet service providers, but this would fail due to the lack of storage of communication data (\"web problem\").\n\nThe GVU also calls to execute the missing third basket of the reform of copyright law at last. Likewise, the trend towards trivialisation of copyright infringement by individual politicians criticized repeatedly, most recently in an article by Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Paul van Dyk in TIME.\n\nThe investigations conducted by the association were influenced by technological progress over the years: After the beginning of the 80s the fight against pirated VHS tapes were in the spotlight, many prosecutions in the 90s and the following years related to the distribution of movies and games via P2P networks. Since 2010 streaming has taken an increasingly larger space.\n\nThe number of cases opened in the years 2007 to 2011 fell from 576 to 204. The decrease is mainly due to the fact that since 2008 many prosecutors have focused on those investigations in which more than 200 copies of a work were produced. The GVU in its own words has adopted this trend and focuses its investigative activities increasingly on major cases.\n\nIn addition to the operations that stern directly from GVU investigations, the association supports those proceedings initiated by the relevant legal authorities. In addition, each year several proceedings are officially reported, which were initiated jointly by law enforcement agencies and the GVU. About a quarter of all cases result in a verdict or penalty order.\n\nIn recent years, the GVU has uncovered many release groups and other networks, some of which stand out because of their size or importance. Especially if in the course of the investigation a house search takes place, the respective cases and the activities of the association experienced increased media attention. Mentioned in the annual reports of the GVU important procedures include the following:\n\n\nIn the following years, the association wants especially to tackle the financing of \"piracy\". The aim of the operation is to prevent professional service of ad-funded websites with pirated works.\n\nThe most important proceeding of the GVU in the last decade was against Kino.to. In June 2011 Kino.to was one of the 50 most visited sites in Germany and was thus well known to the general public. According to the film industry over 96 per cent of visitors were located in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. At Kino.to it was possible to view tens of thousands of videos via so-called Streams, including numerous high-quality movies and TV series.\n\nSince Kino.to has become available in March 2008, the GVU was determined to go against its backers. According to the GVU, the process was difficult, as those behind Kino.to had specifically concealed their identities. For example, the top-level domain .to was chosen, as the responsible authority in Tonga does not releases any information about the respective owners of domains. Only when the third formal complaint by the Association was reported to the authorities in Dresden on April 28, 2011, the desired outcome was achieved: In early June, in raids across several European countries, several persons were arrested who were directly involved in Kino.to - including the owner Dirk B.\n\nMainly responsible for the success was the Integrierte Ermittlungseinheit Sachsen (INES, Integrated Detection Unit Saxony). During the course of process Kino.to was shut down on the suspicion of the backers forming a criminal organization and copyright infringement on an industrial scale. A message relating to the criminal investigation is now found at Kino.to. What is seen in the film industry as a major success fuelled huge criticisms by the majority of Kino.to users.\n\nAs a direct result of the closure of Kino.to, Anonymous started an attack on the Web server of the GVU, which finally led to an overload and failure of the website. In addition under the name KinoX.to a portal got created which is a direct descendant of Kino.to. The GVU has now also initiated an investigation into this portal. In addition, the association and authorities are investigating the advertising and marketing of Kino.to and KinoX.to.\n\nA Trojan, which had been discovered for the first time on 20 March 2012, used the logo of GVU without permission of the Association. It targets and infects PCs running Microsoft Windows XP or later versions and claims to have locked the PC on behalf of the GVU, as pirated content had been detected on it. In fact not a single file on the hard disk is checked; however the user is prompted to pay a fee in order to regain access to the computer. Usually, the requested amount is between 50 and 100 euros and is to be paid via paysafecard or (now defunct) Ukash.\n\nMeanwhile, numerous variants of the GVU Trojan are circulating purporting to be a program of the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, Federal Office for Information Security) or the Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte (GEMA, Society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights). Due to the widespread use of the Trojan, in August 2012 the GVU released its first statement regarding the malware, aimed in particular at the malware authors. It was speculated that the Trojan was written by operators of illegal streaming portals in order to open up new financial sources. The page KinoX.to which strongly resembles Kino.to was used for the mass dissemination of new variants of the malware according to GVU.\n\nIn January 2006 the GVU was itself under investigation. The state prosecution of Ellwangen accused the association of having promoted the illegal distribution of copyrighted material. As the accusation details the association had allegedly had financial dealings with an administrator of the so-called IOH server, over which numerous release groups had collected and distributed copied content. In addition, the association got accused of directly providing hardware for the operation of the server.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation the business premises of the GVU in Hamburg, as well as the home of a senior employee, were searched. The GVU has officially confirmed the raid and, according to the authorities, made available all of the information. Due to the particular urgency of the case, the action gained widespread media attention. However, suspicions against the association have not been confirmed. The investigation has since halted.\n\nAlso, during another investigation, the role of the GVU was criticised: The Kiel District Court said that during the course of proceedings against a suspected software pirates, it is essential to ensure the independence of police investigative work. Specifically, there were complaints that an employee of the GVU had worked as an expert in the process and at the same time had a free hand in the analysis of seized computers. The requirement of impartiality, not only for judges but also for prosecutors and the police had, in their opinion, not been fully safeguarded. Investigating authorities were prohibited to privatize their work.\n\nAlso, the strategy of the GVU in luring software pirates through a so-called honey pot trap has remained a subject of criticism. For example, during the course a raid in autumn 2007 suspicions were raised that the GVU and other organizations had installed open FTP servers on network, intended for the use by release groups, thus enabling the determination release group members based on their IP address. According to the unanimous opinion of experts, this approach is, at least legally, unobjectionable.\n\nIndividual media outlets have criticised the GVU’s close proximity to lawyers, prosecutors, police and internet service providers, although naturally these kind of co-operations are part of the work of any interest group. The Association’s close cooperation with various other organizations is repeatedly criticized, especially during its annual Industry Forum.\n\nIn August 2010, the GVU was suspected of having caused the unjustified removal of several posts on the video platform Vimeo, which had been published under a Creative Commons license and are therefore available to all. Among other contents, \"You are a terrorist\" and \"Electric Reporter\" were affected. During the course of the investigation into the case it was revealed that the removal of the content was not initiated by the association, but by the company OpSec Security, based in Munich. The authors Alexander Lehmann and Mario Sixtus were able to obtain an injunction against the company and the GVU has since explicitly distanced itself from the company. According to the GVU, OpSec Security had at no point been contracted to clear videos from Vimeo in its name.\n\n"}

The performance took place in Los Angeles, California in 1977 as a response to the rapes and murders covered by the media in the \"Hillside Strangler\" case.\"As if the horror of these crimes wasn't enough, the press coverage of the events sensationalized the sexual nature of the crimes. For feminist activists in Los Angeles involved in the movement to end violence against women, this analysis was unacceptable.\"\n\nA continuation of \"Three Weeks in May,\" Lacy and Labowitz designed \"In Mourning and in Rage\" as a personal response to the sensationalized media coverage of violence against women as well as an expression of grief and rage towards the loss of life. The performance was a collaboration between Lacy, Labowitz, Bia Lowe, Holly Near, City Councilwoman Pat Russel, the Woman's Building, Women Against Violence Against Women, and Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The event was staged for mass media coverage at the Los Angeles City Hall.\n\nThe performance consisted of a large funeral motorcade of black-clad women lead by a hearse from the Woman's Building to the Los Angeles City Hall. Once there, nine seven-feet-tall women draped in black emerged from the hearse along with a women dressed in red. The mourners then climbed the steps of city hall where each of the nine women gave a statement into a microphone expressing their solidarity with the murdered women, emphasized by a chorus of \"In memory of our sisters, we fight back!\" from the rest of the motorcade. By making this performance public as well as highly crafted for media coverage, Lacy and Labowitz looked to highlight not only the deaths of the ten women killed by the Hillside Strangler, but the significantly larger population of women victims whose stories went uncovered by mainstream media.\n\nThe piece concluded with direct statements to the press explaining the rationale for the piece as well as a speech demanding resources for women's self defense. Singer-songwriter Holly Near performed her song \"Fight Back\" which was written specifically for this event.\n\n\"In Mourning and in Rage\" was highly covered by the press and resulted in increased support from Los Angeles City Council members and a pledge from the Rape Hotline Alliance to provide self defense classes.\n\nTo further the conversation about social action and art, Lacy and Labowitz produced a video documenting \"In Mourning and in Rage\" as well as a pamphlet entitled \"What is Social Art?.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "52935850", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52935850", "title": "Keshcarrigan Bowl", "text": "Keshcarrigan Bowl\n\nThe Keshcarrigan Bowl is an Iron age bronze bowl discovered to the north of Keshcarrigan, county Leitrim, Ireland, in the 19th century. The bowl was found in the waterway between Lough Scur and Lough Marrave (\"lake of death\"). It was perhaps a ceremonial drinking cup. The bowl would have been a prestigious item in 1st century Ireland, the bird-shaped handle outstandingly designed and skillfully executed. The Keshcarrigan Bowl is in the archaeology branch of the National Museum of Ireland.\n\nThe Keshcarrigan bowl is considered one of the finest classic cast bronze cups, or drinking vessel. Made of bright-yellow metal, it was discovered during the building of the \"Ulster Canal\". The bowl is a fine golden bronze only wide and in thickness, being cast or beaten into shape before being finished and polished by being spun on a lathe. The neck was finished off against an internal mould. The principal decorative feature of the bowl is its cast bronze zoomorphic handle, following the graceful shape of a bird-beast head of a somewhat nondescript appearance influenced by the flamboyant ornamentation of its time, soldered to the body of the vessel at the base and loosely connected to the vessel neck. The ridge at the front of the bird-head, the 'shield' below, and impression of a beak turning-backward, are all characteristic of the male-Shelduck.\n\nIn 2018 it was shown on an Irish postage stamp, after featuring in \"A History of Ireland in 100 Objects\".\n\nThe brilliantly modeled ducks-head handle on the Keshcarrigan bowl is an early masterpiece of the style, comparable to the best British work of the period such as the bird-finials on the Torrs Chamfrein horns, the stylistic identity of both heads representing ducks, and both having empty slots for studs in the eyes. The Torrs style originated in Britain in the middle or second half of the third century BC. The Keshcarrigan cup is on stylistic grounds likely to be contemporary with the Torrs pieces, with the “crimped” pattern on the rim of the Keshcarrigan bowl perhaps comparable with similar techniques used on the circular Wandsworth boss and the terminal circular insignias on the Witham Shield. The bowl seems to have close affinities to pottery bowls of identical profile from Brittany, which have a similar “crimped” pattern on their inner rims. Being lathe-spun the age of the bowl suggests a comparatively late date at variance with the stylistic evidence. The bowl is of importance in showing the Torrs style is recorded in both Britain and Ireland. The cup resembles another found at Fore, County Westmeath, which is slightly earlier and imported from Britain, as this may also be.\n\nThe bowl was intended for drinking purposes, for eating food out of, as a container, and ceremonial purposes. Metal handled cups are a feature of late La Tène culture, and their production might have been stimulated by the re-appearance of wine-services imported from the Classical world.\n\nSome sources suggest the bowl was imported across the Irish Sea because the practice of producing bronze bowls using a spinning technique was done in the Belgae workshops of south-east England, and Roman continental workshops, rather than Ireland. However the evidence for this conclusion is conjecture, and the Keshcarrigan bowl was just as likely made in Ireland. A reasonably close parallel to the Keshcarrigan cup is a handled vessel of willow, presumably Irish origin, in the National Museum of Ireland, and another bronze handle from a similar profile cup was discovered at County Galway. Conversely, though a similar handle was recently found in the Somerset hoard, no other vessel of this style was found in southern Britain, so the practice of making bowls with ornamental bird handles must have become established in Ireland sometime in the early 1st Century AD.\n\nO'Toole suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl represents evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheavals in Celtic Europe in the century before and after the birth of Christ. Gallic Belgic tribes crossed into Britain as refugees from the Romans and displacing native people some of whom came to Ireland.\n\n\n"}

It celebrated its 100th anniversary as former city mayor Jerry Abramson's official \"Family-Friendly New Years Eve\" celebration location. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\nThe facility has served the city of Louisville and Jefferson County in a variety of ways during the past century, from utilization as an actual armory to American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels basketball games, to various wrestling events, concerts, political rallies, and Hurricane Katrina flood relief have also been staged there. More recently, WWE used the 3,000-person capacity arena as a training ground for future stars in a minor-league promotion known as Ohio Valley Wrestling, until the organization moved to the Davis Arena. WWE also staged two pay-per-view events while the venue was known as Louisville Gardens: (In Your House 6 and ). TNA Wrestling held an event at the venue in 2007.

The Kentucky Wildcats when led by Adolph Rupp played 72 games at the armory going 61-11 there from 1937 to 1956 \nIncluded in that was games played in the SEC Men's Basketball Tournament which was held at the armory from 1941 to 1952. Additionally, the Ohio Valley Conference men's basketball tournament was held there from 1949 to 1955 and again from 1964 to 1967.\n\nThe Kentucky Colonels, of the American Basketball Association, played their home games at the facility, then known as the Louisville Convention Center, from 1967 through 1970. Louie Dampier was the team's best player in the era. On November 24, 1968, Penny Ann Earley became the first female to appear in a men's professional league, playing briefly in a home game for the Colonels.\n\nThe Louisville Catbirds, of the Continental Basketball Association (1983–1985), the Louisville Shooters, of the Global Basketball Association (1991–1992) and the Kentucky Colonels, of the ABA 2000 (2004–2006), all played their home basketball games at the Louisville Gardens. The University of Louisville women's basketball team used the Gardens for six home games in the 1997–98 season. Ice hockey teams to use the Gardens as home ice include the Louisville Blades, Louisville Shooting Stars and the Louisville Rebels.\n\nThe building was also known as the Convention Center or Louisville Convention Center, mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. It was renamed Louisville Gardens in 1975 when the Commonwealth Convention Center (now called Kentucky International Convention Center) was being built.\n\nIn 2007, the Cordish Company, manager of the nearby Fourth Street Live! entertainment complex, agreed to take over operation of \"The Gardens\" from the Metro Louisville Government as part of a $250 million development in downtown Louisville.

{"id": "2385075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2385075", "title": "National Symphony Orchestra", "text": "National Symphony Orchestra\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), founded in 1931, is an American symphony orchestra based in Washington, D.C.. Its principal performing venue is the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. \n\nFor the first period of its history, the NSO performed in Constitution Hall. During the tenure of the first music director, Hans Kindler, the musicians received a salary of $40.00 per week, for three rehearsals and one concert, for five months of the year. The first female member of the NSO was a harpist, Sylvia Meyer, who joined in 1933.\n\nKindler and the NSO made several 78-rpm recordings for RCA Victor, including the two Roumanian Rhapsodies by George Enescu; much later, in 1960, the NSO would perform the first of these works under the baton of the visiting Romanian conductor George Georgescu, a close associate and favored exponent of the composer. One of the more unusual RCA recordings with the orchestra was of the complete ballet music from the opera \"King Henry VIII\" by Camille Saint-Saëns, one of the very few recordings conducted by Walter Damrosch. Years later, Howard Mitchell made a series of stereophonic recordings with the orchestra for RCA. Antal Doráti recorded with the orchestra for Decca Records. Mstislav Rostropovich made recordings for Teldec, Sony Records, and Erato. The orchestra returned to RCA Victor under Leonard Slatkin, until RCA abandoned new classical recordings.\n\nIn 1986, the NSO became the artistic affiliate of the Kennedy Center, where it has presented a concert season annually since the Center opened in 1971.\n\nThe NSO regularly participates in events of national and international importance, including performances for ceremonial state affairs, presidential inaugurations and official holiday celebrations, including concerts for Memorial Day and the regular \"A Capitol Fourth\" concerts on 4 July.\n\nThe NSO itself numbers 100 musicians, presenting a 52-week season of approximately 175 concerts each year. These include classical subscription series, pops concerts, and educational programs. In addition to these activities, small groups of NSO members develop education programs designed at age levels from pre-kindergarten through high school. Collectively, these ensembles present as many as 100 additional performances a year during the American Residencies and at the Kennedy Center.\n\nThrough the John and June Hechinger Commissioning Fund for New Orchestral Works, the NSO has commissioned more than 50 works, including cycles of fanfares and encores. During his tenure, Slatkin founded the National Conducting Institute in 2000. \n\nAlso of note is the National Symphony Orchestra Summer Music Institute. For more than a decade, scholarships provided by the National Trustees of the National Symphony Orchestra have enabled top-level students from across the country and from many nations to come to the nation’s capital for several weeks of study with NSO musicians. These participants, selected from a competitive pool of applicants, come from a variety of backgrounds, some currently enrolled in music conservatories such as Juilliard and others still completing high school.\nAnother important project is the National Symphony Orchestra American Residencies for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This venture encompasses sharing all elements of classical symphonic music with a specific region of the United States, exploring the diversity of musical influences, and giving the region a musical voice in the nation’s center for the performing arts through exchanges, training programs, and commissions. Established in 1992, the project has taken the NSO to fifteen states.\n\nIn November 2004, the orchestra announced the conclusion of Slatkin's NSO directorship in 2008. One report spoke of tensions between the conductor and the orchestra, and mentioned criticisms of Slatkin's programming and rehearsal styles. With the 2006–2007 season, Iván Fischer became the principal guest conductor of the orchestra. On 13 April 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of Fischer as the orchestra's principal conductor as of the 2008–2009 season, for two seasons. \n\nOn September 25, 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of Christoph Eschenbach as the orchestra's sixth music director, effective with the 2010–2011 season, for an initial contract of four years. In September 2011, the orchestra extended Eschenbach's contract through the 2014–2015 season, and in March 2014, his contract was extended through the 2016–2017 season. In February 2015, the NSO announced the scheduled conclusion of Eschenbach's tenure as NSO music director at the end of the 2016-2017 season, at which time he is scheduled to become the NSO's conductor laureate.\n\nIn 2011, Gianandrea Noseda first guest-conducted the NSO, and returned in November 2015 for an additional guest engagement. In January 2016, the NSO announced the appointment Noseda as its next music director, effective with the 2017–2018 season. He is to serve as music director-designate in the 2016-2017 season, and his initial contract as music director is for 4 seasons. In September 2018, the NSO announced the extension of Noseda's contract through the 2024-2025 season.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56189045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56189045", "title": "Native American fashion", "text": "Native American fashion\n\nNative American fashion (also known as Indigenous American fashion) encompasses the design and creation of high-fashion clothing and fashion accessories by the Native peoples of the Americas. Indigenous designers frequently incorporate motifs and customary materials into their wearable artworks, providing a basis for creating items for the \"haute couture\" and international fashion markets. Their designs may result from techniques such as beadwork, quillwork, leather, and textile arts, such as weaving, twining, and tufting. In some cases, however, they choose not to include any materials associated with indigenous cultures.\n\nIn the United States, in accordance with the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, in order to qualify as Native American designers, artists must be enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe or be certified by a specified tribal council. In Canada, there are no specific laws to protect First Nations iconography and traditional arts, though two trademarks, \"igloo tag\" and \"Genuine Cowichan Approved\" have been registered to protect Inuit peoples and clothing designs for the Cowichan Tribes. In Latin America legislation is sparse, but some countries or individual states within countries with high indigenous populations have passed laws to protect indigenous heritage and design.\n\nWhen Native American designers first broke into the modern fashion industry in the 1950s, they adopted a pan-Indian approach. By selecting motifs and iconography easily identified as part of indigenous culture, they were able to gain acceptance and develop a market share with mainstream buyers. As the field of Native designers in high fashion expanded, individual designers moved away from pan-Indianism, expressing their individual identity, whether or not it was based on their traditional tribal heritage. Many have taken traditional themes and incorporated them into their works, while others have taken specific garments and updated them to contemporary aesthetics by changing necklines, sleeve lengths, hemlines and other features.\n\nControversy has emerged over the misappropriation or inappropriate use of cultural heritage by non-Native designers. Respectful use of imagery by mainstream designers who are not indigenous can help expand appreciation of Native cultures, but plagiarism of design or malapropos use reinforces negative stereotypes and spurs controversy. Similarly, utilizing artisan craftwork can expand awareness if designers are fairly compensated for their work and given credit for their contributions. Contemporary controversies have spurred both crowd-sourced and legislative action to protect the designs and cultural heritage of indigenous designers.\n\nHistorical clothing of Native American peoples has been collected and displayed by curators of major museums, such as the National Museum of the American Indian, with a focus on pre-20th century attire. For the most part, these collections failed to take into consideration the shift in clothing trends among indigenous peoples brought about by assimilation policies or by access to tailoring training and industrially produced textiles.\n\nWhile Native peoples have always produced clothing, until the twentieth century the garments they made were for personal or ceremonial use. In 1942, the American anthropologist Frederic H. Douglas, sought to highlight the beauty of Native American fashion by presenting a fashion show featuring garments made by Native Americans between 1830 and 1950. During the same decade, Lloyd Kiva New, a Cherokee who had graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago began touring throughout Europe and the United States with clothing and accessory lines he had designed, using hand-woven and dyed fabrics and leather crafts. In 1945, New opened a studio in Scottsdale, Arizona, with financial backing from Douglas, which initially focused on belts, hats and purses. Influenced by Navajo medicine bags, his purses, decorated with hand-worked metals became a specialty. Recognizing the need to reduce labor costs, he began combining machine work with handcrafting and instituted an apprenticeship program to meet increasing production demands while gearing his designs for the up-scale market.\n\nGaining coverage from national magazines like \"Harper's Bazaar\" and \"The New Yorker\", New began selling his bags at the Elizabeth Arden Salon and Neiman Marcus. Expanding into clothing with a focus on classic cuts and simple designs using quality materials, New incorporated woven Cherokee fabrics, bead- and silver-work into a line of coats and dresses for women and men's suits, capitalizing on the luxury clothing market which emerged after World War II. \"Southwestern chic\" became a national trend in the early 1950s. In 1951, New was the only Native American designer who participated in the Atlantic City International Fashion Show, winning national recognition. He began to consult with artists and incorporated silk screened fabrics using native motifs, such as Pima basket weaving designs, Hopi pottery patterns, Navajo and Zuni yei elements, drawing from a variety of tribal aesthetics. As with designers who followed him, his sacred symbols and iconography were modified to become secularized.\n\nTo encourage other indigenous artists to enter fashion design and safeguard cultural traditions which he feared might be lost, in 1959 New turned his attention to education, sponsoring a summer design project, known as the Southwest Indian Arts Project. The experimental project eventually resulted in the founding by New and other artists of the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) in 1962. The purpose of the school was to provide an education which fostered pride in students' indigenous heritage and featured the development of skills designed to improve their economic opportunities. New taught a printed textiles course focused on dying techniques, and Azalea Thorpe (Cherokee) taught weaving. Josephine Myers-Wapp (Comanche) was hired to instruct students in the traditional techniques used to make garments and accessories, laying the groundwork for the aesthetic appreciation of tribal traditions. She taught students to use traditional materials like feathers, leather and shells, and methods including beadwork, ribbonwork and weaving to create garments. By 1965, IAIA was hosting local fashion shows and within three years, the students had begun showing their works in other venues in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and New York. Within ten years, the reputation of the textile design programs at the school had gained international acclaim.\nIn Mexico, before 1950 many indigenous communities were isolated and produced their own traditional clothing. As roads improved and people began moving from the countryside to cities, many put aside their traditional clothing, to blend in with their new cosmopolitan neighbors. In 1965, Gilberto Ortiz (Mixtec) moved from San Andrés Lagunas, Oaxaca, to Mexico City and began training as a tailor under German businessman, José Schroeder. Acquiring traditional European styling, his first major client was movie icon, María Félix. In 1978, Ortiz left Schroeder and partnered with the Italian businessman, Edmundo Calanchini. He designed mainly for businessmen and politicians until 1997, when he opened his own shop aimed specifically at the haute couture market. In 2006, at the suggestion of his client Juan Gabriel, Ortiz launched his own label, \"Gioros\", an acronym using the first two letters of each of his names, Gilberto Ortiz Osorio. In 2012, he was named one of the top three tailors in the world by the textile firm Scabal. Typically Ortiz produces classically-styled garments using high-end fabrics, but his latest offering in 2017 featured men's and women's jeans.\n\nIn the 1960s, Frankie Welch (self-identified Eastern Cherokee descent) began working as a fashion consultant to Washington's elite. After purchasing goods others made for her clients, she decided to capitalize on the rapport she had built and opened a store in 1963 at 305 Cameron St. in Old Town. Most noted for scarves, such as her Cherokee syllabary design, she supplied First Ladies Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter, and Nancy Reagan with accessories. Welch also created dresses for the First Ladies, including a 1974 brocade gown for Betty Ford which was part of the 2016 \"Native Fashion Now\" tour. The green silk gown, which she also designed for Ford, is on display at the Smithsonian's First Ladies' Hall in the National Museum of American History.\n\nDuring the 1970s, other Native American designers began to make a name for themselves during the Indian and Natural movements, such as Jewel Gilham (Blackfeet) and Remonia Jacobsen (Otoe-Iowa). Gilham catered to working women, designing pantsuits and long dresses made of polyester fabrics with felt insets depicting geometric figures and native motifs. Jacobsen's work featured loose-fitting dresses featuring decorative techniques, such as embroidered ribbonwork in the Otoe and Iowa style, appliqué drawing on Seminole traditions, buckskin leggings patterned on Kiowa designs, as well as influences from Pueblo and Sioux decorative silhouettes. Fueled by the American Indian and Civil Rights Movement, countercultural consumers found appeal in Gilham and Jacobsen's work. Furthermore, their fashion fostered a pan-Indian unity in the quest for political power through self-expression.\n\nWhen Josephine Wapp retired in 1975, Sandy Fife Wilson (Muscogee) took over instruction of her traditional techniques course and offered \"Traditional and Contemporary Fashion Design\" to include current fashion trends. Fife's students formed the Full Moon Fashions group and began targeting non-native women as prospective buyers for their products. In 1982, when Wendy Ponca (Osage) took over the fashion design courses at the IAIA, she renamed them fiber arts in accordance with other accredited university curricula, offering three levels of instruction. She founded the Waves of the Earth Fashion Group and required her students to participate in the fashion shows of the IAIA, giving them an opportunity to show their creations and discover how to market their works. Ponca changed the direction of Native American fashion by allowing the designers to determine whether their works would include traditional influences and media. She taught them garment design, structural integrity, and color theory, but allowed students to interpret how they used the lessons. Ponca's approach was to ignore demands to make designs fit stereotypical definitions of indigenous identity. Instead she encouraged creativity and innovation, like utilizing mylar, a space-age material to create designs which reflected the Osage connection with the sky.\n\nThe fashion show of the Santa Fe Indian Market, hosted for nearly two decades by fashion expert, Jeri Ah-be-hill (Kiowa), quickly became another venue to showcase the students' work, using the body as a venue to display designs, rather than galleries. \"Native Uprising\", initially called \"Native Influx\" was founded in the 1980s as a collaborative association of indigenous artists, designers, and models, who were alumni of IAIA, with the express purpose of building a contemporary, Native fashion design movement and allowing members to profit from their fashion shows. With New as an advisor and Ponca as the coordinator, the group included many members who made a name for themselves in fashion, for example Marcus Amerman (Choctaw), who acted as the stage director and RoseMary Diaz (Santa Clara Pueblo), who majored in fashion design and creative writing, before turning to writing about fashion.\n\nIn 1981, Margaret Wood (Navajo/Seminole) of Arizona, known for fashion design as well as for her quilts, published \"Native American Fashion: Modern Adaptations of Traditional Designs\". The book was the first treatment of contemporary Native American fashion and remains the sole in-depth treatment of the subject. Also in the 1980s, indigenous designers like Luanne Belcourt (Chippewa-Cree) and Myrtle Raining Bird (Chippewa-Cree) operated their company \"Sitting Eagles\", marketing custom-made garments on their reservation to high-end buyers. Jeanette Ferrara (Isleta Pueblo) opened a design studio known for coats and vests incorporating cotton, wool, and velvet, and Ardina Moore (Quapaw-Osage) founded \"Buffalo Sun\" in Oklahoma in 1983. Geraldine Sherman (Lakota) designed for non-native marketer and anthropologist Helene Hagan to produce garments featuring Native American iconography. Hagan marketed them, stressing their spiritual and symbolic meaning.\nHealthcare professional and fashion designer, Marjorie Bear Don't Walk (Chippewa-Salish) designed high-end couture for working women and displayed her fashions featuring appliqué techniques at conferences. Shed ran a mail order business, allowing customers to provide her with their preferred materials which she then worked into her designs. In 1984, Selina Curley (Apache-Navajo) founded a design firm, Traditions by Selina, aimed at preserving the traditions of her heritage. Her typical designs are based on the Apache camp dress with a full, ankle-length skirt and long sleeves.\n\nThe Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, hosted \"Talking Threads: Contemporary Native American Fashions\" in 1986. The exhibit featured designs by Joyce Begay-Foss (Navajo), Loretta Tah-Martin (Apache-Ponca) and Michelle Tsosie Naranjo (Santa Clara-Navajo-Laguna Pueblo-Mission), among others. The following year, the Red Earth Festival was established in Oklahoma City, showcasing creations by non-native designer Michael Kors, along with Phyllis Fife (Muscogee), to demonstrate that Native clothing was part of mainstream fashion. Fife was part of a group of native designers known as the \"Fashion Drums of Red Earth\", who have made the fashion show of the Red Earth Festival an annual event, demonstrating that native clothing is wearable for every day and not simply as ceremonial costuming. Also in 1987, Patta Joest (Choctaw) established her firm Patta LT with the label \"Dancing Rabbit\", to create high-fashion, producing contemporary garments with design elements from Southeastern Woodland tribal heritage. They included Cherokee tear dresses and Seminole patchwork vests, incorporating features such as Plains Tribes-style beadwork. Her line also included innovative bras and lingerie as well as broomstick skirts.\n\nThe Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 was passed by the United States Congress. It specified that for artists to market their works as Native American, they must be enrolled in a state or federally recognized tribe or be certified by a tribal council as a member and must disclose their affiliated tribe. The law aimed to curtail the misappropriation of Native American designs by non-Natives wishing to capitalize on the indigenous market. For indigenous Americans, their symbols, such as the headdress have ceremonial and sacred properties. Inappropriate use of such objects, like the 2014 \"Next Top Model\" use of the headdress for non-Native models and its use in Dallas by Chanel for their \"Métiers d'Art\" show, were all too frequent occurrences. Though the law made it illegal to sell items by those not affiliated as a tribe member, little could be done when designs, symbols, or names were usurped. The law, written to protect the tribes and their cultures as a whole, does not cover individuals, with the result that there is no protection for the works of fashion designers. As part of their tribal tradition, symbols of various tribes are not typically trademarked, but one exception is the name \"Navajo\", which was legally trademarked in 1943.\n\nSoon after the change to US law, public debate in Canada over protection of intellectual property rights became a media topic. There are no Canadian laws which specifically protect against cultural appropriation. The government utilizes international agreements to uphold their fiduciary responsibility to First Nations. As in the US, laws cover communities as a whole and not individual copyright and it is difficult for indigenous peoples to prevent misappropriation of their names and symbols. Most protections that exist are to protect economic rather than heritage rights. In two cases, trademarks have been obtained to protect Native artists. Since 1959, the \"igloo tag\" may be used only by Inuit people to protect their works. The Cowichan Band Council has registered \"Genuine Cowichan Approved\" as a mark specifically for clothing designs.\n\nThe 1990s saw a split in the Native American fashion design styles, with one group pursuing simple silhouettes with defined, smooth transitions between fabric lines, while the other group focused on avant-garde indigenous couture. Among those who favored classic, clean-lines were Betty David (Spokane), known for her shearling coats; Dorothy Grant (Haida), who trained at Vancouver's Helen Lefeaux School of Fashion Design and whose work includes images of flora and fauna of the Pacific Northwest, formline art and basketry designs; and Penny Singer (Navajo), who added photographic images on fabric to her traditional men's and women's shirts and accessories decorated with beads and ribbon work. Virgil Ortiz (Cochiti Pueblo) and Grant were the first Native American fashion designers to exhibit at an event in Manhattan. They held a show together at the Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week in 2009, though Ortiz's work generally is known as more cutting-edge and noted for incorporating colors, shapes, and symbols from pottery in his fashion design. Angela DeMontigny (Chippewa-Cree-Métis) of southwestern Ontario, a Canadian First Nation designer, also followed the classic traditional lines, with edgy elements based initially on leather and suede garments before branching into jewelry and accessories.\n\nIn 1991, D’Arcy J. Moses (Pehdzeh Ki), whose bold colors and designs featuring beaver and other furs were carried in high-end retail stores like Holt Renfrew, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue, signed a contract with the Fur Council of Canada to help them improve their image, drawing anger from anti-fur activists. While the contract provided a steady income, the controversy created a distraction from his work. Other indigenous designers from the era included the master weaver Margaret Roach Wheeler (Choctaw-Chickasaw), who earned a master's degree in art at Pittsburg State University in Kansas, under the tutelage of Marjorie Schick; Sean McCormick (Métis), who began designing footwear in the early 1990s and in 2008, launched \"Manitobah Mukluks\"; and Virginia Yazzie Ballenger (Navajo), New Mexican designer, most noted for her \"fluted broomstick skirt and matching velveteen blouse\". Aresta LaRusso founded \"Deerwater Design\" in Flagstaff in 1994 featuring items made of traditional silk or wool fabrics and deer or elk skin. To update her contemporary patterning, she used zebra and impala hide, decorated with beadwork, fringe and silver.\n\nWendy Ponca, one of the leaders of the avant-garde group, left IAIA in 1993. After she was replaced by Pearl Sunrise (Navajo), a noted weaver, the fashion curricula at IAIA was eliminated in 1995, though momentum for high fashion works produced by native designers was rising. Among Ponca's students at IAIA in the 1990s were the designers Pilar Agoyo (Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo-Cochiti Pueblo-Kewa Pueblo), who worked on costuming for several films, including \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" (2008) and The Avengers (2012), and Patricia Michaels (Taos Pueblo), who went on to take second place in season 11 of \"Project Runway\". Her women's jacket titled \"Weathered Text: No Trespassing by the Taos War Chief.\" won the Best of Class award in the textiles category at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2010. Another of Ponca's students, Brenda Wahnee (Comanche), developed her own line \"Com-N-Acha\", featuring fashion forward designs. Her works were featured in 2003 at the Grammy Fest party. Tazbah Gaussoin \n(Picuris Pueblo-Navajo), Consuelo Pascual (Navajo-Maya), and Rose Bean Simpson (Santa Clara Pueblo) were other Ponca students who began making a name in fashion circles in the 1990s.\n\nSince 1995, the Canadian Aboriginal Festival (CANAB) has hosted a fashion show of First Nations designers. Dave Jones (Garden River Ojibwe), began producing an annual fashion show for the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards (CAMA) in 2001. By 2008, the CANAB Festival featured six fashion shows, as well as booths for designers to exhibit their wares. In 1998, the Denver Art Museum hosted a fashion show, \"Indian Chic\" featuring the works of Dorothy Grant, Wendy Ponca and Margaret Roach Wheeler. It was the first time a major museum had shown works in their collection of indigenous garments, labeling them as \"fashion\". Other Native designers of the 2000s include Orlando Dugi (Navajo), Dallin Maybee (Northern Arapaho-Seneca), Connie Gaussoin (Navajo-Picuris Pueblo), the street style of Douglas Miles of Apache Skateboards (San Carlos Apache-Akimel O'odham) and the custom shoes of Louie Gong (Nooksack-Squamish). Dugi is self-taught in fashion, learning to sew, measure and create patterns from online resources. Jamie Okuma (Luiseño-Shoshone-Bannock), another self-taught artist, became the youngest person to earn the Best of Show ribbon at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2000.\n\nFrom the turn of the 21st century, there has been a resurgence in Latin America for indigenous designs. The trend has been to partner with indigenous communities of artisans to create fabrics for non-native designers. In many countries, the indigenous heritage is seen as part of the national identity and there was little recognition that the design elements non-Native designers used and modified were part of the intellectual property of indigenous communities. Designers often used remnants of textiles or cut out embroidery on one garment to use on another. Imitations of indigenous designs were ordered from labor markets in Asia. After 2010, the trend began to change with slow recognition that original indigenous designs and designers should be respected. One innovator in this period was Franklin Janeta (Puruhá), of Riobamba, Ecuador, who began working as an embroidery artisan as a child, and in 2000 opened Vispu, a store to market his designs. Modifying traditional clothing styles, he altered components like necklines and sleeve length to create more contemporary fashions. Around the same time, Eliana Paco Paredes (Aymara) of Bolivia began to design fashions based on the traditional costumes of the \"cholitas\", using wool or aguayo fabrics, but fusing them with lace or silk and decorating them with rhinestones and sequins. In 2016, after showing her work at Bolivian Fashion Week, she was invited to participate in New York Fashion Week.\n\nIn 2005, the IAIA with support from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, sponsored \"Tribal Fusions\", as a cross-cultural fashion endeavor, uniting designers from Africa with Marcus Amerman, Dorothy Grant, Patricia Michaels and Virginia Yazzie Ballenger for the annual fashion show at the Santa Fe Indian Market. It was a unique opportunity for designers from diverse indigenous populations to share designs and methods of economic empowerment. In 2009, Jessica Metcalfe (Chippewa), a scholar who earned her doctorate from the University of Arizona, created a fashion blog called \"Beyond Buckskin\". Metcalfe used the blog to promote Native American designers, to talk about how they fit into popular culture and also to hold companies accountable when they attempted to appropriate Native culture. The following year, Patricia Michaels formed \"UNRESERVED Alliance\", in an attempt to ensure that Native American fashion designers were represented at New York Fashion Week. Similarly to Native Uprising founded two decades previously, the collective of designers aimed through collaboration to improve inclusion of indigenous artists.\n\nAs Native American designers recognized that marketing to indigenous peoples alone limited their business sustainability, they increasingly created clothing which is derived from their cultural heritage but has been adapted to appeal to a larger aesthetic. Early designers tended to approach fashion from a pan-Indian perspective, but contemporary indigenous designers often \"stay within the realm of their own traditional tribal or regional clothing techniques\". In 2012, Kelly Holmes (Cheyenne River Lakota), a former model, founded \"Native Max\", \"the first Native American fashion magazine\". Jessica Metcalf (Turtle Mountain Chippewa), who wrote the \"Beyond Buckskin\" blog opened a fashion boutique in Gardena, North Dakota, that same year. Metcalfe, along with photographer Anthony Thosh Collins and designer Bethany Yellowtail (Northern Cheyenne-Crow) created a compilation of fashion called \"Beyond Buckskin Lookbook\" which she says is the \"first compilation of modern Native fashion produced exclusively by Natives\".\n\nIn Ecuador, Lucía Guillín (Puruhá) launched \"Churandy\" featuring the dress styles of indigenous Andes communities with contemporary modifications in 2012. Her clothing lines have expanded to include blouses, jackets and shorts featuring embroidery patterns and colors typical to the region. The same year, Sisa Morocho (Puruhá) also launched her design company \"Sumak Churay\" in Quito, after studying fashion at the Ana MacAulife Institute. Her father's death had prompted her to leave the family hat business and branch out on her own. Using motifs from the Puruhá culture and adorning them with beads, embroidery and sequins on brightly colored fabrics, she first sold blouses and then became known for dresses. In 2015, Morocho was able to open a second store featuring her designs in Riobamba. In 2013, Victoria Kakuktinniq (Inuit) founded \"Victoria's Arctic Fashion\" to market her designs. She creates fur and leather winterwear goods including headbands, jackets, gloves and parkas, using sealskin and decorated with fox cuffs and embroidery. In 2015 Kakuktinniq won the Business of the Year award from the Nunavut annual trade show.\n\nThe Italian designing firm, Ermenegildo Zegna, opened a fashion institute in 2016, in the Azcapotzalco neighborhood of Mexico City with the goal of teaching the techniques of design to indigenous women. Students enrolled were members of the Mazahua, Nahua, Otomí, Purépecha, Triqui and Tzeltal ethnic groups. The training the women received focused on tailoring techniques rather than on native design elements in an effort to allow the women to move from craftwork into the high fashion market. That same year, Nala Peter (Inuit) began making sealskin bras and panties at the suggestion of her partner, marketing them on line and was invited to participate in the \"Floe Edge: Contemporary Art and Collaborations\" exhibition in Nunavut. Another exhibitor at the show was Nicole Camphaug (Inuit), who designs footwear with sealskin and fur heals and vamps.\nIn 2016, a major traveling exhibit, \"Native Fashion Now,\" which traveled to venues from the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, to Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the Portland Art Museum in Oregon to the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan, put the spotlight on contemporary Native American fashion. Featuring designs from 75 fashion designers from throughout Canada and the United States, the exhibit presented a range of styles and designs from diverse cultures, such as Alano Edzerza (Tahltan Nation), Maya Stewart (Chickasaw-Muscogee-Choctaw) and Bethany Yellowtail (Northern Cheyenne-Crow), among others. Becki Bitternose (George Gordon), who designs jackets and coats from Pendleton blankets, was featured at the 2016 New York Fashion Week. \n\nVancouver hosted its first Indigenous Fashion Week in 2017 with designs from numerous First Nations designers, including Sho Sho Esquiro (Kaska Dena-Cree), known for elaborately decorated gowns, enhanced with fur, beaver tail, salmon skin, feathers and shells combined with gold trim; Evan Ducharme (Métis), whose work focuses on sustainable and Eco-friendly design and incorporates Métis elements like knotted belts based on fishing net techniques; Jeneen Frei Njootli (Vuntut Gwitchin), who presented a collection using innovative design incorporating fur and hides; Autum Jules (Tlingit), noted for her use of textures and color to reflect the connection between people and the earth; Tyler-Alan Jacobs, (Squamish) whose designs reflect his identity as a two-spirit artist; and Alano Edzerza (Tahltan), known as a multi-media artist whose work incorporates silk-screened images of Native iconography on his garments. Jill Setah (Yunesit'in) participated in the Vancouver event, after having showcased her works at both Oxford Fashion Week and Paris Fashion Week. Tishynah Buffalo (George Gordon), who lives in Alberta, Canada, was invited to participate in London Fashion Week in 2017, to showcase her innovative designs which often use Pendleton blankets and are decorated with beadwork and Cree floral patterns. Helen Oro, (Pelican Lake), who designs fashion accessories, also participated in the event. Oro who has found ceremonial beading constricting, adds beadwork to glasses, head bands, heels and creates jewelry pieces.\n\nTammy Beauvais - designed the cape given to Michelle Obama by Sophie Grégoire-Trudeau.\n\nTishynah Buffalo - incorporates Cree designs\n\nEliana Paco Paredes - Aymara fashion designer\n\nNon-Native companies and individuals have attempted to use Native American motifs and names in their clothing designs. As early as the 1940s, Anglo designers in the United States had developed a type of one and two-piece dresses called \"squaw dresses.\" These outfits were based on Mexican and Navajo skirts and Western Apache camp dresses. The dresses, also known as Fiesta, Kachina, Tohono or Patio Dresses \"represented both idealized femininity and Americanness because of their Native American origins.\" These dresses, knowingly appropriating Indigenous styles, were considered a \"fashion sensation\" of the time, according to the \"Arizona Daily Star\". The Navajo style that influenced the creation of Squaw Dresses was itself an adaptation of European styles by Navajo women. The bodice of a Squaw Dress drew from Western Apache and Tohono O'odham styles. Squaw dresses were popular in the United States for around 20 years. The original \"designer\" of the Squaw Dress was Dolores Gonzales of Tucson, Arizona. Gonzales herself said of her dresses, \"I didn't design them; I lifted them. The Indian women were already wearing them.\" Other people involved in promoting and working on the designs included the designers Cele Peterson and George Fine.\n\nUrban Outfitters created a collection in 2011 called \"Navajo,\" featuring underwear, hats and other items with art based on traditional Navajo rugs. The Navajo Nation responded by issuing a cease and desist on their use of the word \"Navajo\". Pop band No Doubt released a 2012 video featuring stereotypical images of the American frontier and ended up pulling the video and issuing an apology. Victoria's Secret clothed a model in a \"Native-inspired\" bikini and giant war headdress at their fashion show that same year. Victoria's Secret was again accused of cultural appropriation in their 2017 fashion show, which featured outfits inspired by traditional Native fashion.\n\nIn 2015, the Congress of Oaxaca passed legislation to \"award Cultural and Intangible Heritage status to the designs, costumes, and handicrafts, as well as the languages spoken by the Indigenous peoples in the state\", after a French firm \"Antiquite Vatic\" attempted to claim a copyright on the designs of artisans from the Mixe community of Santa María Tlahuitoltepec. The following year, indigenous designers from Panama, who were part of the Ipeti Guna community, backed by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Trade sought legal action against textile companies who were misappropriating their molas, which have governmental protection for the Guna designers as the only \"genuine producers\" of the cloth. Another action in 2016, found designers in Oaxaca, Mexico, circulating a petition via Change.org to demand that fashion designers stop plagiarizing their work. The designs from Zapotec designers from San Antonino Castillo Velasco were misappropriated by the Argentine fashion house \"Rapsodia\".\n\nIn 2017, Parisian designer Christian Louboutin drew criticism for paying Yucatec Maya artisans only 238 pesos (around $13 US) each for bags he sold for around $28,000 pesos (equivalent to $1,550 US). The controversy was sparked when activists called out Louboutin for exploiting the artisans. He paid for all of their materials and paid the workers 478 pesos per day for 6 hours of work, which compares to the average Mexican salary in the region of 80 pesos for 8 hours of work per day. The artisans were thankful for the work and the monies they received, but Louboutin's firm pulled the page advertising the bags from his website. That same year, the Peruvian textile company Kuna withdrew a collection after complaints that the company had misappropriated \"kené\" designs from the Shipibo-Conibo people. The controversy motivated Congresswoman Tania Pariona to introduce legislation to protect the cultural heritage and symbols of indigenous communities in Peru.\n\nAnother issue in regard to Native American fashion is the stereotypical representation of Indigenous peoples' clothing in mass media depictions. Native Americans are portrayed most often in historical contexts wearing traditional clothing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50723719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50723719", "title": "Nazario Collection", "text": "Nazario Collection\n\nThe Nazario Collection (), also known as Agüeybaná's Library (), Father Nazario's Rocks (), and the Phoenician Rocks (), is the name commonly used to describe a cache of carved stones that originated at Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. According to contemporary accounts, the statuettes made of local serpentine rocks were first discovered by Catholic priest José María Nazario y Cancel during the 19th century, and feature unidentified petroglyphs that have been speculated to be connected to the Old World for over 130 years. Their original site was not far from Yauco and was underground, where it was hidden under a slate that concealed a tunnel. Overwhelmed with the quantity and difficulty of transporting a trove that totaled more than a ton, he opted to abandon his individual approach and recruited locals to aid in the moving of the rocks to his house, where he conducted the first research on them by comparing them to similar objects from other countries. Nazario would combine his research with his religious background, leading to the hypothesis that there might be some connection between them and the Ten Lost Tribes.\n\nDue to the ramifications that their authentication would have on mainstream concepts of Pan-American history, the authenticity of the pieces has been in question from the onset, with researchers providing conflicting opinions. Despite this, several foreign archeologists traveled to Puerto Rico in order to study the pieces. Among those that inquired on the matter was ethnographer Alphonse Pinart, who examined the pieces and concluded that they were \"undoubtedly authentic\". The explorer also expressed concern that some people could try to falsify pieces to receive gifts in exchange from them. Locally, historians took an interest in the matter while archeologists did not study them for decades. After the death of Nazario, most pieces were kept at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture (ICP), with others being kept by the UPR and foreign institutions in New York, Spain and Paris. During the 1980s, the Collection attracted historian Salvador Tío, who tried to recruit a variety of institutions to the cause of studying the pieces.\n\nDuring the 2010s, the study of the pieces has been taken by personnel of the archeology department of the University of Puerto Rico at Utuado. Head archeologist Reniel Rodríguez decided to follow the scientific method to test several characteristics of the rocks and petroglyphs. Among these are geological studies, which concluded that the petroglyphs were carved in Puerto Rico and that the rocks were likely not brought from abroad based on the raw materials used, serpentine rocks found near location of the discovery. Another aspect of Rodríguez's research is based on using high power microscopes to determine the technique and instruments used to make the carvings, thus allowing for the detection of fraud if the tools are found not to have been available during the time. Preliminary results from this area suggest that the technique used was unlike any of the ones used by the known native groups of Puerto Rico.\nA new epigraphic study is also being conducted to determine the precedence of the petroglyphs or their closest parallels. Preliminary results in this area have found similarities between the petroglyphs and the Libyco-Berber alphabet as recorded in the Canary Islands and the Tartessian language of the Iberian Peninsula. During this research, Rodríguez has recruited experts from Universidad del Turabo and University of Miami. Additional studies planned include C-14 dating and thermoluminescence tests for burned pieces.\n\nThe discovery of the rocks is attributed to Catholic priest José María Nazario y Cancel, a native of the municipality of Sabana Grande that had settled in Guayanilla and had received education at the University of Salamanca that included, among other things, the study of ancient languages. The popular story of the event was told by the priest to historian Adolfo de Hostos. According to this narrative, sometime during the late 1870s the minister was summoned to the deathbed of a local woman of Taíno ascent. There she, who was aware of Nazario's interest in archeology and native history, decided to reveal the location of a long-hidden collection of artifacts. This knowledge had been covertly passed from generation to generation throughout the centuries, but she decided to reveal it in hopes that the priest would recognize its historical importance and safeguard it from that point on. With time, the old woman was given the name of \"Juana Morales\" and was claimed to be \"the last descendant\" of Agüeybaná II or Agüeybaná El Bravo, the last ruler of the Puerto Rico natives and military leader during the Spanish–Taíno War of San Juan–Borikén (from whom the rocks get one of their colloquial namesakes), elements that were not found in the original version. There is no record of an elder person by that name dying during the time in the municipality’s records, but there is a local Morales family that lives at Barrio Indio and has its own oral tradition of the events dating back to at least the 1970s.\n\nNazario then traveled between municipalities until he arrived at a riverside location in what is now speculated to have been the modern barrio Los Indios, reaching a stone slab that was meant as a marker. Digging the terrain, the priest found a tunnel and continued rummaging until he reached an alcove within which were more than 800 rocks and stones of varying sizes several of which had anthropomorphic shape, all covered in unknown petroglyphs that did not match any Amerindian civilization known to have lived in Puerto Rico or the Caribbean. \nFrom 1880 onwards, the rocks were taken to Nazario's personal house at Guayanilla, not the parochial house, where he kept the other fragments of this finding and several other archeological pieces as part of his collection. Nazario gave the people involved in the extraction a modest reward for bringing pieces there. In 1883, Agustín Stahl and Román Baldorioty de Castro visited the house and discussed the possibility of creating the Puerto Rico Museum of Natural History.\n\nNazario named them \"antropoglifitas\" (hispanized from the Greek \"antropōmorphos\", which relates to having human-like characteristics, and \"gluphē\", which refers to carvings) and considered each individual piece a volume in a larger story. In his writings, Nazario stated that they had been found packed in a small area and at a distance that was \"not extraordinarily away from Guayanilla\", speculating if they had been hidden there to avoid being lost at war (between the local and foreign natives) due to its proximity to the chiefdom of Agüeybaná. The priest was close to physician and author Manuel Zeno Gandía, with whom he exchanged correspondence and would later join him in a historical debate over the location of Columbus' arrival to Puerto Rico. Nazario gave him two pieces of the Collection to him and requested that they were kept safe and close. In 1881, when Zeno Gandía was chosen as representative of the Puerto Rican media in the activities held to commemorate Pedro Calderón de la Barca's second centenary in Spain, he took the pieces to the founder of the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Pedro González de Velasco, who according to the author insisted in keeping one of them. An agreement was reached between both, where the Spaniard accepted naming it after Nazario and gave credit to its discovery in Puerto Rico. This event caused a temporary estrangement between Zeno Gandía and the priest. After González de Velasco died the following year, the destination of the piece became unknown.\n\nThe first formal mention of the Collection was made by Alphonse Pinart in 1890, noting that the discovery was made near Yauco, in a place that he identifies as \"Hanoa, Puerto Rico\", and that some pieces displayed signs of being \"undoubtedly authentic\", but assumed that unscrupulous people fabricated their own to receive a reward. He further noted similarities between the characters in the Collection and known ancient alphabets, but declined speculating further on the matter. Pinart also embarked some pieces with him to the Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro from which they were moved to the Musée du quai Branly when the former institution closed down, 38 pieces remain there and form the largest known concentration outside of Puerto Rico. Nazario later noted that besides France, other pieces had been taken by the researcher to Copenhagen and Philadelphia.\n\nIn 1893, Nazario wrote a piece named \"Escritura Aborigen de Carib\" (English: \"Aboriginal writing of the Carib\"), where he detailed his interpretations of the petroglyphs. Analyzing the inscriptions, he dismissed a Taíno or Arawak origin and by 1897 had concluded that the carvings were more reminiscent of Chaldean or Hebrew languages, saying that he recognized some of the characters present. Nazario also asserted that based on the study of the petroglyphs, it was safe to conclude that the Pre-Columbian inhabitants of Puerto Rico had perfected writing beyond the natives of Mexico or Peru, speculating that the pieces could have been a Pre-Columbian national archive of some kind. Nazario would then begin an effort to translate the characters phonetically after acquiring a copy of 1889's \"Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea\" (English: \"History of the Nations: Chaldea\") and using the characters present in a Babylonian religious artifact reproduced there. The document would be modified and later become known as \"Escritura Fonética de los Indios de Puerto Rico\" (English: \"Phonetic orthography of the Indians of Puerto Rico\"). Nazario hypothesized that perceived linguistic similarities could imply that some of the Ten Lost Tribes crossed Asia making their way into the Bering Strait and traveled from there to North America, before dividing somewhere near Central America, from where they arrived to the Caribbean.\n\nThe conclusions reached by Nazario were met with skepticism by mainstream archeologists who labeled him as \"imaginative [and/or] crazy\", as it implied contact with the New World prior to Columbus' voyages, and speculation emerged that he had paid a local jíbaro (a class of Puerto Rican countrymen) to sculpt the stones with a machete and that the petroglyphs were meaningless. In 1894, Nazario met Cayetano Coll y Toste, which whom he had been involved in a number of historical debates, at San Juan. Both discussed the possibility of the historian aiding in the process of deciphering the characters in the Collection, but the effort was aborted when the condition of sending the pieces to San Juan (to be returned later) was proposed. According to historian Otto Sievens, several of the rocks were thrown into a cistern at Guayanilla's church when the Americans arrived during the Spanish–American War. By 1903, Nazario was holding conferences about the Collection, which were unsuccessful in gaining the desired attention.\n\nThat same year, Jesse Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution, visited Puerto Rico and reportedly offered Nazario $800 to buy the pieces, but the offer was declined. In his subsequent report, the anthropologist concluded that the assemblage was the most intricate one among those that gathered native petroglyphs in Puerto Rico. However, in his examination of the carvings Fewkes also commented that the inscriptions were not Amerindian in origin and labeled them as \"exotic\", leading to an assumption that they may not be ancient. In his field notes, Fewkes notes that he was unable to find Nazario during a first visit in 1902, returning the following year. He also stated that the entire Collection was under a roof, that the pieces were classified by priority, and that the priest gave him his writings (which he discarded as not being authored by a scientist). Despite his skepticism, Fewkes took some pieces with him, which he placed in an exhibit along pieces of dubious origin at the National Museum of Natural History based on his initial assessment. This led to unrelated American archeologists assuming that the rocks were a forgery, discontinuing their investigation for several decades. Influenced by their foreign peer, local archeologists also lost interest in the Collection and stopped their inquiry for decades.\n\nIn an interview held in 1905, the priest showed \"Escritura Fonética de los Indios de Puerto Rico\" to journalist Gabriel A. Piles and discussed hypotheses about the arrival of Old World travelers as well as his efforts to translate the characters using \"Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea\". Between 1911 and 1912, Nazario was transferred to San Juan while facing health issues. After being relocated, the priest had the Collection moved to the capital and kept it in his room. In 1908, Nazario wrote to Zeno Gandía informing him that a letter from Pinart had arrived, in the process making a throwaway remark noting that \"it was almost incredible that 28 years [had already passed since their first meeting]\", which would later allow to date the philologist's visit to 1880 and placed the original date of discovery sometime during the late 1870s. During this decade, Samuel Kirkland Lothrop visited Puerto Rico and took some pieces.\n\nArcheologist Adolfo de Hostos visited Nazario in San Juan, where he was told the now-popular origin story. Taking some pieces with him, Hostos was still not convinced that the Collection (which at this point he estimates rounds the 700 pieces) possessed cuneiform characters, but still felt that it required detailed study. With the death of Nazario in 1919, the pieces became segregated, with only around 250 being acquired by collector Robert Junhans and later preserved at the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture. The first pieces arrived there during the 1950s, where they were placed in storage. The pieces in Hostos possession were granted to the University of Puerto Rico. These were relocated to the Museo de Historia, Antropología y Arte at Río Piedras. The ones owned by Lothrop were sent to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Alice de Santiago, a school teacher from Barceloneta, reportedly found a piece that was similar to those in possession of Nazario but made in limestone and contacted Zeno Gandía. The current whereabouts of this rock are unknown.\n\nA number of writings authored by Nazario where later recovered by Zeno Gandía, who republished them in \"El Imparcial\" and claimed that he had seen Martin J. Berntsen of the Dominican priests of Bayamon taking some of the documents once his friend died, with the documents later being found by a priest in the parochial archives there. The origin story was first published by Hostos more than three decades later in 1955, having already deviated slightly from its original account by integrating elements related to the adaptation of the account to then-concurrent concepts. In it, he discussed a booklet filled with notes from Nazario being the last known person to be see the lost document.\n\nIn 1969, Hostos sent one of the pieces to the British Museum so that it could be studied by scholar C.B.F. Walker, author of a number of books on cuneiform writing. Afterwards, Walker responded with an assessment that it possessed characteristics similar to pieces recorded circa 2000 B.C. and that it could be Sumerian in origin. During the 1980s, the president of the \"Academia Puertorriqueña de la Historia\" (English: \"Puerto Rican Academy of History\") Aurelio Tió revived the debate surrounding the pieces and began insisting on the thorough study of the inscriptions, citing that the idea that they were randomly inscribed with a machete was implausible. This historian dismissed the prevailing conclusions surrounding the rocks, noting that too much emphasis had been given to Fewkes' insinuation and that, despite the lack of formal studies by the anthropologist, it had somehow become widely accepted among local archeologists. Tío argued that if authenticated, the Collection could potentially represent one of the biggest archeological finds in the Americas and the Western Hemisphere, a position that he defended until his death. He unsuccessfully tried encouraging the Smithsonian, Harvard University, University of Valladolid, Yale University, University of Pennsylvania, the British Museum and archeologist Marcel Sigrist to retake the study of the pieces. In total, Tío wrote over 30 papers on the Collection evaluating its potential significance to local history and the possible influence on the Taíno population, which did not receive academic examination or rebuttals from the archeological community. He also commissioned a professional photographer to capture the first high quality images of the pieces, which were to be re-published in the media. Linguists from Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and France were involved in the issue, with the latter concluding that they could be legitimate.\n\nDespite not meeting with immediate success, the attempt to bring the topic to the mainstream did gather the interest of peripheral groups such as the Midwestern Epigraphic Society, which considered the pieces authentic in a report and established parallels between the symbols present in the petroglyphs and similar inscriptions present in cooper and gold slabs recovered in Ecuador. Author Barry Fell concluded that the inscriptions were not random, and that the characters correspond to Pre-Greek characters found in Cyprus, Turkey and Crete, rearranged so that they would be phonetically read in Pre-Incan Quechuan. The speculation being that ancient Cyprians had previously interacted with the South American ethnic group and learned to write that language with their alphabet before reaching Puerto Rico and doing the same with the local population. According to Fell, evidence suggesting the authenticity of the petroglyphs emerged with the discovery (along the relevant civilization) of a similar grid-based and acrostic language by Pedro I. Porrás Garcés at Ecuador in 1961, which was first detailed in his an article titled \"Arqueología de la Región Oriental\" (English: \"Archeology of the Oriental Region\"). The document also notes similarities with characters present in the royal robe of Viracocha Inca, leading to the hypothesis that they were huacas and that one particular piece was dedicated to a request to Mamai, the title invested to the Incan queen. Fell concludes that the Collection would represent the largest finding related to this culture and the only one outside South America. The report gathered some interest, but conflicting views within the mainstream media resulted in stagnation of the topic.\n\nAfter the death of Salvador Tió, others that have promoted the topic include Antonio Molina and his daughter, Zoé Tió. In Guayanilla, biographer Norbeto Lugo and Irvin Sepúlveda have made efforts to foment the study on the pieces. In 2008, interest in the pieces surrounded the 175th Anniversary of the municipality's foundation. It was due to this celebration, where interest in Guayanilla's history peaked, that arrangements were made to have the Collection in public exhibition for the first time and the first time in decades that the topic returned to the mainstream media. The exhibition took place between March 27 and 28 at the behest of Leandro Hernández, director of the \"Centro Cultural María Arzola\" (English: \"María Arzola Cultural Center\") which also hosted the pieces. The municipal administration of Guayanilla then announced arrangements to have them permanently moved there in order to exhibit them. During the following year, interest in the Collection grew and the municipality began efforts to create the \"Museo de Epigrafía Lítica Padre Nazario\" (English: \"Father Nazario Museum of Lithic Epigraphy\") to emphasize them. Shortly afterwards, the finding became a central argument against the creation of an eolic park in the region. Upon opening, the museum featured a permanent exhibition where 19 pieces of the Collection were on display, among other archeological exhibitions relevant to the municipality. The topic re-entered the mainstream media in April 2016, with coverage related to a conference covering his research that was organized by Zoé Tió.\n\nIn 2012, research on the pieces returned to the mainstream academia with the involvement of Reniel Rodríguez Ramos from the University of Puerto Rico at Utuado, who was concerned that up to that point most of the local research had been carried by historians. During his first visit to the ICP, he encountered part of the Collection being repurposed and the rest in storage. While attending an activity in the British Museum in 2014, Rodríguez took some pieces with him to the cuneiform exhibit, where he was casually presented to C.B.F. Walker while showing Jago Cooper a copy of Hostos' letter to the now-retired cuneiform expert. None of the present gave a definitive answer to their nature, but agreed that further study was needed. Parallel to this process, a documentary began being prepared by cinematographer Carlos García in collaboration with Rodríguez and his team.\n\nIn terms of characteristics, most pieces depict individuals in what appear to be varying ceremonial postures while wearing headwear and a tunic in which the petroglyphs are present. The group also examined other characters that deviated from the norm, such as those present at a site within the Guánica State Forest in an attempt to identify similar inscriptions. In relation to local natives, analogues are scarce and not identical, with some a similar headwear appearing in a piece unearthed at Tecla in Guayanilla and elements of clothing in idols (and additional symbols) being found at La Hueca in Vieques. Rodríguez has been unable to pinpoint the place referred to as \"Hanoa, Puerto Rico\" in Pinart's notes. Consequently, the research team carried sample collection in the south western coast of Puerto Rico, in particular the regions of Guayanilla and Yauco assumed to be near the initial discovery, such as Barrio Los Indios and Barina. After completing macroscopic examination, the prime matter is consonant with serpentinized peridotite with traces of bastite and mica typical in the region.\n\nEfforts were made by the research team to retrieve as much firsthand information on the origin and history of the pieces as possible. With the collaboration of Laura Rodríguez from the Bayamón Central University, the archeologist was able to rummage through the Zeno Gandía Collection (a repository of documents and artifacts that used to belong to him) and retrieve the correspondence between Nazario and the author. By establishing the date of Pinart's first visit, Rodríguez attempted to prove if Nazario had access to sources detailing ancient writing similar to that exhibited in the Collection prior to this. In this regard, he concluded that since \"Historia De Las Naciones: Caldea\" was published at least nine years after the visit of Pinart, it could not have been used by Nazario to forge the characters. He also acquired Fewke's field notes with the help of Roberto Martínez. Rodríguez tried to pinpoint the location of González de Velasco's piece, but was told that it is no longer part of the Museo Nacional de Antropología's Puerto Rico exhibit.\n\nThe archeologist discussed how to proceed with people from a number of fields, including geology, chemistry and physics. To determine the chemical characteristics of the pieces, Antonio Martínez of the Physics Department of the UPR and Pablo Llerandi of General Studies at University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus (UPR-RP) have been involved in an initiative to complete studies on X-ray diffraction and spectrography, in order to further pinpoint the properties of the prime matter. In order to determine the characteristics of the traces the high power microscopes of the UPR-RP were used to carry out high magnification studies in which perpendicular striations were noted as part of a pointer drag technique. Some pieces do display characters that were added later than those in the others, implying that some were created afterwards. However, the manner in which some of the pieces have been intemperized (in particular the presence of differential intemperization in some that has rounded the edges of fractures in only one of the sides) is inconsistent with them being fabrications that were forged in the late 1870s and then stored indoors ever since, instead suggesting that they were exposed to the elements for a prolonged time period. Further efforts are being made to fund a collaboration with Leiden University to advance this research area with their specialists.\n\nCarlos Silva of Universidad del Turabo has been involved in the 3D scanning of the pieces. The high definition imaging has led to the interest of philologist Christopher Rollston, whom Rodríguez considers a candidate to attempt the falsification of the Old World hypothesis. Studies in thermoluminescence have been proposed to establish the last time that the rocks were set on fire. Some of the artifacts were burned after the traces were made, with the pieces that fragmented during the process being plausible candidates. Others have carbon remnants that could be dated by employing the C-14 method. The general plan is to send separate pieces to the University of Washington Luminescence Dating Laboratory and to Oxford Authentication to compare results, which Rodríguez considers possibly conclusive. Towards this end, he has requested additional support from the ICP or the Official Historian of Puerto Rico.\n\nBased on his research, Rodríguez has formulated a number of hypotheses that are being currently examined without taking an a priori position about their authenticity or the possibility of fraud, with his initial position taking under consideration that some pieces where likely created after the initial discovery. If the entire Collection is proven to be fraudulent, he argues that the age of the pieces makes them archeological artifacts in their own right. Rodríguez has also formulated a preliminary hypothesis if several of the pieces are certified as authentic, for which he tried to identify similar geodesic characters, since these are not common, and have only been found in the Caribbean at Mona Island, Salto Arriba in Puerto Rico, Bateyes de Viví in Cuba and Piedra Mapa in Santa Marta. Throughout the rest of the globe, their closest analogues are found at the Canary Islands. Rodríguez also considers that religious idols found in this archipelago exhibit similar posture and facial features, which were not discovered until after the pieces were reportedly unearthed and he argues that Nazario could not have known. In terms of character analysis, there are some that are analogue to the Libyco-Berber alphabet found in the Canary Islands.\n\nAfter the initial studies, a set of cave paintings was uncovered near Playa Los Tubos, which Rodríguez decided to capture and send to Renata Springer Bunk (a philologist who has authored several books about the Libyco-Berber characters at the Canary Islands) who responded in the affirmative about their nature but lost interest after being told that they were found at Puerto Rico. Ultimately, he combined these with the seafaring nature of Caribbean natives and studies like one in which archeologist Richard Thomas Callahan of the University of Calgary studied how far the Canary Current could have dragged a drifting vessel, to formulate a hypothesis that he wants to falsify. In regards to other hypotheses, Rodríguez is skeptical of Fell's conclusion and notes that some of the words that the zoologist translated as phonetic Quechan such as \"yuca\", \"ungey\", \"chayote\" or \"papaya\" are in fact Arawak in origin.\n"}

Her performance at the Tate Modern \"The World is Flooding\" in 2014 was followed by an exhibition \"Animal with a Language\" at Waterside Contemporary, both of which saw Ashery work with participants from Freedom from Torture, UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group, Portugal Prints, and others, to explore these themes.\n\nAshery has exhibited and performed at various international venues, such as ZKM, Karlsruhe; Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin; Brooklyn Museum, New York; Overgaden, Copenhagen; DEPO, Istanbul; Whitstable Biennale; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Auto Italia South East, London; and Freud Museum, London, producing works that explore her personal politics and identity in relation to wider social and cultural contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is famous for his preparational work for the unimplemented painting \"Farewell to Rus\".\n\nPavel Korin was born in the village of Palekh (now in Ivanovo Oblast) to a family of a professional icon-painter Dmitry Nikolayevich Korin. In 1897, when Pavel was only five years old, his father died. In 1903-1907, he studied at the \"School for Icon Painting\" at Palekh getting a formal certificate as a professional icon-painter. In 1908, he moved to Moscow and until 1911 worked there at the icon shop of the Don Monastery.\n\nIn 1911, he worked as an apprentice to Mikhail Nesterov on frescoes of The Intercession Church at the Convent of Martha and Mary (\"Marfo-Mariinsky\") on Bolshaya Ordynka Street in Moscow. Nesterov insisted that Korin gain a formal education in easel painting and arranged his admission to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1912. Pavel graduated from that school in 1916, having been a student of Konstantin Korovin and Leonid Pasternak.\n\nIn 1916, he worked on frescoes for the mausoleum of Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna at The Intercession Church at the Convent of Martha and Mary. In accordance with the wishes of the Grand Duchess, he traveled to Yaroslavl and Rostov to study traditional frescoes of antique Russian churches.\nIn February 1917, he started to work in his attic studio on Arbat Street in Moscow and worked there until 1934.\n\nIn 1918-1919, he taught at the \"2nd State Art Studios\" (2-ые ГСХМ). In 1919-1920 he worked at the \"Anatomic theatre\" of Moscow State University, as he thought that, as a painter, he needed deeper knowledge of the human anatomy. In the evenings he copied paintings and sculptures of the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nIn 1923, he traveled over Northern Russia, visiting Vologda, Staraya Ladoga, Ferapontov Monastery, and Novgorod. In 1926-1931, he worked as an instructor of painting classes for beginners at the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nIn 1926, the Convent of Martha and Mary was closed by the Soviets and all the art there was to be destroyed. Pavel and his brother Alexander managed to smuggle out and save the iconostasis and some of the frescoes. On March 7 of that year he married Praskovya Tikhonovna Petrova, a disciple of the Convent of Martha and Mary.\n\nIn 1927, Korin's aquarelle \"Artist's studio\" and his oil landscape \"My Motherland\" were bought by the Tretyakov gallery, showing recognition from the Soviets.\n\nIn 1931, Korin's studio was visited by Maxim Gorky, who supported Korin since. In 1932, Korin followed Gorky to Sorrento, painted Gorky's portrait, and visited Italy and Germany.\n\nIn 1931, Korin started to work as the Head of the Restoration Shop of Museum of the Foreign Art (former Museum of Fine Arts later Pushkin Museum). He held this position for until 1959. After this he held the position of the Director of the \"State Central Art Restoration Works\" (ГЦРХМ) until his death. As one of the most senior Russian restorers of the time he contributed enormously to the saving and restoration of famous paintings.\n\nIn 1933, Korin moved to the studio on Malaya Pirogovka Street in Moscow where he worked until his death. Now the building is Korin's museum.\n\nIn the 1940s, he painted many portraits of members of the Soviet intelligentsia (including Leonid Leonidov, Mikhail Nesterov, Alexey Tolstoy, Kachalov and Nadezhda Peshkova (Gorky's daughter in law)). He painted the fresco \"Match to the Future\" for the \"Palace of Soviets\" in the Moscow Kremlin and a Triptych devoted to Alexander Nevsky.\nIn the 1950s, Korin worked on mosaics for the Moscow Metro. His mosaics decorate the stations Komsomolskaya-Koltsevaya, Arbatskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line) and Novoslobodskaya, and also the Main Hall (Актовый Зал) of Moscow State University. He also won an impressive list of Soviet awards in the 1950s and 1960s: \n\nPavel Korin died in Moscow on 22 November 1967 and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery.\nThe biography of Korin shows an accomplished Soviet painter and a prominent art figure, but the job he had considered the main work of his life was left unfinished. During his student years Korin was impressed by the life of Alexander Ivanov, who spent most of his adult life in creating a single painting \"The Appearance of Christ before the People\" (1835–1857). Pavel decided that he should live by Ivanov's example and devote his whole life to a single large painting. He began by preparing a very accurate, life sized copy of Ivanov's masterpiece (1920–1925). The initial name for this painting was \"Bless the Lord, oh my soul\" (\"Благослови, душе моя, Господа\").\n\nIn 1925 Korin witnessed the intercession of Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow in the Cathedral of the Dormition of Moscow Kremlin. All people of importance in the Russian Orthodox Church, usually suppressed by the Soviets, were present. After the event Pavel decided that his magnum opus would be named \"Requiem\", or \"Requiem for Russia\", and would depict the intercession of Patriarch Tikhon and show the Russia that was lost after the October Revolution.\nKorin feverishly painted people present at the burial service for Tikhon, often the last survivors of families of Russian nobility, or dissident priests, soon to be destroyed. Rumors about the dangerous painting soon became a matter of NKVD interest. In 1931 Maxim Gorky advised Korin that the name \"Requiem for Russia\" was too strong to be accepted and recommended a change to \"Русь Уходящая\" - literally \"Rus that is going away\", but usually translated as \"Farewell to Rus\". Gorky believed that the painting showing the last parade of the Orthodox Church, depicting the tragedy and at the same time the misery of those people who would will disappear into irrelevancy, would be accepted and even well received by the Government. Korin agreed with the new name of the painting.\n\nFor forty years Korin worked on the painting. He produced dozens of large (more than life size), detailed paintings that he preferred to call etudes for the \"Farewell to Rus\" masterpiece; he worked on composition. He ordered a huge canvas, designed a special stretcher for it, and spent years coating the canvas with multiple layers of the special underlays. Korin was combining the ancient methods of the icon paintings with the science of art restorations and claimed the painting prepared by his methods should survive hundreds, possibly thousands of years without the need for restoration.\n\nIn his lifetime, he had not put a single brushstroke on the canvas - forty-two years of preparational work was not enough for Pavel Korin. Though some might consider it an extreme case of procrastination, the huge canvas became a popular art exhibit in the Korin Museum. Many consider it as an art masterpiece in its own right, similar to the \"Black Square\" of Kazimir Malevich.\n\n"}

They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the Middle East and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their ancestors below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of portraiture in the history of art.\n\nOne skull was accidentally unearthed in the 1930s by the archaeologist John Garstang at Jericho in the West Bank. A number of plastered skulls from Jericho were discovered by the British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon in the 1950s and can now be found in the collections of the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Nicholson Museum in Sydney and the Jordan Archaeological Museum.\n\nOther sites where plastered skulls were excavated include Ain Ghazal and Amman, Jordan, and Tell Ramad, Syria. Most of the plastered skulls were from adult males, but some belonged to women and children.\n\nThe plastered skulls represent some of the earliest forms of burial practices in the southern Levant. During the Neolithic period, the deceased were often buried under the floors of their homes. Sometimes the skull was removed, and its cavities filled with plaster and painted. In order to create more lifelike faces, shells were inset for eyes, and paint was used to represent facial features, hair, and moustaches. Some scholars believe that this burial practice represents an early form of ancestor worship, where the plastered skulls were used to commemorate and respect family ancestors. Other experts argue that the plastered skulls could be linked to the practice of head hunting, and used as trophies. Plastered skulls provide evidence about the earliest arts and religious practices in the ancient Near East.\n\n"}

It has been compared to two other novels about American politics: Robert Penn Warren's \"All the King's Men\" (1946) and \"\" (2011).\n\nThe book was originally published by an anonymous author, who was later found to be columnist Joe Klein. Klein completed a sequel of sorts, \"The Running Mate\" in 2000, focusing on the \"Primary Colors\" character of Charlie Martin.\n\nAn early reviewer opined that the author wished to remain unknown because \"Anonymity makes truthfulness much easier\". Later commentators called the publishing of the book under an anonymous identity an effective marketing strategy that produced more publicity for the book, and thus more sales, without calling into question the author's actual inside knowledge.\n\nSeveral people, including former Clinton speechwriter David Kusnet, believed the style of writing had similarities to that of Klein. This was also supported by a quantitative stylometric analysis of the book by Vassar professor Donald Foster. Klein initially denied writing the book and publicly condemned Foster. Klein denied authorship again in \"Newsweek\", speculating that another writer wrote it. \"Washington Post\" Style editor David von Drehle, in an interview, asked Klein if he was willing to stake his journalistic credibility on his denial, to which Klein agreed.\n\nOn July 17, 1996, after \"The Washington Post\" published the results of a handwriting analysis of notes made on an early manuscript of the book, Klein finally admitted that he was \"Anonymous\".\n\nThe book begins as an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton, joins the presidential campaign of Southern governor Jack Stanton, a thinly disguised stand-in for Bill Clinton. The plot then follows the primary election calendar beginning in New Hampshire where Stanton's affair with Cashmere, his wife's hairdresser, and his participation in a Vietnam War era protest come to light and threaten to derail his presidential prospects. In Florida, Stanton revives his campaign by disingenuously portraying his Democratic opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel and as a weak supporter of Social Security. Burton becomes increasingly disillusioned with Stanton, who is a policy wonk who talks too long, eats too much and is overly flirtatious toward women. Stanton is also revealed to be insincere in his beliefs, saying whatever will help him to win. Matters finally come to a head, and Burton is forced to choose between idealism and realism.\n\n\"The New York Daily News\" described the book as a farce and praised it as funny, truthful, and as containing \"uncannily accurate\" portraits of its thinly disguised characters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His mother remarried when his father died when he was 10 years old.Sava Sekulić was raised by his uncle and his aunt. He never attended any schools. His father taught him to read and write. Also, Sava used to quote his father's last words: \"Learn by yourself, draw and write with a stone in your hand\". During World War I, he was harmed and lost one eye when he was 15 years old. He started writing poems when he was 22 and painting in 1932, but he did not dedicate himself to painture exclusively. In 1943, during the World War II he began to work as a builder. Parallel to writing poems, after his retirement in 1962, Sava began to do painting in order to define his poetry more precisely. Sekulić belongs to the group of the so-called outsider artists, lonely, bizarre, asocial people who create new forms of beauty. His unusual associativity and ability for materialization of his intellectual energy as a complete self-taught was intuitively and instinctively released. He died in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1989.\n\nSekulić is a painter of the universal, the timeless and the limitless. For him everything is generalized, from the individual he aspires to the universal, and is very successful. Therefore, his works are the highest achievements of L'art brut, not only in the country, but worldwide. Allegories and metaphors are present in nearly all his works. With his visions he reduced a unique pictorial definition, minimized the subject matter to a metaphor. Most numerous are his compositions with human figures, portraits and scenes with historical and beings. While painting historical personalities, he portrayed the victims as heroes, and the members of his family as mythological beings. However, the most complex is the figure of a woman.\n\nIn many works there are philosophical stories and moralizing lessons. Figures are simplified, flat and highly stylised. In the background of every painting is an original story derived from numerous popular legends and beliefs – pagan, Christian, mythological, historical or contemporary.\nThe myths with the pronounced respect for animals – primordial parents and beliefs on summing up people and animals are presented in his paintings by duplication and compaction of human and animal figure (fish, bird, horse, cow, snake, octopus, deer, bull, he-goat...), multiplication of heads and limbs. The artist prefigured the symbiosis of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, where all the alchemy of his pictorial expression is clearly visible. It is paradoxical that the artist’s very style counteracts the narrative aspect of the painting and concentrates totally on the pictorial value with the strength on an unconscious neo-primitive.\n\nHis palette is restricted. He often paints surfaces with different applications of transparent colours, one over the other, without waiting for the earlier layer to dry, which leads to mixing and assimilation of colours. One colour is often predominant in each painting, which sometimes creates a monochrome impression. He sometimes only partly paints the background of certain paintings, thus leaving whole surfaces unpainted. This additionally eliminated any illusion of spatial depth.\n\nSekulić’s paintings are pervaded with a number of inventive characteristics, the symbiosis of the real and the surreal, with the character of almost pure automatism. The superiority of the artist’s senses overgrows the perception of a beholder. An ordinary observer is not capable of noticing and understanding sensitive structure of purely pictorial phenomena; his paintings are firstly accepted as a kind of visual intrigue and are later intellectually experienced. Finally, Sava Sekulić is one of the greatest Serbian outsider and naïve painters and a world classic also.\n\nThe best of his paintings are in the collections of Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia and in Galerie Charlotte Zander, Bönningheim, Germany. He participated in independent and group shows in the country: Belgrade, Zagreb, Aranđelovac, Jagodina, as well as abroad in significant international exhibitions in:Munich, Paris, Cologne, etc.\nHe received many prominent international awards. For his works he was also awarded posthumously at the \"Fifth World Triennial of Naïve and Marginal Art IN SITA\" in Bratislava, 2000, etc.).\n\n\n"}

At the time, Howard Klein was Assistant Director at the Rockefeller Foundation and played an instrumental role in the Rockefeller Foundation's decision to donate to TV Lab at Thirteen/WNET, working with WGBH's Fred Barzyk and artist Nam June Paik, among others. Initially, John Jay Iselin, WNET's President at the time, suggested Robert Kotlowitz for the role of TV Lab director, but artists involved in the project expressed discontent with the proposal.

It saw the premieres of over 140 operas, including Rossini's \"L'italiana in Algeri\", and was the theatre of choice for the presentation of \"opera seria\" until La Fenice was built in 1792.\n\nThe small, elegant theatre was first constructed by Michele Grimani on land owned by the Venier family. It was inaugurated on 26 December 1755 with a performance of Gioacchino Cocchi's opera \"Zoe\". In 1766 the ownership of the San Benedetto passed from Grimani to a consortium of patrician families in Venice who had been box holders at the theatre. The original design of the theatre was circular. However it was rebuilt in the traditional horseshoe shape following a fire in 1773. \n\nIn 1765 Vincenzo Galeotti who danced here from 1761 became the ballet master of the theatre and staged his first ballet here (at that time besides Galeotty and his wife Antonia there were two soloists and 16 corps de ballet dancers in the company). In 1772—1773 the ballet master of San Benedetto was Gasparo Angiolini.\n\nIn 1782 Teatro San Benedetto hosted the ball in honour of Count and Countess De Nord, Russian prince Pavel Petrovich and his spouse, visiting Venice. \n\nIn 1786 the owners' consortium had to cede the theatre to the Venier family following a lawsuit, and later went on to build La Fenice. The theatre then became the Teatro Venier (or Teatro Venier in San Benedetto). \n\nIn 1810, the ownership passed to the impresario Giovanni Gallo, and for a time it was known as the Teatro Gallo.

Situated next to the Free Trade Hall, it is the oldest surviving theatre in Manchester. It was commissioned by Mancunian businessman John Knowles who wanted a theatre venue in the city.\n\nThe Theatre Royal operated as a theatre from 1845 until 1921, when it closed in the face of growing competition from the Palace Theatre and Opera House. The building has since been converted numerous times for use as a cinema, bingo hall and nightclub. It has been unoccupied since 2009.\n\nThe theatre, which stands on an island site on the south side of Peter Street, is constructed in sandstone ashlar. It is in two storeys, with an attic, and is in Neoclassical style. Around the building, between the upper storey and the attic, is a modillioned cornice. Its entrance front facing Peter Street is symmetrical with three bays, the central bay being wider than the lateral bays. The central bay is in the form of a portico, with Corinthian columns and pilasters. Its entablature contains a central semicircular arch breaking through to the gable. Steps lead up to entrances in each bay. Above the central entrance is a pedimented niche containing a statue of William Shakespeare, which is based on the statue by Peter Scheemakers in Westminster Abbey. The lateral bays contain windows with balconies in the upper storey. Along the sides of the theatre are alternating rectangular windows and panels, with a blank semicircular arch above each window. The interior of the theatre has been altered, but retains its 1875 gallery. The theatre was designated as a Grade II listed building on 3 October 1974. The authors of the \"Buildings of England\" series describe it as a \"splendid classical composition in stone, one of the best examples of theatre architecture surviving anywhere in England from the first half of the 19th century\". The Theatres Trust described it as \"unique and architecturally significant\", with the façade being \"one of the finest examples of theatre architecture to have survived in Britain from the first half of the nineteenth century\", stating that it influenced the design of the Royal Opera House, London.\n\nManchester appears to have two previous Theatre Royals before the current building was constructed in 1845. The first opened in Spring Gardens on 5 June 1775 and operated on that site until the expiration of the proprietors' lease in 1807.\n\nThe second Theatre Royal opened in Fountain Street on 12 July 1807 and was destroyed by fire on 7 March 1844. John Knowles took over the management of this second Theatre Royal some time before the fire, at a time when the theatre in Manchester was at its lowest ebb. Knowles set up a strong stock company and proved himself a very capable, though somewhat authoritarian, theatre manager. However, following the 1844 fire the proprietors of the theatre in Fountain Street refused to rebuild it.\n\nAt a public dinner in his honour in July 1844, Knowles was presented a plate \"in acknowledgement of his energetic and successful efforts to revive national drama in Manchester\". Knowles told the gathering that if they could get no one else to build a theatre then he would do it himself. As a result, Knowles bought the patent rights and set about finding a site for the new theatre. Knowles had always been an admirer of theatrical performances and he was anxious to see their renovation in this, his native town. He desired to see the revival of the legitimate drama, and the plays represented in a manner duly worthy of them.\nKnowles found a new site for his theatre on Peter Street. He demolished the Wellington Inn and Brogden's Horse Bazaar. Knowles employed Francis Chester and John Gould Irwin as the architects for his new theatre. In preparation for the building of the new Theatre Royal, Knowles and Chester went to London and visited most of the metropolitan theatres, noting their areas, internal forms, acoustic capabilities, etc. With a cost of £23,000, the new Theatre Royal opened to an audience of 2,500. Precautionary measures against fire were taken by placing a tank on the roof capable of holding 20,000 gallons of water, which was connected by pipes to the stage and the green room. Its programme that night included Weber's \"Oberon\" overture, Douglas Jerrold's \"Time works wonders\" and an elaborate ballet spectacle \"The Court Ball in 1740\". Knowles's schedule of productions was intensive – in one season there were 157 performances at which two and sometimes three plays were performed. The popularity of the theatre grew. Charles Dickens, John Leech and George Cruickshank were amongst notable people who appeared at the theatre. The theatre was dedicated to Shakespeare and Knowles installed a Carrara marble statue of the playwright above the entrance. It was Manchester's finest outdoor statue. In 1875, after years of success, Knowles severed his connections with the theatre, disposing of it to a limited company for £50,000.\n\nIn 1921 the theatre was converted to a cinema due to competition from the Palace Theatre, Manchester and the Manchester Opera House. In 1972 the theatre became a bingo hall, then a nightclub in 1978, at which point various lighting bridges and rigs were added. It was known successively as the \"Discotheque Royale\", Infinity then M2 and finally a rename and rebrand to Coliseum due to the trouble caused by the clientele it attracted. The nightclub closed in 2009.\n\nIn 2008 a 28-storey office and retail tower was proposed, called \"Theatre Royal Tower\", that would be connected to the back of the original theatre. It was designed by Stephenson Bell with The Benmore Group as the developer.\n\nIt was announced in 2011 by owners Benmore that the Theatre Royal would receive a £2 million refurbishment to convert the building into a live music venue. Plans to convert the building into a hotel and live music venue never came about.\n\nDespite the promise of investment, Benmore sold the building in November 2012. It was purchased by the Edwardian Group, who owned the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel adjacent to the theatre in the Free Trade Hall. The building could potentially be restored as a theatre or banqueting hall as a complimentary extension for the hotel.\n\nThe 1845 exterior façade is virtually intact, and the building retains the balcony from 1875. Theatres Trust has said that the internal conversions for its past usage in various guises appear to have obscured – rather than destroyed  – the interior. The Trust classify the original interior work as \"restorable as a theatre\".\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

And in 2011, during the 15th Annual Webby Awards \"Urban Wolf\" won the People's Voice Award for Best Drama. It also has been selected for the 2009 AFI DigiFest by the American Film Institute as \"one of the most compelling example of new media storytelling\".\n\nOn March 31, 2010, Sony Pictures Entertainment officially announces a groundbreaking worldwide distribution deal for the series. The show premiered on Sony Pictures Entertainment owned Crackle on May 13, 2010. Then Sony Pictures syndicated the series in a multi-platform footprint including: YouTube, hulu, the PlayStation Network, Google TV, the Bravia Network, Animax, AXN, AT&T, Sprint, etc.\n\nOn October 19, 2012, Apple releases an exclusive and innovative mobile app edition of Urban Wolf available on its 172 iTunes App Stores worldwide for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. The Urban Wolf app edition features the entire 15 episodes of the series in HD and also offers an outstanding wealth of exclusive bonus feature to the next-gen format with in-depth background information. These extra materials function similarly to the extras section on a DVD box set.\n\nThe plot focuses mainly on an American tourist freshly landed at Paris airport in France who is pursued and terrorized by a malevolent security camera operator.\n\n\n\n\nThe series has received overwhelmingly enthusiastic critical reception. Journalist and critic Hugh Hart, writing for \"Wired Magazine\" noted: \"Laurent Touil-Tartour exploits sharp edits, a driving score and spare cinematography to extract maximum tension and an handsomely filmed suspense drama.” Hugh Hart also enjoyed the usage of non-verbal storytelling: \"Not a word gets spoken in Urban Wolf. But even without dialogue, French filmmaker Laurent Touil-Tartour has made an unusually sophisticated spy-tech thriller.”\n\nCritic Jandy Stone Hardesty, in her review for Row Three, said that Touil-Tartour has “a nice flair for composition and a good sense of visual storytelling, he also knows how to do good twists and suggest things rather than spell them out, something I really appreciated.” William Bibbiani, in \"CraveOnline\", called it \"an exciting little bit of filmmaking that deserves its notoriety and is worth howling about”, and Liz Shannon Miller writing in \"GigaOM\" wrote that \"“Urban Wolf is a gripping thriller that stands out as proudly unique. Some of Wolf‘s execution might emulate classic 1970s thrillers, but the concept is pure 21st century, playing nimbly with issues of privacy and paranoia. When a director can make even the eating of a potato chip seem malevolent (as occurs in the yet-to-premiere episode 7), you know you’ve watching something special.”\n\nReviewing it for the \"Mingle Media TV Network\", journalist Kristyn Burtt wrote: \"The reason this series stands out amongst the pack is its cinematic feel and the utilization of mise en scene. You don't hear the main character utter a word until Episode 7, and boy, is it effective.”\n\nAwarding the film a five out of five star rating, Feo Amante's film critic E.C.McMullen Jr. wrote: \"The tension from episode to episode is incredible and Laurent just keeps ramping it up. With its beautiful settings (shot in Paris, France), excellent cinematography, and super tight, witty action, this could very well define the future of online cinema. I'm not kidding! URBAN WOLF is a Turbo Thrust Cat and Mouse Thriller with a V8 engine!”\n\nActor Vincent Sze plays the role of Justin Case.\n\nInterview with Laurent Touil-Tartour\n\n"}

{"id": "22480886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22480886", "title": "Ľuba Lesná", "text": "Ľuba Lesná\n\nĽuba Lesná (born 21 March 1954) is a contemporary Slovak investigative journalist, filmmaker, novelist, and playwright. While her earlier work focused on plays, since Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution she has worked primarily as a journalist, writing also several books and a novel, \"Prípad medička\" (The Medical Student Case), being rewritten as a play. Lesná worked with Prime Minister Iveta Radičová, as an analyst in the Slovak Office of the Government from 2010-2012.\n\n\n\nNon-fiction\n\n\n\nFiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The novel \"Prípad medička\" [The Medical Student Case] is and is not about the actual murder of medical student Ľudmila Cervanová. It is, because Ľuba Lesná became familiar with this affair over a long period of time and discovered many facts and a lot of information used in the book. And it is not, because the novel is written as a literary fiction about the abduction and murder of a character, medical student Alena Hronská. Why did the famous author of non-fiction books (\"The Abduction of the President's Son\", \"The Abduction of Democracy\") not stick to pure facts this time? And why did she decide to risk telling her own version of this affair? Because, as she says herself in the book's introduction, according to pure facts and documents it should be clear to readers that this case did not take place the way that official police and judicial versions described it. The question — so what happened? — remains unanswered.\" (Martin Mojžiš, \".týždeň \")\n\n\"Just make sure nobody ever finds out what really happened. I have borrowed this sentence from Ľuba Lesná’s book, \"Prípad medička\" (Petrus Publishers, 238 pp)... One can’t help asking — could all this really be true? Because, if the murder of the medical student really happened the way the author describes it (and I hasten to add that personally I find it quite plausible) why has the truth not prevailed? The answer is probably in the times we live in, in our reality that easily turns lies into truth... While reading Ľuba Lesná’s latest book I could not get the first sentence from Péter Esterházy out of my head: 'It’s bloody hard to lie if one does not know the complete truth.' And I don’t mean the book’s 'heroes', the ŠtB officers... Luckily, the medical student’s sad story reminds us that the truth, even if revealed only in part, has the power to awaken our conscience, albeit painfully, with adrenaline throbbing in our veins. That is why politicians and many public officials consider it an unwanted commodity.\" (Štefan Markuš, \"SME\")\n\n\"'The time is not yet right for me to speak the truth about the medical student’s case, he said in his unforgettable sonorous voice...' I quote from the book \"Prípad medička\" by Ľuba Lesná, inspired — quite openly — by Ľudmila Cervanová’s murder. Although it is a work of fiction, the author cannot hide the fact that she is a journalist par excellence, or her extraordinary personal commitment to uncovering the centre of the disgusting octopus, the nerve centre of an operation that entangled and destroyed six innocent lives. Ľuba Lesná seems to have intimate knowledge of all these horrors and because 'the time is not yet right' for the truth to come out, she had to do it herself, by turning Cervanová’s case into fiction. I salute you, Mrs. Lesná!...\" (Lucia Piussi, \".týždeň)\n\n\"If the adversary in a detective story is a simpleton, the discovery of his identity is rarely pleasurable for the reader... The author of the novel demonstrates on a broad scale that everything in this case was fabricated by the communist intelligence service (ŠtB). All the ambitious investigator wanted to do was to indict as many young people as possible and he couldn't care less whether they were guilty or not, or if they had the means to commit the crime or not. Eventually the reader finds out that everything boils down to the so-called Arab link—the terrorist training facility for Arab students at Piešťany airport.\" (Michal Schuster, \"Knižná revue\") \n\n"}
