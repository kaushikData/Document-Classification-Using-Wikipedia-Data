It originated in the decoration of \"majlis\" (the front parlour of traditional Arab homes) in the Asir province of Saudi Arabia and adjoining parts of Yemen. These wall paintings, typically in the form of a of mural or fresco, present geometric designs in bright colors. Called \"nagash\" in Arabic, the wall paintings are often considered a mark of pride for a woman.\n\nIt was inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2017 as Al-Qatt Al-Asiri.\n\nThe geometric designs and heavy lines seem to be adapted from the area’s textile and weaving patterns.\n\nWomen in the Asir region are traditionally responsible for plastering and painting the walls, corridors, and ceilings of their homes. A family’s wealth often is signified by the skill, color, and complexity of the paintings, with poorer homes decorated in basic straight, simple lines in red, green, yellow, and brown. Women within the same neighborhood sometimes compete to make the most vivid and extravagant designs. Several Saudi women have become famous as \"majlis\" painters, such as Fatima Abou Gahas. Women's artwork is heavily influenced by their love for music, their view of culture and general perception of life; for example, the artwork of more conservative women is more likely to feature conservative and modest colors.\n\nThe interior walls of the home are brightly painted, employing defined patterns of lines, triangles, squares, diagonals and tree-like patterns.\n\nWomen from the region sometimes sell miniature \"'Asiri\" houses as souvenirs and knickknacks, which are popular among Saudi city-dwellers, who find these colorful houses a source of wonder.\n\nThe Saudi provincial airport in Abha reflects the region's cultural heritage. Airport Director Abdul Aziz Abu Harba said that \"the seating arrangement at the airport lounge has been in the form of a traditional \"majlis\" and the walls are painted in various colors reflecting the natural beauty of Asir\".\n"}

None of the artists have proper use of their hands as a pre-condition to joining the association. It represents around 820 artists located in 76 countries, of whom 143 ( as of 2016) are full members, and receive a monthly fee from the organization from the date of their admission until their death. The other artists are students, who receive a monthly scholarship until such time as they are promoted.\n\nThe main product of the organization is Christmas cards designed by the member artists. These cards are sold every year in the months leading up to Christmas via direct mailing in 48 countries around the world. Other products include postcards, art prints and calendars.\n\nThe parent company in Liechtenstein acquires the reproduction rights of a given painting and distributes it internationally. The original works are also sold at exhibitions held throughout the world. Works produced by the members have been shown in the United Nations Office at Geneva and at the European Council in Strasbourg.\n\nAMFPA was founded in 1957 as the Vereinigung der Mund- und Fussmalenden Künstler in aller Welt, e. V. (VDMFK), in Liechtenstein. It was styled a \"self-help\" organization and had the scope to further the painting skills of any mouth or foot painter, to promote their artwork and to support them financially.\n\nThe first president of the association, Arnulf Erich Stegmann, was a prominent figure in the development of mouth and foot painting. Born in 1912 in Darmstadt, Germany, Stegmann lost the use of both arms from polio at the age of two. Regardless, his artistic talents were soon recognized and supported by his teachers. He was proficient with a variety of brushes and styles, using only his mouth. He was educated at the School of Higher Education for Book Trade and Graphics in Nuremberg and studied with the artists Erwin von Kormöndy and Hans Gerstacker. He made a living selling his art cards and prints at marketplaces. After the Second World War he established his own publishing company with the poignant name \"Dennoch\" (\"Anyway\").\n\nIn 1953/54 he organized the \"Lodge of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists\" as a type of artists' community. This developed into the international \"Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists\", with Stegmann elected president for life.\n\nThe association's stated objectives are:\n\nThe association is run as a \"democratic co-operative\". Any mouth and foot painter of unimpeachable reputation living anywhere in the world can become a member of the association, provided they are 18 years of age and their works are considered artistic by the Jury who then recommends them for membership to the Managing Board.\n\nThe management procedures are governed by the statutes, which require that a Delegates Convention or General Assembly of all members must be held at least once every three years.\n\nFor electoral purposes, the Association divides the world into four regions: Europe, Africa and the Middle East; the Americas; the Far East; Australasia and Oceania. Each region deputes at least one delegate for every five members.\n\nThe managing board members and the president are elected by the members of the association. With the exception of the legal representative, every managing board member has to be a recognized mouth or foot painter.\n\nThe Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (MFPA) is the British organization for mouth and foot painters, and is a member organization of AMFPA. It was established in 1973 following legislation which required that disabled people be in charge of the business activities of an organization representing them.\n\nDuring the last 50 years paintings and artworks of mouth- and footpainters haven\\ been shown in numerous museums and town halls around the world. International exhibitions were held, for instance, in the following venues:\n\nAMFPA has many customers and supporters from around the world who appreciate and understand the difficult lives and inspiring works of the artists. Among those prominent figures to have spoken in favour of, met or celebrated lives of AMFPA artists are the Pope, Pierce Brosnan, HRH Prince Harry, Queen Sofia of Spain, Heinz Fischer, former president of Austria, Ma Ying-Jeou, former president of Taiwan, Bertel Haarder, Danish Minister for culutre and church, Mauricio Macri, current president of Argentina, Arnold Schwarzenegger 38th Governor of California, Salman Kahn, Amitabh Bachchan, Honorable Mr Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, David Dimbleby, Seal, Keith Chesney, HRH Prince Charles, Al Gore 45th Vice President of the United States, Morgan Freeman, (the late) Sir Terry Wogan KBE, Frederick Forsythe CBE, Kathy Lee Gifford, Jonny Wilkinson MBE, Anton Du Beke, Susan Boyle, David Coulthard MBE, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Sir Geoffrey Boycott, Alesha Dixon, KT Tunstall, Aled Jones, Bennett Gartside, Sean Lock, Rula Lenska, Kathy Lee Gifford, Katie Couric, HRH Sophie, Countess of Wessex, Sir Harold Evans, Rt.

The coverage has spurred criticism from charity, consumer and handicap organizations. The criticism included:\n\n\nNo claims have been made suggesting any illegal activity by AMFPA. The criticism has been centred on what is perceived as bad ethics.\n\nThe AMFPA has in some news reports and court hearings responded to some of the claims, stating that AMFPA has never intentionally presented itself as a charitable organization, but instead has explicitly pointed its commercial nature out to consumers. AMFPA has also stated that 80% of the worldwide profits are distributed among the artists. AMFPA declined to present financial records to support this claim.\n\nAMFPA stated that it never introduced pressure sales tactics but made use of direct mailing many years before competitors and charity organisations introduced similar methods. AMFPA sees itself as a victim of an unfair and tendentious journalistic coverage lacking of true facts and suspecting bad ethics.\n\nIn June 2007 the company sued the Danish Broadcasting Corporation and Danish daily \"Ekstra Bladet\" for libel, following negative coverage during December 2005. On 10 October 2008, the High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled in favor of the accused journalists, stating that there was sufficient factual basis for statements like: \"Behind the scenes we found a well-oiled money making machine with economic puppeteers, who are scraping in money with arms and legs\"; \"People think they are supporting a charity, but in reality we are looking at a money making machine\"; and \"...only a measly 3% is going to the mouth and foot painting artists\". AMFPA did not appeal the decision.\n\n"}
{"id": "39730185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39730185", "title": "Auguste Dreyfus", "text": "Auguste Dreyfus\n\nAuguste Dreyfus (28 June 1827 – 25 May 1897) was a French businessman who made his fortune by financing the Peruvian trade in guano. Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima, Peru to act as their local representative. He became involved in the guano trade, and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe.\nWith this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income.\n\nThe Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction. The government ran into increasing financial difficulties. These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano-producing province. A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile. The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end. He retired to France, where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art.\n\nAuguste Dreyfus was born into a Jewish family in Wissembourg, Bas-Rhin, on 28 June 1827.\nHe was the tenth of twelve children of the merchant Edward Dreyfus (1788–1866) and his wife Sara Marx (1791–1865). \nHe was the youngest of their seven boys.\n\nOn 29 August 1852 Auguste's brothers Prospere, Jérome and Isidore started Dreyfus Frères & Cie.\nThis was a small company in Paris trading in fabrics and other commodities.\nAuguste Dreyfus joined the company in 1856.\nBy 1859 Auguste Dreyfus, now residing in Peru, had become a minority partner.\nAuguste began trading in guano, and quickly became wealthy through careful attention to the fluctuations in the global demand for the commodity.\n\nProspere and Jérôme retired from the business in 1864 and Isidore in 1866.\nLeon Dreyfus, who had moved to Peru and made influential connections, \nbecame a partner on 19 January 1866 and remained associated with Auguste until 1869.\nAuguste became respected in business circles on both sides of the Atlantic for his skill and the profitability of his enterprises.\n\nThe government of Peru had been exploiting their guano reserves on a consignment system, in which the state paid contractors to extract, transport and sell it on a cost-plus basis. This encouraged corruption and inefficiency. Contractors were motivated to overstate costs and sell at low prices in order to drive up volumes. By 1868 Peru had large and growing debts. In response to growing public criticism, the government chose a new approach. \nOn 5 July 1869 the government cancelled all consignment arrangements and granted Dreyfus Frères the exclusive right to sell up to two million tons of guano in Europe. \nDreyfus was to pay 50 \"soles\" per ton for the guano, a considerably higher price than the government had been receiving up to then.\n\nAuguste Dreyfus was backed by the Société Générale of Paris.\nDreyfus arranged for a partnership in which shares were issued with a nominal value of 60 million francs. \nSociété Générale and the international trading house Leiden, Premsel & Cie. both took 22.5 million francs while Dreyfus took 15 million.\nEach of the major partners in turn distributed shares to subordinate partners.\nA private addendum to the contract stipulated that Dreyfus's choice of banker would handle Peruvian financial affairs in London.\nHe chose J. Henry Schroder & Co., a bank of the City of London.\nSchroders would handle the bond issues of 1870 to 1872.\nThe royalty payments were to start in the early 1870s as the other contracts expired.\nIn the meantime, Dreyfus would advance the government 2.4 million soles per year and 700,000 soles monthly for the first twenty months.\nThe contract also included clauses through which his company would assume government debts to former guano contractors and foreign bondholders, \ncharging the government 5% interest on this debt until it was paid off.\nThe total debt was 21 million soles. The agreement was ratified on 17 August 1869.\nThe Minister of Finance, who arranged the deal, was Nicolás de Piérola.\n\nThe former contractors did not have popular support but fought the contract, which had not been open to competition.\nIn November 1869 the Supreme Court said the contract should be cancelled since it had stripped Peruvian citizens of their rights.\nThe government rejected this ruling, saying it was for the legislature to decide.\nIn November 1870 the Chamber of Deputies approved the contract by 63 votes to 33, \nand the Senate ratified the decision soon after.\n\nThe income provided by the Dreyfus contract was absorbed in payments to an expanding civil service and armed forces.\nRather than reduce debts or invest in urgently needed schools or irrigation projects, Pierola used the income from the contract as collateral for additional loans, \nwhich President José Balta used for an ambitious plan promoted by Henry Meiggs to build railways in the mountainous Andes country.\nDreyfus arranged to float these loans in Europe, one in 1870 for ₤12 million of 6% bonds sold at 82.5% of face value, \nand a second in 1872 of 5% bonds sold at 77.5% of face value.\nPeru had hoped to sell almost ₤37 million of the 1872 bonds, but investors were concerned about the country's ability to serve its soaring debts, and there were rumors that the guano supplies were running out. \nDreyfus and his associates bought most of the ₤22 million that was issued, paying just ₤13 million.\nBy 1872 almost all of the government's guano revenue was going to debt interest payments, and the deficit was running at 50%.\nThe public saw no return from the railway projects, and in May 1872 elected Manuel Pardo as President, a popular former mayor of Lima. An attempted coup d'état before Pardo took power did not succeed.\nPardo inherited a financial crisis. The best-quality and most accessible gauno had already been extracted, so prices were falling and costs rising.\nPardo reduced the size of the army by three-quarters and canceled two orders for battleships from Britain, \nbut continued the railway construction program.\nHe allowed Dreyfus to continue with the last bond issue, which proved a failure. Only ₤8.3 million was raised, one quarter of what had been hoped.\nThe money mainly went to paying Dreyfus and refinancing debts.\n\nDreyfus now began suffering from the declining quality of the remaining guano and from competition with artificial fertilizer manfuctured in Germany. In November 1873 Dreyfus announced that he no longer had enough income to service Peru's foreign debt. The government responded by withdrawing Dreyfus's permit to ship guano, and stated that bondholders of the two loans had first claim on Peruvian guano, ahead of Dreyfus. \nThe government threatened to sue Dreyfus in Europe if he failed to meet his payments on the loans. An agreement was reaching in April 1874 under which Dreyfus could export another 850,000 tons of guano, the remainder of the 2 million tons agreed in the contract, and Dreyfus would continue to service the foreign debt until 1 July 1875. Dreyfus would also advance cash to the government based on the gross value of the guano extracted.\n\nOn 1 January 1876 the Peruvian government defaulted on payments on its foreign debt.\nPeru reserved 100,000 tons of gauno as security for the payments they had missed. \nIn March 1876 a new contract for guano sales was agreed with the Peruvian Guano Company, formed by the London merchant bank Raphael & Sons, and the Peruvians Carlos Gonzales Candamo and Arturo Heeren.\nOn 31 March Peru concluded a contract with the Société Générale of Paris for the sale of guano.\nManuel Pardo's presidency ended among growing economic problems compounded by civil unrest and a brewing crisis with Chile. He was succeeded by General Mariano Ignacio Prado, to whom he had lent his support.\nOne of Prado's first acts was to travel to London, where on 7 June 1876 he signed an agreement by which Peru sold 1,900,000 tons of guano to Raphael's consortium.\n\nThe Dreyfus contract expired on 31 October 1876, leaving Dreyfus Brothers with about half a million tons of unsold guano.\nIt was expected to take until mid-1878 to clear this inventory.\nThe competing Peruvian Guano Company was handicapped by terms that favored Peru, and until 1879 was not allowed to sell at competitive prices. \nDreyfus had large stocks of higher-quality guano, and continued to dominate the global market.\nThe Peruvian Guano Company's bondholders tried to sue Dreyfus for a share of his guano revenue, but did not succeed.\n\nIn February 1879 the War of the Pacific broke out between Chile and Bolivia with Peru. One of the causes was the 1875 nationalization by Peru of nitrate production facilities in Tarapacá province, many of them owned by Chilean companies. Chile quickly seized control of the main ports through which guano was exported and also Tarapacá, a key source of guano as well as of nitrates. By late 1879 the Peruvian government still owed Dreyfus £4 million, secured by the country's remaining reserves of guano.\nIn December 1879 President Prado left Peru and was replaced by Nicolás de Piérola. In January Piérola and Dreyfus agreed on a new contract under which the government recognized a debt to Dreyfus of 21 million soles, or ₤4 million, to be recovered by Dreyfus through further sales of guano. Dreyfus was to export only to markets that were not being served by the Peruvian Guano Company. The British protested against the agreement, but were not supported by the French.\n\nOn 30 June 1880 a new agreement was made between Peru and Dreyfus to consolidate its debt. Peru would give up control of its railways for twenty five years and pay Dreyfus £3,214,388. About the same time, the Chilean government agreed to give the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company the right to export guano from the occupied territories.\nChile occupied Lima in January 1881, effectively deciding the war, although a guerrilla struggle continued.\nOn 9 February 1882 a new agreement was made with Chile in which that country would sell one million tons of guano from Tarapacá to the highest bidder, with half the profit going to creditors of Peru whose claims were secured by the guano, including Dreyfus. Chile probably made this concession to avoid intervention by the creditor governments.\nThe Treaty of Ancón, signed on 20 October 1883, ended the war. Chile acquired Tarapacá permanently.\nIn the years that followed Dreyfus, the bondholders of the Peruvian Guano Company and other creditors, sometimes backed by the French or British governments, \nmade conflicting claims against Chile and Peru with limited success.\nDreyfus chose Waldeck-Rousseau, a prominent Republican who had been Minister of the Interior in 1884, as his advocate in his case against the Société Générale, formerly his partner.\n\nDreyfus converted to Catholicism shortly before his marriage in Lima with the Peruvian Sofia Bergman on 15 August 1862.\nHis wife's brothers, Charles and Frederick Bergman, won a contract in August 1869 to build and run dock facilities in the port of Callao, which they sold to the Société Générale in 1874. Sofia Bergman died in Lima in 1871.\nDreyfus married his second wife in Lima on 8 January 1873.\nLuisa González Orbegoso (1847–1924), Marquise de Villahermosa, was granddaughter of Marshal Luis José de Orbegoso, one of the first presidents of the Republic of Peru.\n\nTwo sons and two daughters were born of Dreyfus's second marriage. Louis Dreyfus (1874–1965), was successively authorized by decree of 12 August 1885 to call himself Dreyfus-Gonzalez de Andia, then in 1925 by Alfonso XIII of Spain, to assume – contrary to the Spanish noble usage – the title of his mother, who died a year before, and finally, by decree of 26 July 1935, to remove Dreyfus from his name. \nLouis married Félicie de Talleyrand-Périgord, daughter of Archambaud de Talleyrand-Périgord and Marie de Gontaut-Biron.\nÉdouard Dreyfus Gonzalez (1876–1941) was a lawyer and Count of Premio Real. He wrote songs under the name Jean Dora. \nHe married Anne-Hélène de Talleyrand-Périgord, sister of Félicie.\nEmilie Dreyfus married the viscount, banker and politician Hervé de Lyrot.\nHer sister married René de Lyrot.\n\nDreyfus was described in 1886 as having great vigor and agility, despite being somewhat overweight.\nHe was a good friend of the President of France, Jules Grévy. \nGrévy supported Dreyfus in his claims against Peru.\nDespite his conversion, Dreyfus was a target of anti-Semites such as Édouard Drumont in his 1888 polemic \"La France juive\" (Jewish France).\nHis children would also suffer from anti-semitism.\n\nDreyfus died in Paris on 25 May 1897.\n\nIn November 1874 Dreyfus bought an imposing neo-classical hotel at 3 Rue Ruysdael.\nThere he accumulated an extraordinary art collection, which he inventoried in detail in 1887.\nDreyfus showed objects in the Peru pavilion at the Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris, including furniture encrusted with pearls and objects of art. He also sent three mummies from Peru to the Paris Anthropological society in 1878.\nIn June 1888 Dreyfus bought the domain of the Château de Pontchartrain from Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck.\nIn 1891 the architect Émile Boeswillwald was given the task of restoring the chateau.\n\nIn June 1889 Dreyfus sold 116 items from his collection, realizing 861,000 francs.\nIn June 1896 the Dreyfus-Gonzalez collection was sold at public auction in Paris, and included among other valuables four candelabra called \"the sirens and garlands of leaves\" (c. 1783–1784) attributed to the great bronze sculptor François Remond and coming from a series of six that were part of the furniture of the Parisian hotel of the second Duke of Praslin (1735–1791), which were acquired by the Duke of Hamilton. They were sold to Dreyfus in 1882.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n"}

The Acts would have extend protection to \"the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation,\" with \"apparel\" defined to include \"men's, women's, or children's clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear;\" \"handbags, purses, and tote bags;\" belts, and eyeglass frames. In order to receive the three-year term of protection, the designer would be required to register with the U.S. Copyright Office within three months of going public with the design.\n\nH.R. 2511 was introduced July 13, 2011 by Representative Robert Goodlatte [R-VA6] with thirteen co-sponsors. On August 25, 2011, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary referred the Bill to the U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.\nhttp://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2511\n\nH.R. 2033 was introduced April 25, 2007 by Representative Bill Delahunt with fourteen co-sponsors. On May 4, 2007 the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary referred the Bill to the U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. A hearing was held February 14, 2008, but the bill never made it out of the subcommittee.\n\nS. 1957 was introduced on August 2, 2007, in Washington, D.C. by Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) with ten co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary but progressed no further.\n\nH.R. 2196 was introduced on April 30, 2009, by Representative Delahunt and twenty-three co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day and then stalled in committee.\n\nCurrently, fashion may only be protected by copyright to the extent that its shape is non-utilitarian enough to qualify as a creative \"sculpture,\" or to the extent that a design, pattern, or image on the clothing qualifies as \"pictorial\" or \"graphic.\" While current laws against counterfeit goods do provide some protection for designers, this is so only when the trademark is used and not when merely the design is copied under a different label. In addition, fashion may be protected by design patents if the requirements for patentability are met. To be patentable an ornamental design must be new, original and non-obvious. The United States Patent and Trademark Office website (www.uspto.gov) has a searchable database of patents, and includes patents on apparel in class D2, carrying articles in class D3, and eyeglass frames in class D16. Technological advances to the means of textile and garment production, as well as increases in the number of distribution channels and the availability of cheap labor in emerging economies have enabled those who would copy these designs to do so quickly and inexpensively. Legislation targeting design piracy has already been enacted in Europe, India, and Japan.\n\nCritics claim that, contrary to the bill's claims, the bill will actually harm independent fashion designers. The majority of independent designers do not have the litigation funds to effectively challenge big business should they be accused of copyright infringement. Furthermore, because distributors of accused designs can be penalized as well as the designer, distributors of clothing will become very wary of new designs unless the designer has adequate funds, influence, and power to hire skilled and effective lawyers. Pattern companies frequently utilize prevailing trends; so they too are vulnerable. Because of the legal risks of producing fashion patterns, fewer people will sew their own clothing, and fabric and sewing stores will suffer losses as well. As evidence of the bill's hypocrisy, critics point to how one of the most vocal supporters of the bill, Diane von Fürstenberg, was recently caught copying and distributing a piece of clothing originally designed by an independent Canadian designer. Critics also argue that the industry is already thriving commercially and encourages innovation. They point attention to the concept that originality in fashion design is too insubstantial for copyright law to distinguish protected elements from non-protected elements, and that extending copyright protection would stifle independent designers while giving powerful, big-business fashion houses a near-monopoly.\n\nH.R. 5055 was introduced March 30, 2006 by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), with six co-sponsors from both parties. The bill was referred by the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary to the U.S. House Subcomittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.\n\nThe subcommittee held a hearing on the bill on July 27, 2006, at which there was disagreement among legal experts as well as representatives of the fashion industry as to whether there was a need for copyright protection. Proponents of the Act claimed that new technology threatened American designers' ability to compete with the products of lower-cost countries, because the distribution of images of new designs and the automation of copying and manufacturing could occur within hours. They additionally pointed out that the United States was the exception among western nations in failing to protect designs.\n\nS.3728 was introduced on August 5, 2010, by Senator Chuck Schumer with ten co-sponsors. On December 1, 2010, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted unanimously for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor. This is the furthest that any of the design bills has progressed since 2006.\n\nUnder the IDPPPA, a copy of a design would have infringed if it was found to be \"substantially identical\" to the original work with little to no changes to set that design apart. Penalties for false representation would have been increased from $500 to $5,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000. \"Apparel\" items that would be protected by this Act include women's, men's, and children's clothing as well as luggage, handbags, wallets and eyeglass frames. A \"fashion design\" under the IDPPPA would be defined as an entire article of apparel including its embellishment and also includes elements of the original apparel that are the creative work of the original designer and are unique.\n\nSupporters argue that this act would create more protection for fashion designers. Opponents have argued that the bill would \"bring more lawyers into every step of the design process,\" outlaw \"inspiration and creativity,\" prevent \"unrestricted use of works in the public domain,\" and \"slow down the fast-paced design process.\" Some designers have supported the IDPPPA for protecting their current and future fashion designs. For example, Kurt Courtney of the AAFA has praised the bill as a \"great compromise and a product of hard work,\" but added that its effects will largely be seen in court cases involving the bill.\n\nS.3523 was introduced on September 10, 2012, by Senator Chuck Schumer with ten co-sponsors. On September 20, 2012, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor without amendment.\n\n\n"}

The protest started on August 14, 2013 as a reaction to a Russian Federation trade embargo against Ukraine. It was organized by Vidsich on social media. The campaign expanded to mass distribution of leaflets, posters, and stickers in over 45 cities and towns. Having faded by the beginning of the Euromaidan demonstrations in November 2013, it was renewed on March 2, 2014, during the Crimean crisis and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nAccording to activists, the campaign began as a response to a series of economic wars launched by Russia against Ukraine, including the \"Meat War\", the \"Cheese War\", and the \"Chocolate War.\" On August 14, 2013, the Federal Customs Service of Russia listed all Ukrainian exporters as companies \"at risk\", resulting in a blockade of Ukrainian products imported to Russia. A backup developed at customs involving hundreds of truckloads and railcars of Ukrainian goods.\n\nOn August 22, 2013, activists held a protest near the Presidential Administration of Ukraine. The campaign continued with a mass distribution of leaflets, posters and stickers in more than 45 cities and towns in Ukraine. Caricatures of Russian Matryoshka dolls have been used in the campaign. The campaign began to decline with the beginning of Euromaidan.\n\nOn March 2, 2014, activists used social networks to announce the renewal of the boycott on any goods and services that benefit Russian companies. The intention was to keep Ukrainian money from going to Russia where it may be used to support the Russian military. The boycott was launched in response to the Crimean crisis and the Russian military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nIn March 2014, activists began organizing flash mobs in supermarkets to urge customers not to buy Russian goods and to boycott Russian gas stations, banks, and concerts. In April 2014, some movie theaters in Kiev, Lviv, and Odessa began shunning Russian films.\n\nIn summer of 2014, activists in Kiev began organizing flash mobs and actions in Russian restaurants and coffeehouses.\n\nIn the end of August 2014 activists have started a campaign \"Boycott Russian Films\" against Russian movies and serials on Ukrainian media space.\n\nBy April 2014, some Russian manufacturers changed their barcodes from Russian to Ukrainian. Titled \"Boycott Invaders\", an Android app was developed to identify products from Russia, including those disguising their origin.\n\nBeginning in March 2014, the boycott spread to Poland and Lithuania.\n\nSales of Russian goods in Ukraine decreased by 35-50% in the spring of 2014. In May 2014, Ukrainian supermarkets began to abandon the procurement of Russian goods. Delivery of goods from Russia fell by a third.\n\nIn April 2014 it was reported that producers from Russian Federation are changing Russian barcodes with barcodes of other countries. Moreover, there are revealed facts of illegal masking of Russian products in some Ukrainian supermarkets.\n\nFrom January to May 2014, according to Standard & Poor's ratings, banks with Russian capital in Ukraine lost more than 50% of deposits.\n\nAccording to comparison test of Russian TV series watching ratings in Ukraine for 2013 (sample by GfK) and for 2014 (sample by Nielsen), total ratings dropped by a third.\n\nAs of mid of May 2014 it is known that Ukrainian supermarkets have started to massively abandon purchases of Russian goods. Supply amounts from Russian Federation decreased by a third.\n\nAccording to \"Taylor Nelson Sofres\" (TNS) Internet research in Ukraine, in March–April 2014 — 52% of Ukrainians are positive or \"rather positive\" about the boycott of Russian products. According to the survey, 39% of Ukrainians are involved into the boycott. Further survey campaign revealed that from July to August 2014, support of Russian products boycott increased from 52% to 57%. The number of people who are personally taking part in boycott of Russian products increased from 40% to 46%. According to data reported by TSN, in September 2014, 50% of Ukrainians joined Russian products boycott.\n\nEconomist Andriy Novak made a statement that the Russian products boycott in March 2014 has caused no more than a few tens of million dollars' loss to the Russian economy. In his opinion, the more effective way of fighting Russian economy is \"striking at a painful area – \"Gazprom\"\".\n\nThe idea of a boycott was supported by Fozzy Group, a Ukrainian group of companies that owns and manages retail stores, but was not supported by Ukrainian representative offices of \"Auchan Ukraine\" and \"Metro Cash and Carry\" retail groups. The reason was explained as a part of their apolitical vision.\n\nAndriy Dlihach, \"Advanter Group\" CEO, urged not to ban Russian products and to concentrate on buying Ukrainian ones instead.\n\nUkrainian and Russian-speaking blogger Danylo Vakhovskyi said that he is consciously using Russian internet services and will continue to do so, because it is a way to support \"the creation of a favorable environment for entrepreneurship\" in Russia. Although it is \"not patriotic, but to support entrepreneurs \"with ruble\", it is to give opportunity for the development of new projects, that is changing world for the better\". The blogger also presented some examples of such projects, including these websites: QIWI, Ostrovok.ru and Kaspersky Anti-Virus.\n\n\n"}

She is portrayed by Adrienne Wilkinson as an adult and as a baby by infant actors. She is loosely based on Livia Drusilla who was the wife of the Roman emperor Augustus.\n\nEve is the daughter of Xena and younger sister of , born of a miraculous conception after Xena and Gabrielle encounter a deity called the \"God of Light\". When Xena chooses to save her former enemy, Callisto, from eternal suffering, the redeemed spirit of Callisto allows her to conceive a child, who is then selected to be her reincarnation.\n\nBefore her birth, Xena's unborn daughter is prophesied by the Fates to become the Bringer of Twilight, the human who will bring about the end of the rule of the Olympian gods. Zeus attempts to kill Xena and her child before this happens, but is thwarted by his son Hercules, who kills him with a rib of Cronus. Xena delivers the baby with Gabrielle's help in the shade of a tree, moments after Zeus's demise. Xena names the girl Eve, a name that her deceased son suggested upon seeing him in the underworld. Meanwhile, Athena becomes the leader of the Olympian gods, and they continue their ceaseless persecution of the infant Eve. Driven to desperation, Xena and Gabrielle fake their own deaths, and that of Eve, by staging a fatal crash, then taking a sleeping draught in a manner similar to the ploy in Romeo and Juliet. They intend to awaken shortly afterwards, but the plan goes awry when , believing them to be dead, buries Xena and Gabrielle in an ice cave on Mount Etna as great warriors and leaves Xena's sword and chakram. Eve remains in the custody of Xena's friend Octavius, who proceeds to take her to Rome and sends her to the provinces to be educated.\n\nTwenty-five years later, Xena and Gabrielle awaken to discover that Octavius has become the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, and Eve is now a brutal warrior known as \"Livia\", the Champion of Rome. She is the protégée and lover of Ares, but is intending to marry Augustus and thus become the empress. Xena sets about trying to stop her daughter from massacring innocent people, and in the process inadvertently exposes Livia's identity to the gods, who resume their persecution of her as the Bringer of Twilight. She feels conflicted when Eve murders Xena's old friend Joxer.\n\nLivia is reformed when 's spirit shows her various moments of Xena taking care of her when she was a baby, and learns that her mother truly did care for her. The reformed Livia once again takes on the name of Eve, and intends to become the Messenger of Eli, who taught pacifism and independence from the Olympian gods. While Eve is initiated into the sect of Eli, the God of Eli gives Xena the power to kill gods as long as Eve is alive. This development causes the Olympians to redouble their efforts to kill Xena and her daughter, bringing about their own demise when Xena goes up against them with her newly acquired power. Ares and survive, having remained neutral during the ordeal. However, Ares gives up his powers and immortality to save Eve and Gabrielle.\n\nAfter the Twilight of the Gods, Eve travelled with Xena and Gabrielle. As such, she appears in the first four episodes of season six. According to an interview with Adrienne Wilkinson, the episode \"Coming Home\" took place a year after the events in \"Motherhood\".\n\nAfter \"Who's Gurkhan?\" Eve apparently returned to Rome, though no explanation was provided for her absence. In fact, while Xena seemed to know where Eve was, Gabrielle didn't, as seen in \"The God You Know\" where Gabrielle seems surprised to learn Eve is in Rome.\n\nEve challenges the emperor, Caligula, in \"The God You Know\" in regards to his slaughter of the Elijans. She is nearly killed by Caligula, but Xena arrives in time to defeat him and save Eve.\n\nEve is seen briefly in \"You Are There\" being interviewed by a news reporter Nigel.\n\nEve's final appearance in the series was in the episode \"Path of Vengeance\" in which she returns to the land of Varia's tribe of Amazons in order to atone for her attack on them six years prior. Varia, now leading the multiple Amazon tribes that have gathered from around the known world, captures Eve in order to make her stand trial. Marga had apparently banished Eve after \"Coming Home\" with the threat of death if she returned. Varia, having lost her little sister at Livia's hand during the attack on her village, is after Eve's life.\n\nIt is revealed in this episode, that the Amazons she captured as slaves (as stated in \"Coming Home\"), she had tossed overboard with their shackles still on when she was unable to sell them to Gurkhan.\n\nGabrielle challenges Varia for leadership of the Amazons in order to save Eve's life when she is found guilty, but loses. Xena challenges Varia to a fight before she can execute Eve, and in doing so, she shows Varia that she has become like Livia, which leads Varia to stop her actions, and pardon Eve (stating Livia is dead).\n\nAt the end of the episode, Eve parts ways with Xena and Gabrielle, heading to China a to continue to spread the message of Eli. Xena offers to go with her, but Eve states she needs to do it on her own, and departs.\n\nThere is a hint of Eve having children as stated in the episode \"The Xena Scrolls\", Professor Pappas and Melinda Pappas to be descendants of Xena in the 1940s, as she is Xena's only living offspring.\n\nLivia made two appearances in season six. One was as a vision seen by Eve, caused by the king of Hell, Mephistopheles, in order to torment Eve, hoping to get her to spill her blood in order to release him into the world in the episode \" The Haunting of Amphipolis.\" Livia was also seen in flashbacks in \" Path of Vengeance\" when she attacked Varia's tribe.\n\nEve possesses excellent combat prowess; comprehensively trained by from early childhood to fight in his name. (Hand-to-hand combat, all sorts of weapons but mostly swords) She is established as an extremely dangerous individual, and is more than capable of taking a stand against even the most skilled and dangerous of opponents, such as the and her mother.\n\nChakram Skills: In the episode \"Eve\", she was able to stop the Chakram when Xena threw it at her by cutting it into two pieces. In the next episode \"Motherhood\", Eve caught the Chakram.\n\nAcrobatic Skills: Aside from other acrobatic skills almost all well-trained warriors have in the show, Eve (Livia) has her own \"trademark\" moves: in the episode \"Coming Home\" as well as in the episode \"Path of Vengeance\", Eve (Livia) made a flip that only she knew how to do; this was revealed by Varia: '\"I've seen only one warrior do that move...\"' and which actually helped her to recognize the woman as being the former Livia—the Champion of Rome.\n\nCommander: Being the former commander of the Roman Legions, Eve (Livia) holds her previously acquired knowledge of political and historical facts.\n\nHeavenly Abilities: After Eve was initialized as the Messenger of the God of Light, she received a number of abilities that are channelled from Heaven. In the episodes \"The Haunting of Amphipolis\" and \"Heart of Darkness\", Eve was shown casting evil spirits back to Hell and healing a human who was taken by demons.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The piece may either use flame effects as part of a sculpture, or be a choreographed performance of fire effects as the piece burns; the latter being almost a type of performance art. \n\nFire can be a compelling medium for artists and viewers. It has a direct effect on its surroundings, consuming materials and giving heat and light. It is constantly moving and can appear to be alive. There is also the inherent perceived danger of fire.\n\nFire artists use various fuels and colorants to achieve desired effects. The choice of fuel is largely dependent on the effects desired. In large stationary pieces, propane gas is a popular fuel. Gas escaping from its container can be set alight. Different plumbing, pressures, nozzles alter the nature of the flames. Controlling how the propane mixes with the oxygen in the air is important. \n\nLiquid fuels like alcohol, methanol, kerosene, mixes of kerosene and diesel, and others, can produce spectacular results. Extra precautions must be taken with liquids because they fall and splash, while gasses usually dissipate. \n\nMost colorants are solids ground into a powder. As the powder is heated, it begins to oxidize and burns a color particular to the chemical used. Some colorants can be dissolved in alcohol or water or other liquids to facilitate their dispersion in the fire. Some colorants are toxic and should not be used in proximity to people. \n\n\n"}

It literally means \"Painting of the Sun, Moon and the Five Peaks\" and is also called \"Irwoldo\" or \"Irwolgonryundo\". The sun and moon symbolize the king and queen while the five peaks denotes a mythical place. The screen serves to display the majesty of the Joseon royal court.\n\nThe scene depicts a burning red sun, a full moon, five craggy peaks, and two fast-flowing streams with cascades, all flanked by a pair of conifers. The brilliant colours — known as tang-chae (Chinese colours) — were fixed with either animal or fish glue, rendering the screens brilliant and waterfast. \nNew York Times critic Holland Cotter has described the screen's solid, saturated colors and robust forms as being regular as \"textile patterns\", and noted that these screens have \"an archaic, hieratic look unlike Chinese or Japanese painting of the time.\" \n\nThere are no existing documents from an early period to explain the original iconography of the Five Peaks. Chadwick reports the findings of Dr. Yi Song-mi, Professor of Art History at the Academy of Korean Studies in Seoul. He has suggested that these screens were one of the most important elements in the throne hall, and that this formalized landscape illustrates the Joseon political cosmology. The \"almost\" red sun represents the king as the yang, the positive male principle, while the white moon represents the queen as the yin, the negative female principle. These two principles make the universe work.\n\nAn alternative explanation is that the screen might represent the blessing of Korea by Heaven, symbolized by the sun and moon in balance. When the king sat in front of this screen, he appeared to be at the pivotal point from which all force emanated and to which all returned. Thus, imbued with sacred power, the screen manifests a political cosmology as evidence of Heaven's favour, mandate, and continued protection of the ruler.\n\nChadwick (1998) also reports Yi's (1996) study of the history of such screens. He attempts to establish whether they were used at the start of the Joseon Dynasty reigned by King Taejo (r. 1392–1398). One suggestion Yi reports is that the practice of using the Five Peaks screen was established by Jeong Do-jeon. He was instrumental in the adoption of Neo-Confucianism as the Joseon's state ideology. Jeong Do-jeon used the screen as an important part of the design of the Joseon palace architecture in 1392. However, there is a painting from the 16th century referred to as \"The martial arts performance at Soch'ong-dae in the reign of King Myeongjong\" (r. 1545–1567) and there is no screen behind the throne. A 19th century copy however has the screen in place behind the throne. Yi therefore suggests that the 1392 date might be far too early and prefers a more recent date for the establishment of the screens. He suggests that screens role might well have been adopted after the 1592 Imjin wars as an attempt to reaffirm the dynasty's power. \n\nThe National Museum of Korea's entry on the screens asserts that the earliest written evidence for the use of a Sun, Moon, and Five Peaks screen in the Joseon palace dates from the mid-seventeenth century, but suggests that they could have been used earlier, as part of the Joseon court tried to distinguish itself from that of the Goryeo court.\n\nPalace records suggest that the screens were constantly being produced. Today however, only around twenty originals remain. None are signed. Examples of the screens can be seen at royal palaces in Seoul such as at Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace and Changgyeonggung.\n\n\n"}

The Porrúa name has been associated with books and publishing since the beginning of the 20th century, through its flagship Librería Porrúa bookstore in Mexico City and subsidiary stores throughout the country, and the company's renowned and extensive publishing business operating under the names and imprints of Librería Porrúa Hermanos and Editorial Porrúa.\n\nHermanos Porrúa has over 100 years of history as bookseller and publisher in Mexico. In the second half of the 19th century, three brothers emigrated from Spain to Mexico City: José, Indalecio and Francisco Porrúa. Indalecio had a market stall on what is now Del Carmen Street, north northwest of the Zócalo, in which he had a sign stating that he bought and sold libraries. His business was successful enough that he asked his brothers to join him. The libraries that they purchased were important not only for the works that they contained but also because from whom they were purchased, including some of the Mexico City’s nobility. They published Mexico’s first bibliography called the “Boletín Bibliográfico” which categorized the antique books for sale. It and others like it would set the value of most of the antique books in Mexico over the following century.\n\nPorrúa began publishing in 1910, starting with a “Guide to the City of Mexico” by José Romero, physically printed in Spain but distributed in Mexico by Porrúa. Four years later, the first book completely published in Mexico, a collection of poems, was offered by the company. The company’s logo, called the “Caballero Aguila” (Eagle Knight) was devised in 1915 by Saturnino Herrán. During the 1930s (at least), the business published as \"Porrúa Hermanos y compania\". The modern organization of the business took shape in 1940, changing its name to Editorial Porrúa and the company began printing specialty books, such as those on law and art. In 1959, Porrúa began printing a series of classical works with the aim of making these more affordable to the general public. Starting in 1964, Porrúa began publishing its own reference work called “El Diccionario de Historia Biografía y Geografía de México” (Dictionary of the History, Biographies and Geography of Mexico) and in 1992 began a division dedicated to young readers, starting with a version of the story of Don Quixote.\n\nThe original site of Librería Hermanos Porrúa is at the corner of República de Argentina and Justo Sierra Street in the historic center of Mexico City. The building was originally a house that dates from the 18th century and has two floors. The outside of the building maintains much of original décor, such as the geometric design on both floors, a niche with a statue of the Virgin Mary and iron railings on the windows of the upper floor. The inside of the building has been completely modernized and the lower floor is dedicated to the bookstore.\n\nFrom the original store in the Centro Histórico, Porrúa now has stores in all of the states of México and is also present in many location of the department store El Palacio de Hierro and the office supply chain Office Max in México.\n\n"}

{"id": "149437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149437", "title": "Matteo Bandello", "text": "Matteo Bandello\n\nMatteo Bandello (; 1480 – 1562) was an Italian writer, soldier, monk, and later, a Bishop mostly known for his novellas.\n\nMatteo Bandello was born at Castelnuovo Scrivia, near Tortona (current Piedmont), 1480. He received a good education, and entered the church, but does not seem to have been very interested in theology. For many years he lived at Mantua and Castel Goffredo, and superintended the education of the celebrated Lucrezia Gonzaga, in whose honour he composed a long poem. The decisive Battle of Pavia, as a result of which Lombardy was taken by the emperor, compelled Bandello to flee; his house at Milan was burnt and his property confiscated. He took refuge with Cesare Fregoso, an Italian general in the French service, whom he accompanied into France.\n\nHe was later raised to the bishopric of Agen, a town in which he resided for many years before his death in 1562. Bandello wrote a number of poems, but his fame rests entirely on his extensive collection of Novelle, or tales (1554, 1573), which have been extremely popular. They belong to the same genre as Boccaccio’s \"Decameron\" and Marguerite de Navarre’s \"Heptameron\". The common origin of them all is to be found in the old French \"fabliaux\", though some well-known tales are evidently Eastern, and others classical. Bandello’s novellas are thought the best of those written in imitation of the Decameron, though Italian critics find fault with them for negligence and inelegance of style.\n\nThe stories on which William Shakespeare based several of his plays (\"Much Ado about Nothing\", \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Twelfth Night\" in particular) were supplied by Bandello, probably through Belleforest and Pierre Boaistuau whose stories were later translated into English by William Paynter and included in his \"The Palace of Pleasure\". Another of his stories includes \"The countess of Cellant\", a distortion of Challand, a northwest region of Italy.\n\nThe only nearly complete translation of Bandello's tales into English is \"The novels of Matteo Bandello\", translated by John Payne in 6 volumes, 1890. This edition is separated into 4 parts, containing 51, 43, 51, and 21 stories, respectively, for a total of 166, minus two (part 2, story 35 and part 4, story 6), omitted because of their being almost identical to those of Marguerite the Navarre's Heptameron (stories 30 and 17), respectively, though keeping Bandello's dedicatory preface.\n\nThe Payne translation is a mixture of 19th and 16th century idioms. Examples of the latter include \"an thou wilt\" instead of \"if you will\", \"wheneas\" instead of \"when\", \"methinketh\" instead of \"I think\", \"parlous\" instead of \"perilous\". On most occasions, the language is clear and of fine literary value, but sometimes it is degraded with terms no one ever spoke or wrote. For example, instead of saying \"Now I would gladly hear your advice on this matter\", the duchess of Amalfi says: \"Now I would fain hear from thee that which thou counsellest thereanent.\"\n\nThere is a second book of Bandello in an English translation by Percy Pinkerton and containing twelve tales. This translation uses a more modern mode of expression.\n\nThe vast majority of the stories derive from those Bandello heard from contemporaries, reported as real life events. Far more rarely, some stories are based on literary or historical sources, such as book 5 of Dante's Purgatory (part 1, story 11), the Lucretia and Tarquin episode in Livy's History of Rome (part 2, story 15), story #23 of the Heptameron (part 2, story 17), and Francesco Petrarch's Triumph of Love from \"Triumphs\" (part 2, story 41). Some derive from English history, such as the chronicle of Mary Douglas, niece to King Henry VIII of England (part 3, story 44) and Henry VIII's six wives (part 3, story 45), some from Spanish history, such as Alfonso X (part 4, story 10). All of them were told to him by men, but a minority of dedicatory prefaces are offered to women. Bandello writes that the dedicatory prefaces to the nobility or to worthy persons are useful to him as a shield in case someone becomes offended by one of the stories and is tempted to attack him (part 2, story 32). He shows psychological insight into jealousy, in particular the description of two types of jealous men, the first from feelings of inadequacy and the second from feelings of the fickleness of women (part 3, story 47).\n\nThe most striking stories include two whores seeking to win their husbands back (part 1, story 17), two brother thieves in cahoots to rob the treasures of the king of Egypt (part 1, story 23), a disdained lover voluntarily choosing to live inside a cave (part 1, story 25), a woman killing herself only out of fear that her good fortune will turn bad (part 1, story 48), Filippo Lippi, released from slavery in Africa because of his talent as a celebrated painter (part 1, story 50), a woman disdaining a man and then killing herself when he no longer pursues her (part 2, story 16), an abbot making music from a chorus of pigs (part 2, story 23), an adulterous lover buried alive and then saved (part 3, story 1), a merchant's murder of another (part 4, story 1), a case of double adultery whereby each husband cuckolds the other (part 4, story 11), and two women yelling at each other after being falsely told they are hard of hearing (part 4, story 21).\n\nFour Bandello stories were adapted by Shakespeare, including \"Cymbeline\" (part 1, story 19), the Claudio subplot of \"Much Ado about Nothing\" (part 1, story 20), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (part 2, story 6), and \"Twelfth Night\" (part 2, story 28), plus one from the Shakespeare Apocrypha, \"Edward III\" (part 2, story 29).\n\nBandello stories have also been adapted by other dramatists, including John Webster, \"The Duchess of Malfi\" (part 1, story 24), Philip Massinger, \"The Picture\" (part 1, story 19), the same source as that of Cymbeline, John Marston and Jean Mairet, \"Sophonisba\" (part 1, story 35), John Fletcher, \"The Maid in the Inn\" (part 2, story 11), the anonymous 17th century French author of \"The Cruel Moor\" (1618) (part 3, story 17), Giuseppe Giacosa, \"La Signora di Challant\", \"The Lady of Challand\" (part 1, story 4) and Lope de Vega, \"Castelvines y Monteses\" (published in 1647 and written between 1604 and 1618).\n\n\n"}

It was filmed in 1989, but not released until 1991 due to the financial difficulties surrounding New World Pictures, the film's production company. It takes a dark, satirical look at the end of the world, nuclear holocausts, alienism and terrorism. It was filmed in Oshkosh, Appleton and Neenah, Wisconsin. It has gained a cult following.\n\nThe film starts off in a forest with a family being attacked by a family of huge Brazilian Cocorada. It then moves to a typical-looking family moving into a well-off suburban Ohio neighborhood. They are the bugs that were seen earlier, after they took on human form and met every \"normality\" standard from the magazine \"Family Bazaar\". They moved to the suburbs after the husband, Richard, got a job at a nuclear power plant; he works there in order to cause an explosion one day that will rid the world of humans and leave bugs in peace. But after a while they drift from all-American family normalities — the son, Johnny, a straight-laced A student, begins listening to heavy metal and becomes a junkie; Richard and his wife, Jane, drift away from each other, he having an affair at work and she becoming attached to her credit card; lastly the daughter, Sally, becomes a pregnant lesbian after being raped by a jock from the high school. \n\nThey each show their true bug form at least once in the film: Johnny while smoking marijuana with his metalhead buddies, Sally while being raped by the jock, Richard when infiltrating the nuclear plant, and Jane when two \"Family Bazaar\" agents come to their house. As they drift away from normality (and nearly being found out by the neighbors) their aunt, Bea, is sent to help. She becomes a nuisance and they decide she should be taken care of. Richard decides to not blow up the plant, and kills Bea instead. At the end of the movie they return to their lives in Brazil, and are visited by the townspeople that grew to love them. Although the plant did not blow up, enough radiation was released to remove the hair from much of the town's population.\n\nA deleted scene reveals that Aunt Bea survived and still intends to destroy the world.\n\n\nThe film was met with mixed reception.\n\n"}

It was opened in 1844 and remained active until the theatre building was severely damaged by the Fire of Pera in 1870. The ruined theatre building was purchased by Ottoman Greek banker Hristaki Zoğrafos Efendi, who built the present-day Çiçek Pasajı on its land plot in 1876.\n\nThe Naum Theatre was originally built as the \"Bosco Theatre\" by Italian illusionist Bartolomeo Bosco, on a land plot on İstiklal Avenue owned by the Naum family, as a wooden Ottoman style building. After Bartolomeo Bosco left the city, the ownership of the building passed to Michel Naum and Joseph Naum; who, upon completing the renovation works, reopened it with the name \"Théatre de Péra\" in 1844. The first play to be performed in the theatre was the opera play \"Norma\" by Vincenzo Bellini.\n\nAfter this original wooden building suffered damage from fire, a new theatre building was constructed in 1849 and was opened with the name \"Théatre Italien Naum\". The theatre was frequently visited by Sultans Abdülaziz and Abdülhamid II, and hosted Giuseppe Verdi's play \"Il Trovatore\" before the opera houses of Paris. The majority of the opera plays that were performed at the Naum Theatre were composed by Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti and Gioachino Rossini. In a letter to his mother, Gustave Flaubert wrote that he watched a play by Donizetti at the Naum Theatre in Istanbul the day following his arrival to the city.\n\nMichel and Joseph Naum were the sole owners in Istanbul of the rights to display many European theatre and opera plays, and brought many foreign troupes to Istanbul. They also printed the first Ottoman Turkish translations of the opera plays in the form of booklets. Apart from the usual evening plays, they also organized daytime plays for groups of viewers coming from the Asian side of the Bosphorus.\n\nAfter the Fire of Pera in 1870, the ruined theatre building was purchased by the local Greek banker Hristaki Zoğrafos Efendi, and architect Kleanthis Zannos designed the current Çiçek Pasajı building, which was constructed in 1876 on the theatre's former land plot.\n\n"}

The group originated at and was instrumental in the success of the Richmond Printmaking Workshop. In addition to the RPW, many of the One/Off Printmakers were faculty members or M.F.A alumni at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School, the Hand Workshop (now VisArts), Sweet Briar College, Richmond City schools, or the University of Richmond.\n\nPrintmakers working at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop on West Cary Street in Richmond formed a Print Club for both artists and patrons. The Print Club published periodically beginning around 1982 a photocopied \"Print Club Newsletter\" with the Workshop's logo of a black octopus, the same design which was emblazoned on a large exterior wall of the large studio and meeting space for the group also known as the RPW. The newsletter recounts that RPW founder Nancy David (who had been a student in the silkscreen and lithography classes taught by Marilyn Bevilacqua at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School) received a technical assistance grant from the Virginia Commission for the Arts to attend the Bookworks '82 Conference held at the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, \"a meeting for artists, writers, and publishers of small and unique editions.\" Also attending Bookworks '82 as panelists were Bruce Schnabel, an RPW bookbinding instructor, and Janet Dalberto of the Special Collections Department of Virginia Commonwealth University's Cabell Library. Richmond representatives to Bookworks '82 viewed an exhibition by the Philadelphia Print Club of one-of-a-kind (i.e. one/off) books, many of handmade paper.\n\nWalter Hamady of the University of Wisconsin lectured at Bookworks '82 about handmade paper and described his studio near Madison, Wisconsin. During the conference, the Helen Drutt Gallery featured Bruce Schnabel's one-of-a-kind books. The \"Print Club Newsletter\" related that \"one of the best by-products of the meeting was the opportunity to meet and exchange information with others involved in book art.\"\n\nThe same year, the RPW in Richmond was visited by the National Endowment for the Arts to consider funding. The \"Print Club Newsletter\" stated that the people the NEA sends \"are usually professionals from similar areas of pursuit as the organization hosting the visit, and they are always from a different part of the country to avoid partiality. They receive payment only for their expenses.\" The RPW was visited by Sheila levrant de Bretteville of the Communications Art Department at the Otis Parsons Institute in Los Angeles. Also during this time, the commissioners of the Virginia Commission for the Arts visited 1708 Gallery and the\nRichmond Printmaking Workshop, and a fundraising Octoberfest and Holiday Open House was led by Board member Joe Seipel, the Texas Wisconsin Border Café, and Board president Cynthia Schaal to support both 1708 and the Richmond Printmaking Workshop. The announcement for the open house was printed on the RPW's Chandler press with moveable type recently donated by Walter Garde, Jr.\nBy the time the Richmond Printmaking Workshop closed its doors, the One/Off Printmakers group of professional printmakers had already begun, drawing from the RPW Print Club and building on the experience and leadership of RPW founder Nancy David and former RPW directors Laura Pharis and Mary Holland. At its beginnings, almost every member of One/Off had at one time or another used the presses or participated as instructor or student in the workshops at the Richmond Printmaking Workshop.\n\nIn 2016 ONE/OFF Printmaker Jack Glover received the Theresa Pollak award for excellence in the arts from Richmond Magazine.\n\nOne of One/Off's first exhibitions was at Reynolds Minor Gallery when that gallery was on Franklin Street in Richmond.\nIn 2002 members of One/Off exhibited a group show at Artspace Gallery on Broad Street in Richmond, Virginia and also participated in an Art-o-mat vintage cigarette vending machine installation at Artspace with small cellophane-wrapped art in simulated cigarette packs weighted to dispense in the vintage machine with a purchased $5 token. The concept of old cigarette machines vending art was the original idea of Clark Whittington and his group \"Artists in Cellophane\". \n\nOver the years, some of the One/Off participating artists were David Freed, Barbara Tisserat, Kelly Nelson, Aijung Kim, Chris Palmer, Walter Garde, Mitzi Humphrey, Mary Holland, Laura Pharis, Paula Nottingham, Peter Calvert, Anne Chenoweth, Warren Corrado, Nick Cossitt, Janet DeCover, Nancy David, Don Earley, Steven Fishman, Kris Iden, Jim Nottingham, Mel Paca, Jack Glover, Tucker Hill, Tanja Softic, Dawn Latané, Carolyn Sharp, Kate Horne, Randy Toy, Suzanne Fortin, Philip Wetton, Joan Gaustad, Ronnie Sampson and Janet Gilmore Bryant.\n\nIn 2005 a ONE/OFF Printmakers' exhibition of members' art was at Main Art Gallery on Main Street in Richmond, Virginia, and another group show that year was at Middle Street Gallery in Washington, Virginia. The group presented a print show in 2007 in the large\nexhibition area of the Montpelier Art Center, Montpelier, Virginia.\n\nIn 2008 One/Off Printmakers celebrated the 25th anniversary of the organization with an exhibition at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School gallery. In 2009 the group again showed at Middle Street Gallery in Washington, Virginia.\n\nOn loan from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts collection, One/Off Printmakers showed \"Three One/Off Portfolios\" at Art6 Gallery in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThirteen artists of One/Off Printmakers were featured in the front gallery of Chroma Projects in Charlottesville, Virginia, with a Charlottesville First Friday opening reception.\n\nIn 2012, as the group approached its 30th anniversary, One/Off Printmakers was given a celebratory opening reception and exhibition at the newly opened Studio Two Three on Main Street in Richmond. In 2013, One/Off Printmakers presented a show at Rivermont Studio in Lynchburg, Virginia. \n\nThe gallery at the Inn at Little Washington in Washington, Virginia was the site for a One/Off Members' print exhibition on several occasions. \n\"One/Off Printmakers: 8 x 10\" was a suite of members' prints exhibited at the Pauley Center (formerly the historic Virginia Home for Confederate Widows) of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. Following the exhibition at the Pauley Center, this suite of prints traveled around the state of Virginia as part of \"Old Dominion/New Perspectives\", a series of exhibitions focusing on the American South, sponsored by the VMFA.\n\nAt Richmond's Hill Gallery in 2015, One/Off Printmakers exhibited etchings, monoprints, woodcuts, and silk screen prints.\nIn 2016, a One/Off exhibition curated by Dennis Winston and Eric Walton was shown at Walton Gallery in Petersburg, Virginia.\nIn 2016, A One/Off Printmakers memorial exhibition in honor of Janet DeCover was featured in the 1708 Gallery satellite exhibition space at Richmond's Linden Row Inn.\n\nInternational group exhibitions for One/Off Printmakers include: Galleria, St. Punto A, Milano, Italy; \nICPNA, Lima, Peru, Exhibition, Instituto Cultural Peruano Norte Americano, Lima, Peru 1999; Atelier Circulaire, Montreal, Quebec. One/Off Printmakers is on Facebook.\n\nSome of the print portfolios produced by One/Off Printmakers were \"The Beastiary Portfolio\",\n\"The Abstract Portfolio\", \n\"The Landscape Portfolio\" , \"One/Off Printmakers 8 x 10\", and a memorial portfolio in honor of Richmond Printmaking Workshop founder Nancy David. The One/Off Printmakers porfolios are in the collection of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and various private collections.\n"}
{"id": "23313913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23313913", "title": "Pantomimeteatret", "text": "Pantomimeteatret\n\nThe Pantomime Theatre () is an open-air theatre located in the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark. As indicated by the name, it is primarily used for pantomime theatre in the classical Italian commedia dell'arte tradition which is performed daily. Besides this original function, the theatre leads a second life as a venue for ballet and modern dance.\n\nWhen the Tivoli Gardens first opened in 1874, a small theatre was already found at the site of the current building just inside the main entrance. It was made out of timber and painted canvas and after a series of rebuilding and major repairs, it was finally decided to replace it with a more up-to-date building in 1873. The architect Vilhelm Dahlerup, at that time working on the design of the Royal Danish Theatre was commissioned to make a proposal and the year after in 1874, the same year as the Royal Theatre, the present Peacock Theatre in Chinese style was inaugurated. Dahlerup had never been to China but he sought inspiration from pictures of buildings, borrowed from an engineer who had been stationed in the Far East. The technical side of the project was constructed by the theatre's director and Pierrot Niels Hendrik Volkersen and timber and assistance with the cordage was obtained from the Holmen naval base.\n\nIt is a toy-like Historicist theatre built in Chinese style and noted for its mechanical front curtain that takes five men to operate and unfolds like a peacock-s tail.\n\nThe repertoire consists of a mixture of traditional pantomimes, ballet performances and contemporary and more experimental performances.\n\nThe pantomime tradition of the theatre is a mixture of many elements that are apparently quite unrelated. When the peacock folds down its wings, the stage is obviously set somewhere in old Copenhagen, at the home of stodgy Cassander who lives alone with his beautiful daughter, Columbine. It remains unclear what has happened to her mother. Cassander is assisted by his servant, Pierrot, who has a white face like the clown he really is. And Cassander’s adversary with whom he is constantly struggling is Harlequin – a charming, masked scoundrel with little money to his name but who is deeply in love with Columbine and often well-connected to a friendly sorcerer or fairy.\n\nLike the characters, the music comes from many different sources. It includes Strauss, Mozart and Gounod – and, needless to say, lots of music by H. C. Lumbye, Tivoli’s in-house composer at one time. The music has been selected to underpin the plot and movements of each pantomime.\n\nThe programme also include ballet performances, including examples of the distinctive Danish Bournonville style and modern dance. HM Queen Magrethe created costumes and scenography several times, including for ballets based on Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Match Girl\" and \"The Swineherd\" in 2007 and 2009. Choreographers who have created works for the Pantomimeteatret include Dinna Bjørn, Louise Midjord, Paul James Rooney and Ian Rowe.\n\nSince 2003 the programme has also involved more contemporary genre like jazz dance and hip hop pantomimes.\n\nArtists who have worked with the Pantomime Theatre include:\n\nAnnett Ahrends and Henrik Lyding, \"The Pantomime Theatre - the life behind the Peacock Curtain in Tivoli\", Forlaget Vandkunsten, 2008 (text in English and Danish and photographs by Annett Ahrends)\n\nTivoli Gardens\n"}
{"id": "1848891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1848891", "title": "Paper craft", "text": "Paper craft\n\nPaper craft is the collection of art forms employing paper or card as the primary artistic medium for the creation of three-dimensional objects. It is the most widely used material in arts and crafts. It lends itself to a wide range of techniques, as it can for instance be folded, cut, glued, molded, stitched, or layered. Papermaking by hand is also an important paper craft. Painting and calligraphy though they are commonly applied as decoration are normally considered as separate arts or crafts.\n\nPaper crafts are known in most societies that use paper, with certain kinds of crafts being particularly associated with specific countries or cultures. In Caribbean countries paper craft is unique to Caribbean culture which reflect the importance of native animals in life of people. \n\nIn addition to the aesthetic value of paper crafts, various forms of paper crafts are used in the education of children. Paper is a relatively inexpensive medium, readily available, and easier to work with than the more complicated media typically used in the creation of three-dimensional artwork, such as ceramics, wood, and metals. It is also neater to work with than paints, dyes, and other coloring materials. Paper crafts may also be used in therapeutic settings, providing children with a safe and uncomplicated creative outlet to express feelings.\n\nThe word \"paper\" derives from papyrus, the name of the ancient material manufactured from beaten reeds in Egypt as far back as the third millennium B.C. Indeed, the earliest known example of \"paper folding\" is an ancient Egyptian map, drawn on papyrus and folded into rectangular forms like a modern road map. However, it does not appear that intricate paper folding as an art form became possible until the introduction of wood-pulp based papers. \n\nThe first Japanese origami is dated from the 6th century A.D. In much of the West, the term origami is used synonymously with paper folding, though the term properly only refers to the art of paper folding in Japan. Other forms of paper folding include Zhezhi (Chinese paper folding), Jong-i.e.-jeop-gi, from Korea, and Western paper folding, such as the traditional paper boats and paper planes.\n\nPapel picado, as practiced in Mexico and other places in Latin America is done using chisels to cut 50 to a hundred sheets at a time, while Chinese paper cutting uses knives or scissors for up to 8 sheets. Wycinanki and other European forms usually are done on one single sheet. In either of these traditions, paper sheets are folded prior to cutting to achieve symmetrical designs.\n\nImages built using colored paper pulp are a form of paper art that started in the 20th century. Chuck Close, Lynn Sures are among contemporary artist developing this medium. Paper pulp craft is widely used in rural India for making kitchen utility baskets.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28013", "title": "Silicon Graphics", "text": "Silicon Graphics\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc. (later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing computer hardware and software. Founded in Mountain View, California in November 1981 by Jim Clark, its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.\n\nEarly systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University, and were derived from Clark's broader background in computer graphics. The Geometry Engine was the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a \"geometry pipeline\", specialized hardware that accelerated the \"inner-loop\" geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.\n\nSilicon Graphics reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity Wintel machines began to erode SGI's stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of Maya to other platforms is a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing MIPS platforms to the Intel Itanium, as well as introducing their own Linux-based Intel IA-32 based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor, a move that also failed.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems, a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name \"Silicon Graphics International\". The remains of Silicon Graphics, Inc. became Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.\n\nJames H. Clark left his position as an electrical engineering associate professor at Stanford University to found SGI in 1982 along with a group of seven graduate students and research staff from Stanford: Kurt Akeley, David J. Brown, Tom Davis, Rocky Rhodes, Marc Hannah, Herb Kuta, and Mark Grossman; along with Abbey Silverstone and a few others.\n\nEd McCracken was CEO of Silicon Graphics from 1984 to 1997. During those years, SGI grew from annual revenues of $5.4 million to $3.7 billion.\n\nThe addition of 3D graphic capabilities to PCs, and the ability of clusters of Linux- and BSD-based PCs to take on many of the tasks of larger SGI servers, ate into SGI's core markets. The porting of Maya to Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows further eroded the low end of SGI's product line.\n\nIn response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price Ed McCracken was fired and SGI brought in Richard Belluzzo to replace him. Under Belluzzo's leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline.\n\nOne such initiative was trying to sell workstations running Windows NT called Visual Workstations instead of just ones which ran IRIX, the company's version of UNIX. This put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Dell, making it more difficult to justify a price premium. The product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later.\n\nSGI's premature announcement of its migration from MIPS to Itanium and its abortive ventures into IA-32 architecture systems (the Visual Workstation line, the ex-Intergraph Zx10 range and the SGI 1000-series Linux servers) damaged SGI's credibility in the market.\n\nIn 1999, in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company, Silicon Graphics Inc. changed its corporate identity to \"SGI\", although its legal name was unchanged.\n\nAt the same time, SGI announced a new logo consisting of only the letters \"sgi\" in a proprietary font called \"SGI\", created by branding and design consulting firm Landor Associates, in collaboration with designer Joe Stitzlein. SGI continued to use the \"Silicon Graphics\" name for its workstation product line, and later re-adopted the cube logo for some workstation models.\n\nIn November 2005, SGI announced that it had been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange. SGI's market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in 1995 to just $120 million at the time of delisting. In February 2006, SGI noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year.\n\nIn mid-2005, SGI hired Alix Partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit. SGI announced it was postponing its scheduled annual December stockholders meeting until March 2006. It proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn January 2006, SGI hired Dennis McKenna as its new CEO and chairman of the board of directors. Mr. McKenna succeeded Robert Bishop, who remained vice chairman of the board of directors.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, SGI announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for itself and U.S. subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by $250 million. Two days later, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved its first day motions and its use of a $70 million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders. Foreign subsidiaries were unaffected.\n\nOn September 6, 2006, SGI announced the end of development for the MIPS/IRIX line and the IRIX operating system. Production would end on December 29 and the last orders would be fulfilled by March 2007. Support for these products would end after December 2013.\n\nSGI emerged from bankruptcy protection on October 17, 2006. Its stock symbol at that point, \"SGID.pk\", was canceled, and new stock was issued on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol \"SGIC\". This new stock was distributed to the company's creditors, and the SGID common stockholders were left with worthless shares. At the end of that year, the company moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale. Its earlier North Shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the Computer History Museum; the newer Amphitheater Parkway headquarters was sold to Google. Both of these locations were award-winning designs by Studios Architecture.\n\nIn April 2008, SGI re-entered the visualization market with the SGI Virtu range of visualization servers and workstations, which were re-badged systems from BOXX Technologies based on Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron processors and Nvidia Quadro graphics chipsets, running Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Windows Compute Cluster Server.\n\nIn December 2008, SGI received a delisting notification from NASDAQ, as its market value had been below the minimum $35 million requirement for 10 consecutive trading days, and also did not meet NASDAQ's alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders' equity of $2.5 million or annual net income from continuing operations of $500,000 or more.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 again, and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems for $25 million. The sale, ultimately for $42.5 million, was finalized on May 11, 2009; at the same time, Rackable announced their adoption of \"Silicon Graphics International\" as their global name and brand. The Bankruptcy court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for June 3 and 24, 2009, and July 22, 2009.\n\nAfter the Rackable acquisition, \"Vizworld\" magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of SGI.\n\nDuring the Silicon Graphics Inc.'s second bankruptcy phase, it was renamed to Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.(GPHI) in June 2009.\n\nIn 2010, GPHI announced it had won a significant favorable ruling in its litigation with ATI Technologies and AMD in June 2010, following the patent lawsuit originally filed during the Silicon Graphics, Inc. era. Following the 2008 appeal by ATI over the validity of ('327) and Silicon Graphics Inc's voluntary dismissal of the ('376) patent from the lawsuit, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of GPHI's U.S. Patent No. 6,650,327, and furthermore found that AMD had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings. On January 31, 2011, the District Court entered an order that permits AMD to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit SGI to accuse AMD's Radeon R700 series of graphics products of infringement in this case. On April 18, 2011, GPHI and AMD had entered into a confidential Settlement and License Agreement that resolved this litigation matter for an immaterial amount and that provides immunity under all GPHI patents for alleged infringement by AMD products, including components, software and designs. On April 26, 2011, the Court entered an order granting the parties' agreed motion for dismissal and final judgment.\n\nIn 2011-11, GPHI filed another patent infringement lawsuit against Apple Inc. in Delaware involving more patents than their original patent infringement case against Apple last November, for alleged violation of U.S. patents 6,650,327 ('327), ('145) and ('881).\n\nIn 2012, the GPHI filed lawsuit against Apple, Sony, HTC Corp, LG Electronics Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Research in Motion Ltd. for allegedly violating patent relating to a computer graphics process that turns text and images into pixels to be displayed on screens. Affected devices include Apple iPhone, HTC EVO4G, LG Thrill, Research in Motion Torch, Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, and Sony Xperia Play smartphones.\n\n\nSGI's first generation products, starting with the IRIS (Integrated Raster Imaging System) 1000 series of high-performance graphics terminals, were based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors. The later IRIS 2000 and 3000 models developed into full UNIX workstations.\n\nThe first entries in the 1000 series (models 1000 and 1200, introduced in 1984) were graphics terminals, peripherals to be connected to a general-purpose computer such as a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, to provide graphical raster display abilities. They used 8 MHz Motorola 68000 CPUs with of RAM and had no disk drives. They booted over the network (via an Excelan EXOS/101 Ethernet card) from their controlling computer. They used the \"PM1\" CPU board, which was a variant of the board that was used in Stanford University's SUN workstation and later in the Sun-1 workstation from Sun Microsystems. The graphics system was composed of the GF1 frame buffer, the UC3 \"Update Controller\", DC3 \"Display Controller\", and the BP2 bitplane. The 1000-series machines were designed around the Multibus standard.\n\nLater 1000-series machines, the 1400 and 1500, ran at 10 MHz and had 1.5 MB of RAM. The 1400 had a 73 MB ST-506 disk drive, while the 1500 had a 474 MB SMD-based disk drive with a Xylogics 450 disk controller. They may have used the PM2 CPU and PM2M1 RAM board from the 2000 series. The usual monitor for the 1000 series ran at 30 Hz interlaced. Six beta-test units of the 1400 workstation were produced, and the first production unit (SGI's first commercial computer) was shipped to Carnegie-Mellon University's Electronic Imaging Laboratory in 1984.\n\nSGI rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the IRIS 2000 series, first released in August 1985. SGI began using the UNIX System V operating system. There were five models in two product ranges, the 2000/2200/2300/2400/2500 range which used 68010 CPUs (the PM2 CPU module), and the later \"Turbo\" systems, the 2300T, 2400T and 2500T, which had 68020s (the IP2 CPU module). All used the Excelan EXOS/201 Ethernet card, the same graphics hardware (GF2 Frame Buffer, UC4 Update Controller, DC4 Display Controller, BP3 Bitplane). Their main differences were the CPU, RAM, and Weitek Floating Point Accelerator boards, disk controllers and disk drives (both ST-506 and SMD were available). These could be upgraded, for example from a 2400 to a 2400T. The 2500 and 2500T had a larger chassis, a standard 6' 19\" EIA rack with space at the bottom for two SMD disk drives weighing approximately each. The non-Turbo models used the Multibus for the CPU to communicate with the floating point accelerator, while the Turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this. 60 Hz monitors were used for the 2000 series.\n\nThe height of the machines using Motorola CPUs was reached with the IRIS 3000 series (models 3010/3020/3030 and 3110/3115/3120/3130, the 30s both being full-size rack machines). They used the same graphics subsystem and Ethernet as the 2000s, but could also use up to 12 \"geometry engines\", the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators. The standard monitor was a 19\" 60 Hz non-interlaced unit with a tilt/swivel base; 19\" 30 Hz interlaced and a 15\" 60 Hz non-interlaced (with tilt/swivel base) were also available.\n\nThe IRIS 3130 and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time, being complete UNIX workstations. The 3130 was powerful enough to support a complete 3D animation and rendering package without mainframe support. With large capacity hard drives by standards of the day (two 300 MB drives), streaming tape and Ethernet, it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation.\n\nThe line was formally discontinued in November 1989, with about 3500 systems shipped of all 2000 and 3000 models combined.\n\nWith the introduction of the IRIS 4D series, SGI switched to MIPS microprocessors. These machines were more powerful and came with powerful on-board floating-point capability. As 3D graphics became more popular in television and film during this time, these systems were responsible for establishing much of SGI's reputation.\n\nSGI produced a broad range of MIPS-based workstations and servers during the 1990s, running SGI's version of UNIX System V, now called IRIX. These included the massive Onyx visualization systems, the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to 64 processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution, fully realized 3D graphics.\n\nIn October 1991, MIPS announced the first commercially available 64-bit microprocessor, the R4000. SGI used the R4000 in its Crimson workstation. IRIX 6.2 was the first fully 64-bit IRIX release, including 64-bit pointers.\n\nTo secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit R4000), SGI acquired the company in 1992 for $333 million and renamed it as MIPS Technologies Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGI.\n\nIn 1993, Silicon Graphics (SGI) signed a deal with Nintendo to develop the CPU used in the Nintendo 64, a derivative of the R4300i microprocessor. Though the deal was signed in early 1993, it was not made public until August of that year, and the console itself would not be released until 1996.\n\nIn 1998, SGI relinquished some ownership of MIPS Technologies, Inc in a Re-IPO, and fully divested itself in 2000.\n\nIn the late 1990s, when much of the industry expected the Itanium to replace both CISC and RISC architectures in non-embedded computers, SGI announced their intent to phase out MIPS in their systems. Development of new MIPS microprocessors stopped, and the existing R12000 design was extended multiple times until 2003 to provide existing customers more time to migrate to Itanium.\n\nIn August 2006, SGI announced the end of production for MIPS/IRIX systems, and by the end of the year MIPS/IRIX products were no longer generally available from SGI.\n\nUntil the second generation Onyx Reality Engine machines, SGI offered access to its high performance 3D graphics subsystems through a proprietary API known as \"IRIS Graphics Language\" (IRIS GL). As more features were added over the years, IRIS GL became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use. In 1992, SGI decided to clean up and reform IRIS GL and made the bold move of allowing the resulting OpenGL API to be cheaply licensed by SGI's competitors, and set up an industry-wide consortium to maintain the OpenGL standard (the OpenGL Architecture Review Board).\n\nThis meant that for the first time, fast, efficient, cross-platform graphics programs could be written. To this day, OpenGL remains the only real-time 3D graphics standard to be portable across a variety of operating systems. OpenGL-ES even runs on many types of cell phones. Its main competitor (Direct3D from Microsoft) runs only on Microsoft Windows-based machines and some consoles.\n\nSGI was part of the Advanced Computing Environment initiative, formed in the early 1990s with 20 other companies, including Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, MIPS Computer Systems, Groupe Bull, Siemens, NEC, NeTpower, Microsoft and Santa Cruz Operation. Its intent was to introduce workstations based on the MIPS architecture and able to run Windows NT and SCO UNIX. The group produced the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification, but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation.\n\nAn SGI Crimson system with the fsn three-dimensional file system navigator appeared in the 1993 movie \"Jurassic Park\".\n\nIn the movie \"Twister\", protagonists can be seen using an SGI laptop computer, however the unit shown was not an actual working computer, but rather a fake laptop shell built around an SGI Corona LCD flat screen display.\n\nThe 1995 film \"Congo\" also features an SGI laptop computer being used by Dr. Ross (Laura Linney) to communicate via satellite to TraviCom HQ.\n\nThe purple, lowercased \"sgi\" logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the HBO series \"Silicon Valley\", before being taken down and replaced by the Google logo as the intro graphics progress. Google leased the former SGI buildings in 2003 for their headquarters in Mountain View, CA until they purchased the buildings outright in 2006.\n\nFor eight consecutive years (1995–2002), all films nominated for an Academy Award for Distinguished Achievement in Visual Effects were created on Silicon Graphics computer systems.\n\nOnce inexpensive PCs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were SGI's core business, SGI shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the Web. Many SGI graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as ATI and Nvidia, contributing to the PC 3D graphics revolution.\n\nSGI was a promoter of free software, supporting several projects such as Linux and Samba, and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the XFS filesystem and the Open64 compiler.\n\nIn 1995, SGI purchased Alias Research, Kroyer Films, and Wavefront Technologies in a deal totaling approximately $500 million and merged the companies into Alias|Wavefront. In June 2004 SGI sold the business, later renamed to Alias/Wavefront, to the private equity investment firm Accel-KKR for $57.1 million. In October 2005, Autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias for $182 million in cash.\n\nIn February 1996, SGI purchased the well-known supercomputer manufacturer Cray Research for $740 million, and began to use marketing names such as \"CrayLink\" for (SGI-developed) technology integrated into the SGI server line. Three months later, it sold Cray's Business Systems Division, responsible for the CS6400 SPARC/Solaris server, to Sun Microsystems for an undisclosed amount (widely believed to be $50 million). Many of the Cray T3E engineers designed and developed the SGI Altix and NUMAlink technology. SGI sold the Cray brand and product lines to Tera Computer Company on March 31, 2000 for $35 million plus one million shares. SGI also distributed its remaining interest in MIPS Technologies through a spin-off effective June 20, 2000.\n\nIn September 2000, SGI acquired the Zx10 series of Windows workstations and servers from Intergraph Computer Systems (for a rumored $100 million). These models were rebadged as SGI systems, but discontinued in June 2001.\n\nAnother attempt by SGI in the late 1990s to introduce its own family of Intel-based workstations running Windows NT or Red Hat Linux (see also SGI Visual Workstation) proved to be a financial disaster, and shook customer confidence in SGI’s commitment to its own MIPS-based line.\n\nIn 1998, SGI announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own MIPS processors, but the upcoming \"super-chip\" from Intel, code-named \"Merced\" and later called Itanium. Funding for its own high-end processors was reduced, and it was planned that the R10000 would be the last MIPS mainstream processor. MIPS Technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market, where it was having some success, and SGI would no longer have to fund development of a CPU that, since the failure of ARC, found use only in their own machines. This plan quickly went awry. As early as 1999 it was clear the Itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected. As the production delays increased, MIPS' existing R10000-based machines grew increasingly uncompetitive. Eventually it was forced to introduce faster MIPS processors, the R12000, R14000 and R16000, which were used in a series of models from 2002 through 2006.\n\nSGI's first Itanium-based system was the short-lived SGI 750 workstation, launched in 2001. SGI's MIPS-based systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the Itanium 2-based Altix servers and Prism workstations some time later. Unlike the MIPS systems, which ran IRIX, the Itanium systems used SuSE Linux Enterprise Server with SGI enhancements as their operating system. SGI used Transitive Corporation's QuickTransit software to allow their old MIPS/IRIX applications to run (in emulation) on the new Itanium/Linux platform.\n\nIn the server market the Itanium 2-based Altix eventually replaced the MIPS-based Origin product line. In the workstation market, the switch to Itanium was not completed before SGI exited the market.\n\nThe Altix was the most powerful computer in the world in 2006, assuming that a \"computer\" is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system. The Altix had 512 Itanium processors running under a single instance of Linux. A cluster of 20 machines was then the eighth-fastest supercomputer. All faster supercomputers were clusters, but none have as many FLOPS per machine. However, more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable. SGI acknowledged this and in 2007 moved away from the \"massive NUMA\" model to clusters.\n\nAlthough SGI continued to market Itanium-based machines, its more recent machines were based on the Intel Xeon processor. The first Altix XE systems were relatively low-end machines, but by December 2006 the XE systems were more capable than the Itanium machines by some measures (e.g., power consumption in FLOPS/W, density in FLOPS/m, cost/FLOPS). The XE1200 and XE1300 servers used a cluster architecture. This was a departure from the pure NUMA architectures of the earlier Itanium and MIPS servers.\n\nIn June 2007, SGI announced the Altix ICE 8200, a blade-based Xeon system with up to 512 Xeon cores per rack. An Altix ICE 8200 installed at New Mexico Computing Applications Center (with 14336 processors) ranked at number 3 on the TOP500 list of November 2007.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that SGI's core market has traditionally been Hollywood visual effects studios. In fact, SGI's largest revenue has always been generated by government and defense applications, energy, and scientific and technical computing. In one case Silicon Graphics largest single sale ever was to the United States Postal Services (USPS). SGI's servers powered an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Program to mechanically read, tag and sort the mail (hand-written and block) at a number of USPS's key mail centers. The rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, and the availability of diverse professional software for them, effectively pushed SGI out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets.\n\nSGI continued to enhance its line of servers (including some supercomputers) based on the SN architecture. SN, for Scalable Node, is a technology developed by SGI in the mid-1990s that uses cache-coherent non-uniform memory access (cc-NUMA). In an SN system, processors, memory, and a bus- and memory-controller are coupled together into an entity called a node, usually on a single circuit board. Nodes are connected by a high-speed interconnect called NUMAlink (originally marketed as CrayLink). There is no internal bus, and instead access between processors, memory, and I/O devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers.\n\nThanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory, SN systems scale along several axes at once: as CPU count increases, so does memory capacity, I/O capacity, and system bisection bandwidth. This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single OS image using standard shared-memory synchronization methods. This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained-to-peak performance than non-cache-coherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written (or re-written) to do explicit message-passing communication between their nodes.\n\nThe first SN system, known as SN-0, was released in 1996 under the product name Origin 2000. Based on the MIPS R10000 processor, it scaled from 2 to 128 processors and a smaller version, the Origin 200 (SN-00), scaled from 1 to 4. Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as 512 processors.\n\nThe second generation system, originally called SN-1 but later SN-MIPS, was released in July 2000, as the Origin 3000. It scaled from 4 to 512 processors, and 1,024-processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers. A smaller, less scalable implementation followed, called Origin 300.\n\nIn November 2002, SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system, under the name Origin 3900. It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN-MIPS system, from 32 up to 128 processors per rack while moving to a \"fat tree\" interconnect topology.\n\nIn January 2003, SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the Altix 3000 (internally called SN-IA). It used Intel Itanium 2 processors and ran the Linux operating system kernel. At the time it was released, it was the world's most scalable Linux-based computer, supporting up to 64 processors in a single system node. Nodes could be connected using the same NUMAlink technology to form what SGI predictably termed \"superclusters\".\n\nIn February 2004, SGI announced general support for 128 processor nodes to be followed by 256 and 512 processor versions that year.\n\nIn April 2004, SGI announced the sale of its Alias software business for approximately $57 million.\n\nIn October 2004, SGI built the supercomputer Columbia, which broke the world record for computer speed, for the NASA Ames Research Center. It was a cluster of 20 Altix supercomputers each with 512 Intel Itanium 2 processors running Linux, and achieved sustained speed of 42.7 trillion floating-point operations per second (teraflops), easily topping Japan's famed Earth Simulator's record of 35.86 teraflops. (A week later, IBM's upgraded Blue Gene/L clocked in at 70.7 teraflops).\n\nIn July 2006, SGI announced an SGI Altix 4700 system with 1,024 processors and 4 TB of memory running a single Linux system image.\n\nSome 68k and MIPS-based models were also rebadged by other vendors, including CDC, Tandem Computers, Prime Computer and Siemens-Nixdorf.\nSGI Onyx and SGI Indy series systems were used for game development for the Nintendo 64.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24226198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24226198", "title": "Special effects supervisor", "text": "Special effects supervisor\n\nA special effects supervisor (also referred to as a special effects coordinator or SFX Supervisor) is an individual who works on a commercial, theater, television or film set creating special effects. The supervisor generally is the department head who defers to the film's director and/or producers, and who is in charge of the entire special effects team. Special effects include anything that is manual or mechanically manipulated (also called \"practical effects\" or in camera effects). This may include the use of mechanized props, special effects makeup, props, scenery, scale models, pyrotechnics and atmospheric effects: creating physical wind, rain, fog, snow, clouds etc.\n\nSpecial effects (SFX) or (SPFX) are produced on the set, as opposed to those created in post-production which are generally called \"visual effects\" (VFX). In recent years real physical special effects have been increasingly overshadowed by computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects created in post-production.\"\n\nSome examples of special effects are explosions, car crashes and chases, gunshots, earthquake effects, special makeup, prosthetics, special set construction, snow and rain.\n\nSpecial Effects Technician is a person working in the special effects department, under the special effects supervisor, and he is responsible for creating and assisting special effects. Major motion pictures, with many special effects many have many special effects technicians.\n\nA special effects supervisor has to ensure the safety of his/her crew and everyone else on set. Before the cameras start rolling, local officials may step onto set and perform inspections, so knowledge of the law and safety protocols helps when using explosives and firearms during the production process. Specific education programs are recommended for one to gain high awareness in health and safety. Other training in various fields such as handling explosives, firearms, high voltage and other hazardous material and equipment helps. One should be familiar with all the necessary equipment such as wind, snow, fog, fire and rain machines, as well as dummies and body parts. On set, the supervisor is the one in charge of setting up and operating these gears. Creativity and imagination plays a big role in this occupation, for he/she is the one responsible to see the big picture of the script and know when and how a special effect should be implemented. He/she should have the ability to visualize how things will appear ‘on screen.’ Strong communication skills and presentation skills are an asset because being able to show such skills during the interview process proves personal responsibility and willing to collaborate with others. As well, the head of the entire special effects team works closely with the production designer and art director. The supervisor plans a special effects scene and presents it to the director, in hope that he/she will be pleased with the results. Experience in photography may be an advantage in this job because as the supervisor, he/she has to plan the camera angles when shooting special effects scenes. Starting young allows one to absorb all the information and experience you can get and applying them to become a special effects artist.\n\nEntry into this career path is competitive. There are various paths that one can take in order to become a special effects supervisor. People with animation, computer science, and industrial design backgrounds are seen. A formal education, particularly in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering is suggested. Some enter into this profession with a degree in film and television production, which is useful. Some students may specialize in fine art or sculpture, which may enhance their techniques to apply to special effects careers in modeling, illustration, animation and much more. Being good with computer software saves a company time and money to invest in training their new employees. Modern special effects tend to be computer generated nowadays, blending physical techniques and digital tricks. Taking classes related to computer graphics gives people insight on computer animation software that he/she may come into contact with. Several years of employment experience at the junior level is necessary before one takes on this senior-level role as a supervisor. Special effects are a form of science, so courses in Chemistry, Physics and Biology are recommended. To have an understanding in advanced mathematics allows preparing the department budget and crew scheduling easier. Education in any of these fields gives a person valuable experience that he/she may be able to apply to their career.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51621668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51621668", "title": "Susan Borowitz", "text": "Susan Borowitz\n\nSusan Stevenson Borowitz is an American writer and producer. She is best known for her work on \"Family Ties, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Aliens in the Family\", and \"Pleasantville\"\".\" During her marriage to writer and comedian, Andy Borowitz (1982–2005), the two co-created \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\" This series ran from 1990–1996 and led to Will Smith's stardom. It won NAACP's Image Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993. In addition, Susan and Andy co-created and produced many other television situation comedies. Susan is the author of the comedic novel, \"When We’re in Public, Pretend You Don’t Know Me: Surviving Your Daughter's Adolescence So You Don't Look Like an Idiot and She Still Talks to You,\" published in 2003.\n\nSusan Stevenson was born on March 6, 1959 in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania. She knew from a young age that she was passionate about writing and story creation. Both her parents, Robert Large Stevenson and Norma Willis Stevenson, were artists. As a result, there were many art artifacts scattered throughout Susan's family home. Growing up, she would often work on art projects, which later turned into illustrations in the form of books that she ultimately used to tell a story. During her years in school, the written word became her story-telling medium of choice, although she did still enjoy drawing as a form of stress relief. During her time in Hollywood, she still focused on visual arts to relieve her stress. However, this time she shifted her focus on sewing and creating formal wear for her new Hollywood lifestyle.\n\nSusan graduated from Harvard University, class of 1981 with a bachelor's degree in English Literature. At Harvard, Susan further explored her interest in writing and believed she potentially wanted a career out of it. She hoped to exercise her writing in humor, which she favored, and did so by becoming an editor of the \"Harvard Lampoon\". One of her articles has made it into the book, \"The Best of the Harvard Lampoon: 140 Years of American Humor\" which includes passages from many Hollywood comedy writers before their careers took off. Eventually, writing for the \"Harvard Lampoon\" inspired her to branch out and write comedy as her career. She began freelance writing for a few years, then made her way to the Hollywood realm of comedic writing.\n\nHer first big hit was her work on the popular sitcom, \"Family Ties\" (1982–1989). In four years, Susan worked her way from story editor up to producer. Borowitz attributes her success and learning of the sitcom production trade to her mentor, Gary David Goldberg (the creator of \"Family Ties\"). She learned many things behind the scenes, such as directing and editing, but also the importance of set design and the visual factors that tie together to create a successful show. She used these learned skills to help her write, produce, and co-create \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" with her husband at the time, Andy Borowitz.\n\n\"Family Ties\" ran from 1982-1989. It was a situational comedy about Steven and Elyse Keaton, previous hippies in the 60's, who were attempting to raise their family in a normal suburban area. Their oldest child, played by Michael J. Fox, had different views from their own. He was conservative, in contrast to his radical liberal parents. The series starred Michael J. Fox, Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter and won many awards including Golden Globes and Emmys.\n\n\"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" was an instant hit and won many awards for its comedy aspects. In addition to its 1993 NAACP's Image Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, it also won the Top TV Series at the ASCAP Film and Television Awards in 1994, in addition to many others. Rapper at the time, Will Smith, who went by \"The Fresh Prince\" kick-started his acting career by starring in the sitcom. Andy and Susan Borowitz wanted to relate Will's character as much to his personal life as possible. The show not only focused on comedy, but also the life lessons of race, class, and family. The Borowitz's wanted to be sure to highlight the race issue of blacks at the time, which is what inspired them to create the show in the first place. They hired black writers and crew members in order to be accurate in their depictions. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air resulted in a change of pop culture with its popularity, influencing America on the vast lifestyles of all races. It also successfully started many careers for other African American people inspiring networks and writers to further incorporate lead stars as being African American.\n\n\"Out All Night\" was co-created by Susan Borowitz, Andy Borowitz and Rob Edwards. The Borowitz's were also executive producers. The series starred Patti LaBelle and ran on NBC from September 1992 to July 1993. LaBelle played a former singer who owned an L.A nightclub and the show focused on she managing \"Club Chelsea\" and her friends’ involvement in her life.\n\n\"Aliens in the Family\" was created and executively produced by Susan and Andy Borowitz. The ABC show premiered in March 1996 and ended in August 1996. It was about a human single father (Grant Thatcher) falling in love with an alien mother (Sophie Bold) and their journey of living a normal life on earth. Much of the comedic aspects in the sitcom stemmed from the physical appearance of the aliens and the interactions with the humans.\n\nBorowitz was a co-producer on the 1998 film, \"Pleasantville\". It starred Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire and encompassed their journey of going back in time trapped in a 1950s television show.\n\nSusan and Andy Borowitz had two children together, a daughter and a son. The family moved to New York City to raise the family, where Borowitz found it difficult to balance family while also maintain her job that was based 3,000 miles away. She decided to spend her time raising her children. In 2003, she wrote the book, \"When We’re in Public, Pretend You Don’t Know Me: Surviving Your Daughter's Adolescence So You Don't Look Like an Idiot and She Still Talks to You,\" in order to capture her daughter's adolescence and as an outlet for other suburban mothers dealing with similar struggles.\n\n\"When We’re in Public, Pretend You Don’t Know Me: Surviving Your Daughter's Adolescence So You Don't Look Like an Idiot and She Still Talks to You\" was Borowitz's first and only book thus far. In it, she encourages fellow mothers to be the UnCool mom in a comedic way. Much of the book consists of advice and inspiration to other moms in similar positions. She prompts them to be the adult in the relationship, and not necessarily the best friend that many teenagers prefer their mothers to be. It contains advice from child psychologist, Dr. Ava Siegler, as well as some of Borowitz's personal experiences in addition to experiences of other mothers.\n\nIn addition to these films and movies, Susan also wrote for various television shows such as E/R, Dreams, Webster, and Amanda's.\n"}

Starring Brian Dennehy and Chloe Webb, it was nominated for the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) award at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe American architect Stourley Kracklite has been commissioned to construct an exhibition in Rome dedicated to the architecture of Étienne-Louis Boullée. Doubts arise among his Italian colleagues about the legitimacy of Boullée among the pantheon of famed architects, perhaps because Boullée was an inspiration for Adolf Hitler's architect Albert Speer.\n\nTirelessly dedicated to the project, Kracklite's marriage deteriorates, along with his health. His social and physical decline corresponds to the decline of his idol Boullée, who until the 20th century was hardly known. \n\nKracklite becomes obsessed with the historical Caesar Augustus after hearing that Livia, his wife, supposedly poisoned him. Kracklite assumes that his own wife, Louisa, is trying to do the same because he is suffering increasing stomach pains.\n\nShe informs him that she is pregnant, and is sexually involved with the younger co-organiser of the exhibition. \n\nHe discovers that he has a stomach cancer and has not long to live. The film ends at opening ceremony, which Kracklite watches from a higher vantage point. Louisa gives birth to their child, and Kracklite jumps to his death.\n\nDirector Greenaway's visual technique heightens Kracklite's alienation. There are few close-up shots of the other actors beside Dennehy, who himself is dwarfed by the dominance of the Roman architecture surrounding him.\n\nGreenaway's trademark historical reenactments also compose a major theme: many visual images of the film appear to replicate major 18th-century works of art and architecture. In addition there are subtle references to Isaac Newton and the law of gravity, perhaps alluding to Kracklite's own inability to escape the physical laws of mortality.\n\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports 91% approval of \"The Belly of an Architect\" based on 11 reviews, though with an average rating of 6.5/10.\n\n"}
{"id": "805496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=805496", "title": "The Black Cauldron (film)", "text": "The Black Cauldron (film)\n\nThe Black Cauldron is a 1985 American animated adventure fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation in association with Silver Screen Partners II and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The 25th Disney animated feature film, it is loosely based on the first two books in \"The Chronicles of Prydain\" by Lloyd Alexander, a series of five novels that are, in turn, based on Welsh mythology.\n\nSet in the mythical land of Prydain during the Early Middle Ages, the film centers on the evil Horned King who hopes to secure an ancient magical cauldron that will aid him in his desire to conquer the world. He is opposed by a young pig keeper named Taran, the young princess Eilonwy, the bard Fflewddur Fflam, and a wild creature named Gurgi who seek to destroy the cauldron, to prevent the Horned King from ruling the world.\n\nThe film is directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich, who had directed Disney's previous animated film \"The Fox and the Hound\" in 1981, the first Disney animated film to be recorded in Dolby Stereo. It features the voices of Grant Bardsley, Susan Sheridan, Freddie Jones, Nigel Hawthorne, John Byner, and John Hurt. \n\nIt was the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating as well as the first Disney animated film to feature computer-generated imagery. The film was distributed theatrically through Buena Vista Distribution on July 24, 1985. With the budget of $44 million, it was the most expensive animated film ever made at the time. Earning $21.3 million domestically, it led to a loss for the studio, putting Walt Disney Feature Animation near bankruptcy. Due to its commercial failure, Disney did not release the film on home video until 1998.\n\nIn the land of Prydain, Taran is an \"assistant pig-keeper\" on the small farm of Caer Dallben, home of Dallben the Enchanter. Dallben learns that the Horned King is searching for a mystical relic known as the Black Cauldron, which is capable of creating an invincible army of undead warriors, the \"Cauldron-Born\". Dallben fears the Horned King may try to steal his pig Hen Wen, which has oracular powers, and use her to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by the Horned King's forces.\n\nTaran follows them to the Horned King's stronghold. Along the way, he encounters the small, pestering companion Gurgi, who joins Taran on his search. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics, Taran leaves the former to sneak into the castle and rescues Hen Wen, but although Hen Wen escapes from the castle, Taran is arrested and thrown into the dungeon. A fellow captive named Princess Eilonwy frees Taran as she is trying to make her own escape. In the catacombs beneath the castle, Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king, where Taran arms himself with the king's sword. It contains magic that allows him effectively to fight the Horned King's minions and so to fulfill his dream of heroism. Along with a third prisoner, the comical, middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are soon reunited with Gurgi. Upon discovering that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin companion Creeper to send the Gwythaints to follow Taran and bring him back alive.\n\nFollowing Hen Wen's trail, the four stumble into the underground kingdom of the Fair Folk who reveal that Hen Wen is under their protection. When the cheerful, elderly King Eidilleg reveals that he knows where the cauldron is, Taran resolves to go destroy it himself. Eilonwy, Fflewddur, and Gurgi agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man Doli is assigned to lead them to the Marshes of Morva while the Fair Folk agree to escort Hen Wen safely back to Caer Dallben. At the marshes they learn that the cauldron is held by three witches—the grasping Orddu, who acts as leader; the greedy Orgoch; and the more benevolent Orwen, who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight, which causes a frightened Doli to abandon the group. Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword, and he reluctantly agrees, although he knows that to yield it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal that the cauldron is indestructible, and that its power can only be broken by someone who climbs in under his own free will, which will kill him. Although Taran feels foolish for aspiring to destroy the cauldron alone, his companions show their belief in him; and it seems that Eilonwy and Taran will kiss. Suddenly, the celebration is interrupted by the Horned King's soldiers who have finally reached the marshes themselves. They seize the cauldron and arrest everyone but Gurgi, and take their prisoners back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world.\n\nGurgi manages to free the captives and Taran decides to cast himself into the cauldron, but Gurgi stops him and jumps into the cauldron himself. The undead army collapses. When the Horned King spots Taran at large, he infers the turn of events, says that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron; however, the cauldron's magic is out of control. It consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire and blood, trapping him in the cauldron as well as destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever. The three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. However, Taran has finally realized Gurgi's true friendship, and he persuades them to revive the wild thing in exchange for the cauldron, forcing him to give up his magical sword permanently. Fflewddur challenges the reluctant witches to demonstrate their powers by the revival, and upon hearing Fflewddur's remarks, the witches honor the request, restoring Gurgi back to life. After Gurgi is resurrected, he pushes Taran and Eilonwy into a kiss. The four friends then journey back to Caer Dallben where Dallben and Doli watch them in a vision created by Hen Wen, and Dallben finally praises Taran for his heroism despite the fact that he prefers to be a Pig-Boy.\n\n\nWalt Disney Productions optioned Lloyd Alexander's five-volume series in 1971, and pre-production work began in 1973 when the film rights to Alexander's books were finally obtained. According to Ollie Johnston, it was he and Frank Thomas that convinced the studio to produce the movie, and that if it had been done properly, it might be \"as good as \"Snow White\"\". Because of the numerous storylines and with over thirty characters in the original series, several story artists and animators worked on the development of the film throughout the 1970s, where it was originally slated for release in 1980. Veteran artist Mel Shaw created inspirational conceptual pastel sketches in which then-Disney CEO Ron W. Miller considered to be too advanced for the animators. Therefore, in August 1978, the studio pushed its release date back to Christmas 1984 due to the animators' inability of animating realistic human characters; its original release date would later be assumed by \"The Fox and the Hound\". During its development limbo, one of those writers was veteran storyboard artist Vance Gerry who was chosen to create beat storyboards that would outline the plot, action, and locations. Having set up the three principal characters, Gerry adapted the Horned King into a big-bellied Viking who had a red beard, fiery temper, and wore a steel helmet with two large horns. Desiring an experienced British screenwriter to write the screenplay, the studio signed Rosemary Anne Sisson onto the project.\n\nThe first director attached to the project was animator John Musker after he was proposed the job by production head Tom Wilhite. As director, Musker was assigned to expand several sequences in the first act, but they were eventually deemed too comedic. When production on \"The Fox and the Hound\" had wrapped, several feature animation directors Art Stevens, Richard Rich, Ted Berman, and Dave Michener became involved in \"The Black Cauldron\". When Miller decided too many people were involved, he decided Stevens was not appropriate to supervise the project so he contacted Joe Hale, who was a longtime layout artist at Disney Studios, to serve as producer. With Hale as producer, actual production on \"The Black Cauldron\" officially began in 1980. He tossed out visual character artwork submitted by Tim Burton and along with \"The Fox and the Hound\" directors Richard Rich and Ted Berman, they desired a \"Sleeping Beauty\"-style approach and brought Milt Kahl out of retirement to create character designs for Taran, Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, and the other principal characters. He and the story team (including two story artists David Jonas and Al Wilson that Hale brought to the project) revised the film, capsulizing the story of the first two books and making some considerable changes which led to the departure of Sisson who had creative differences with Hale and the directors. Animators John Musker and Ron Clements, also citing creative differences, were removed from the project and began development on \"The Great Mouse Detective\". Displeased with Vance Gerry's concept for the Horned King, Hale turned the Horned King into a thin creature donning a hood and carrying a spectral presence with shadowed face and glowing red eyes, his role expanded into a composite villain of several characters from the books. Taran and Eilonwy eventually acquired elements of the past designs and costumes of earlier Disney characters, especially the latter, who was drawn to resemble Princess Aurora.\n\nShortly before the film's initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening for the rough cut of \"The Black Cauldron\" was held at the studio's private theater in Burbank, California. After the film, particularly the climactic \"cauldron born\" sequence, proved to be too intense and frightening for the majority of the children in the audience (most of whom fled the theater in terror before it was even finished), the newly appointed Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered certain scenes from \"The Black Cauldron\" be cut, as a result of the length and the fear that their graphic nature would alienate children and family audiences. Since animated films were generally edited in storyboard form using Leica reels (later known as animatics: storyboards shot sequentially and set to temporary audio tracks), producer Joe Hale objected to Katzenberg's demands. Katzenberg responded by having the film brought into an edit bay and editing the film himself.\n\nInformed of what Katzenberg was doing by Hale, Disney CEO Michael Eisner called Katzenberg in the editing room and convinced him to stop. Though he did what Eisner insisted, Katzenberg requested that the film be modified, and delayed its scheduled Christmas 1984 release to July 1985 so that the film could be reworked.\n\nThe film was ultimately cut by twelve minutes, with existing scenes rewritten and reanimated for continuity. Many of the cut scenes involved extended character interactions, but other trims involve violent content, including the undead \"Cauldron Born\", who are used as the Horned King's army in the final act of the film. While most of the scenes were seamlessly removed from the film, the Cauldron Born sequence contains rather recognizable lapses because the removal of the scenes of the Cauldron Born mauling the henchmen, as well as one of them being dissolved by the mist, creates a jump in the film's soundtrack.\n\nInvented by David W. Spencer from the studio's still camera department, the animation photo transfer process (shorten as the APT process) was first used for \"The Black Cauldron\" which would enhance the technology by which the rough animation would be processed onto celluloid. First, the rough animation would be photographed onto high-contrast litho film, and the resulting negative would be copied onto the plastic cel sheets that would transfer lines and the colors which eventually eliminated the hand-inking process. But as the APT-transferred line art would fade off of the cels over time, most or all of the film was done using the xerographic process which had been in place at Disney since the late 1950s. Spencer would win a technical Academy Award for this process, but the computer would soon render the APT process obsolete.\n\n\"The Black Cauldron\" is notable for being Disney's first animated feature film to incorporate computer-generated imagery in its animation for bubbles, a boat, a floating orb of light, and the cauldron itself. Despite \"The Black Cauldron\" being released a year before \"The Great Mouse Detective\", both films were in production simultaneously for some time and the computer graphics for the latter were done first. When producer Joe Hale heard about what was being done, the possibilities made him excited and he made the crew from \"The Great Mouse Detective\" project create some computer animation for his own movie. For other effects, animator Don Paul used live action footage of dry ice mists to create the steam and smoke coming out of the cauldron.\n\nThe Black Cauldron: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the film. It was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein and originally released in 1985.\n\nUnlike most other Disney animated films, the film did not contain any songs. At the same time, Bernstein had just come off the success of his Academy Award-nominated score for the 1983 film \"Trading Places\" as well as the score for the 1984 film \"Ghostbusters\". Like in the latter of the two, \"The Black Cauldron\" saw the use of the ghostly ondes Martenot to build upon the dark mood of Prydain.\n\nBecause of the film's last minute revisions, much of Bernstein's score was cut and unused. In its minority, the score was re-recorded for the album original release by Varèse Sarabande in 1985, with the composer conducting the Utah Symphony Orchestra. The album soon fell out of print and many of the film's tracks did not resurface until a bootleg copy entitled \"Taran\" was supplied to soundtrack specialty outlets in 1986.\n\nThe film tracks received their premiere release in 2012 as part of Intrada Records partnership with Walt Disney Records to issue several Disney films soundtracks.\n\nThe score received positive reviews from music critics, and today is regarded as one of the best works by Bernstein and for a Disney animated film, despite its obscurity. Jason Ankeny from AllMusic gave to the soundtrack a positive review, stating that \"Bernstein's bleak arrangements and ominous melodies vividly underline the fantasy world portrayed onscreen, and taken purely on its own terms, the score is an undeniable success\". The film score review website Filmtracks wrote: \"The score for \"The Black Cauldron\" was for Bernstein what \"Mulan\" was for Jerry Goldsmith in the next decade: a fascinating journey into a fresh realm that required its music to play a more significant role in the film\".\n\nFor its initial release, the film became the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. It was also presented in Super Technirama 70—the first since \"Sleeping Beauty\"—and Dolby Stereo 70mm six-track surround sound.\n\nThe film was re-released in 1990 in selected markets (including Portland, Oregon) under the title \"Taran and the Magic Cauldron\".\n\n\"The Black Cauldron\" was released in North America on July 24, 1985. The film was also screened at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. While officially budgeted by Disney executives at $25 million, the film's production manager, Don Hahn, said in his documentary, \"Waking Sleeping Beauty\", that it cost $44 million to produce the film. The $44-million budget made it the most expensive animated film ever made at the time. The film grossed $21.3 million domestically. It resulted in a loss for Walt Disney Studios and put the future of the animation department in jeopardy (earning it the nickname \"the film that almost killed Disney\"). It was so poorly received that it was not distributed as a home video release for more than a decade after its theatrical run. Adding insult to injury, the film was also beaten at the box office by \"The Care Bears Movie\" ($22.9 million domestically), which was released several months earlier by Disney's much-smaller rival animation studio Nelvana. The film was however more successful outside North America notably in France where it had 3,074,481 admissions and was the fifth most attended film of the year.\n\nThe film was the last Disney animated film to be completed at the original Animation Building of the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The animation department was moved to the Air Way facility in nearby Glendale in December 1984, and, following corporate restructuring, eventually returned to the Burbank studio in the mid-1990s at a new facility.\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 57%, based on 30 reviews with an average score of 5.7/10. The critics' consensus stated \"Ambitious but flawed, \"The Black Cauldron\" is technically brilliant as usual, but lacks the compelling characters of other Disney animated classics.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" gave a positive review of the film, while \"Los Angeles Times\" Charles Solomon praised its \"splendid visuals\". Walter Goodman, reviewing for \"The New York Times\", praised the animation and John Hurt's performance, but felt \"[p]eople old enough to recall their delight at earlier feature animations, no doubt burnished by memory, are not of course the audience at which \"The Black Cauldron\" is aimed. Nor, apparently, is it aimed at youngsters who have had a taste of more sophisticated animation of the \"Star Wars\" breed of movies.\" London's \"Time Out\" magazine deemed it \"a major disappointment\", adding that \"the charm, characterization and sheer good humor\" found in previous Disney efforts \"are sadly absent\". Jeffrey Katzenberg, then-Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, was dismayed by the product and the animators felt that it lacked \"the humor, pathos, and the fantasy which had been so strong in Lloyd Alexander's work. The story had been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and it was heartbreaking to see such wonderful material wasted.\"\n\nLloyd Alexander, the author of the books on which the film was based, had a more complex reaction to the film:\nFirst, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable. I had fun watching it. What I would hope is that anyone who sees the movie would certainly enjoy it, but I'd also hope that they'd actually read the book. The book is quite different. It's a very powerful, very moving story, and I think people would find a lot more depth in the book.\n\nFollowing many requests from fans, \"The Black Cauldron\" was released on VHS in the United Kingdom in 1997, and in the United States on August 4, 1998, as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection, in a pan-and-scan transfer, thirteen years after its theatrical release. The film received a DVD release with a 2.20:1 non-anamorphic widescreen transfer in 2000, as part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line, featuring an art gallery, a new game \"The Quest for the Black Cauldron\", and the 1952 Donald Duck short \"Trick or Treat\".\n\nIn 2008, Disney announced a Special Edition DVD release of the film to be released in 2009, but failed. It was re-advertised as a 25th Anniversary Edition and released on September 14, 2010, in the US and UK. It contained a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, the new \"Witch's Challenge\" game, deleted scenes, and all of the features from the 2000 DVD release.\n\nCostumed versions of the characters from the film have made occasional appearances at the Disney theme parks and resorts.\n\nIn 1986, the eatery \"Lancer's Inn\" at Walt Disney World, was renamed \"Gurgi's Munchies and Crunchies\". Eventually, in 1993 they closed the place down then later remodeled it into \"Lumiere's Kitchen\", \"The Village Fry Shoppe\" and \"The Friar's Nook\" (its current name).\n\nOn July 11, 1986, Tokyo Disneyland opened \"Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour\", a walk-through attraction in which the Horned King makes an appearance. The attraction was in operation until 2006. To tie-in with the attraction's opening, a 14-day special event and castle show \"The Mystery of Cinderella Castle\" was featured on the Cinderella Castle Forecourt Stage, featuring Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, with Princess Aurora, Prince Phillip and Maleficent from \"Sleeping Beauty\". During Goofy, Donald, Phillip and Aurora's battle with Maleficent's forces, Creeper makes a cameo appearance with other Disney villains.\n\nA video game of the same name was designed by Al Lowe of Sierra On-Line and released in 1986. It was made shortly after the first \"King's Quest\" game, so it resembled that adventure in many ways. Along with \"The Dark Crystal\" it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.\n\nThe player character is a young assistant pig-keeper named Taran, who undertakes a quest to stop the evil Horned King, who seeks for Hen Wen, the magical pig of the wizard Dallben, for her visionary abilities. With these abilities, the Horned King would be able to discover the Black Cauldron and rule the land. Taran's first mission is to lead her to the Fair Folk while the Horned King's dragons are looking for them. If the pig should be captured (the game allows either possibility), Taran can go to the Horned King's castle and rescue her. As soon as he is inside, Taran will meet Eilonwy with her magic bauble and may rescue Fflewddur Fflam, as well as discover a Magic Sword. The Cauldron is in the possession of three witches of Morva who will trade it for the Sword. Unfortunately a dragon grasps the cauldron and Taran goes back to encounter the evil man himself. The game actually featured plot branches and multiple endings depending on many variables, such as whether Hen Wen the pig was saved, how the cauldron was destroyed, and what reward was chosen afterwards. This use of multiple endings preceded the more famous use in Lucasfilm's game \"Maniac Mansion\" by a year.\n\n\"Antic\" in 1987 criticized the Atari ST version of \"The Black Cauldron\" as \"typical of early software for newer computers. It doesn't fully utilize the ST's capabilities\", citing the \"chunky low-resolution\" graphics \"obviously ported from another make of computer\". The magazine concluded that fans of other Sierra adventures would enjoy the game.\n\n"}
{"id": "370807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=370807", "title": "The Persistence of Memory", "text": "The Persistence of Memory\n\nThe Persistence of Memory () is a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dalí, and one of his most recognizable works. First shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referenced in popular culture, and sometimes referred to by more descriptive (though incorrect) titles, such as \"Melting Clocks\", \"The Soft Watches\" or \"The Melting Watches\".\n\nThe well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch. It epitomizes Dalí's theory of \"softness\" and \"hardness\", which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Adès wrote, \"The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order\". This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was in fact the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert melting in the sun. \n\nIt is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange \"monster\" (with a lot of texture near its face, and lots of contrast and tone in the picture) that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The figure can be read as a \"fading\" creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature's exact form and composition. One can observe that the creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that the creature is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.\n\nThe orange clock at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants. Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay. Another insect that is present in the painting is a fly, which sits on the watch that is next to the orange watch. The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. \"The Persistence of Memory\" employs \"the exactitude of realist painting techniques\" to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.\n\nThe craggy rocks to the right represent a tip of Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Many of Dalí's paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to Mount Pani.\n\nDalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation \"The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory\" (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, while the original \"Persistence of Memory\" remains at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dalí also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are the \"Persistence of Memory\", the \"Nobility of Time\", the \"Profile of Time\", and the \"Three Dancing Watches\".\n\n\n"}

They are the largest form of \"thangka\" paintings in the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Thongdrels typically depict a seated Guru Rinpoche surrounded by holy beings in a composition that, unlike most smaller thangkas, is in a \"landscape\" format, somewhat wider than it is tall.\n\nThongdrels are composed of several layers, mostly of silk. These begin with a backing, then the image itself, made up of appliqué pieces sewn to a background. Finally there is a yellow drape that covers and protects it when not on display. Thongdrels are stored rolled up. Thongdrels are displayed once a year as the highlight of the tsechu festival of a district or \"dzongkhag\" (although not every district has a thongdrel). Typically they are displayed on the last day of the tsechu. The painting is not allowed to be struck by the direct rays of the sun, thus it may be unfurled at around 3:00 in the morning and rolled back up by 7:30 AM. \n\nUsually the architecture of the dzong provides a wall with access above, down which they may be unrolled, but sometimes metal hanging frames may be used. Major Tibetan centres have structures built into the defensive walls or other buildings specifically designed to give a large space for the display of festival thangkas. \n\nThe mere viewing of the unfurled thongdrel is said to cleanse the viewer of sin. They may also be exhibited at other important occasions such as royal coronations, when the thongdrel from a number of monasteries may be transported to appear. \n\n"}
{"id": "18900832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18900832", "title": "Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Broodthaers)", "text": "Un Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (Broodthaers)\n\nUn Coup de Dés Jamais N'Abolira Le Hasard (\"A Throw of the Dice will Never Abolish Chance\") is an artist's book by Marcel Broodthaers published November 1969 in Antwerp. The work is a close copy of the first edition of the French Symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé's poem of the same name, published in 1914, but with all the words removed, replaced by black stripes that correspond directly to the typographic layout used by Mallarmé to articulate the text.\n\nBroodthaers reduces \"Un Coup de Dés\" to its structure - or to put it another way he elevates the structure of the work to a concept worthy of study in its own right, thus acknowledging Mallarmé's own fetishistic attention to this aspect of his work. Rendering the structure concrete, visible, almost tactile, Broodthaers offers a conceptual analysis of Mallarmé's poem across the distance of a nearly a century...It would be hard to imagine a more subtle treatment of Mallarmé's work, or one more capable of demonstrating its essential properties, than this reworked book by Broodthaers. — Johanna Drucker\n\nOften included in exhibitions tracing the history of the artist's book, the work is seen as a seminal example of the European post-avant-garde. It is often referred to simply as \"Un Coup de Dés\".\n\nBroodthaers had lived in poverty as a poet in Brussels for twenty years before becoming an artist in 1964. His first exhibition, at the Galere Saint-Laurent, included two unsold parcels of his fourth book of poetry, \"Pense-Bête\", encased in plaster. This was the first of many works that 'employed techniques associated with poetry but applied by him not only to words but to images and symbols.' \"Un Coup de Dés\" would become the most famous instance of Broodthaers' interest in setting up a contradiction between the written word and a visual image 'to the profit of the subject.'\n\nBroodthaers had been given a copy of Mallarmé's \"Un Coup de Dés\" in 1945 by the Belgian surrealist painter Réné Magritte as 'a way of explaining his art to a young admirer without explaining it literally.'\n\nAs for the idea of establishing a direct relationship between literature and the plastic arts, I'm afraid I have done so by taking as a subject \"A Throw Of The Dice\", by Mallarmé !!! — Broodthaers\n\nMallarmé had written the poem in 1897 and left copious notes as to how it should be typeset, instructions that were finally carried out 16 years after his death, in 1914. The poem was famous for its extraordinary typography, which anticipated the 20th century interest in graphic design and concrete poetry. Mallarmé was known to have organised the layout of the poem using rectangles of card, and to leave written pleas to publish the work exactly as he'd intended. As such, Broodthaers' work can be seen as a direct quote of Mallarmé's working methods and of his obsession with the visual layout of the text.\n\nMallarmé is the source of all contemporary art... it unconsciously invents modern space. — Broodthaers, 1970\n\nBroodthaers' exhibition 'Exposition Littéraire autour de Mallarmé' at the Wide White Space Gallery, Antwerp, December 1969 consisted of a copy of Mallarmé's book 'opened so that, (as nearly always when a book is put in an exhibition) only two pages were visible. The meaning is there but cannot be entirely reached.' A series of metal plates, made of anodised aluminium, engraved with black impressions standing in for the text, were hung on the wall whilst a recording of Broodthaers reciting the poem was played continuously for the duration of the exhibition. \n\nThe word was \"there\", more \"real\", because three dimensional, than the original pages but, of course, negative and illegible. Meanwhile, the tape-recorded voice of the artist read out the poem repeatedly, it was \"there\" but not simultaneously and continuously present like the words of the poem.\nAfter a brief introduction citing the original edition published in 1914 by Librairie Gallimard, the book starts with the entire poem written as a block of text which is rectangular if the type of Mallarme's poem is 'regular' and oblique if the type from Mallarme is italic. 12 double spreads follow, with immaculately laid out black shapes standing in for the text. The work is soft bound and feels quite insubstantial. The cover is a near-perfect facsimile of the original cover, but with the word 'image' replacing 'poem' in the centre of the design.\n\nThe edition was published in Antwerp to coincide with the exhibition on 25 November 1969. 10 copies of the work - unbound, numbered I-X, printed onto 12 aluminium sheets - were made available, along with 90 copies printed on translucent paper and 300 copies on normal paper. The translucent edition came with two sheets of white card cut to the size of the book so that individual pages could be isolated by the reader if they so wished.\n\nThe book, like Broodthaers' work in general, has gradually grown in stature since his death in 1976, and has found its way into a number of important collections, including MOMA, V&A, and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Antwerp.\nIt also has inspired other reworks, like this one by Michalis Pichler: \"In Michalis Pichlers’ 2008 rework the blocks are cut out, creating a negative space and geometric pattern of cuts and absence. (...) The idea of remake and of version, using another existing work as point of departure, relieves the artist of the onus of originality while allowing the new gesture to stand as a novel gesture. Un-originality, anti-expressiveness – these are terms that are of more recent vintage than first generation conceptualism.\" \n\n\n"}

Dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of information about Guthrie's vast cultural legacy, the Woody Guthrie Archives houses the largest collection of Woody Guthrie material in the world. The archives opened to the public in New York City in 1996. The archives were subsequently moved to the new Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2013, after being acquired by the Tulsa-based George Kaiser Foundation. The Center officially opened on April 27, 2013.\n\nThe Woody Guthrie Center features, in addition to the archives, a museum focused on the life and the influence of Guthrie through his music, writings, art, and political activities. The museum is open to the public; the archives is open only to researchers by appointment. The archives contains thousands of items related to Guthrie, including original artwork, books, correspondence, lyrics, manuscripts, media, notebooks, periodicals, personal papers, photographs, scrapbooks, and other special collections.\n\nOn September 6, 2007, Woody Guthrie Publications, in cooperation with the Woody Guthrie Foundation released \"The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949\", accompanied by a 72-page book describing the performance and the project. Paul Braverman, a student at Rutgers University in 1949, made the recordings himself using a small wire recorder at a Guthrie concert in Newark, New Jersey. On February 10, 2008, the release was the recipient of a Grammy Award in the category Best Historical Album.\n\nThe Foundation was previously based in Brooklyn, New York and directed by Woody Guthrie's daughter Nora Guthrie. Nora Guthrie opened up the Foundation's archives to musicians of many types, who she encouraged to write and record music for the many hundreds of Woody Guthrie's written lyrics. Following Woody Guthrie's death, many of these lyrics were without surviving melodies, as Woody did not write musical notation and never recorded (or taught anyone) the majority of his original compositions.\n\nIn 1995, Nora Guthrie had invited alternative folk-rocker Billy Bragg to select some lyrics from the archive to be set to music and then to be recorded commercially. Bragg then invited the alt-country band Wilco to help complete the project. Wilco and Bragg released 2 acclaimed \"Mermaid Avenue\" albums in 1998 and 2000, using Woody's lyrics set to their own musical compositions. Also, a film documentary Man in the Sand. was released documenting not only the making of the Mermaid Avenue albums but also Bragg's exploration of Woody Guthrie's origins in hometown Okemah, Oklahoma. Many other collaborative projects by others have followed.\n\nFollowing is a comprehensive list of commercial recordings containing songs which have lyrics written by Woody Guthrie and music written by others:\n\n\nOne of the lyrics which was worked several times by Billy Bragg, \"All You Fascists\", has subsequently surfaced in a recording of a 1944 radio program \"The Martins and the McCoys\". Guthrie appeared in the program with other folk singers and can be heard singing \"All of You Fascists Bound to Lose, set to his original melody, which is of course substantially different from the melodies Bragg has devised for it.\n\nGiven the quantity of these posthumous collaborations, it was perhaps inevitable that there would be some lyrics set to more than one melody. For instance, track 3 on the Wasserman album (\"Ease My Revolutionary Mind\") uses the same set of lyrics as track 3 on the Farrar album (as well as track 3 on the Autumn Defense album). Track 2 on the Brooke album (\"You'd Oughta Be Satisfied Now\") uses the same set of lyrics as track 5 on the third volume of \"Mermaid Avenue\". The Woody Guthrie Publications website lists Jonatha Brooke's version of \"You'd Oughta Be Satisfied Now\" as a \"derivative work\".\n\n"}
