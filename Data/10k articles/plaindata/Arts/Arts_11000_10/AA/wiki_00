She participated in the Teacher in Space program as backup to Christa McAuliffe for the 1986 ill-fated STS-51-L mission of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\". She then trained as a Mission Specialist, and flew on STS-118 in August 2007.\n\nMorgan was born to Dr. and Mrs. Jerry Radding in 1951 and raised in Fresno, California, where she attended Herbert Hoover High School. Following graduation in 1969, she was accepted to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, where she graduated with distinction in 1973 with a B.A. in Human Biology. She obtained her teaching credential from Notre Dame de Namur University in nearby Belmont in 1974.\n\nMorgan began her teaching career in 1974 on the Flathead Indian Reservation at Arlee Elementary School in Arlee, Montana, where she taught remedial reading and math. From 1975 to 1978, she taught remedial reading/math and second grade at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School in McCall, Idaho. From 1978 to 1979, Morgan taught English and science to third graders at Colegio Americano de Quito in Quito, Ecuador, for a year. From 1979 to 1998, Morgan taught second, third, and fourth grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary School.\n\nMorgan was selected as the backup candidate for the NASA Teacher in Space Project on July 19, 1985. From September 1985 to January 1986, Morgan trained with Christa McAuliffe and the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" crew at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. Following McAuliffe's death in the \"Challenger\" disaster, Morgan assumed the duties of Teacher in Space Designee. From March 1986 to July 1986, she worked with NASA, speaking to educational organizations throughout the country. In the fall of 1986, Morgan returned to Idaho to resume her teaching career. She taught second and third grades at McCall-Donnelly Elementary and continued to work with NASA's Education Division, Office of Human Resources and Education. Her duties as Teacher in Space Designee included public speaking, educational consulting, curriculum design, and serving on the National Science Foundation's Federal Task Force for Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering.\n\nIn January 1998, 12 years after McAuliffe's death, Morgan was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate (Mission Specialist) and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1998 to begin training to become a full-time astronaut. Following the completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch. She served in the Astronaut Office CAPCOM Branch, working in Mission Control as prime communicator with on-orbit crews.\n\nLike many other astronauts and cosmonauts, Morgan is a licensed amateur radio operator, having passed the technician class license exam in 2003. This qualified her to use the facilities of the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) project.\n\nMorgan's duties as a Mission Specialist were no different than those of other crew members. While NASA press releases and media briefings often referred to her as a \"Mission Specialist Educator\" or \"Educator Astronaut\", Morgan did not train in the Educator Astronaut Project. NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin clarified at a press conference after STS-118 that Morgan was not considered a Mission Specialist Educator, but rather was a standard Mission Specialist, who had been a teacher.\n\nPrior to her flight on STS-118, NASA seemed to limit Morgan's exposure to the press, but she did a series of interviews shortly before the start of the mission about what the crew of STS-118 would be doing to help build the International Space Station, commenting, \"You know, there's a great sense of pride to be able to be involved in a human endeavor that takes us all a little bit farther. When you look down and see our Earth, and you realize what we are trying to do as a human race, it's pretty profound.\"\n\nThree weeks after Morgan's mission ended, she conducted her first space education assignment at Walt Disney World in Florida. Morgan's words from that day were etched into a plaque on a wall of Mission: Space. The \"Wall of Honor\" contains quotes from notable people, such as Neil Armstrong, John F. Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh, Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Galileo, and Christa McAuliffe. Morgan's plaque is placed beside McAuliffe's, which says: \"Space is for everybody ... That's our new frontier out there.\" This event was one of a series of lectures Morgan would complete.\n\nSTS-118, an assembly mission to the International Space Station, successfully launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center at 6:36:42 p.m. EDT, 8 August 2007. Morgan served as robotic arm operator, and transfer coordinator, coordinating the transfer of over of cargo to the International Space Station, and bringing home over . In addition to her other duties, Morgan participated in twenty-minute amateur radio question-and-answer sessions with young people at the Discovery Center of Idaho and other centers, and joined Mission Specialist Alvin Drew in an education event with young people at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia. The event was hosted by June Scobee, widow of Space Shuttle \"Challenger\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s commander, Richard \"Dick\" Scobee. The center honored Morgan with the \"President George H.W. Bush Leadership Award\". STS-118 landed successfully at Kennedy Space Center on August 21, a day ahead of schedule due to concerns about Hurricane Dean.\n\nOn June 28, 2008, Morgan announced that she would leave NASA for a teaching job at Boise State University. In August 2008, Morgan took a full-time position as a Distinguished Educator in Residence; a dual appointment to BSU's colleges of engineering and education. There she advises, leads and represents the university in policy development, advocacy and fund-raising in science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nOn July 4, 2008, Morgan received the \"Friend of Education\" award from the National Education Association. The following month Barbara R. Morgan Elementary School opened in McCall.\n\nMorgan received the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2008.\n\nMorgan is married to writer Clay Morgan of McCall, Idaho; they have two sons. She is a classical flautist who also enjoys jazz, literature, hiking, swimming, and cross-country skiing.\n\n"}

At present, it is probably the most extensive private collection of Santa Claus items in the world with over 3,700++ santas. And unlike traditional museums, the Casa Santa is a fun museum in that the visitors are free to inspect the items closely, or in some cases, play with it.\n\nCasa Santa started out as a small personal collection and it grew in size until it needed a house where the Santas could \"live.\" The Casa Santa was converted from a family resthouse into a museum of Santa Claus collection in 1995. The house was remodeled by folk architect Rosario Encarnacion Tan and the lighting design inside the museum was crafted by international Japanese light designer Shoko Matsumoto.\n\nIn December 2004, it was the cover of \"Starweek\"'s Christmas and in Christmas 2008 appeared in the front page of the \"Philippine Inquirer\". It has appeared in over 50 T.V. and movie productions -- \"Rated K\", \"Wish Ko Lang\",\" Unang Hirit\", \"Magandang Umagang Bayan\", \"US Girls\", \"Boy and Kris\". On international television, it was covered by two news agencies, Reuters and Associated Press.\n\nAddition to the collection is a room full of miniature Christmas villages. A starter collection in the loft was displayed in 2010. After acquiring a significant number of mini- houses this year, it was given a room of its own. The village was designed by Bamboo Tonogbanua of Bacolod, himself a Christmas village collector.\n\nNEWEST ATTRACTION\n\nThis 2015 a newly renovated Santa's village has been created by Christmas village miniature artist Bamboo Tonogbanua, a Cebuano Artist.\n\nCASA SANTA PLAYROOM, a room designed to house small & big santa stuffed toys collection. A colorful room designed, full of toys and entertaining surprises.\n\nAnd by December, Jardin de Miramar has its newest & modern facility, the Isla Palma Resort located within the compound. It is nature-inspired and imprints a platform strategically made for thematic events, weddings, corporate parties, cocktails, team building activities or simply for private celebrations. Its setting creates a distinct feel of being in an island with a pavilion seating 300 persons and a 250 sq m wrap-around pool. Discover the tropical allure of the Isla Palma Resort – a quiet haven with an urban feel set in the midst of a countryside locale.\n\nAnother curious item in the Jardin de Miramar is the restored Noah's Ark found in the Galera and surrounded by a rustic playground. Noah's Ark is newly renovated multi-colored fishing boat artistically reconstructed into a play area. And like any work of art in Jardin, this old boat not only serves as a charming relic that is lovely to look at. It is a hardworking piece of art where children can play \"sailor and pirate, hike and seek, go up and down the lighthouse and pyramid tree, run along the bridges and do the monkey swings. .\n\nJardin has extended its collection to other works of art such as the sculptures/creation of nationally recognized artists Ed Castrillo, Michael Cacnio, Daniel dela Cruz, Tony Leano, Ral Arrogante, mural works by Alfred Galvez; mosaic works by Hannah Liongoren. The three-hectare Jardin de Miramar is also the most popular party venue in the East and is the only wedding and party place with each of the 9 venues having a thematic look and character. It is also popular as a prenuptial photo shoot venue.\n\n"}

{"id": "31525918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31525918", "title": "Christian views on poverty and wealth", "text": "Christian views on poverty and wealth\n\nThere have been a variety of Christian views on poverty and wealth. At one end of the spectrum is a view which casts wealth and materialism as an evil to be avoided and even combatted. At the other end is a view which casts prosperity and well-being as a blessing from God. \n\nMany taking the former position address the topic in relation to the modern neoliberal capitalism that shapes the Western world. American theologian John B. Cobb has argued that the \"economism that rules the West and through it much of the East\" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that \"man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)\". He asserts that it is obvious that \"Western society is organized in the service of wealth\" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West. Scottish theologian Jack Mahoney has characterized the saying of Jesus in as having \"imprinted themselves so deeply on the Christian community through the centuries that those who are well off, or even comfortably off, often feel uneasy and troubled in conscience.\"\n\nSome Christians argue that a proper understanding of Christian teachings on wealth and poverty needs to take a larger view where the accumulation of wealth is not the central focus of one's life but rather a resource to foster the \"good life\". Professor David W. Miller has constructed a three-part rubric which presents three prevalent attitudes among Protestants towards wealth. According to this rubric, Protestants have variously viewed wealth as: (1) an offense to the Christian faith (2) an obstacle to faith and (3) the outcome of faith.\n\nAccording to historian Alan S. Kahan, there is a strand of Christianity that views the wealthy man as \"especially sinful\". In this strand of Christianity, Kahan asserts, the day of judgment is viewed as a time when \"the social order will be turned upside down and ... the poor will turn out to be the ones truly blessed.\"\n\nThomas Aquinas wrote \"Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things.\"\n\nDavid Miller suggests that this view is similar to that of the third century Manicheans who saw the spiritual world as being good and the material world as evil with the two being in irreconcilable conflict with each other. Thus, this strand of Christianity exhorts Christians to renounce material and worldly pleasures in order to follow Jesus. As an example, Miller cites Jesus' injunction to his disciples to \"take nothing for the journey.\"\n\nThe Catholic Worker Movement advocate voluntary poverty. Christians, such as New Monastics, may choose to reject personal wealth and follow an ascetic lifestyle, in part as a protest against \"a church and public that embraces wealth, luxury and ostentatious power.\"\n\nAccording to David Miller, Martin Luther viewed Mammon (or the desire for wealth) as \"the most common idol on earth\". Miller cites Jesus' encounter with the rich ruler as an example of wealth being an obstacle to faith. According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus. Miller cites Paul's observation in 1st Timothy that, “people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.\" . Paul continues on with the observation that \"the love of money is the root of all evil.\"\n\nJesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is[a] to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\"\nKahan cites Jesus' injunction against amassing material wealth as an example that the \"good [Christian] life was one of poverty and charity, storing up treasures in heaven instead of earth.\n\nDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. \n\nJesus counsels his followers to remove from their lives those things which cause them to sin, saying \"If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to go with two hands into hell, where the fire never goes out.\" . In order to remove the desire for wealth and material possessions as an obstacle to faith, some Christians have taken vows of poverty. Christianity has a long tradition of voluntary poverty which is manifested in the form of asceticism, charity and almsgiving.\nKahan argues that Christianity is unique because it sparked the beginning of a phenomenon which he calls the \"Great Renunciation\" in which \"millions of people would renounce sex and money in God's name.\"\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, poverty is one of the evangelical counsels. Pope Benedict XVI distinguishes \"poverty \"chosen\"\" (the poverty of spirit proposed by Jesus), and \"poverty \"to be fought\"\" (unjust and imposed poverty). He considers that the moderation implied in the former favors solidarity, and is a necessary condition so as to fight effectively to eradicate the abuse of the latter. Certain religious institutes also take a vow of extreme poverty. For example, the Franciscan orders have traditionally foregone all individual and corporate forms of ownership.\n\nOne line of Protestant thinking views the pursuit of wealth as not only acceptable but as a religious calling or duty. This perspective is generally ascribed to Calvinist and Puritan theologies, which view hard work and frugal lifestyles as spiritual acts in themselves. John Wesley was a strong proponent of gaining wealth, according to his famous \"Sermon 50,\" in which he said, \"gain all you can, save all you can and give all you can.\" It is impossible to give to charity if one is poor; John Wesley and his Methodists were noted for their consistently large contributions to charity in the form of churches, hospitals and schools. \n\nIncluded among those who view wealth as an outcome of faith are modern-day preachers and authors who propound prosperity theology, teaching that God promises wealth and abundance to those who will believe in him and follow his laws. Prosperity theology (also known as the \"health and wealth gospel\") is a Christian religious belief whose proponents claim the Bible teaches that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. Most teachers of prosperity theology maintain that a combination of faith, positive speech, and donations to specific Christian ministries will always cause an increase in material wealth for those who practice these actions. Prosperity theology is almost always taught in conjunction with continuationism.\n\nProsperity theology first came to prominence in the United States during the Healing Revivals in the 1950s. Some commentators have linked the genesis of prosperity theology with the influence of the New Thought movement. It later figured prominently in the Word of Faith movement and 1980s televangelism. In the 1990s and 2000s, it became accepted by many influential leaders in the charismatic movement and has been promoted by Christian missionaries throughout the world. It has been harshly criticized by leaders of mainstream evangelicalism as a non-scriptural doctrine or as an outright heresy.\n\nProfessor Cosimo Perrotta describes the early Christian period as one which saw \"the meeting and clash of three great cultures: the Classical, the Hebrew (of the Old Testament) and the Christian.\" Perrotta describes the cultures as having radically different views of money and wealth. Whereas the Hebrew culture prized material wealth, the Classical and Christian cultures either held them in contempt or preached indifference to them. However, Perrotta points out that the motivation of the Classical and Christian cultures for their attitudes were very different and thus the logical implications of the attitudes resulted in different outcomes.\n\nPerrotta characterizes the attitude of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being \"completely different from the classical view.\" He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers. Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them. The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt. Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was \"not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands.\" In essence, the poor man is \"protected by God\". However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament. The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.\n\nPerrotta points out that material wealth is highly valued in the Old Testament; the Hebrews seek it and God promises to bless them with it if they will follow his commandments. Joseph Francis Kelly writes that biblical writers leave no doubt that God enabled men such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Solomon to achieve wealth and that this wealth was a sign of divine favor. However, Kelly also points out that the Old Testament insisted that the rich aid the poor. Prophets such as Amos castigated the rich for oppressing the poor and crushing the needy. In summary, Kelly writes that, \"the Old Testament saw wealth as something good but warned the wealthy not to use their position to harm those with less. The rich had an obligation to alleviate the sufferings of the poor.\"\n\nJesus explicitly condemns excessive love of wealth as an intrinsic evil in various passages in the Gospels, especially in Luke (Luke 16:14–15 being an especially clear example). He also consistently warns of the danger of riches as a hindrance to favor with God; as in the Parable of the Sower, where it is said:\n\nJesus makes Mammon a personification of riches, one in opposition to God, and which claims a person's service and loyalty as God does. But Jesus rejects the possibility of dual service on our part: for, he says, no one can serve both God and Mammon.\n\nIn the story of Jesus and the rich young man the young ruler's wealth inhibits him from following Jesus and thereby attaining the Kingdom. Jesus comments on the young man's discouragement thus:\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain, Jesus exhorts his hearers to sell their earthly goods and give to the poor, and so provide themselves with \"a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys\" (Lk 12.33); and he adds \"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Lk 12.34).\n\nIn The Parable of the Rich Fool Jesus tells the story of a rich man who decides to rest from all his labors, saying to himself:\n\nAnd Jesus adds, \"This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God\" (Lk 12.21).\n\nJesus and Zacchaeus (Lk 19.1–10) is an example of storing up heavenly treasure, and being rich toward God. The repentant tax collector Zacchaeus not only welcomes Jesus into his house but joyfully promises to give half of his possessions to the poor, and to rebate overpayments four times over if he defrauded anyone (Lk 19.8).\n\nLuke strongly ties the right use of riches to discipleship; and securing heavenly treasure is linked with caring for the poor, the naked and the hungry, for God is supposed to have a special interest in the poor. This theme is consistent with God's protection and care of the poor in the Old Testament.\n\nThus, Jesus cites the words of the prophet Isaiah (Is:61.1–2) in proclaiming his mission:\n\nLuke, as is well known, had a particular concern for the poor as the subjects of Jesus' compassion and ministry. In his version of the Beatitudes, the poor are blessed as the inheritors of God's kingdom (Lk 6.20–23), even as the corresponding curses are pronounced to the rich (Lk 6.24–26).\n\nGod's special interest in the poor is also expressed in the theme of the eschatological \"great reversal\" of fortunes between the rich and the poor in The Magnificat (Lk 1.46–55):\n\nand in Jesus repeated use of the tag \"many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first\" (Mt 19.30, Mt 20.16, Mk 10.31 & Lk 13.30) and similar figures (Mt 23.12, Lk 14.11 & Lk 18.14).\n\nIn the Parable of the Wedding Feast, it is \"the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame\" who become God’s honored guests, while others reject the invitation because of their earthly cares and possessions (Lk 14.7–14).\n\nLuke’s concern for the rich and the poor continues in the Acts with a greater focus on the unity of the nascent Christian communities. The two famous passages (2.43–45; 4.32–37), which have been appealed to throughout history as the “normative ideal” of the community of goods for Christians, rather describe the extent of fellowship (koinōnia) in Jerusalem community as a part of distinctive Christian identity. Acts also portrays both positive and negative uses of wealth: those who practiced almsgiving and generosity to the poor (9.36; 10.2, 4) and those who gave priority to money over the needs of others (5.1–11; 8.14–24).\n\nFor Paul, riches mainly denotes the character and activity of God and Christ – spiritual blessings and/of salvation – (e.g., Rom. 2.4; 9.23; 2 Cor. 8.9; Eph. 1.7, 18; 2.4, 7) although he occasionally refers to typical Jewish piety and Greco-Roman moral teachings of the time, such as generosity (Rom. 12.8, 13; 2 Cor. 8.2; Eph. 4.28; 1 Tim. 6.17 ) and hospitality (1 Tim. 5.10) with warnings against pride (1 Tim. 6.17) and greed (1 Cor. 5.11; 1 Tim. 3.8). 1 Tim. 6.10 seems to reflect a popular Cynic-Stoic moral teaching of\nthe period: “the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.” Paul’s focus of generosity is devoted to the collection for the church in Jerusalem (Gal. 2.10; 1 Cor. 16.1–4; 2 Cor 8.1 – 9.15; Rom. 15.25–31) as an important symbol of unity between Jewish and gentile believers with an appeal to material and spiritual reciprocity. It is also noteworthy that Paul's teaching in 1 Tim 6:17 implies there were rich believers in the Early Church.\n\nA concept related to the accumlation of wealth is Worldliness, which is denounced by the Epistles of James and John: \"Don't you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God\" (Ja 4.4). The first letter of John says, in a similar vein: \"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” (1 Jn 2:15).\n\nThe Epistle of James also stands out for its vehement condemnation of the oppressive rich, who were presumably outsiders to the Christian community, which mainly consisted of the poor. Adopting the Psalter's convention of the “wicked rich” and the “pious poor” and adopting its voice, James indicts the rich with the sins of hoarding wealth, fraudulently withholding wages, corruption, pride, luxury, covetousness and murder; and denounces the folly of their actions in the face of the imminent Day of Judgement.\n\nFinally, the Revelation treats earthly riches and commercial activities with great ambivalence. While Jesus exposes the true poverty of the Laodicean church’s boast of wealth (3.17–18), he presents himself as the true source and dispenser of wealth (cf. 2 Cor. 8.13–15). Later, earthly riches and businesses activities are associated with the sins of Babylon, the earthly power of evil with self-accorded glory and luxury, whose fall is imminent (18.1–24). However, the Revelations also portrays the New Jerusalem with a lavish materialistic description, made of pure gold decorated with “every kind of precious stone” (21.18–19).\n\nEarly Christianity appears to have adopted many of the ethical themes found in the Hebrew Bible. However, the teachings of Jesus and his apostles as presented in the New Testament exhibit an \"acute sensitivity to the needs of the disadvantaged\" that Frederick sees as \"adding a critical edge to Christian teaching where wealth and the pursuit of economic gain are concerned.\n\nAlan Kahan points to the fact that Jesus was a poor man as emblematic of \"a revolution in the way poverty and wealth were viewed.\" This is not to say that Christian attitudes borrowed nothing from its Greco-Roman and Jewish precursors. Kahan acknowledges that, \"Christian theology absorbed those Greco-Roman attitudes towards money that complemented its own.\" However, as Kahan puts it, \"Never before had any god been conceived of as poor.\" He characterizes Christian charity as being \"different in kind from the generosity praised in the classical tradition.\"\n\nKahan contrasts the attitudes of early Christians with those of classical thinkers such as Seneca. The New Testament urges Christians to sell material possessions and give the money to the poor. According to Kahan, the goal of Christian charity is equality, a notion which is absent in the Greco-Roman attitudes toward the poor.\n\nCosimo Perrotta characterizes the Christian attitude vis-a-vis poverty and work as being \"much closer to the tradition of the Old Testament than to classical culture.\" However, Irving Kristol suggests that Christianity's attitude towards wealth is markedly different from that of the Hebrews in the Old Testament. Kristol asserts that traditional Judaism has no precepts that parallel the Christian assertion that it is difficult for a rich man to get into heaven.\n\nPerrotta characterizes Christianity as not disdaining material wealth as did classical thinkers such as Socrates, the Cynics and Seneca and yet not desiring it as the Old Testament writers did.\n\nMany of the Church Fathers condemned private property and advocated the communal ownership of property as an ideal for Christians to follow. However, they recognized early on that this was an ideal which was not practical in everyday life and viewed private property as a \"necessary evil resulting from the fall of man.\"\nAmerican theologian Robert Grant noted that, while almost all of the Church Fathers condemn the \"love of money for its own sake and insist upon the positive duty of almsgiving\", none of them seems to have advocated the general application of Jesus' counsel to the rich young man viz. to give away all of his worldly possessions in order to follow him.\n\nAugustine urged Christians to turn away from the desire for material wealth and success. He argued that the accumulation of wealth was not a worthy goal for Christians.\n\nClement of Alexandria counselled that property be used for the good of the community, he sanctioned private ownership of property and the accumulation of wealth. Lactantius wrote that \"the ownership of property contains the material of both vices and virtues but communism [communitas] contains nothing but license for vice.\"\n\nBy the beginning of the medieval era, the Christian paternalist ethic was \"thoroughly entrenched in the culture of Western Europe.\" Individualist and materialist pursuits such as greed, avarice, and the accumulation of wealth were condemned as un-Christian.\n\nMadeleine Gray describes the medieval system of social welfare as one that was \"organized through the church and underpinned by ideas on the spiritual value of poverty.\n\nAccording to Kahan, Christian theologians regularly condemned merchants. For example, he cites Honorius of Autun who wrote that merchants had little chance of going to heaven whereas farmers were likely to be saved. He further cites Gratian who wrote that \"the man who buys something in order that he may gain by selling it again unchanged and as he bought it, that man is of the buyers and sellers who are cast forth from God's temple.\"\n\nHowever, the medieval era saw a change in the attitudes of Christians towards the accumulation of wealth. Thomas Aquinas defined avarice not simply as a desire for wealth but as an \"immoderate\" desire for wealth. Aquinas wrote that it was acceptable to have \"external riches\" to the extent that they were necessary for him to maintain his \"condition of life\". This argued that the nobility had a right to more wealth than the peasantry. What was unacceptable was for a person to seek to more wealth than was appropriate to one's station or aspire to a higher station in life. The period saw fierce debates on whether Christ owned property.\n\nThe church evolved into the single most powerful institution in medieval Europe, more powerful than any single potentate. The Church was so wealthy that, at one time, it owned as much as 20–30% of the land in Western Europe in an era when land was the primary form of wealth. Over time, this wealth and power led to abuses and corruption.\n\nAs early as the 6th and 7th centuries, the issue of property and move of wealth in the event of outside aggression had been addressed in monastic communities via agreements such as the Consensoria Monachorum. By the eleventh century, Benedictine monasteries had become wealthy, owing to the generous donations of monarchs and nobility. Abbots of the larger monasteries achieved international prominence. In reaction to this wealth and power, a reform movement arose which sought a simpler, more austere monastic life in which monks worked with their hands rather than acting as landlords over serfs.\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, mendicant orders such as the Dominicans and the Franciscans departed from the practice of existing religious orders by taking vows of extreme poverty and maintaining an active presence preaching and serving the community rather than withdrawing into monasteries. Francis of Assisi viewed poverty as a key element of the imitation of Christ who was \"poor at birth in the manger, poor as he lived in the world, and naked as he died on the cross\".\n\nThe visible public commitment of the Franciscans to poverty provided to the laity a sharp contrast to the wealth and power of the Church, provoking \"awkward questions\".\n\nWidespread corruption led to calls for reform which called into question the interdependent relationship of church and state power. Reformers sharply criticized the lavish wealth of churches and the mercenary behavior of the clergy. For example, reformer Peter Damian labored to remind the church hierarchy and the laity that love of money was the root of much evil.\n\nUsury originally was the charging of interest on loans; this included charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a bureau de change. In places where interest became acceptable, usury was interest above the rate allowed by law. Today, usury commonly is the charging of unreasonable or relatively high rates of interest.\n\nThe first of the scholastics, Saint Anselm of Canterbury, led the shift in thought that labeled charging interest the same as theft. Previously usury had been seen as a lack of charity.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, the leading theologian of the Catholic Church, argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to \"double charging\", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing.\n\nThis did not, as some think, prevent investment. What it stipulated was that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all. This is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that \"to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural\". St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges.\n\nThe rising capitalistic middle class resented the drain of their wealth to the church; in northern Europe, they supported local reformers against the corruption, rapacity and venality which they viewed as originating in Rome.\n\nOne school of thought attributes Calvinism with setting the stage for the later development of capitalism in northern Europe. In this view, elements of Calvinism represented a revolt against the medieval condemnation of usury and, implicitly, of profit in general. Such a connection was advanced in influential works by R. H. Tawney(1880–1962) and by Max Weber (1864–1920).\n\nCalvin criticized the use of certain passages of scripture invoked by people opposed to the charging of interest. He reinterpreted some of these passages, and suggested that others of them had been rendered irrelevant by changed conditions. He also dismissed the argument (based upon the writings of Aristotle) that it is wrong to charge interest for money because money itself is barren. He said that the walls and the roof of a house are barren, too, but it is permissible to charge someone for allowing him to use them. In the same way, money can be made fruitful.\n\nFor Puritans, work was not simply arduous drudgery required to sustain life. Joseph Conforti describes the Puritan attitude toward work as taking on \"the character of a vocation — a calling through which one improved the world, redeemed time, glorified God, and followed life's pilgrimage toward salvation.\" Gayraud Wilmore characterizes the Puritan social ethic as focused on the \"acquisition and proper stewardship of wealth as outward symbols of God's favor and the consequent salvation of the individual.\" Puritans were urged to be producers rather than consumers and to invest their profits to create more jobs for industrious workers who would thus be enabled to \"contribute to a productive society and a vital, expansive church.\" Puritans were counseled to seek sufficient comfort and economic self-sufficiency but to avoid the pursuit of luxuries or the accumulation of material wealth for its own sake.\n\nIn two journal articles published in 1904–05, German sociologist Max Weber propounded a thesis that Reformed (i.e., Calvinist) Protestantism had engendered the character traits and values that under-girded modern capitalism. The English translation of these articles were published in book form in 1930 as \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". Weber argued that capitalism in northern Europe evolved because the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was a force behind an unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism.\n\nWeber's work focused scholars on the question of the uniqueness of Western civilization and the nature of its economic and social development. Scholars have sought to explain the fact that economic growth has been much more rapid in Northern and Western Europe and its overseas offshoots than in other parts of the world including those that where the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been dominant over Protestantism. Some have observed that explosive economic growth occurred at roughly the same time, or soon after, these areas experienced the rise of Protestant religions. Stanley Engerman asserts that, although some scholars may argue that the two phenomena are unrelated, many would find it difficult to accept such a thesis.\n\nJohn Chamberlain wrote that \"Christianity tends to lead to a capitalistic mode of life whenever siege conditions do not prevail... [capitalism] is not Christian in and by itself; it is merely to say that capitalism is a material by-product of the Mosaic Law.\"\n\nRodney Stark propounds the theory that Christian rationality is the primary driver behind the success of capitalism and the Rise of the West.\n\nJohn B. Cobb argues that the \"economism that rules the West and through it much of the East\" is directly opposed to traditional Christian doctrine. Cobb invokes the teaching of Jesus that \"man cannot serve both God and Mammon (wealth)\". He asserts that it is obvious that \"Western society is organized in the service of wealth\" and thus wealth has triumphed over God in the West.\n\nSocial justice generally refers to the idea of creating a society or institution that is based on the principles of equality and solidarity, that understands and values human rights, and that recognizes the dignity of every human being. The term and modern concept of \"social justice\" was coined by the Jesuit Luigi Taparelli in 1840 based on the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas and given further exposure in 1848 by Antonio Rosmini-Serbati. The idea was elaborated by the moral theologian John A. Ryan, who initiated the concept of a living wage. Father Coughlin also used the term in his publications in the 1930s and the 1940s. It is a part of Catholic social teaching, Social Gospel from Episcopalians and is one of the Four Pillars of the Green Party upheld by green parties worldwide. Social justice as a secular concept, distinct from religious teachings, emerged mainly in the late twentieth century, influenced primarily by philosopher John Rawls. Some tenets of social justice have been adopted by those on the left of the political spectrum.\n\nAccording to Kent Van Til, the view that wealth has been taken from the poor by the rich implies that the redistribution of that wealth is more a matter of restitution than of theft.\n\nCatholic social teaching is a body of doctrine developed by the Catholic Church on matters of poverty and wealth, economics, social organization and the role of the state. Its foundations are widely considered to have been laid by Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical letter \"Rerum novarum\", which advocated economic distributism and condemned socialism.\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, its purpose \"is simply to help purify reason and to contribute, here and now, to the acknowledgment and attainment of what is just…. [The Church] has to play her part through rational argument and she has to reawaken the spiritual energy without which justice…cannot prevail and prosper\", According to Pope John Paul II, its foundation \"rests on the threefold cornerstones of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity\". These concerns echo elements of Jewish law and the prophetic books of the Old Testament, and recall the teachings of Jesus Christ recorded in the New Testament, such as his declaration that \"whatever you have done for one of these least brothers of Mine, you have done for Me.\"\n\nCatholic social teaching is distinctive in its consistent critiques of modern social and political ideologies both of the left and of the right: liberalism, communism, socialism, libertarianism, capitalism, Fascism, and Nazism have all been condemned, at least in their pure forms, by several popes since the late nineteenth century.\n\nIrving Kristol posits that one reason that those who are \"experiencing a Christian impulse, an impulse toward the \"imitatio Christi\", would lean toward socialism ... is the attitude of Christianity toward the poor. \"\n\nArnold Toynbee characterized Communist ideology as a \"Christian heresy\" in the sense that it focused on a few elements of the faith to the exclusion of the others. Donald Treadgold interprets Toynbee's characterization as applying to Christian attitudes as opposed to Christian doctrines. In his book, \"Moral Philosophy\", Jacques Maritain echoed Toynbee's perspective, characterizing the teachings of Karl Marx as a \"Christian heresy\". After reading Maritain, Martin Luther King, Jr. commented that Marxism had arisen in response to \"a Christian world unfaithful to its own principles.\" Although King criticized the Soviet Marxist–Leninist Communist regime sharply, he nonetheless commented that Marx's devotion to a classless society made him almost Christian. Tragically, said King, Communist regimes created \"new classes and a new lexicon of injustice.\"\n\nChristian socialism generally refers to those on the Christian left whose politics are both Christian and socialist and who see these two philosophies as being interrelated. This category can include Liberation theology and the doctrine of the social gospel.\n\nThe \"Rerum novarum\" encyclical of Leo XIII (1891) was the starting point of a Catholic doctrine on social questions that has been expanded and updated over the course of the 20th century. Despite the introduction of social thought as an object of religious thought, \"Rerum novarum\" explicitly rejects what it calls \"the main tenet of socialism\":\n\"Hence, it is clear that the main tenet of socialism, community of goods, must be utterly rejected, since it only injures those whom it would seem meant to benefit, is directly contrary to the natural rights of mankind, and would introduce confusion and disorder into the commonwealth. The first and most fundamental principle, therefore, if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property.\" \"Rerum novarum\", paragraph 16.\nThe encyclical promotes a kind of corporatism based on social solidarity among the classes with respects for the needs and rights of all.\n\nIn the November 1914 issue of \"The Christian Socialist\", Episcopal bishop Franklin Spencer Spalding of Utah, U.S.A. stated:\n\n\"The Christian Church exists for the sole purpose of saving the human race. So far she has failed, but I think that Socialism shows her how she may succeed. It insists that men cannot be made right until the material conditions be made right. Although man cannot live by bread alone, he must have bread. Therefore the Church must destroy a system of society which inevitably creates and perpetuates unequal and unfair conditions of life. These unequal and unfair conditions have been created by competition. Therefore competition must cease and cooperation take its place.\"\n\nDespite the explicit rejection of Socialism, in the more Catholic countries of Europe the encyclical's teaching was the inspiration that led to the formation of new Christian-inspired Socialist parties. A number of Christian socialist movements and political parties throughout the world group themselves into the International League of Religious Socialists. It has member organizations in 21 countries representing 200,000 members.\n\nChristian socialists draw parallels between what some have characterized as the egalitarian and anti-establishment message of Jesus, who–according to the Gospel–spoke against the religious authorities of his time, and the egalitarian, anti-establishment, and sometimes anti-clerical message of most contemporary socialisms. Some Christian Socialists have become active Communists. This phenomenon was most common among missionaries in China, the most notable being James Gareth Endicott, who became supportive of the struggle of the Communist Party of China in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nMichael Moore's film also features a religious component where Moore examines whether or not capitalism is a sin and whether Jesus would be a capitalist, in order to shine light on the ideological contradictions among evangelical conservatives who support free market ideals.\n\nLiberation theology is a Christian movement in political theology which interprets the teachings of Jesus Christ in terms of a liberation from unjust economic, political, or social conditions. It has been described by proponents as \"an interpretation of Christian faith through the poor's suffering, their struggle and hope, and a critique of society and the Catholic faith and Christianity through the eyes of the poor\", and by detractors as Christianized Marxism.\nAlthough liberation theology has grown into an international and inter-denominational movement, it began as a movement within the Roman Catholic church in Latin America in the 1950s–1960s. Liberation theology arose principally as a moral reaction to the poverty caused by social injustice in that region. The term was coined in 1971 by the Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutiérrez, who wrote one of the movement's most famous books, \"A Theology of Liberation\". Other noted exponents are Leonardo Boff of Brazil, Jon Sobrino of El Salvador, and Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay.\n\nThe influence of liberation theology within the Catholic Church diminished after proponents using Marxist concepts were admonished by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) in 1984 and 1986. The Vatican criticized certain strains of liberation theology – without actually identifying any particular strain – for focusing on institutional dimensions of sin to the exclusion of the individual; and for allegedly misidentifying the church hierarchy as members of the privileged class.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been proved that this color solid comprises all the object colors producible under illumination of that spectral power distribution with one unit luminous flux, and the volume of the color solid determines the upper limit for the number of the object colors producible under the given spectral power distribution with one unit luminous flux.

The cultural heritage of Nepal has evolved over the centuries. This multi-dimensional heritage bounds the diversities of Nepal's ethnic, tribal, and social groups, and it expresses in music and dance; art and craft; folklore and folktales; languages and literature; philosophy and religion; festivals and celebration; foods and drinks. Its culture is mostly influenced by Indian culture and Tibetan culture.\n\nLegends state that dances in this country originated in the abode of Lord Shiva — the Himalayas, where he performed the tandava dance. This indicates that dance traditions of Nepal are very ancient and unique. With altitudes and ethnicity, the dances of Nepal slightly change in style as well as in the costumes. The Dishka, a dance performed at weddings, includes intricate footwork and arm movements. Accompanying music and musical instruments change in tune with the themes, which revolve around topics like harvesting of crops, marriage rites, war stories, a lonely girl’s yearning for her love, and several other themes and stories from everyday life in the villages. The famous Tharu stick dances, and the crazy peacock dance are two highlights, but there are plenty of other surprises. Expect to be invited to join in the dancing, as the evening reaches its climax.\n\nAs per the 2011 census, 123 languages are spoken in Nepal. Nepal's linguistic heritage has evolved from three major language groups: Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman, and indigenous. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as mother tongue) are Nepali (44.6%), Maithili (11.7%), Bhojpuri(6%), Tharu (5.8%), Tamang (5.1%), Nepal Bhasa (3.2%), Magar (3%) and Bajjika (3%) Kirat-Sunuwar, Limbu, Rai, Gurung, .\n\nNepali, written in Devanagari script, is the official national language and serves as \"lingua franca\" among Nepalese ethno-linguistic groups. Extinct languages of Nepal include Kusunda, MaWalinga and Waling\n\nReligions and philosophy of Nepal\nThe 2001 census identified 80.6% of the population being Hindu. Buddhism was practiced by about 11% of the population (although many people labelled Hindu or Buddhist often practice a syncretic blend of Hinduism, Buddhism, and/or animist traditions). About 3.2% practice Islam and 3.6% of the population follows the indigenous Kirant religion. Christianity is practiced officially by less than 0.5%.\n\nHindu and Buddhist traditions in Nepal go back more than two millennia. In Lumbini, Buddha was born, and Pashupatinath temple, Kathmandu, is an old and famous Shiva temple of Hindus. Nepal has several other temples and Buddhist monasteries, as well as places of worship of other religious groups. Traditionally, Nepalese philosophical thoughts are ingrained with the Hindu and Buddhist philosophical ethos and traditions, which include elements of Kashmir Shaivism, Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, works of Karmacharyas of Bhaktapur, and tantric traditions. Tantric traditions are deep rooted in Nepal, including the practice of animal sacrifices. Five types of animals, always male, are considered acceptable for sacrifice: water buffalo, goats, sheep, chickens, and ducks. Cows are very sacred animals and are never considered acceptable for sacrifice.\n\nSeveral of the festivals of Nepal last from one to several days. As a predominantly Hindu and Buddhist nation, most of the Nepalese festivals are religious ones. The festivals of Nepal have their roots in Hinduism as 82% of the population of the country is Hindu. Buddhism, the second-largest religion of the nation which accounts for 9% of the population, has influenced the cultural festivals of Nepal. Dashain or Dusshera is the longest and the most important festival of Nepal. Generally Dashain falls in late September to mid-October, right after the end of the monsoon season. It is \"a day of Victory over Demons\". The Newars celebrate the festival as Mohani. Tihar or Diwali, Holi, Saraswati Puja, Rakshabandhan, Bhai Dooj, Janmashtami, Kali Puja, Gai Jatra, Nag Panchami, Teej, Chhath, Kartik Poornima, Maghe Sankranti, Ganesh Chaturthi, Maha Shivratri and Chhechu are other widely celebrated important festivals of Nepal. New Year's Day of the lunar calendar Nepal Sambat occurs in November. Several Jatras take place throughout the year and public holidays are declared in some regions.\n\nOther important festivals include Buddha Purnima (the celebration of the birth of Buddha) Maha Shivaratri (a festival of Lord Shiva) and during Maha Shivaratri festivities, some people consume excessive drinks and smoke charas. Sherpas, mostly located at higher altitudes and in the Mount Everest region, celebrate \"Mani Rimdu\", for \"the good of the world\".\n\nMost festivals include dancing and music, and a variety of special foods are consumed during festivals and on special occasions.\n\nThe Sagan ceremony is the ritualized presentation of five food items (boiled egg, smoked fish, meat, lentil cake and rice wine) to a person which is done to bring good fortune as per Tantric tradition.\n\nNepal Sampada Sangha (Nepal Heritage Society) has compiled an inventory of 1,262 significant architectural and archeological sites in Nepal outside Kathmandu Valley.\n\nKabbadi and Dandi Biyo are national games of Nepal. But now people love cricket, basketball and football as well in Nepal.\nFor more information, read Sports in Nepal\n\nDandi Biyo is the National Game of Nepal. It consists two piece of stick one is called Dandi and another is Biyo. Dandi hits biyo and hitman measures the distance between Dandi and Biyo.\n\nNepal has been a member of the International Federation of Basketball (FIBA) since 2000 and is FIBA Asia's youngest member. Yet, its national team has already established itself as a regional presence as it won two bronze medals at the SABA Championship.\n\n\n"}

It was released by United Artists and is a sequel to the film \"Mandingo\", released in 1975. The film stars Warren Oates, Pam Grier, Ken Norton, and was directed by Steve Carver.\n\nThis film picks up the story 15 years after the events of the first film. Drum (Norton) has been born to a white prostitute (Vega), who raises him with her black lesbian lover (Kelly). Drum grows up to be a fighter and is often forced to bare-knuckle-box other slaves for the entertainment of the owners, one of whom is a gay Frenchman named Bernard DeMarigny (Colicos). DeMarigny wants to sleep with Drum, but his advances are rejected by the slave and DeMarigny vows revenge against Drum. Drum and his friend Blaise (Kotto) are eventually sold to plantation owner Hammond Maxwell (Oates) and are both taken to his plantation to work. Regine (Grier) is purchased by Maxwell as well and is taken to the plantation for his own personal desires as a bedwench.\n\nAfter arriving at Maxwell's plantation, Regine is set up in the bedroom above Hammond. Augusta Chauvel (Lewis), Maxwell's fiancé is jealous and has other plans for Regine. Maxwell's daughter Sophie (Smith) wants to sleep with Drum, but he won't for fear of being killed. Sophie also attempts to sleep with Blaise and after being rejected, tells her father that Blaise has raped her, which is a lie. Blaise is put in chains and Maxwell decides that he must be castrated for the alleged rape.\n\nMeanwhile, a dinner party has been arranged to celebrate the engagement of Maxwell and Chauvel. DeMarigny has been invited to attend the celebration and the guests end up discussing the best way to castrate a slave at the dinner party. While the party is taking place, Drum frees Blaise from his chains and there ends up being a violent uprising from the slaves at the engagement party. DeMarigny shoots Blaise during the fighting and Drum in turn grabs hold of DeMarigny's privates and rips them off. Both slaves and slavers are killed during the battle, but Maxwell and Chauvel are all saved by Drum. In appreciation for saving his family, Maxwell sets Drum free and sends him running into the night, which is the final scene of the movie, Drum running away into the unknown.\n\nThe film was initially being directed by Burt Kennedy, but he was replaced due to creative differences with the executive producer, Dino De Laurentiis. Carver then took over as director with only four days of preparation, the film's print made use of material filmed by both Kennedy and Carver.\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Life on the old plantation was horrendous, I agree, but movies like this are less interested in information than titillation, which, in turn, reflects contemporary obsessions rather more than historical truths.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1448459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1448459", "title": "Ethnopoetics", "text": "Ethnopoetics\n\nEthnopoetics is a method of recording text versions of oral poetry or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic lines, verses, and stanzas (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include Jerome Rothenberg, Dennis Tedlock, and Dell Hymes. Ethnopoetics is considered a subfield of ethnology, anthropology, folkloristics, stylistics, linguistics, and literature and translation studies.\n\nJerome Rothenberg coined the term ethnopoetics in the 1960s. According to Catherine S. Quick, Rothenberg had recognized that “most translations of Native American oral traditions . . . failed to capture the power and beauty of the oral performances on the written page,” especially when “Western poetic styles” were imposed upon these written texts (1999, 96). Rothenberg’s influence has increased public awareness of the rich narrative and poetic traditions of cultures all over the world.\n\nThe development of ethnopoetics as a separate subfield of study was largely pioneered from the middle of the 20th century by anthropologists and linguists such as Dennis Tedlock and Dell Hymes. Both Tedlock and Hymes used ethnopoetic analysis to do justice to the artistic richness of Native American verbal art, and while they have disagreed on some analytic details, they agree on the fundamental issues and purposes of ethnopoetics.\n\nOn the one hand, Dennis Tedlock argues not only that pauses in oral performances indicate where poetic line breaks should occur in the written texts, which he compares to musical scores, but also that words on the page should be formatted to reflect the more subtle qualities of speech used in oral performances. Tedlock explain his perspective in this way,\nAn ethnopoetic score [or text] not only takes account of the words but silences, changes in loudness and tone of voice, the production of sound effects, and the use of gestures and props. . . . Ethnopoetics remains open to the creative side of performance, valuing features that may be rare or even unique to a particular artist or occasion.\n\nIn other words, Tedlock argues that by visually representing oral performance features in the written texts, ethnopoetic methods more accurately convey the aesthetic qualities of the performance than uniformly formatted text in prose paragraphs ever could. Tedlock himself defines ethnopoetics as “a decentered poetics, an attempt to hear and read the poetries of distant others, outside the Western [poetic] tradition as we know it now.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Dell Hymes believes that even previously dictated texts retain significant structural patterns of poetic repetition that “are the ‘reason why’” storytellers use pauses in their oral performances (1999, 97–98). Hymes’s ethnopoetic theories focus on repetitions in the grammar and syntax of transcribed and translated texts that he suggest can still be analyzed and retranslated. For example, accordingly to folklorist Barre Toelken, the poetic beauty and power of Native American texts like “The Sun's Myth” have been restored “because a dedicated anthropological folklorist and linguist, Dell Hymes, dedicated a good part of his life to resuscitating a dry, written text collected . . . by a long-dead anthropologist [i.e., Franz Boas] and stored away in a dusty volume” (2003, 122). When Hymes retranslated “The Sun’s Myth,” he recovered the poetic and stylistic devices that were used in the original recorded performance, but which had been lost in the myth’s earlier translation by Franz Boas.\n\nHymes’ ethnopoetics revolves around a conception of narratives as primarily organized in terms of \"formal\" and \"aesthetic\"—‘poetic’—patterns, not in terms of content or thematic patterns. Narrative is therefore to be seen as a form of action, of performance, and the meanings it generates are effects of performance. Narratives, seen from this perspective, are organized in lines and in groups of lines (verses, stanzas), and the organization of lines in narratives is a kind of implicit patterning that creates narrative effect. . . . Content, in other words, is an effect of the formal organization of a narrative: What there is to be told emerges out of how it is being told. (Blommaert 2007, 216)\n\nAlso, understanding the native language of oral performers is essential for accurate, ethnopoetic translation of their words into written texts. For example, folklorist Barre Toelken explains that Hymes’s “knowledge of the extant Chinookan languages” helped him to “notice stylistic devices that highlighted certain actions and themes and even performance styles that brought scenes into sharp focus” (2003, 122). In other words, without his knowledge of the native language of oral performers, Hymes could not have placed his ethnopoetic translation of “The Sun’s Myth” within its specific Native American cultural context.\n\nVarious other writers and poets can be said to have contributed to the field of ethnopoetics as an aesthetic movement. For example, Tristan Tzara created calligrams and William Bright worked with the Karuk tribe to preserve their native language. However, within the fields of linguistics, folkloristics, and anthropology, ethnopoetics refers to a particular method of analyzing the linguistic features and syntactical structures of oral literature (such as poetry, myths, narratives, folk tales, ceremonial speeches, etc.) in ways that pay attention to poetic patterns within speech. Overall, then, ethnopoetic methods and theories strive to capture on the written page the unique aesthetic elements of individual cultures’ oral poetry and narrative performance traditions, or what folklorists would call their verbal lore.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11529567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11529567", "title": "Franz Kafka bibliography", "text": "Franz Kafka bibliography\n\nFranz Kafka, a German-language writer of novels and short stories, regarded by critics as one of the most influential authors of the 20th century, was trained as a lawyer and was employed by an insurance company, writing only in his spare time.\n\nKafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close female friends, including his father, his fiancée Felice Bauer, and his youngest sister Ottla.\n\nOnly a few of Kafka's works were published during his lifetime: the story collections ' (\"Contemplation\") and ' (\"A Country Doctor\"), and individual stories (such as \"\" (\"The Metamorphosis\")) in literary magazines. He prepared the story collection ' (\"A Hunger Artist\") for print, but it was not published until after his death. Kafka's unfinished works, including his novels ', ' and ' (also known as \"\", \"The Man Who Disappeared\"), were published posthumously, mostly by his friend Max Brod, who ignored Kafka's wish to have the manuscripts destroyed. Brod also published letters, diaries and aphorisms.\n\nMany of Kafka's works have uncertain dates of writing and/or were written over long periods of time. In such cases the year the writing of the work began is used. Year and place of the first publication is shown. For many works the German text is available, for several works also an English translation. It is linked in columns \"de\" (short for \"deutsch\", German) and \"en\" (short for English).\n\nKafka often made extensive use of a characteristic particular to the German language allowing for long sentences that sometimes can span an entire page. Kafka's sentences then deliver an unexpected impact just before the full stop—that being the finalizing meaning and focus. This is achieved due to the construction of certain sentences in German which require that the verb be positioned at the end of the sentence. Such constructions are difficult to duplicate in other languages, so it is up to the resourceful translator to provide the reader with the same (or at least equivalent) effect found in the original text. German's more flexible word order is not the only problem translating German into other languages. German also lacks an informal language register, uses modal connectives, and syntactic structures which can be translated in more than one way. Kafka did not write in standard High German, but rather in a Praguean German heavily influenced by the Yiddish and Czech languages. This has led philosophers Deleuze and Guattari to describe Kafka's linguistic style as \"deterritorialized\", characterized by a \"withered vocabulary\" and an \"incorrect syntax\".\n\nGerman sentences also have a different syntactic structure. Unlike English, German is a verb-final language, which places the main verb of a verb string (e.g., \"transformed\" in \"had been transformed\") at the end of a phrase. The difference can be seen in the contrast between the original German version of the first sentence in Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\":\n\nAnother virtually insurmountable problem facing translators is how to deal with the author's intentional use of ambiguous idioms and words that have several meanings which result in writings difficult to precisely translate. One such instance is found in the first sentence of \"The Metamorphosis\". English translators have often sought to render the word \"Ungeziefer\" as \"insect\"; in today's German it means vermin. It is sometimes used colloquially to mean \"bug\" – a very general term, unlike the scientific sounding \"insect\". Kafka had no intention of labeling Gregor, the protagonist of the story, as any specific thing, but instead wanted to convey Gregor's disgust at his transformation.\nTranslators have chosen numerous inexact and unsatisfactory ways to represent \"[zu einem] ungeheuren Ungeziefer\", unable to convey the repetition of the first two syllables and the equal four syllables of the two words in German:\n\nAnother example is Kafka's use of the German noun \"Verkehr\" in the final sentence of \"The Judgment\". Literally, \"Verkehr\" means intercourse and, as in English, can have either a sexual or non-sexual meaning; in addition, it is used to mean transport or traffic. The sentence can be translated as: \"At that moment an unending stream of traffic crossed over the bridge\". What gives added weight to the obvious double meaning of 'Verkehr' is Kafka's confession to Brod that when he wrote that final line, he was thinking of \"a violent ejaculation\".\n\n"}
{"id": "5622164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5622164", "title": "Gaiety Theatre, London", "text": "Gaiety Theatre, London\n\nThe Gaiety Theatre was a West End theatre in London, located on Aldwych at the eastern end of the Strand. The theatre was first established as the Strand Musick Hall (sic) in 1864 on the former site of the Lyceum Theatre. In 1868, it became known as the Gaiety Theatre and was, at first, known for music hall and then for musical burlesque, pantomime and operetta performances. From 1868 to the 1890s, it had a major influence on the development of modern musical comedy.\n\nUnder the management of John Hollingshead until 1886, the theatre had early success with \"Robert the Devil\", by W. S. Gilbert, followed by many other burlesques of operas and literary works. Many of the productions starred Nellie Farren. Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque \"Little Jack Sheppard\" (1885–86), produced together with his successor, George Edwardes. Edwardes's first show, \"Dorothy\", became a long-running hit. In the 1880s and 90s, the theatre had further success with a number of burlesques with original scores by the theatre's music director, Wilhelm Meyer Lutz, including \"Faust up to Date\" (1888), \"Carmen up to Data\" (1890) and \"Cinder Ellen up too Late\" (1891).\n\nIn the 1890s, the theatre introduced new style of musical theatre in London now referred to as the Edwardian musical comedy. These shows employed female dancers known as the Gaiety Girls and were extraordinarily popular, inspiring imitations at other London theatres. A success in this genre was \"The Shop Girl\" (1894), which was followed by many \"girl\"-themed musicals. The building was demolished in 1903, and the theatre was rebuilt at the corner of Aldwych and The Strand. More hit musicals followed. When Edwardes died in 1915, Robert Evett, took over the management of the theatre and had a number of further successes, notably \"Theodore & Co\" (1916) and \"Going Up\" (1918). By 1939 and in need of refurbishment, the theatre closed and stood empty during World War II. The building suffered extensive bomb damage during air raids and stood empty until it was demolished in 1956.\n\nThe theatre was financed by a joint stock company and built in 1864 as the Strand Musick Hall by Bassett and Keeling. This large theatre, with over 2,000 seats, was built at a time when many new theatres were being built in London. Unlike at many other music halls, the proprietors decided to ban smoking and drinking within the hall, and these activities were accommodated in the adjacent saloons.\n\nA novel gas lighting system was incorporated in the hall, using prisms and mirrors to create a soft light. Exhausting the heat of the gas jets drew fresh air into the building. The house was approached through an ambitious arcade, from the Strand. This was never successful and, with the theatre, was demolished to allow the building of the Aldwych.\n\nIn 1868, the theatre was sumptuously rebuilt by John Hollingshead as the Gaiety Theatre (announcing its dramatic policy in its name), on a nearby prominent site at the centre of the Aldwych, facing the eastern end of the Strand. It was designed by the theatre architect C. J. Phipps, who also designed the Gaiety Theatre (1871) in Dublin. A restaurant operated in the building, and patrons could eat before seeing the show and then go directly to their seats without having to worry about the weather outside.\n\nThe Gaiety Theatre opened on 21 December 1868, with \"On the Cards\" and several companion pieces, including the successful \"Robert the Devil\", by W. S. Gilbert, a burlesque of the opera \"Robert le Diable\". The theatre was a venue primarily for burlesque, variety, continental operetta and light comedy under the management of John Hollingshead from 1868 to 1886, including several operettas by Jacques Offenbach and musical burlesques arranged by the theatre's music director, Wilhelm Meyer Lutz. Gilbert also wrote \"An Old Score\" for the theatre in 1869.\n\nNellie Farren soon became the theatre's star \"principal boy\" in all the burlesques and played in other comedies. She and comic Fred Leslie starred at the theatre for over 20 years, with Edward Terry for much of that period. Her husband, Robert Soutar was an actor, stage manager and writer for the theatre. A typical evening at the Gaiety might include a three-act comic play, a dramatic interlude, a musical extravaganza, which might also include a ballet or pantomime (in the tradition of a Harlequinade). During such four-hour-long bills-of-fare, regular patrons might skip an item on the programme to eat in one of the theatre's plush restaurants, play billiards in the on-site Billiard Room or drink in one of its several bars.\nIn 1870, H. J. Byron's \"Uncle Dick's Darling\" starred a young Henry Irving. This was the last play that theatre buff Charles Dickens saw before his death. Irving also played in the popular and frequently played comical interlude, \"The Trial of Mr. Pickwick\", with Gaiety favourites J. L. Toole and Nellie Farren, who played Sam Weller. \"Thespis\", the first collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, played at the theatre in 1871, with Farren as Mercury and J. L. Toole in the title role. Offenbach's \"Les deux aveugles\" played in 1872, starring Fred Sullivan. Two Dion Boucicault plays produced here in the early 1870s were \"Night and Morning\" and \"Led Astray\". Among other burlesques written by Byron for the theatre from 1876 to 1879, he travestied Boucicault's \"Don Caesar de Bazan\" as \"Little Don Caesar de Bazan\". In the late 1870s, the theatre became the first to install electric lighting on its frontstage.\n\nOn 15 December 1880, the theatre presented \"Quicksands\", the first major English language adaptation of a drama by Henrik Ibsen. It was adapted by W. H. Vernon from Ibsen's \"The Pillars of Society\". Lutz and Robert Reece's version of \"The Forty Thieves\" was performed in 1880 (following an 1878 charity production of the same story), and \"Aladdin\" in 1881. In 1883, F. C. Burnand wrote a burlesque of \"The Tempest\" called \"Ariel\" for the theatre. \"Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed\" was another 1883 burlesque. Hollingshead's last production at the theatre was the burlesque \"Little Jack Sheppard\" (1885–86), produced together with his successor, George Edwardes. Hollingshead called himself a \"licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, Shakespeare, taste and musical glasses.\"\n\nEdwardes's first show was \"Dorothy\". Although \"Dorothy\" called itself a comic opera, as did most of the British musical works of the era that were neither burlesque, pantomime nor low farce, \"Dorothy\" incorporated some of the elements that US duo Harrigan and Hart were using on Broadway, integrating music and dance into the story line of the comedy. Edwardes sold that production, but it went on to become the longest-running hit that the musical stage had ever seen. Edwardes then returned the theatre to burlesque for a half dozen more years. However, in the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognise. Edwardes expanded the format, adding an original score composed chiefly by Meyer Lutz, and the shows were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.\n\nThese \"new burlesques\" included \"Little Jack Sheppard\" (1885), \"Monte Cristo Jr.\" (1886), \"Miss Esmeralda\" (1887), \"Faust up to Date\" (1888), \"Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué\" (1888), \"Carmen up to Data\" (1890), \"Joan of Arc\" by Adrian Ross and J. L. Shine (1891) and \"Cinder Ellen up too Late\" (1891). John D'Auban acted as the theatre's ballet-master and choreographed the Gaiety burlesques and other pieces from 1868 to 1891. Comedian E. J. Lonnen joined the Gaiety for many of Lutz's burlesques. After these, however, the age of burlesque was coming to an end, and with the retirement of Nellie Farren and Fred Leslie, it was essentially over.\nFor \"Joan of Arc\", Edwardes had hired a young writer, Adrian Ross, who next wrote a less baudy, more lightly comic piece, similar to \"Dorothy\", with a minimum of plot, focusing on songs with clever lyrics, \"In Town\" (1892), with stylish costumes and urbane, witty banter. Edwardes also engaged Ivan Caryll as resident composer and music director at the Gaiety and soon put Caryll together with the writing team of Owen Hall, Harry Greenbank, Ross and Lionel Monckton. Edwardes and this team created a series of musical shows similar to \"Dorothy\", but taking its lighter, breezier style a step further. These shows featured fashionable characters, tuneful music, romantic lyrics, witty banter and pretty dancing. The success of the first of these, \"A Gaiety Girl\" (1893), which played at other theatres, confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.\n\nFor the next two decades, the \"girl\" musicals packed the Gaiety Theatre, including titles like \"The Shop Girl\" (1894), \"My Girl\" (1896), \"The Circus Girl\" (1896), and \"A Runaway Girl\" (1898). These musicals were imitated at other theatres. A particular attraction of the Gaiety shows was the beautiful, dancing Gaiety Girls. These were fashionable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses from the burlesques. Gaiety Girls were polite, well-behaved young women and became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood. Some became popular leading actresses. The young ladies appearing in George Edwardes's shows became so popular that wealthy gentlemen, termed \"Stage Door Johnnies\", would wait outside the stage door hoping to escort them to dinner. In some cases, a marriage into society and even the nobility resulted. Edwardes arranged with Romano's restaurant, on the Strand, for his girls to dine there at half-price. It was good exposure for the girls and made Romano's the centre of London's night-life.\nAlan Hyman, an expert on burlesque theatre who penned the 1972 book \"The Gaiety Years\", wrote:\n\nThe building was demolished in 1903 as part of the road widening of the East Strand and the new Aldwych-Kingsway road development, and Edwardes quickly built the \"New Gaiety Theatre\" at the corner of Aldwych and the Strand. \"The Orchid\" (1903) opened the new theatre, followed by \"The Spring Chicken\" (1905), \"The Girls of Gottenberg\" (1907), \"Our Miss Gibbs\" (1909), \"Peggy\" (1911), \"The Sunshine Girl\" (1912), \"The Girl on the Film\" (1913), \"Adele\" (1914), and \"After the Girl\" (1914).\n\nPerhaps to balance the \"girl\" musicals for which the Gaiety was famous, Edwardes also presented a series of \"boy\"-themed musicals, such as \"The Messenger Boy\" (1900), \"The Toreador\" (1901, which introduced Gertie Millar), \"Two Naughty Boys\" (1906), \"The New Aladdin\" (1906), \"Havana\" (1908). Later, George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard produced a number of successes at the theatre, including \"Tonight's the Night\" (1915) and \"Theodore & Co\" (1916). Many of these popular musicals toured after their runs at the Gaiety, both in the British provinces and internationally. Leopold Wenzel conducted during the Edwardian period, leaving the theatre in 1913.\n\nEdwardes died in 1915, leaving his estate indebted and the theatre (as well as Edwardes' other theatres, including Daly's Theatre), in the hands of Robert Evett, formerly a leading tenor of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Manuel Klein was music director at the Gaiety for several years beginning in 1915. Under Evett's management, the theatre prospered with another hit, \"Going Up\" (1918), followed by \"The Kiss Call\" (1919), and \"Faust on Toast\" (1921). In 1922, Evett produced Gaiety adaptations of \"Catherine\" and \"The Last Waltz\", a work of which he was co-author. The same year, the revue \"Pins and Needles\" opened starring the French beauty Agnès Souret and had a run of nine months before transferring to the Shubert Theatre, New York. In 1924, Evett produced \"Our Nell\", the revised version of \"Our Peg\".\n\nMusicals continued at the Gaiety. In 1929, \"Love Lies\", by Stanley Lupino and Arthur Rigby, starring Cyril Ritchard and Madge Elliott, had a successful run at the theatre. In the 1930s, the theatre played works such as \"Sporting Love\" (1934) by composer and pianist Billy Mayerl, also with Lupino, which ran for 302 performances. The last show at the theatre was the farce \"Running Riot\", in 1939.\n\nBy 1938 the Gaiety Theatre was in need of refurbishment. However, the theatre no longer conformed to the then current licensing regulations, and so extensive modernisation was required. This was not considered to be financially viable and in 1939 the Gaiety Theatre closed. The interior fittings were stripped from the building, and sold at auction. Standing empty during World War II, the building suffered further damage as a result of bombing during air raids.\n\nIn 1946 the shell of the Gaiety Theatre was purchased by Lupino Lane for £200,000. It was the intention to rebuild the theatre and make it, once again, a centre of musical comedy. Although restoration did commence, it was found that the structural problems were worse than expected and the work discontinued. The building was once again sold, resulting in it being demolished in 1956 and replaced by an office development.\n\nFrom 2006, a new luxury hotel was being built on the site, the Silken Hotel, designed by Foster & Partners. At the rear, one of the walls of the old restaurant, which has listed building status, was being incorporated into all the new development. However, work on the hotel was halted in 2008 when the developers went bankrupt.\n\n\n\n"}

Stanley Moss, a British soldier, writer and traveller. It describes an operation in Crete during the Second World War to capture German general Heinrich Kreipe. Moss kept a diary during the war years and based his book on it. The 2014 edition includes an introduction by one of Moss's children and an afterword by Patrick Leigh Fermor.\n\nThe story was made into a 1957 film with the same title starring Dirk Bogarde by the British writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.\n\nMoss recounted his and Patrick Leigh Fermor’s activities during the Second World War as agents in Crete of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), notably their extraordinary kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe, Commander of the 22nd Air Landing Infantry Division that was occupying Crete, and his removal to Cairo (and British war forces) in 1944. The manuscript was written in early 1945 but was censored by the Head of SOE, Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins (CD), by instruction to Colin Mackenzie (BB100), Head of Force 136. When the book was finally published in 1950, it was selected by W. Somerset Maugham as one of the best three books of that year writing,\"more thrilling than any detective story I can remember, and written in a modest and most engaging manner\". The book was chosen to lead the BBC's famous radio series \"Now it can be told\" of 1950.

Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The Special Operations Executive (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local resistance in harrying German occupying forces.\n\nOn 4 February 1944, Major Patrick Leigh Fermor and Captain William Stanley Moss and two Cretan SOE agents left Egypt by plane for Crete. Their intention was to parachute into Crete but after arriving at the drop zone, only Leigh Fermor was able to parachute successfully. The others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to Egypt. On landing Leigh Fermor was met by a group from the Cretan resistance, with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the SOE team. After three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two-month period, Moss and the other two arrived by Motor Launch ML 842 on 4 April 1944. They were met on the beach by Leigh Fermor and another SOE agent, Sandy Rendel.\n\nTheir target General Müller was replaced by General Kreipe just before they arrived. The team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the German commanding officer. The SOE team included a number of Cretans; 'Anthony' (Antonis Papaleonidas), 'Micky' (Michalis Akoumianakis) and Grigorios Chnarakis. Micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite Kreipe's residence, the Villa Ariadne, in the village of Knossos. The team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction. Dressed as a Cretan shepherd, Leigh Fermor travelled on the local bus to check Knossos and the area around the German headquarters. He decided that the German headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate. After a few days of alternately observing the actions of the General, they finalized the details of the abduction. The plan was for the two British officers, dressed as corporals in the \"Feldgendarmerie\" (German military police), to stop the general's car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point.\n\nOn the night of 26 April 1944, the two British officers stopped the General's car before the Villa Ariadne. When the car stopped, Leigh Fermor took care of Kreipe and Moss knocked the driver out with his cosh. Moss drove the team and the General in the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in Heraklion before leaving Leigh Fermor to abandon the car. When Leigh Fermor left the car, he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by British Commandos so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population.\n\nWith his Cretan escorts, Moss set off with the General across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British motor launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. On 14 May 1944, the SOE team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near Rodakino, possibly Peristeres beach, on the southern side of the island. They were transported to safety, landing at Mersa Matruh in Egypt.\n\nAfter the war, a member of Kreipe’s staff reported how, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by, “Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.” Post War correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the General’s car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.\n\nThe book was due to be published in Germany in 1950. Kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to escape to Moss and Leigh Fermor as described by Moss in the book. Kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in Germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue. Leigh Fermor's report after the operation and the publication of his account of the abduction published in 2015 both corroborated Moss's version of events.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

The formal gateway to the iwan is called \"pishtaq\", a Persian term for a portal projecting from the facade of a building, usually decorated with calligraphy bands, glazed tilework, and geometric designs. Since the definition allows for some interpretation, the overall forms and characteristics can vary greatly in terms of scale, material, or decoration. Iwans are most commonly associated with Islamic architecture; however, the form is Iranian in origin and was invented much earlier and fully developed in Mesopotamia around the third century CE, during the Parthian period of Persia. \n\nThe root of this term is Old Persian 'Apadana' (see Apadana palace at Persepolis) where king Darius I declares in an inscription, \"I, Darius, ... had this 'Apadana' constructed ...\". Apadana is a name given to this particular palace in modern literature, although the name simply implies a type of structure, the iwan, not a particular palace. The term in Old Persian means \"unprotected\" (â-pâd-ânâ), and the design allows the structure to be open to the elements on one side. At Persepolis, however, the 'apadana' takes the form of a veranda, that is, a flat roof held up by columns, rather than a vault — but still open to the elements on only one side. A comparable structure is found 2000 years later in Isfahan at the Palace of Chehel Sotoun. By the time of the Parthian and the Sasanian dynasties, the iwan had emerged as two types of structure: the old columned one, and a newer vaulted structure—both, however, carrying the same native name of apadana/iwan, because both types are \"unprotected\" (open on one side to the elements).\n\nIwans were a trademark of the Parthian Empire (247 BC–AD 224) and later the Sassanid architecture of Persia (224 -651), later finding their way throughout the Arab and Islamic architecture which started developing in 7th century AD, after the period of Muhammad (c. 570–632). This development reached its peak during the Seljuki era, when iwans became a fundamental unit in architecture, and later the Mughal architecture. The form is not confined to any particular function, and is found in buildings for either secular or religious uses, and in both public and residential architecture. \n\n\"Ivan\" is an alternative form of the name, used in Iran, reflecting the Persian pronunciation.\n\nMany scholars - including Edward Keall, André Godard, Roman Ghirshman, and Mary Boyce - discuss the invention of the iwan in Mesopotamia, the area around today's Iraq. Although debate remains among scholars as to how the iwan developed, there is a general consensus that the iwan evolved locally, and was thus not imported from another area. Similar structures, known as \"pesgams\", were found in many Zoroastrian homes in Yazd, where two or four halls would open onto a central court; however, it is not known whether these spaces were vaulted. \n\nThe feature which most distinctly makes the iwan a landmark development in the history of Ancient Near Eastern architecture is the incorporation of a vaulted ceiling. A vault is defined as a ceiling made from arches, known as arcuated, usually constructed with stone, concrete, or bricks. Earlier buildings would normally be covered in a trabeated manner, with post and lintel beams. However, vaulted ceilings did exist in the ancient world before the invention of the iwan, both within Mesopotamia and outside it. Mesopotamian examples include Susa, where the Elamites vaulted many of their buildings with barrel vaults, and Nineveh, where the Assyrians frequently vaulted their passages for fortification purposes. \n\nOutside Mesopotamia, a number of extant vaulted structures stand, including many examples from Ancient Egypt, Rome, and the Mycenaeans. For example, the Mycenaean Treasury of Atreus, constructed around 1250 BCE, features a large corbelled dome. Egyptian architecture began to use vaulting in its structures after the Third Dynasty, after around 2600 BCE, constructing very early barrel vaults using mud bricks.\n\nAlthough some scholars have asserted that the iwan form may have developed under the Seleucids, today most scholars agree that the Parthians were the inventors of the iwan. One of the earliest Parthian iwans was found at Seleucia (Seleucia-on-the-Tigris), located on the Tigris River, where the shift from post-and-lintel construction to vaulting occurred around the 1st century CE. Other early iwans have been suggested at Ashur, where two buildings containing iwan-like foundations were found. The first building, located near the ruins of a ziggurat, featured a three-iwan façade. The proximity of the building to a ziggurat suggests that it may have been used for religious preparations or rituals. It could also indicate a palatial building, as it was common for the ziggurat and palace to be situated next to one another in the Ancient Near East. What seems to be a palace courtyard had iwans on each side, which remained a common features well into Islamic times. \n\nThe second iwan building is located across a courtyard, and Walter Andrae, a German archaeologist, suggested that it served as an administrative building rather than as a religious center because there is no evidence of inscriptions or wall carvings. Although the absence of inscriptions or carvings does not equate necessarily to a civic function, it was not uncommon for iwans to serve a secular use, as they were frequently incorporated into palaces and community spaces. Other early sites including Parthian iwans include Hatra, the Parthian ruins at Dura Europos, and Uruk.\n\nThe Sasanian Persians also favored the iwan form, and adopted it into much of their architecture; however, they transformed the function. The Parthian iwan led to other spaces, but its primary function served as a room itself. In contrast, the Sasanian iwan served as a grand entranceway to a larger, more elegant space which was usually domed. Both the Parthian and Sasanian iwans were often elaborately decorated with inscriptions and sculpted reliefs including scenes of hunting, vegetal motifs, abstract, geometric patterns, and animal scenes. The reliefs’ style shows a blend of influences including other Near Eastern cultures, Roman, and Byzantine decorative traditions. For instance, the rock-cut iwan at Taq-i Bustan features Roman style figures, Eastern-inspired vegetal patterns and crenellations, and wide-eyed, stylized Byzantine-esque angels and mosaic interiors.\n\nThe most famous example of a Persian Sassanid iwan is the Taq-i Kisra (\"Iwan of Khosrau\"), part of a palace complex in Mada'in which is the only visible remaining structure of the ancient Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. It is near the modern town of Salman Pak, Iraq, on the Tigris River about twenty-five miles south of Baghdad. Construction began during the reign of Khosrau I after a campaign against the Eastern Romans in 540 AD. The arched iwan hall, open on the facade side, was about 37 meters high 26 meters across and 50 meters long, the largest vault ever constructed at the time. Early photographs and 19th-century drawings show that the remaining part of the hall has reduced since then.\n\nThe dating for the Taq-i Kisra has been debated throughout history; however, a variety of documents detailing the arrival of Byzantine sculptors and architects sent by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian, suggest that the correct date for the construction is around 540 CE. The 540 CE date suggests that the construction of the Taq-i Kisra, and perhaps Justinian’s “help” was in response to the victory of Sasanian king Khosrau I over Antioch in 540 CE, which is depicted in the mosaics decorating the interior of the Taq-i Kisra. The Taq-i Kisra was finally demolished for the most part by al-Mansur, who reused the bricks to build his own palace complex.\n\nIslamic art and architecture was also heavily influenced inspired by Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian designs, both due to the presence of extant examples and contact between cultures. For example, the Great Mosque of Damascus was built in the early eighth century CE on the site of a Roman Christian Church, and incorporates a nave-like element with a tall arcade and clerestory. The Sasanian Empire also had a tremendous impact on the development of Islamic architecture; however, there was some overlap between the Sasanians and the Muslims making it difficult at times to determine who was influencing whom.\n\nIslamic art and architecture borrows many Sasanian decorative motifs and architectural forms, including the iwan; however, the adoption of the iwan was not immediate. For example, the implementation of the standard four-iwan plan which has become standard in Islamic mosque design was not introduced until the twelfth century, long after its invention in the first century CE. Iwans were used frequently in Islamic non-religious architecture before the twelfth century, including houses, community spaces, and civic structures such as the bridge of Si-o-Se Pol in Isfahan. Furthermore, Islamic architecture incorporated the Sasanian placement for the iwan by making it a grand entrance to the prayer hall or to a mosque tomb, and often placing it before a domed space.\n\nAs well as often using numbers of iwans on the exterior of buildings, as at the Taj Mahal, iwans were often placed on all or several sides of internal spaces and courtyards, a form going back to Parthian times.\n\nOne of the first elaborate iwans used in an Islamic religious context can be found at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which dates from the 12th Century. The history of the evolution of the standard four-iwan plan has been debated by scholars, and some claim that it originated in madrasas, or religious schools designed to educate aristocratic children about Sunnism. However, the four-iwan plan was already in use in palace and temple architecture during both the Parthian and Sasanian periods. The use of iwans would continue to flourish in both mosques and secular spaces starting in the thirteenth century, and would become one of the most iconic features of Islamic architecture, as suggested by the elaborate seventeenth-century iwans in the Great Mosque at Isfahan.\n\nThe Great Iwan (or al-Iwan al-Kabir, Dar al-'Adl, Iwan of al-Nasir) of Cairo was a public and ceremonial space located in the southern section of the Saladin Citadel where the Mamluk sultan sat enthroned to administer justice, receive ambassadors, and carry out other duties of state. The structure used to be known as Dar al-'Adl during the reign of Saladin, the Mamluk ruler of the Bahri dynasty Al-Nasir Muhammad rebuilt the monumental structure twice, in 1315 and 1334. The Great Iwan was demolished by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the early 19th century.\n\nThe 19th century \"Description de l'Égypte\" depicted a square hypostyle structure with five parallel aisles and a dome. The building was open to the exterior on three sides through arcades, and the main façade was articulated with a large central arch flanked by two smaller arches on either side.\n\n\n\n"}

The work was pioneered by Justinus Kerner, who included klecksographs in his books of poetry. Since the 1890s, psychologists have used it as a tool for studying the subconscious, most famously Hermann Rorschach in his Rorschach inkblot test.\n\nSpots of ink are dropped onto a piece of paper and the paper is folded in half, so that the ink will smudge and form a mirror reflection in the two halves. The piece of paper is then unfolded so that the ink can dry, after which someone can guess the resemblance of the print to other objects. The inkblots tend to resemble images because of apophenia, the human tendency to see patterns in nature.\n\nJustinus Kerner invented this technique when he started accidentally dropping blots of ink onto paper due to failing eyesight. Instead of throwing them away, he found that intriguing shapes appeared if he unfolded the papers. He elaborated these shapes into intricate cartoons and used them to illustrate his poems. Kerner began a collection of klecksographs and poetry in 1857 titled \"Klecksographien\". His collection was not published until 1890 because of his death in 1862.\n\nIn 1896, a similar game was described in the United States by Ruth McEnery Stuart and Albert Bigelow Paine in a book titled \"Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures for Young and Old\". The book explained how to make inkblot monsters (\"gobolinks\") and use them as prompts for writing imaginative verse.\n\nAs early as 1895, Alfred Binet and his associate Victor Henri first suggested that inkblots might be used in psychological research, arguing that the interpretation of inkblots could be used to study variations in ‘involuntary imagination’.\n\nAs a child in Switzerland, Hermann Rorschach enjoyed klecksography so much that his friends nicknamed him \"Klecks\", meaning \"inkblot\". As a medical student, Rorschach studied under psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had taught Carl Jung. In studying Freud's work on dream symbolism, Rorschach was reminded of his youthful inkblot hobby. He then created his Rorschach test to see if people's reactions to inkblots could be used as a tool to uncover unconscious desires. The test is essentially a visual variation on Freud's verbal technique.\n\n"}

Bissonnette was diagnosed with multiple other disorders including an intellectual disability and schizophrenia. Bissonnette's art is found at the Musée de l'Art Brut in Switzerland and multiple private collections.\n\nAt age two, Bissonnette suffered from a high fever, which might have caused some kind of damage to his nervous system. By the time he was eight, he was sent to the Brandon Training School, which was Vermont's only institute for the mentally handicapped at the time. During his 10-year confinement at Brandon, he was diagnosed as autistic, schizophrenic, mentally retarded and clinically insane.\n\nDuring this time, he used concepts of art such as drawing and painting to help himself through self-expression. To him, it's a form of therapy as he was non-verbal since the age of three or four. By the time he was 18, he was then transferred to Vermont Psychiatric Hospital in Waterbury, Vermont, but was soon released by his sister, Sally, who learned about how Larry was physically abused at the institutes, and even receive scars. Bissonnette was then enrolled with an residential program for the developmentally disabled.\n\nIn 1991, Larry began communicating for the first time after more than 30 years by typing with an assistive device. Apart from his art, this was another option to express his feelings and thoughts. Throughout his years wandering around in public, Larry displayed a threatening appearance which led to some treating him like an outcast, according to Pascal Cheng who is Larry's aid. But, Larry is aware of this after releasing his thoughts through typing.\n\nIn 1998, Larry began his journey as a public speaker at several National Educational Conferences in which he spoken about autism, communication, and art. Despite being nonverbal, Larry uses his assistive-device typing skills to describe what he wishes to say. He says he is aware that everyone viewed and treated him like an outcast which made everyone realize he is the same as everyone else.\n\nIn 2010, Larry and another autism-rights speaker, Tracy Thresher, described others treating them as outcasts, and revealed that they are actually capable despite others' beliefs. With assistive devices and encouraging others on the autism spectrum about what they can do, others can learn that they are not freaks, but can reach out not only with words, but with courage to work with others including those who are non-autistic. The two men traveled the world and visited several nations such as Japan and Finland.\n\nLarry's success in public speaking brought him to the attention of various media. In 2005, Larry starred in his biographical film, \"My Classic Life as an Artist: A Portrait of Larry Bissonnette\", which earned an award. In 2011, Larry and his ally, Tracy, was in a documentary called \"Wretches and Jabberers\", and in 2012, they were both featured in an episode of the National Geographic \"Taboo\" television series which was titled \"Strange Behavior\".\n"}

It can serve as a \"sick note\" (documentation that an employee is unfit for work) or evidence of a health condition.\n\nAn aegrotat (; ) or sick note is a type of medical certificate excusing a student's absence from school for reasons of illness.\n\nMedical certificates are sometimes required to obtain certain health benefits from an employer, to make an insurance claim, for tax purposes, or for certain legal procedures. Medical certificates are used to indicate eligibility of activity, such as the use of disabled parking. Medical certificates can also be used to describe a medical condition a person has, such as blindness. Medical certificates are often used to certify that someone is free of contagious diseases, drug addiction, mental illness, or other health issues.\n\nHealth criteria are often required when making an application for something, such as an eye examination to get a driver's license. Other times medical criteria are presented voluntarily by an applicant in a self-assessment, without either a doctor or access to the person's medical record. Specific health criteria or medical history are required for certain jobs.\n\nIn the United States, most aviators are required to possess a valid medical certificate that certifies sound health as part of the requirements for piloting an airplane or helicopter. While airman certificates are issued for life, the medical certificate expires and must be renewed periodically in order continue flying privileges. Sport pilots may use a valid state driver's license in place of a medical certificate, and glider and hot air balloon pilots are not required to obtain them.\n\nThe term \"aegrotat\" (abbreviated as \"aegrot\") is used primarily in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations. In the context of British undergraduate degrees a student who is too ill to finish may be awarded an aegrotat degree if the student otherwise would have passed exams or other requirements.\n\nExcept in certain unique circumstances, a holder of a medical certificate in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration may not \"act as pilot in command or in any other capacity as a required flight crewmember of an aircraft\".\n\nA patient with conditions such as: measles, chicken-pox, hepatitis A, leprosy, typhoid fever, and whooping cough, can return to work immediately after their healing phase or medical tests. Almost always the patient may only be allowed to return to work upon submission of a medical certificate.\n\nSometimes, there are standards and procedures in place, for workers in a certain field to be eligible to receive a medical certificate. Any airman at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration must give their employees access to the National Driver Register. On top of this, other tests which are required for first-, second- and third-class airmen are: eye, ear/nose/throat/equilibrium, mental, neurologic, and cardiovascular.\n\n\"The India List and India Office List 1905\" explains that officers on \"Long Leave in Europe\" must, among other things, provide a medical certificate, which is obtained at the Medical Board of India Office.\n\n\"Practical Guide to Employees' State Insurance Act, Rules and Regulations\" explains that under the ESI Act, the employee must obtain a medical certificate via the ESI Dispensary/Hospital, which then gets deposited at the nearest office of the ESI Corporation.\n\nAs many illnesses can come about suddenly, sometimes the worker will not have enough time to receive a medical certificate, or may be too sick to obtain one. In other cases, the worker may not be bothered to go to the trouble of getting one, or may be lying about their illness and want to falsify a certificate to back up their story to their boss.\n\nThere have been discussions regarding whether it is okay to fire someone for submitting a fabricated medical certificates. In many cases, it is deemed wrong, such as in Australia where a bank officer was dismissed after handing in a forged certificate, which prompted a Fair Work Australia Commissioner to say they had a \"continued lack of regard for the truth\". Another example is a WA police officer who was stood down after committing the same offense. Sometimes it is not so black and white. In one case, a woman claimed she was \"coerced into falsifying [a] medical certificate [which ultimately led to her being fired] because she was 'being bullied and treated unfairly' by two managers\".\n\nThere are some companies that sell fake medical certificates. Although the site \"Doctors Note Store\" sells \"fake sick notes and medical certificates for workers in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom\", they add that the \"fakes are for 'novelty use only'\".\n\nAt Flinders University, \"providing a forged medical certificate\" is viewed as academic misconduct.\n\nIn New South Wales, medical professionals who \"deliberately issue a false, misleading or inaccurate certificate\" can be charged under the Medical Practice Act. This is in response to The New South Wales Medical Board \"receiving numerous complaints from employers, insurers, the courts, etc regarding the quality, accuracy and truthfulness of sickness certificates\".\n\nIn order to prove that one's medical certificate is authentic, the following should be done and taken into consideration:\n\n\n\n"}

For instance, like every day life in Paris, with similarities to Vertov’s “Man with a Movie Camera, the murdim Project also captures everyday scenes from daily life in a city. Only these images are not part of a typical “movie” in that you do not have to sit to look at. These are in fact images that go far beyond the usual A3, 16 x 9 and other 1080 sizes. Or, even to think of images that go further than kaleidoscopic computer graphics. 10 to 20 HDV cameras on each totem. Totems are stitched together and broadcast on LCD screens, with each camera aiming at a different part of the scene the same way one would shoot in panoramic photography\n\nJacques Davis, the artist behind murdim Project uses crowds and nature as his subjects. Living and working in Paris, France, Davis worked for 35 years as a photographer doing mostly large slide shows, later with video, and video walls. Be it swimming pools, demonstrations, political meetings, markets, and other gatherings as his subjects for the camera, crowds are the main focus. To view the crowds from afar as a totem, the viewer sees the strength, will and force of a crowd while at the same time one can see close-ups of thousands of very individually unique people.\n\nTo view go to http://www.rhizome.org/editorial/2447\n"}

{"id": "3261733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3261733", "title": "Pan's Labyrinth", "text": "Pan's Labyrinth\n\nPan's Labyrinth () is a 2006 Mexican/Spanish dark fantasy drama film written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. It was produced and distributed internationally by Esperanto Filmoj and Warner Bros., while Picturehouse handled US distribution rights.\n\nThe story takes place in Spain during the summer of 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown, abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with whom the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, animatronics, and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures.\n\nDel Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film \"The Devil's Backbone\" (2001), to which \"Pan's Labyrinth\" is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's DVD commentary. The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English, German and French titles refer specifically to the faun-like Greek deity Pan. However, del Toro has stated that the faun in the film is not Pan.\n\nThe film premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2006. In the United States and Canada, the film was given a limited release on 29 December 2006, with a wide release on 19 January 2007. \"Pan's Labyrinth\" opened to widespread critical acclaim. The film won numerous international awards, including three Academy Awards, three BAFTA Awards including Best Film Not in the English Language, the Ariel Award for Best Picture, the Saturn Awards for Best International Film and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Ivana Baquero and the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form.\n\nIn a fairy tale, Princess Moanna, whose father is the king of the underworld, visits the human world, where the sunlight blinds her and erases her memory. She becomes mortal and dies. The king believes that eventually, her spirit will return to the underworld, so he builds labyrinths (which act as portals) around the world in preparation for her return.\n\nIn 1944 Francoist Spain, protagonist Ofelia travels with her pregnant but sickly mother Carmen to meet Captain Vidal, her new stepfather. Vidal, the son of a famed commander who died in Morocco, believes strongly in Falangism and has been assigned to hunt down republican rebels.\n\nA large stick insect, which Ofelia believes to be a fairy, leads Ofelia into an ancient stone labyrinth, but she is stopped by Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes, who is secretly supporting her brother Pedro and other rebels. That night, the insect appears in Ofelia's bedroom, where it transforms to a fairy and leads her through the labyrinth. There, she meets the faun, who believes she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. He gives her three tasks to complete in order for her to acquire immortality and return to her kingdom. Meanwhile, Vidal murders two local farmers detained (erroneously) on suspicion of helping the rebels.\n\nOfelia completes the first task — retrieving a key from the belly of a giant toad — but becomes worried about her mother, whose condition is worsening. The faun gives Ofelia a mandrake root, which seems to ease Carmen's illness. Accompanied by three fairy guides, Ofelia then completes the second task—retrieving a dagger from the lair of the Pale Man, a child-eating monster. Although she was warned not to consume anything there, she eats two grapes, awakening the Pale Man. He eats two of the fairies and chases Ofelia, but she manages to escape. Infuriated at her disobedience, the faun refuses to give Ofelia the third task.\n\nVidal interrogates and tortures a captive rebel. He asks Doctor Ferreiro to tend to the captive, whom Ferreiro euthanizes instead. Vidal realizes that Ferreiro is a rebel collaborator and kills him. Simultaneously, Vidal catches Ofelia tending to the mandrake root, which he considers delusional. Carmen agrees and throws the root into the fire. She immediately develops painful contractions and dies giving birth to a son. \n\nVidal discovers that Mercedes is also a spy. Mercedes and Ofelia secretly leave but are caught. Ofelia, mistaken as a traitor, is locked in her bedroom, while Mercedes is taken to be interrogated and tortured. Mercedes frees herself, stabs Vidal, and rejoins the rebels. The faun returns to Ofelia to give her a chance for the third task and tells her to bring her baby brother into the labyrinth. Ofelia complies and Vidal pursues her as the rebels launch an attack on the outpost.\n\nOfelia meets the faun at the center of the labyrinth. The faun suggests drawing a few drops of the baby's blood, as completing the third task and opening the portal to the underworld requires the blood of an innocent. Ofelia refuses to harm her brother. Vidal finds Ofelia talking to the faun, whom he cannot see. The faun leaves, and Vidal takes the baby from Ofelia's arms before shooting her.\n\nVidal returns to the labyrinth's entrance, where he is met by the rebels. Knowing that he will be killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes says that the child will not even know his father's name, and Pedro shoots and kills Vidal.\n\nMercedes enters the labyrinth and comforts a motionless but breathing Ofelia. Drops of Ofelia's blood fall down the center of the spiral stone staircase onto an altar. Ofelia, well dressed and uninjured, then appears in a golden throne room. The king of the underworld says that she passed the real final test, which was to choose to spill her own blood rather than that of an innocent. The faun praises Ofelia for her choice, and addresses her as \"Her Majesty\". The queen of the underworld, her mother, invites Ofelia/Moanna to sit next to her father, and rule at his side. Back in the stone labyrinth (in the real world), Ofelia smiles as she dies.\n\nThe epilogue completes the tale of Princess Moanna, stating that she ruled wisely and left quiet traces of her time in the human realm \"visible only to those who know where to look.\"\n\n\nThe idea for \"Pan's Labyrinth\" came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, which he says are filled with \"doodles, ideas, drawings and plot bits\". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote a story about a pregnant woman who falls in love with a faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that \"for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'\". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that \"it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head\".\n\nDel Toro got the idea of the faun from childhood experiences with \"lucid dreaming\". He stated on \"The Charlie Rose Show\" that every midnight, he would wake up, and a faun would gradually step out from behind the grandfather's clock. Originally, the faun was supposed to be a classic half-man, half-goat faun fraught with beauty. But in the end, the faun was altered into a goat-faced creature almost completely made out of earth, moss, vines, and tree bark. He became a mysterious, semi-suspicious relic who gave both the impression of trustworthiness and many signs that warn someone to never confide in him at all.\n\nDel Toro has said the film has strong connections in theme to \"The Devil's Backbone\" and should be seen as an informal sequel dealing with some of the issues raised there. Fernando Tielve and Íñigo Garcés, who played the protagonists of \"The Devil's Backbone\", make cameo appearances as unnamed guerrilla soldiers in \"Pan's Labyrinth\". Some of the other works he drew on for inspiration include Lewis Carroll's \"Alice\" books, Jorge Luis Borges' \"Ficciones\", Arthur Machen's \"The Great God Pan\" and \"The White People\", Lord Dunsany's \"The Blessing of Pan\", Algernon Blackwood's \"Pan's Garden\" and Francisco Goya's works. In 2004, del Toro said: \"\"Pan\" is an original story. Some of my favourite writers (Borges, Blackwood, Machen, Dunsany) have explored the figure of the god Pan and the symbol of the labyrinth. These are things that I find very compelling and I am trying to mix them and play with them.\" It was also influenced by the illustrations of Arthur Rackham.\n\nDel Toro wanted to include a fairy tale about a dragon for Ofelia to narrate to her unborn brother. The tale involved the dragon, named Varanium Silex, who guarded a mountain surrounded by thorns, but at its peak is a blue rose that can grant immortality. The dragon and the thorns ward off many men though, who decide it is better to avoid pain than to be given immortality. Although the scene was thematically important, it was cut short for budget reasons.\n\nThere are differing ideas about the film's religious influences. Del Toro himself has said that he considers \"Pan's Labyrinth\" \"a truly profane film, a layman's riff on Catholic dogma\", but that his friend Alejandro González Iñárritu described it as \"a truly Catholic film\". Del Toro's explanation is \"once a Catholic, always a Catholic,\" however he also admits that the Pale Man's preference for children rather than the feast in front of him is intended as a criticism of the Catholic Church. Additionally, the priest's words during the torture scene were taken as a direct quote from a priest who offered communion to political prisoners during the Spanish Civil War: \"Remember my sons, you should confess what you know because God doesn't care what happens to your bodies; He already saved your souls.\"\n\nIn regards to whether or not the fantasy underworld was real or a product of Ofelia's imagination, del Toro stated in an interview that, while he believes it is real, the movie \"should tell something different to everyone. It should be a matter of personal discussion\". He then mentioned there were several clues in the movie indicating the underworld was indeed real.\n\nThe film was shot in a Scots Pine forest situated in the Guadarrama mountain range, Central Spain. Guillermo Navarro, the director of photography, said that \"after doing work in Hollywood on other movies and with other directors, working in our original language in different scenery brings me back to the original reasons I wanted to make movies, which is basically to tell stories with complete freedom and to let the visuals really contribute to the telling of the story\".\n\nThe pale man's eyes on his hands is a feature shared by the Japanese mythological monster the Tenome. Te-no-me means \"eyes on hands\".\n\n\"Pan's Labyrinth\" employs some computer-generated imagery in its effects, but mostly uses complex make-up and animatronics. The giant toad was inspired by \"The Maze\". Del Toro himself performed the noises. The mandrake root is a combination of animatronics and CGI. Del Toro wanted the fairies \"to look like little monkeys, like dirty fairies\", but the animation company had the idea to give them wings made of leaves.\n\nJones spent an average of five hours sitting in the makeup chair as his team of David Martí, Montse Ribé and Xavi Bastida applied the makeup for the Faun, which was mostly latex foam. The last piece to be applied was the pair of horns, which weighed ten pounds and were extremely tiring to wear. The legs were a unique design, with Jones standing on 20-cm-high lifts (8 in), and the legs of the Faun attached to his own. His lower leg was eventually digitally erased in post production. Servos in the head flapped the Faun's ears and blinked the eyes, and were remotely operated by David Martí and Xavi Bastida from DDT Especiales while on set. Del Toro told Jones to \"go rock star ... like a glam rocker. But less David Bowie, more Mick Jagger\".\n\nThe Captain's room, as shown in the scene where Captain Vidal is shaving, is supposed to resemble his father's watch, which del Toro says represents his troubled mind.\n\nA bout of weight loss on Del Toro's part inspired the physical appearance of the saggy-skinned Pale Man. In order to see while performing the part, Doug Jones had to look out of the character's nostrils, and its legs were attached to the front of the green leotard which Jones wore.\n\nThe film uses subtitles for its translation into other languages, including English. Del Toro wrote them himself, because he was disappointed with the subtitles of his previous Spanish film, \"The Devil's Backbone\". In an interview, he said that they were \"for the thinking impaired\" and \"incredibly bad\". He spent a month working with two other people, and said that he did not want it to \"feel like... watching a subtitled film\".\n\n\"Pan's Labyrinth\" was premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival on 27 May 2006. Its first premiere in an English-speaking country was at the London FrightFest Film Festival on 25 August 2006. Its first general release was in Spain on 11 October 2006, followed by a release in Mexico nine days later. On 24 November 2006 it had its first general English release in the United Kingdom; that month it was also released in France, Serbia, Belgium, Italy, Russia, Singapore and South Korea. It had a limited release in Canada and the United States on 29 December 2006, in Australia on 18 January 2007, in Taiwan on 27 April 2007, in Slovenia on 17 May 2007 and in Japan on 29 September 2007. Its widest release in the United States was in 1,143 cinemas.\n\nThe film was released on DVD on 12 March 2007 in the UK by Optimum Releasing in a two-disc special edition. The film was released in the United States on 15 May 2007 from New Line Home Entertainment in both single-disc and double-disc special edition versions, featuring an additional DTS-ES audio track not present on the UK version. Additionally, the film received a special limited edition release in South Korea and Germany. Only 20,000 copies of this edition were manufactured. It is presented in a digipak designed to look like the \"Book of Crossroads\". The Korean first edition contains two DVDs along with an art book and replica of Ofelia's key. The German special limited edition contains three DVDs and a book containing the movie's storyboard. \"Pan's Labyrinth\" was released for download on 22 June 2007 from Channel 4's on-demand service, 4oD.\n\nHigh definition versions of \"Pan's Labyrinth\" were released in December 2007 on both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD formats. New Line stated that due to their announcement of supporting Blu-ray exclusively, thus dropping HD DVD support with immediate effect, \"Pan's Labyrinth\" would be the only HD DVD release for the studio, and would be discontinued after current stock was depleted. Both versions had a PiP commentary while web extras were exclusive to the HD DVD version. In October 2016, The Criterion Collection re-released the movie on Blu-ray in the US, based on a newly graded 2K digital master supervised by Del Toro.\n\nRotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 95% based on 229 reviews with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"\"Pan's Labyrinth\" is \"Alice in Wonderland\" for grown-ups, with the horrors of both reality and fantasy blended together into an extraordinary, spellbinding fable.\" Based on reviews from 37 critics, it received a 98/100 score at Metacritic, making it Metacritic's highest-rated film of the 2000s decade and the second highest-rated movie of all time. At its Cannes Film Festival release, it received a 22-minute standing ovation, one of the longest in the festival's history. It also received a standing ovation at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, its first release in the Americas.\n\nMark Kermode, in \"The Observer\", labeled \"Pan's Labyrinth\" as the best film of 2006, describing it as \"an epic, poetic vision in which the grim realities of war are matched and mirrored by a descent into an underworld populated by fearsomely beautiful monsters\". Stephanie Zacharek wrote that the film \"works on so many levels that it seems to change shape even as you watch it\", and Jim Emerson called the film \"a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children\". Roger Ebert reviewed the film after his surgery and put it on his Great Movies list on 27 August 2007; when he compiled his belated top ten films of 2006, \"Pan's Labyrinth\" was #1, with him stating \"But even in a good year I'm unable to see everything. And I'm still not finished with my 2006 discoveries. I'm still looking at more 2007 movies, too, and that list will run as usual in late December. Nothing I am likely to see, however, is likely to change my conviction that the year's best film was \"Pan's Labyrinth\".\" \"The New Yorker\"<NOWIKI></NOWIKI>'s Anthony Lane took special note of the film's sound design, saying it \"discards any hint of the ethereal by turning up the volume on small, supercharged noises: the creak of the Captain's leather gloves... the nighttime complaints of floorboard and rafter...\"\n\nSome reviewers had criticisms. For \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\", David Elliott said \"the excitement is tangible\", but added that \"what it lacks is successful unity ... Del Toro has the art of many parts, but only makes them cohere as a sort of fevered extravaganza\". \"New York Press\" critic Armond White criticized the film saying that the \"superfluous addition of del Toro's fairy-tale sensibility to real human misery made that story insufferable [and that] only critics and fanboys (not the general public) fell for its titular allusion to Borges\".\nDuring its limited first three weeks at the United States box office, the film made $5.4 million. As of 1 March 2007, it has grossed over $37 million in North America, and grossed $80 million worldwide. In Spain, it grossed almost $12 million, and it is the fourth highest domestically grossing foreign film in the United States. In the United States, it has generated $55 million from its DVD sales and rentals.\n\nMetacritic named it the best reviewed film of the decade\" in 2010. It is #17 on the BBC list of best 100 films of the 21st century.\n\nThe film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006.\n\n\nUnranked Top 10\nRanked in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\nDel Toro himself has indicated similarities with \"The Spirit of the Beehive\", filmed in Francoist Spain, which juxtaposes issues related to the Civil War with horror film.\nAt least one critic has made a connection to a second Spanish film, \"Cría Cuervos\" (1975, Saura), again made while Franco was still in power. Doug Cummings (Film Journey 2007) identifies the connection between \"Cria Cuervos\", \"Spirit of the Beehive\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\": \"Critics have been summarily referencing \"Spirit of the Beehive\" (1973) in reviews of \"Pan's Labyrinth\", but Saura's film–at once a sister work to Erice's classic in theme, tone, even shared actress (Ana Torrent)–is no less rich a reference point.\"\n\nIn a 2007 interview, del Toro noted the striking similarities between his film and Walt Disney Pictures' \"The Chronicles of Narnia\": both films are set around the same time, have similar child-age principal characters, mythic creatures (particularly the fauns), and themes of \"disobedience and choice\". Says del Toro: \"This is my version of that universe, not only 'Narnia', but that universe of children's literature.\" In fact, del Toro was asked to direct \"\" but turned it down for \"Pan's Labyrinth\".\nIn addition to \"Narnia\", \"Pan's Labyrinth\" has also been compared to films such as \"Labyrinth\", \"MirrorMask\", \"Spirited Away\" and \"Bridge to Terabithia\".\n\nThe score for \"Pan's Labyrinth\", created by Spanish composer Javier Navarrete, was released on 19 December 2006. Navarrete and the score were nominated for an Academy Award. It was entirely structured around a lullaby, and del Toro had the entire score included on the soundtrack, even though much of it had been cut during production. The art used for the soundtrack cover was the un-utilized Drew Struzan promotional poster for the film.\n\n\nIn November 2007, del Toro confirmed that a sequel, entitled \"3993\", was in production. However, del Toro scrapped the project after deciding to direct \"\".\n\n"}
{"id": "277882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277882", "title": "Royal Opera House", "text": "Royal Opera House\n\nThe Royal Opera House (ROH) is an opera house and major performing arts venue in Covent Garden, central London. The large building is often referred to as simply \"Covent Garden\", after a previous use of the site of the opera house's original construction in 1732. It is the home of The Royal Opera, The Royal Ballet, and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. Originally called the Theatre Royal, it served primarily as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first ballet was presented. A year later, Handel's first season of operas began. Many of his operas and oratorios were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premieres there.\n\nThe current building is the third theatre on the site following disastrous fires in 1808 and 1856. The façade, foyer, and auditorium date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium seats 2,256 people, making it the third largest in London, and consists of four tiers of boxes and balconies and the amphitheatre gallery. The proscenium is 12.20 m wide and 14.80 m high. The main auditorium is a Grade I listed building.\n\nThe foundation of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden lies in the letters patent awarded by Charles II to Sir William Davenant in 1662, allowing Davenant to operate one of only two patent theatre companies (\"The Duke's Company\") in London. The letters patent remained in the possession of the patentees' heirs until the 19th century; their whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nIn 1728, John Rich, actor-manager of the Duke's Company at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, commissioned \"The Beggar's Opera\" from John Gay. The success of this venture provided him with the capital to build the Theatre Royal (designed by Edward Shepherd) at the site of an ancient convent garden, part of which had been developed by Inigo Jones in the 1630s with a piazza and church. In addition, a Royal Charter had created a fruit and vegetable market in the area, a market which survived in that location until 1974. At its opening on 7 December 1732, Rich was carried by his actors in processional triumph into the theatre for its opening production of William Congreve's \"The Way of the World\".\n\nDuring the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and Theatre Royal, Drury Lane exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. Despite the frequent interchangeability between the Covent Garden and Drury Lane companies, competition was intense, often presenting the same plays at the same time. Rich introduced pantomime to the repertoire, himself performing (under the stage name \"John Lun\", as Harlequin) and a tradition of seasonal pantomime continued at the modern theatre, until 1939.\n\nIn 1734, Covent Garden presented its first ballet, \"Pygmalion\". Marie Sallé discarded tradition and her corset and danced in diaphanous robes. George Frideric Handel was named musical director of the company, at Lincoln's Inn Fields, in 1719, but his first season of opera, at Covent Garden, was not presented until 1734. His first opera was \"Il pastor fido\" followed by \"Ariodante\" (1735), the première of \"Alcina\", and \"Atalanta\" the following year. There was a royal performance of \"Messiah\" in 1743, which was a success and began a tradition of Lenten oratorio performances. From 1735 until his death in 1759 he gave regular seasons there, and many of his operas and oratorios were written for Covent Garden or had their first London performances there. He bequeathed his organ to John Rich, and it was placed in a prominent position on the stage, but was among many valuable items lost in a fire that destroyed the theatre on 20 September 1808. In 1792 the architect Henry Holland rebuilt the auditorium, within the existing shell of the building but deeper and wider than the old auditorium, thus increasing capacity.\n\nRebuilding began in December 1808, and the second Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (designed by Robert Smirke) opened on 18 September 1809 with a performance of \"Macbeth\" followed by a musical entertainment called \"The Quaker\". The actor-manager John Philip Kemble, raised seat prices to help recoup the cost of rebuilding and the cost of an increased ground rent introduced by the landowner, the Duke of Bedford, but the move was so unpopular that audiences disrupted performances by beating sticks, hissing, booing and dancing. The \"Old Price Riots\" lasted over two months, and the management was finally forced to accede to the audience's demands.\n\nDuring this time, entertainments were varied; opera and ballet were presented, but not exclusively. Kemble engaged a variety of acts, including the child performer \"Master Betty\"; the great clown Joseph Grimaldi made his name at Covent Garden. Many famous actors of the day appeared at the theatre, including the tragediennes Sarah Siddons and Eliza O'Neill, the Shakespearean actors William Charles Macready, Edmund Kean and his son Charles. On 25 March 1833 Edmund Kean collapsed on stage while playing Othello, and died two months later.\n\nIn 1806, the pantomime clown Joseph Grimaldi (\"The Garrick of Clowns\") had performed his greatest success in \"Harlequin and Mother Goose; or the Golden Egg\" at Covent Garden, and this was subsequently revived, at the new theatre. Grimaldi was an innovator: his performance as \"Joey\" introduced the clown to the world, building on the existing role of Harlequin derived from the \"Commedia dell'arte\". His father had been ballet-master at Drury Lane, and his physical comedy, his ability to invent visual tricks and buffoonery, and his ability to poke fun at the audience were extraordinary.\n\nEarly pantomimes were performed as mimes accompanied by music, but as Music hall became popular, Grimaldi introduced the pantomime dame to the theatre and was responsible for the tradition of audience singing. By 1821 dance and clowning had taken such a physical toll on Grimaldi that he could barely walk, and he retired from the theatre. By 1828, he was penniless; Drury Lane held a benefit concert for him after Covent Garden refused.\n\nIn 1817, bare flame gaslight had replaced the former candles and oil lamps that lighted the Covent Garden stage. This was an improvement, but in 1837 Macready employed limelight in the theatre for the first time, during a performance of a pantomime, \"Peeping Tom of Coventry\". Limelight used a block of quicklime heated by an oxygen and hydrogen flame. This allowed the use of spotlights to highlight performers on the stage.\n\nThe Theatres Act 1843 broke the patent theatres' monopoly of drama. At that time Her Majesty's Theatre in the Haymarket was the main centre of ballet and opera but after a dispute with the management in 1846 Michael Costa, conductor at Her Majesty's, transferred his allegiance to Covent Garden, bringing most of the company with him. The auditorium was completely remodeled after an 1846 fire, during the following 1846–47 seasons, the company performed at the Lyceum Theatre. The theatre reopened as the Royal Italian Opera on 6 April 1847 with a performance of Rossini's \"Semiramide\".\n\nIn 1852, Louis Antoine Jullien the French eccentric composer of light music and conductor presented an opera of his own composition, \"Pietro il Grande\". Five performances were given of the 'spectacular', including live horses on the stage and very loud music. Critics considered it a complete failure and Jullien was ruined and fled to America. Costa and his successors presented all operas in Italian, even those originally written in French, German or English, until 1892, when Gustav Mahler presented the debut of Wagner's Ring cycle at Covent Garden. The word \"Italian\" was then quietly dropped from the name of the opera house.\n\nOn 5 March 1856, the theatre was again destroyed by fire. Work on the third theatre, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, started in 1857 and the new building, which still remains as the nucleus of the present theatre, was built by Lucas Brothers and opened on 15 May 1858 with a performance of Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\".\n\nThe Royal English Opera company under the management of Louisa Pyne and William Harrison, made their last performance at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 11 December 1858 and took up residence at the theatre on 20 December 1858 with a performance of Michael Balfe's \"Satanella\" and continued at the theatre until 1864.\n\nThe theatre became the Royal Opera House (ROH) in 1892, and the number of French and German works offered increased. Winter and summer seasons of opera and ballet were given, and the building was also used for pantomime, recitals and political meetings.\n\nDuring the First World War, the theatre was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works for use as a furniture repository.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1936, Geoffrey Toye was managing director, working alongside the Artistic Director, Sir Thomas Beecham. Despite early successes, Toye and Beecham eventually fell out, and Toye resigned.\n\nDuring the Second World War the ROH became a dance hall. There was a possibility that it would remain so after the war but, following lengthy negotiations, the music publishers Boosey & Hawkes acquired the lease of the building. David Webster was appointed General Administrator, and Sadler's Wells Ballet was invited to become the resident ballet company. The Covent Garden Opera Trust was created and laid out plans \"to establish Covent Garden as the national centre of opera and ballet, employing British artists in all departments, wherever that is consistent with the maintenance of the best possible standards ...\"\n\nThe Royal Opera House reopened on 20 February 1946 with a performance of \"The Sleeping Beauty\" in an extravagant new production designed by Oliver Messel. Webster, with his music director Karl Rankl, immediately began to build a resident company. In December 1946, they shared their first production, Purcell's \"The Fairy-Queen\", with the ballet company. On 14 January 1947, the Covent Garden Opera Company gave its first performance of Bizet's \"Carmen\".\n\nBefore the grand opening, the Royal Opera House presented one of the Robert Mayer Children's concerts on Saturday, 9 February 1946.\n\nSeveral renovations had taken place to parts of the house in the 1960s, including improvements to the amphitheatre but the theatre clearly needed a major overhaul. In 1975 the Labour government gave land adjacent to the Royal Opera House for a long-overdue modernisation, refurbishment, and extension. In the early 1980s the first part of a major renovation included an extension to the rear of the theatre on the James Street corner. The development added two new ballet studios, offices, a Chorus Rehearsal Room and the Opera Rehearsal room. Dressing rooms were also added.\nBy 1995, sufficient funds from the Arts Lottery through Arts Council England and private fundraising had been raised to enable the company to embark upon a major £213 million reconstruction of the building by Carillion, which took place between 1997 and 1999, under the chairmanship of Sir Angus Stirling. This involved the demolition of almost the whole site including several adjacent buildings to make room for a major increase in the size of the complex. The auditorium itself remained, but well over half of the complex is new.\n\nThe design team was led by Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones of Dixon Jones BDP as architects. The acoustic designers were Rob Harris and Jeremy Newton of Arup Acoustics. The building engineer was Arup with Stanhope as developer.\nThe new building has the same traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium as before, but with greatly improved technical, rehearsal, office, and educational facilities. Additionally, a new studio theatre, the Linbury, as well as more public space was created. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, which had fallen into disrepair and was used as a scenery store before redevelopment, created a new and extensive public gathering place. The venue is now claimed by the ROH to be the most modern theatre facility in Europe.\n\nSurtitles, projected onto a screen above the proscenium, have been used for all opera performances since they were introduced for schools matinees in 1984. Since the reopening of the theatre in 1999 an electronic libretto system provides translations onto small video screens for some seats, and additional monitors and screens are to be introduced to other parts of the house.\n\nIn 2014 design work, known as the Open Up Project, began with the aim of improving the entrances, lobby areas and the Linbury Theatre.\n\nThe Paul Hamlyn Hall is a large iron and glass structure adjacent to, and with direct access to, the main opera house building. The hall now acts as the atrium and main public area of the opera house, with a champagne bar, restaurant and other hospitality services, and also providing access to the main auditorium at all levels.\n\nThe redevelopment of the Floral Hall went ahead on the strength of a pledge of £10m from the philanthropist Alberto Vilar and for a number of years, it was known as the Vilar Floral Hall; however Vilar failed to make good his pledge. As a result, the name was changed in September 2005 to the Paul Hamlyn Hall, after the opera house received a donation of £10m from the estate of Paul Hamlyn, towards its education and development programmes.\n\nAs well as acting as a main public area for performances in the main auditorium, the Paul Hamlyn Hall is also used for hosting a number of events, including private functions, dances, exhibitions, concerts, and workshops.\n\nThe Linbury Studio Theatre is a flexible, secondary performance space, constructed below ground level within the Royal Opera House. It has retractable raked seating and a floor which can be raised or lowered to form a studio floor, a raised stage, or a stage with orchestra pit. The theatre can accommodate up to 400 patrons and host a variety of different events. It has been used for private functions, traditional theatre shows, and concerts, as well as community and educational events, product launches, dinners and exhibitions, etc., and is one of the most technologically advanced performance venues in London with its own public areas, including a bar and cloakroom.\nThe Linbury is most notable for hosting performances of experimental and independent dance and music, by independent companies and as part of the ROH2, the contemporary producing arm of the Royal Opera House. The Linbury Studio Theatre regularly stages performances by the Royal Ballet School and also hosts the Young British Dancer of the Year competition.\n\nThe venue was constructed as part of the 90s redevelopment of the Royal Opera House. It is named in recognition of donations made by the Linbury Trust towards the redevelopment. The Trust is operated by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and his wife Anya Linden, a former dancer with the Royal Ballet. The name Linbury is derived from the names Linden and Sainsbury. It was opened in 1999 with a collaboration from three Croydon secondary schools (including Coloma Convent Girls' School and Edenham High School) in an original performance called \"About Face\".\n\nIn 2008 the Royal Opera House and Manchester City Council began planning stages a new development known as Royal Opera House, Manchester. The proposal would have seen the Palace Theatre in Manchester refurbished, to create a theatre capable of staging productions by both the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera. It was intended that the Royal Opera House would take residence of the theatre for an annual 18-week season, staging 16 performances by the Royal Opera, 28 performances by the Royal Ballet and other small-scale productions. A year later The Lowry sent an open letter to the then Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Ben Bradshaw, Arts Council England, Manchester City Council and the ROH, calling for the scheme, in its current form, to be scrapped. In 2010 it was announced that the project was being shelved as part of larger arts-funding cuts.\n\nThe Royal Opera House opened a scenery-making facility for their operas and ballets at High House, Purfleet, Essex on 6 December 2010. The building was designed by Nicholas Hare Architects. The East of England Development Agency, which partly funded developments on the park, notes that \"the first phase includes the Royal Opera House's Bob and Tamar Manoukian Production Workshop and Community areas\".\n\nThe Bob and Tamar Manoukian Costume Centre, also designed by Nicholas Hare Associates, opened in September 2015, and provides a costume-making facility for the Royal Opera House and a training centre for students of costume-making from South Essex College. The building also houses the Royal Opera House's collection of historically important costumes. \n\nOther elements at High House, Purfleet include The Backstage Centre, a new technical theatre and music training centre which is currently run by the National College for Creative Industries and was formally opened by Creative & Cultural Skills in March 2013, alongside renovated farm buildings. Acme studios opened a complex of 43 artist studios in Summer 2013.\n\nIn addition to opera and ballet performances, the Royal Opera House has hosted a number of other events including:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53864454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53864454", "title": "Tang Standing Horse figure, Canberra", "text": "Tang Standing Horse figure, Canberra\n\nStanding Horse is a Tang dynasty tomb figure, created during the Tang dynasty in China. In ancient China, numerous tomb figurines and other artefacts were designed specifically to be buried with the deceased in large burial mounds. This large figurine is glazed with the iconic tri-colour glaze, also known as Sancai, which is a glazing technique that is synonymous to the Tang dynasty.\n\nThe form of this sculpture appears to be harmoniously symmetrical at first glance. However, on further scrutiny, it is clear that the shape of the sculpture is deeply organic, revealing a varied contour of curves and edges. When a spotlight is shone on the sculpture, deep pockets of shadows on the sculpture contrast starkly with illuminating highlights that reflect off its shiny, glazed surface.\n\nAs a historical artefact that is more than 1000-year-old, it is very well-preserved. It was created with earthenware, which is a durable material. Bronze and wood were 2 other materials commonly used to create sculptures and tomb artefacts in this period and region. However, earthenware was a more practical material for tomb artefacts because it was more affordable than bronze, and more durable than wood.\n\nThe \"Sancai\" technique literally means ‘three colours’. However, the colours of the glazes were not limited to three in number. This technique is especially associated with the Tang Dynasty. The \"Sancai\" glaze is highly durable – most ceramics glazed with this technique has endured till today. The use of \"Sancai\" glazing on figures was expensive and required skilful craftsmanship. Sumptuary laws also restricted the usage of \"Sancai\" glaze to the upper classes, and production was controlled by the imperial bureaucracy.\n\"An iconography of a work of art is the analysis of the visual images and symbols employed.\" As an expressional subject matter, this figurine of a horse is depicted proportionally and realistically, with great attention paid to its anatomical accuracy, colour treatment, texture and embellishments.\n\nThe high level of craftsmanship reflected on this sculpture demonstrate the lifelikeness and physical characteristics that this horse is supposed to embody: a handsome adult horse with an athletic body and a body of mane that is smooth, shiny and neat. Its posture is upright, its eyes are wide-opened and its head cocked at an angle that is upright but not facing upward.\n\nThe colours applied on this horse further enhance the lifelikeness of the horse, making it look very similar to a real horse. The contrast of green against brown on this sculpture, directs the viewer's attention immediately to the elaborate harness on the horse, so that viewers would notice the distinctive decoration on this harness.\n\nThe intricate details rendered on the horse's harness offers viewers an insight into the type of horse this sculpture is supposed to represent: a Ferghana horse from Central Asia. Ferghana horses were very commonly depicted in Tang dynasty tomb figures.\n\n\"An iconology of a work of art is the interpretation of the symbolism in the visual imagery, especially in a broader sociopolitical context, so as to determine the underlying attitudes and characteristics of a civilisation.\"\n\nThe ancient Chinese believed that every person has 2 souls – 1 is called ‘\"hun\"’ and the other is called ‘\"po\"’. When a person passes on, the \"hun\" soul leaves the body and ascends to heaven, while the \"po\" soul remains with the corpse. In ancient China, tomb artefacts were created specifically for the \"po\" soul to use in its afterlife, according to what the deceased usually needed and wanted when he or she was alive. The primary purpose of a tomb artefact was to care for its deceased master in his or her afterlife. Therefore, studying the tomb artefacts from different Chinese dynasties helps one to understand the changing social and historical circumstances of each dynasty, since the people of different dynasties had different needs and wants, depending on the sociopolitical situation of each dynasty. \n\nFor instance, numerous tomb artefacts of soldiers (also known as a \"terracotta army\") have been found in the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. The Qin dynasty was militaristic, heavy-handed and bureaucratic - it was a time of intense and constant warfare with its neighbours and its military was the most powerful and technologically advanced in the world. Therefore, it is unsurprising to find an overwhelming quantity of tomb figurines cast in the image of soldiers in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China.\n\nOn the other hand, we find this chessboard set in a tomb from the Han dynasty. The Han dynasty was still a time of constant warfare. However, arts and culture were valued and widespread, and the Han Chinese had more freedom to debate philosophical issues and enjoy intellectual games, such as this game of chess. Chess was believed to help people understand military strategies.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, the socio-political condition of China was dramatically different from the Qin and Han dynasties, leading to the production of tomb artefacts that were dramatically different too. Tang dynasty was one that was characterized by its extravagance, prosperity, stability and competitiveness, and these attributes are understandably reflected in the characteristics of tomb figurines produced in the Tang dynasty.\n\nAnother theme that is critical in the interpretation of this figurine of a Central Asian horse is the tense relationship between the nomads of Central Asia and the rest of Asia. Every dynasty in China had military conflicts with the nomads of Central Asia. The Tang empire competed fiercely with the Tibetan empire and the Islamic empires for control of Central Asia.\n\nThe nomads of Central Asia were fierce warriors with powerful warhorses. This is due to a combination of geographical and political reasons. Geographically, Central Asia is difficult for agriculture and it is also far from the sea, thereby cutting it off from trading. Hence, nomadic horse people dominated Central Asia for 2000 years. Their nomadic lifestyle naturally trained them to be highly suitable for warfare. Their horse-riding skills and archery techniques made them the most militarily powerful people in the world. Their military power is further sharpened by the fact that East Asia and West Asia were often competing to gain control of Central Asia.\n\nIt is in light of this socio-historical context that one realises why it was a source of pride for a Tang dynasty tomb to be filled with horses, camels, female attendants, robust manservants and exotic dancers from Central Asia. During the Tang period, the ability to own powerful horses and servants from Central Asia would have been a testimony of a person's wealth, power and social standing. This is especially since Central Asia was renowned for its military power, strong warriors and formidable horses. It would also have been reflective of a person's stylish, cosmopolitan taste, as it shows that this person is globalised and familiar with cultures outside of China. Many of Tang dynasty's tomb artefacts, such as \"Standing Horse\", were meant to assert Tang China's power over Central Asia.\n\nTang dynasty is generally regarded as a high point in Chinese civilisation, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Many neighbouring countries maintained strong diplomatic ties with it, traded extensively with it and sought its economic assistance and military protection. It was a superpower, akin to the United States of today.\n\nThe capital of the Tang dynasty was the most populous city in the world. With this large population, the dynasty was able to have a professional and powerful army. The army not only defended the empire, but was also used to dominate the lucrative trade routes along the Silk Road. A huge population also meant that there were more professional craftsmen in the empire, to create large quantities and higher quality works of art.\n\nIt was a period of progress, prosperity and stability, making it a highly conducive environment to pursue the arts. Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty often featured servants, attendants, dancers, musicians, camels and horses from Central Asia. In the tomb of a high-ranking male, there may also be figurines of soldiers, officials and courtesans.\n\nTomb figurines in the Tang dynasty were made to be visually compelling and it is especially obvious when they are seen in an entire set, or when compared with figurines of other dynasties. The intricate details of each figurine's craftsmanship imbue them with a great sense of physical presence and identity. Their personalised facial expressions and postures distinguish each figurine in an imaginable time and space.\n\nThis great emphasis on the performativity of tomb figurines could be related to the competitive Tang culture of publicly displaying one's wealth and power. The social classes of Tang society were mobile. This means that people in the different social classes could improve its status through hard work and move to an upper class. This created a competitive society, where people often showed off their wealth and power. Members of prominent families or high-ranking officials often paraded through streets in the public, with troops of servants mounted on beautiful horses. This culture of public display takes place even during funerals. After the funerary ceremonies at home are complete, there would be a funeral procession to transport the deceased from home to gravesite.\n\nThe funeral procession is a highly elaborate, visible and competitive public spectacle, designed to impress the public with altars, canopies, flowers, paper figurines, burnt offerings and most importantly, with the display of impressive tomb figurines. The competitive nature of funeral processions got so out of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased's social status. Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master's living family.\n\nTomb figurines of the Tang dynasty were characterized by its wide variety, high quality, energy, performance and lifelikeness. The tomb figurines of Tang China were unprecedented – never before in Chinese history were the figurines endowed with such qualities. The pursuit of more and more vibrant colours led to the invention of the tri-colour glazing technique, or \"Sancai\" glaze, to further enhance the visual appearance of the figurines. This great emphasis on performance burial and extravagant tomb figurines in Tang China, is consistent with Tang China's opulent culture, media and arts. This tomb figurine of a horse, was expected to represent not only itself, but also expected to serve and perform a social and cultural role for the Tang dynasty.\n\nThis sculpture is now in the National Gallery of Australia, in the Asian Gallery collections. It was a gift to the gallery by Dr. Tsui Tsin-tong from Hong Kong, through the National Gallery of Australia Foundation, in 1995.\n\nAdshead, S. A.

{"id": "41675275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41675275", "title": "Teatro Capranica", "text": "Teatro Capranica\n\nThe Teatro Capranica is a theatre situated at 101 Piazza Capranica in the Colonna district of Rome. Originally constructed in 1679 by the Capranica family and housed in the early Renaissance Palazzo Capranica, it was the second public theatre to open in Rome. It was the site of many premieres of Baroque operas including Caldara's \"Tito e Berenice\", Scarlatti's \"Griselda\", and Vivaldi's \"Ercole su'l Termodonte\". The Capranica ceased operating as a full-scale theatre and opera house in 1881 and in 1922 was converted into a cinema. Following the closure of the cinema in 2000, it has functioned on a hire basis as a conference and performance venue.\n\nThe palazzo in which the theatre was situated had been originally constructed in 1451 by Cardinal Domenico Capranica, to serve as both his own residence and the future home of the Almo Collegio Capranica, a college for young clerics which he founded in 1457. One of the few remaining examples of Roman residential architecture of the early renaissance, it has a large side tower and a \"piano nobile\" lit by three cross mullion windows as well as three windows in the late Gothic style which suggest that the palace may have incorporated an earlier building on the site. In the late 1670s, another member of the family, Pompeo Capranica, had a private theatre carved out from existing family apartments without changing the exterior of the building. The theatre was inaugurated on 6 January 1679 with Arcangelo Corelli leading the orchestra for the premiere of Bernardo Pasquini's opera \"Dov'è amore è pietà\".\nWith the accession of Pope Alexander VIII, Pompeo Capranica and his brother Federico received permission to enlarge the theatre and open it to the public. They entrusted the task to Carlo Buratti (a student of Carlo Fontana) who completely rebuilt the theatre in 1694 transforming it into the standard U-shape with rich ornamentation and 6 tiers of 26 boxes each. It re-opened as a public theatre (Rome's second) on 18 January 1695 with a performance of \"Clearco in Negroponte\" a three-act opera jointly composed by Giovanni Lorenzo Lulier, Tommaso Gaffi and Carlo Francesco Cesarini. However, the new theatre still lacked a public entrance opening onto the street. Audiences could only enter through the workshop of a carpenter on the ground floor of the palazzo. His lease required him to close his workshop during the opera season and to provide at his own expense a wooden staircase to enable the spectators to climb into the theatre. It was a situation that was not be rectified until the 19th century.\n\nUnder Pope Innocent XII, public theatrical performances were once again forbidden and the theatre remained closed from 1699 to 1711. When the prohibition on public performances was lifted, the Capranica brothers re-opened the theatre and soon attracted the patronage of Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni who contributed to the cost the renovation after its long closure and hired his architect, Filippo Juvarra, to renovate the stage. The two decades after the re-opening marked the heyday of the theatre which would become Rome's primary public opera house and see the premieres of many new operas and innovative sets designed by Filippo Juvarra and Francesco Galli Bibiena. The composer Alessandro Scarlatti was closely associated with the Capranica which premiered several of his early operas beginning in 1679. When he returned to Rome in 1718 after his years in Naples, he produced his three finest operas for the theatre, \"Telemaco\", \"Marco Attilio Regolo\" and \"Griselda\". Between 1718 and 1721, the Capranica also saw the premieres of Scarlatti's oratorio, \"La gloriosa gara tra la Santità e la Sapienza\", and several of his cantatas.\n\nWith the construction of new public theatres in Rome such as the Teatro Alibert (1718), Teatro Valle (1727) and Teatro Argentina (1732), the Capranica gradually declined in importance, although in the 1750s it was much favoured by Goldoni for their stagings of his plays. In 1760, he wrote his comedy \"Pamela maritata\" expressly for the theatre. The theatre went through several more renovations, closures, and proprietors starting in the second half of the 18th century. By the 19th century, it had ceased being a leading opera house in the city and tended to concentrate on comic operas and plays (often in Roman dialect), acrobatic displays, and puppet shows. The theatre returned to the Capranica family in 1853 when Marchese Bartolomeo Capranica bought it back from Prince Alessandro Torlonia and spent a great deal of money renovating it. However, it never regained its former prestige. The American writer Henry P. Leland described it in 1863 as:\n\nEventually, the costs of upkeep and dwindling audiences led to the Capranica's demise. It closed permanently following a performance of Verdi's opera \"Ernani\" on 1 March 1881. At first it was rented out as a furniture warehouse, but then stood completely empty from 1895 until 1922 when it was converted into a cinema.\n\nAfter the closure of the Cinema Capranica in 2000, the 800 seat theatre with its now minimal stage was re-opened as a conference and performance venue available on a hire basis. Under the propietorship of the Hotel Nazionale and managed by Montecitorio Eventi S.r.l., it has hosted four small-scale opera productions by the association \"Aulico – Opera & Musica\" and over the years has been the setting for numerous meetings of Italian political parties. In January 2013, Silvio Berlusconi gave a two-hour speech there in which he introduced the Popolo della Libertà candidates for the 2013 Italian general election. During a meeting of the Partito Democratico at the Capranica that lasted late into the night of 19 April 2013, Pier Luigi Bersani resigned as party leader following his failure to form a coalition government.\n\nMore than 50 works (including operas, oratorios, cantatas, and plays) have premiered at the Teatro Capranica. The first opera to be premiered there was Pasquini's \"Dov'è amore è pietà\" which inaugurated the theatre in 1679. The 1728 premiere of Riccardo Broschi's \"L'isola di Alcina\" was marked by the presence of his brother, the celebrated castrato singer Farinelli, in the role of Ruggiero. Like most of the operas premiered at the Capranica prior to 1750, it was an \"opera seria\". The premieres at the theatre after 1750 were almost exclusively of the \"opera buffa\" genre, such as Galuppi's \"La cantarina\" (1756) or Piccinni's \"La donna di spirito\" (1770). Many of the shorter ones, such as Antonio Sacchini's \"La vendemmia\" (1760), were specifically written to be performed as comic intermezzos for prose plays. Other operas premiered at the Capranica include:\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

Etty had become famous for nude paintings, and acquired a reputation for tastelessness, indecency and a lack of creativity. With \"The Destroying Angel\" he hoped to disprove his critics with an openly moral piece. The painting is 127.8 cm by 101.9 cm (50 in by 40 in) and depicts a classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons. Some of the humans appear dead or unconscious, others flee or struggle against the daemons.\n\nWhen first exhibited in 1832, \"The Destroying Angel\" was widely praised for its technical brilliance, but critics were divided on the subject matter. Some praised its vivid blend of fear and beauty; others criticised its theme as inappropriate, and chastised Etty for wasting his talent. As Etty had hoped, the painting changed critics' perception of him; some saw it as indicating previously unseen depths, others considered it a renunciation of his previous work. Henry Payne, who had commissioned the painting, sold it in 1854 to Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains.\n\nWilliam Etty (1787–1849), the seventh son of a York baker and miller, had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Many of his peers greatly admired him, and he was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable.\n\nBetween 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nudes. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent. Etty's \"Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm\", completed in 1830 and exhibited in 1832, attracted scathing criticism for its supposed seductive and sensual nature, leading \"The Morning Chronicle\" to comment that \"[Etty] should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth.\"\n\nNeedled by repeated attacks from \"The Morning Chronicle\" on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was \"The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate\".\n\n\"The Destroying Angel\" was commissioned by Henry Payne of Leicester in 1822, on a promise of 60 guineas (about £ in today's terms) when complete. Payne had granted Etty complete freedom in the creation of the piece, but Etty had done little with the notion until, stung by \"The Morning Chronicle\"'s criticism, he decided to return to the theme, completing it in 1832. As Etty had become a more prominent painter in the meantime, Payne paid him £130 (about £ in today's terms) for the piece. The work is thought to have been inspired by the works of John Milton and Alexander Pope, by Michelangelo's \"The Last Judgment\" and possibly by the French Revolution of 1830, in which Etty had been caught up during a visit to Paris to study in the Louvre. The topic was one to which Etty felt particularly close, saying that he had put his \"whole soul\" into the piece.\n\n\"The Destroying Angel\" is a visionary work, depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than a scene from history, literature or mythology. It measures 127.8 cm by 101.9 cm (50 in by 40 in), and depicts an ornate imaginary classical temple. The temple and its occupants are under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons, who are in the process of abducting its human occupants. The angel itself is wreathed in smoke in the centre of the image. Having destroyed one side of the temple, it is poised to hurl a thunderbolt. Below the angel, daemons attack a group of around 25 semi-naked human figures. Each human is shown in a different position and expresses terror differently, and each is deliberately painted in paler tones than those Etty typically used to suggest death and pallor. As with most of Etty's works, the figures are a collection of depictions of models in studio poses, later arranged for dramatic effect, rather than painted as a group.\n\nTo the right of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right-hand corner turns to see flames reflected in the eyes of the daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.\n\nIn the centre of the foreground is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's \"Raving Madness\", which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital (\"Bedlam\"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on one end of the chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.\nBehind the central images of the lunatic, daemon and gambler are a group of people who have only just realised what is happening. A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or to block out the horror taking place in front of her.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the painting, in the background, the structure of the temple crumbles and burns in the wake of the angel's path, while figures in varying stages of undress flee the approaching daemons. In the foreground a drunken man mimics the pose of the Barberini Faun as he clutches his head, alert enough to realise his fate if he does not escape but too intoxicated to flee.\n\nAround the painting lie corpses in various states of undress. \"The Destroying Angel\" was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in \"The Destroying Angel\" were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.\n\n\"The Destroying Angel\" was first exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1832. It immediately generated much critical and public interest, and was compared favourably with \"The Fall of the Damned\" by Peter Paul Rubens, Michelangelo's \"The Last Judgment\" and \"Breughell's frightful fancies\".\nAlthough the painting was celebrated as a technical accomplishment, some critics were uncertain if it had the correct moral effect. \"The Library of the Fine Arts\" was critical of its \"pantomimic\" quality, which it considered \"calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art\", while \"The Examiner\" complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: \"Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put a single one of them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers.\" \"The Times\" said, We do not profess to understand what class of compositions that is which originates neither in history nor poetry—no doubt Mr. Etty does; but as far as we can comprehend his picture, which is much more intelligible than his language, it represents a quantity of able-bodied demons, who appear angry at the ladies for having stayed out so long, and who are come to fetch them home accordingly and criticised Etty for a \"slovenly manner\" and for \"abusing his rich gifts, and [wasting] upon the wild and unmeaning what might be made subservient to much more worthy purposes\". Despite this, the same critic conceded that \"The work is one of extraordinary power\" and that \"The figures are drawn with exquisite skill, the grouping admirably varied, and yet so combined as to present a complete picture, and the colouring vigorous and harmonious in an eminent degree.\"\n\nOther critics admired Etty's unusual interpretation of apocalyptic religious imagery, his ability to give distinct characters and shapes to the individual demons and their victims, and the vividness of his imagination. \"The Morning Post\" particularly praised Etty's ability to convey \"creation conceived and thrown upon the canvas with all the fury of poetical inspiration\" by combining the \"dauntless spirit of a sketch\" with the \"powerful impression of a finished picture\". The prominent art critic William Paulet Carey (writing under the name of 'Ridolfi') championed \"The Destroying Angel\", and in particular Etty's ability to balance beauty, horror and fear without descending into tastelessness. Carey saw Etty as proof that British artistic traditions were equal to any others in the world, and \"The Destroying Angel\" as evidence of Etty's \"redeeming grace and spirit\". Etty's long-standing adversaries at \"The Morning Chronicle\" found little to attack in the painting, their review stating that \"The upper part of the picture is masterly, grand and beautiful. The lower part not so well, but some of the figures are in admirable action and fine drawing.\" The reticence of \"The Morning Chronicle\" prompted Carey to comment that they were in \"envious silence\".\nDespite some criticism, \"The Destroying Angel\" changed the way Etty was perceived by critics. They commonly had viewed Etty's works as insights into his mind, generally with the aim of discrediting him for supposed sexual deviancies. Confronted with a piece so obviously intended to convey a moral lesson, many of those same critics felt that Etty had revealed a more moral nature than they had previously believed. Many explicitly saw \"The Destroying Angel\" as a counterweight to the nude paintings for which Etty was famous, or even a representation of Etty's own repentance for or renunciation of his previous works. \"Fraser's Magazine\" described the painting as \"a sermon to [Etty's] admirers ... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that \"little\" gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils\".\n\nAfter 1832, Etty exhibited over 80 more paintings at the Summer Exhibition. He remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Yet he remained, in the majority view, a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\". Etty remained commercially successful in his lifetime, amassing £17,000 (about £ in today's terms) by his death.\n\nEtty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity. Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Henry Payne sold \"The Destroying Angel\" in 1854 for 770 guineas (about £ in today's terms) to Sir Joseph Whitworth, who donated it in 1882 to the Manchester Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting was exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.\nAs Etty had rapidly fallen from fashion, his works had little influence on most subsequent painters. William Edward Frost was a great admirer of Etty, and Frost's \"Una Alarmed by Fauns\" (1843) and \"Una and the Wood Nymphs\" (1847) owe a conscious debt to \"The Destroying Angel\" in their depiction of a group of semi-clad daemonic and human figures, as does John Everett Millais's early work \"Cymon and Iphigenia\" (1848). As Etty's style became increasingly unpopular, those artists who had imitated him, other than Frost, soon abandoned the style. Etty's biographer Leonard Robinson contends that the later fairy paintings of Richard Dadd, which often show large crowds of mythical creatures mingling with humans, were influenced by Etty but concedes that Dadd was likely unconscious of Etty's influence on his style.\n\n"}

{"id": "39389219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39389219", "title": "The Oasis (novel)", "text": "The Oasis (novel)\n\n\"The Oasis\" is a short satirical novel by American writer Mary McCarthy. Published by Random House in 1949, it is McCarthy's second novel. Described by McCarthy as a “conte philosophique,” it tells the story of a group of embattled intellectuals, their quest to establish a Utopian community in the mountains of New England, and their failure to surmount ideological and personal differences for the greater good of the commune. Doubling as a roman à clef, \"The Oasis\" borrows heavily from McCarthy's experiences and frustrations with the short lived European-American Group, and serves more broadly as a critique of the “abstract idealism of intellectuals” and their inability to enact actual change.\n\nSet in the near future following 1949, \"The Oasis\" depicts a group of fifty radical and liberal intellectuals who venture into the mountains of New England to create a shared living commune (aptly named, “Utopia”). Already present in Utopia's formation, however, is a deep ideological schism between two rivaling factions: the cynical Realists and self-righteous Purists. The Realists, led by the embittered former Marxist William Taub, anticipate the experiment to end in little more than a summer vacation, awaiting Utopia's eventual demise, while the Purists, led by the magazine editor Macdougal Macdermott, are hesitant to perform any action that could contradict their radical, libertarian beliefs.\n\nThe first challenge presented to both factions is whether or not they will admit the Lockman family, led by the exuberant, blue-blooded Joe Lockman, into Utopia. Macdermott, who regards Lockman as a “philistine,” eventually grants the Lockmans his approval for fear that he might otherwise appear elitist. The acceptance of the Lockmans, however, calls forth the larger question, “Was it to follow that anyone could be admitted to Utopia?”\n\nBy the end of the first night in Utopia, it is the Realist leader Taub, not Macdermott, that finds Lockman to be a nuisance, put on edge by Lockman's bombastic spirit and hunting rifle. The next morning, Katy Norell, one of Utopia's more vocal Purists, burns herself and ruins the commune's breakfast while cooking. Most likely an honest mishap, the incident is quickly politicized and blamed on Lockman by the Realists. Following the mishap, Katy's husband, Preston, publicly scolds Katy for ruining breakfast, demonstrating the immense strain that communal living has taken on the residents of Utopia.\n\nThat night, the Realists convene a communal meeting, conspiring to exile Joe and assert their dominance over the Purists. When they are given the floor, however, both Taub and his followers are unable to articulate what it is they want or on what grounds they wish to expel Joe. The meeting ends with the Purists laughing at Taub. Macdermott dismisses the Realists as “revolutionary nihilists,” explaining, “They don’t know what they want… They’re so conservative they’re afraid of their own thoughts.”\n\nAfter a short “lyrical period” of peace, prosperity, and basking in the pastoral quaintness of the commune, the Utopians begin to question the purpose of their project, and whether or not their mission serves a greater good. Katy Norell laments not living up to the expectations of Monteverdi, the ideological “Founder” of the commune and champion of the Purists’ beliefs. They consider creating a “United States of Europe in Exile,” a mission to bring refugees displaced by World War II to America in order to create more small-scale communities like their own. However, the plan falls apart almost as quickly as it is proposed. Grand ambitions to contact congressmen, trade unionists, and newspapers dissolve into an effort to make a simple pamphlet, but this idea is also abandoned.\n\nOne day, the Taubs, Katy, and other members of the commune go strawberry picking on the outskirts of Utopia, only to find that a group of locals have beaten them to the site. When the Utopians ask the locals to leave some berries for them, the Utopians are rudely dismissed. Seeing their dismay, Joe Lockman fires blanks from his gun in order to ward the intruding locals away from Utopia. Lockman then insists everyone in Utopia padlock their front doors, prompting a commune-wide philosophical debate on the implications of privatizing property in Utopia. The discussion prompted by the intruders’ arrival grows broader and broader, with Katy and Taub disagreeing on whether Utopia can survive such a shake up. Katy, drunk, ends up lying in the grass in order to take in the pastoral setting, while Jim Haines, a “Lincoln-esque” magazine editor who is revered by all Utopians, begins to pack up his car to leave the commune, confirming Katy's worst suspicions that, “Ultimately, Utopia would fail.”\n\nWilliam Taub- Based on Philip Rahv, McCarthy's ex-lover and editor at \"The Partisan Review\", Taub is the leader of the Realist faction of Utopia. As the victim of the book's most “outrageous satire,” Taub is depicted as cowardly, lazy, self-centered, and villainous, amounting to a “not especially flattering depiction” of the jaded anti-Stalinist. Convinced that the “potency of history” will prove the “failure of socialism,” Taub is fixated on seeing Utopia fail.\n\nMacdougal Macdermott- Serving as a stand-in for Dwight Macdonald (a friend of McCarthy's and the founder of the magazine \"politics\"), Macdermott is the leader of the Purist faction. Though Macdonald is not lampooned to the same degree that Rahv is, the character of Macdermott is hot-tempered, blindly committed to being consistent in his libertarian views, and susceptible to being roped into Taub's political chess match.\n\nJoe Lockman- A “capitalist monad” who “sets the purists’ symbolic tests,” Joe’s impulsive nature pushes the ideological imperatives of both the Realists and the Purists to their limits. He represents the layman, the non-intellectual, and the growing professional class that is discovering the merits of modernist thought and expression.\n\nKaty Norell- A libertarian idealist dedicated to the purist faction and stuck in a fractious marriage, Katy resembles McCarthy in 1949 more closely than any other character in \"The Oasis\". Katy provides the book’s strongest feminine perspective and feminist argument, “reveal[ing] much remains to be learned about women’s rights in [Utopia].” Large sections of \"The Oasis\" hold little narrative distance from Katy, as the reader sees the mission of the commune fall apart through Katy's eyes towards the end of the novel.\n\nJim Haines- A handsome magazine editor whose departure from Utopia portends the beginning of the end of Utopia.\n\nSusan Hapgood- A novelist and follower of the Realist faction who dotes on Taub, Susan is perhaps meant to represent the younger McCarthy, or perhaps Elizabeth Hardwick, McCarthy's friend and fellow novelist.\n\nHarold Sidney- Based on William Phillips, a co-editor of \"The Partisan Review\" with Philip Rahv, Sidney is Taub's second-in-command. Though less capricious than Taub, he is equally conniving, and, when the time comes for him to speak out against Lockman, Macdermott, and the Purists, he is also equally inept.\n\nLeo Raphael- Inspired by discussion of the commune's greater purpose, Leo proposes that the Utopians refocus their energies on a United States of Europe in Exile, in which the commune can act as a model for European refugees who wish to escape the threat of communism and settle in America.\n\nMonteverdi, “the Founder”- Based on Nicola Chiaromonte. While he does not make any actual appearance in Utopia, the Founder is seen as a sort of prophet by the Purists, his absence leaving them directionless.\n\n\"The Oasis\" was originally published as an ongoing series under the name \"A Source of Embarrassment\" by the British literary magazine \"Horizon\". It was published by Random House in 1949. Though its initial circulation was limited, the novel was reissued by Melville House in 2013 as part of its “Neversink Library” series.\n\nFollowing the bombing of Hiroshima in the summer of 1945, which McCarthy referred to as a “watershed, a dividing line,” many of the New York Intellectuals—a group, which included McCarthy, of contributors to \"politics\", \"Partisan Review\", and other preeminent New York writers and thinkers—became alarmed by the rapidly escalating nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. As many of the New York Intellectuals were formerly avowed Trotskyist Communists, the group became attracted to the idea of retreating from society at large and participating in small-scale communal living. Concerning the period immediately following the war, McCarthy would later remark: “It seemed possible still, utopian but possible, to change the world on a small scale.”\n\nThat summer, McCarthy and her fellow New York Intellectuals, under the guidance of activist Nicola Chiaromonte, established the European-American Group (EAG) in an effort to create “human-scaled, grassroots, transnational communities of dialogue and solidarity.” This effort towards small-scale living, however, was short lived. Soon after its founding, the EAG disbanded “due to a lack of internal consensus about its goals,” as “the Macdonald-McCarthy-Chiaromonte faction” failed to find common ground with the so-called “\"Partisan Review\" Boys,” Philip Rahv and William Phillips. As Hugh Wilford contends in his historio-literary analysis of \"The Oasis\", “An Oasis: The New York Intellectuals in the Late 1940s,” the dissolution of the EAG marked the beginning of the cooptation of Old Left holdouts such as McCarthy and her contemporaries into a larger liberal, post-World War II consensus. In fact, many members of the EAG would become key figures in the creation of the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), a front organization designed by the Central Intelligence Agency for the purposes of winning the Cultural Cold War. Only a few years later, in the spring of 1949, McCarthy—along with Dwight Mcdonald, Elizabeth Hardwick, Sidney Hook, and other former EAG members—would help disrupt a communist conference held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Foreseeing this eventual shift, McCarthy spent her final days in the EAG documenting the group's failures through her writing of \"The Oasis\".\n\n\"The Oasis\" has been described as “an imaginative inquiry into the causes of radical failure,” a satirical critique of the limitations of intellectual debate and the ability for intellectuals to enact actual change, as well as a condemnation of communal and political organization in general. For the latter reason, much has been written on the relationship between \"The Oasis\" and the philosophy of McCarthy's longtime friend, historian Hannah Arendt. In “Social Utopia: Hannah Arendt and Mary McCarthy’s \"The Oasis\",” Nicholas Spencer argues that both Arendt and McCarthy are wary of the propensity of political groups towards “altruistic fervor” and injecting their “personal conduct” with “general objectivity”. Since neither believes that the convictions of political groups can withstand social and personal pressure enacted by the individuals that compose these groups, both favor a “solitude over solidarity” model. Both Arendt and McCarthy view the role of the group as “anesthetic,” and believe that an individual's “yielding” to facts in the service of “self-alteration” is a superior method of self-improvement than group organizing. This ideology is mirrored by and made manifest in McCarthy's unremitting prose, most evidently in \"The Oasis\".\n\nReception of \"The Oasis\" has been historically mixed. Response to the novel's earliest incarnation, in \"Horizon\" magazine, was generally positive. American critics, however, were less kind. In a tepid review published by \"The New York Times\", critic Donald Barr wrote, “readers outside [McCarthy’s] circle can get little from \"The Oasis\" except a vague sense of defamatory brilliance and a few fine scenes.”\n\nThough Hannah Arendt looked favorably on \"The Oasis\", calling it “a gem,” many of McCarthy's closest friends were offended by the novel, most notably those who were implicated in the book's plot. Dwight Macdonald called the book “vicious, malicious, and nasty,” while Diana Trilling labeled McCarthy “a thug.” Saul Bellow found Rahv's portrayal to be a “stupid caricature,” with Rahv himself threatening to sue McCarthy for libel.\n\n\"The Oasis\" has experienced something of a resurgence in recent years. Melville House reissued the book in 2013 as part of its Neversink Library series, which “champions books from around the world that have been overlooked, under appreciated, looked askance at, or foolishly ignored.” Additionally, the book has experienced an upswing in scholarly interest over the past thirty years. In her preface to the 2013 edition of \"The Oasis\", Vivian Gornick wrote:“many American critics… pronounced [\"The Oasis\"] brilliant but heartless. They were wrong. The book is not heartless. It is not out for blood. True, irony inevitably means some fundamental sympathy is being withheld, but the irony here is not savage. Its deliciously witty sentence structure is rooted in the heartfelt disappointment of a moralist whom the reader feels has really wanted the good (that is, the genuine) in our midst to prevail.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "478847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=478847", "title": "The Satanic Bible", "text": "The Satanic Bible\n\nThe Satanic Bible is a collection of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. Though \"The Satanic Bible\" is not considered to be sacred scripture in the way that the Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status. It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as \"atheistic Satanists\" because they believe that God is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection of their own personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in their life. There have been thirty printings of \"The Satanic Bible\", through which it has sold over a million copies.\n\n\"The Satanic Bible\" is composed of four books: \"The Book of Satan\", \"The Book of Lucifer\", \"The Book of Belial\", and \"The Book of Leviathan\". \"The Book of Satan\" challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. \"The Book of Lucifer\" holds most of the philosophy in \"The Satanic Bible\", with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In \"The Book of Belial\", LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. \"The Book of Leviathan\" provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided both in Enochian and in English translation.\n\nThere have been both positive and negative reactions to \"The Satanic Bible\". It has been described as \"razor-sharp\" and \"influential\". Criticism of \"The Satanic Bible\" stems both from qualms over LaVey's writing and disapproval of the content itself. LaVey has been criticized for plagiarizing sections, and accusations have been made that his philosophies are largely borrowed. \"The Satanic Bible\" has been heavily condemned as dangerous, particularly to adolescents. Attempts have been made to ban the book in schools, public libraries, and prisons, though these attempts are somewhat rare.\n\nThere are multiple stories of the birth of \"The Satanic Bible\". In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore describes LaVey as having compiled \"The Satanic Bible\" on his own from monographs he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists a number of people who influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.\n\nLaVey's estranged daughter Zeena Schreck, in an exposé about both her father's religion and past, attributes the birth of \"The Satanic Bible\" to a suggestion by Peter Mayer, a publisher for Avon. According to Schreck, Mayer proposed that LaVey author a Satanic Bible to draw from the popularity of the 1968 horror film \"Rosemary's Baby\", which had caused a recent rise in public interest in both Satanism and other occult practices. Schreck states that, aided by Diane Hegarty, LaVey compiled a number of writings he had already been distributing: an introduction to Satanism, a number of short essays, a guide to ritual magic, and articles he had previously published in \"The Cloven Hoof\", a Church of Satan newsletter.\n\nEither to meet length requirements set by the publisher or out of agreement with the ideas, LaVey and Hegarty borrowed heavily from writings by other authors. These included a social Darwinist book published in 1890 entitled \"Might Is Right\" by Ragnar Redbeard, as well as Dee's Enochian keys from Aleister Crowley's \"The Equinox\", modified to replace references to Christianity with those to Satan. Some accuse LaVey of paraphrasing the \"Nine Satanic Statements\" from Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" without acknowledgement, though others maintain that LaVey was simply drawing inspiration from the novel. LaVey later affirmed the connection with Rand's ideas by stating that LaVeyan Satanism was \"just Ayn Rand's philosophy, with ceremony and ritual added\".\n\nOriginally published in paperback by Avon in 1969, \"The Satanic Bible\" has had thirty printings and has never gone out of print. A hardcover edition was published by University Books that same year but has now been out of print for decades. In 2015, William Morrow published a new hardcover edition of the book combined in a single volume with its companion work, \"The Satanic Rituals\", and marketed under a special arrangement by Rabid Crow Arts and Graphics. The main content has not changed throughout the editions, although the dedication was removed after several printings and the introduction has changed several times. The Sigil of Baphomet has been printed on the cover since the original publication. \"The Satanic Bible\" has sold over one million copies since its initial release. It has also been translated into Danish, Swedish, German, Spanish, Finnish and Turkish.\n\nThough it is no longer included in current printings of \"The Satanic Bible\", early printings included an extensive dedication to various people whom LaVey recognized as influences. LaVey's primary dedication was to Bernardino Nogara (misprinted as \"Logara\"), Karl Haushofer, Grigori Rasputin, Basil Zaharoff, Alessandro Cagliostro, Barnabas, Ragnar Redbeard, William Mortensen, Hans Brick, Max Reinhardt, Orrin Klapp, Fritz Lang, Friedrich Nietzsche, W. C. Fields, P. T. Barnum, Hans Poelzig, Reginald Marsh, Wilhelm Reich, and Mark Twain. The secondary dedication named Howard Hughes, James Moody, Marcello Truzzi, Adrian‐Claude Frazier, Marilyn Monroe, Wesley Mather, William Lindsay Gresham, Hugo Zacchini, Jayne Mansfield, Frederick Goerner, C. Huntley, Nathanael West, Horatio Alger Jr., Robert E. Howard, George Orwell, H. P. Lovecraft, Tuesday Weld, H. G. Wells, Sister Marie Koven, Harry Houdini, Togare (LaVey's pet lion), and the Nine Unknown Men from \"The Nine Unknown\".\n\nThroughout the various printings of \"The Satanic Bible\", it has included introductions by various authors. The first edition (in print from 1969 to 1972) included an excerpt from an article by Burton H. Wolfe, an investigative journalist and biographer of LaVey, entitled \"The Church that Worships Satan\". Wolfe provides an extensive biography of LaVey and a history of the Church of Satan. He mentions \"Rosemary's Baby\" as contributing to the popularity of Satanism, though he does not claim LaVeyan Satanism to have directly influenced its creation. From 1972 until 1976, the introduction to \"The Satanic Bible\" was a piece by Michael A. Aquino, who later went on to found the Temple of Set with a number of members of the Church of Satan. He gives a detailed analysis of the Satanic philosophies, and dispels myths about LaVeyan Satanism. He explains that it is not \"devil worship\", and that LaVeyan Satanists in fact reject the worship of external gods completely. He too provides a brief background on LaVey, explaining how LaVey brought some of the knowledge he had acquired while working with the circus to his religion. Wolfe again wrote the introduction for the 1976 to 2005 editions of \"The Satanic Bible\". It included some of the same content as the 1969 version, with an expanded biography of LaVey and more information on the various conflicts between other religions and LaVeyan Satanism. Since 2005, \"The Satanic Bible\" has contained an introduction written by Gilmore, High Priest of the Church of Satan. In this introduction, he discusses his discovery of LaVeyan Satanism and his relationship with LaVey. He then goes on to provide a detailed biography of LaVey and addresses allegations that LaVey falsified much of the story of his own past. The introduction also provides a history of \"The Satanic Bible\" itself, as well as that of two other books by LaVey: \"The Satanic Witch\" and \"The Satanic Rituals\".\n\nLaVey explains his reasons for writing \"The Satanic Bible\" in a short preface. He speaks skeptically about volumes written by other authors on the subject of magic, dismissing them as \"nothing more than sanctimonious fraud\" and \"volumes of hoary misinformation and false prophecy\". He complains that other authors do no more than confuse the subject. He mocks those who spend large amounts of money on attempts to follow rituals and learn about the magic shared in other occult books. He also notes that many of the existing writings on Satanic magic and ideology were created by \"right-hand path\" authors. He tells that \"The Satanic Bible\" contains both truth and fantasy, and declares, \"What you see may not always please you, but you \"will see\"!\"\n\nThe prologue to \"The Satanic Bible\" begins by discussing the concept of gods, good and evil, and human nature. It includes the Nine Satanic Statements: \nThe Nine Satanic Statements outline the basic ideology of LaVeyan Satanism, and have become some of the guiding principles of LaVeyan Satanism. They also served as a template for later publications by LaVey, such as his 1987 \"Nine Satanic Sins\". Ayn Rand's influence on LaVeyan Satanism is apparent in the Nine Satanic Statements, leading some, namely Nikolas Schreck, to assert that the Statements are simply unacknowledged paraphrase of Rand's thoughts. These accusations have been disproved, however.\n\nMuch of the first book of \"The Satanic Bible\" is taken from parts of Redbeard's \"Might Is Right\", edited to remove racism, antisemitism, and misogyny. It challenges both the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, advocating instead a tooth-for-tooth philosophy. LaVey, through Redbeard, strongly advocates social Darwinism, saying, \"Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!\" Humans are identified as instinctually predatory, and \"lust and carnal desire\" are singled out as part of humans' intrinsic nature. \"The Book of Satan\" suggests a hedonistic outlook, saying, \"I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly happiness.\" Indulgence is endorsed, and readers are encouraged to make the most of their lives. It criticizes both law and religious principles, instead suggesting doing only what makes one happy and successful. LaVey continues to denounce other religions, and he rails against what he considers to be arbitrary definitions of \"good\" and \"evil\". Religion is criticized as a man-made construct, and the reader is urged to question everything and destroy any lies that he or she uncovers. Long-standing lies that are believed to be irrefutable truths are identified as the most dangerous. The last part of \"The Book of Satan\" is an adaptation of the Christian Beatitudes, changed to reflect the principles of LaVeyan Satanism.\n\n\"The Book of Lucifer\" contains the majority of the philosophy of \"The Satanic Bible\". It details how Christianity has taught that God is good and Satan is evil, and presents an alternate view. It describes that the concept of Satan, used synonymously with \"God\", is different for each LaVeyan Satanist, but that to all it represents a good and steadying force in their life. Believers have been called \"atheistic Satanists\" because of this lack of belief in external gods, but others identify as antitheistic. Satan is seen to LaVeyan Satanists not as \"an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a barbed tail, and horns\", but as a force of nature that has only been described as evil by other religions. Satan is viewed as a metaphor or a symbol, not as a being to be worshipped.\n\nLaVey rejects the idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists to take action to fix a situation instead of asking for a solution. The seven deadly sins are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of \"controlled selfishness\", in the sense that doing something to help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" to \"Do unto others as they do unto you\" so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. \"The Book of Lucifer\" also contains a list of \"The Four Crown Princes of Hell\" (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven \"Infernal Names\", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.\n\n\"The Book of Lucifer\" contains a long chapter titled \"Satanic Sex\", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity as well as misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex is the most important element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to \"release the magician's wrath\" as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request in the form of a curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In \"The Book of Lucifer\", LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered their own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.\n\nThe third book of \"The Satanic Bible\" describes rituals and magic. According to Joshua Gunn, these are adapted from books of ritual magic such as Crowley's \"\". \"The Satanic Rituals\", published by LaVey in 1972, outlines the rituals more precisely, and contains the entire text of the Black Mass. LaVey begins \"The Book of Belial\" by defining magic as \"The change in situations or events in accordance with one's will, which would, using normally accepted methods, be unchangeable.\" He explains that some of the rituals are simply applied psychology or science, but that some contain parts with no scientific basis.\n\nLaVey explains that, in order to control a person, one must first attract their attention. He gives three qualities that can be employed for this purpose: sex appeal, sentiment (cuteness or innocence), and wonder. He also advocates the use of odor. In the \"Book of Belial\", he discusses three types of rituals: those for sex, compassion, and destruction. Sex rituals work to entice another person; compassion rituals work to improve health, intelligence, success, and so on; destruction rituals work to destroy another person. LaVey advocates finding others with whom to practice Satanic rituals in order to reaffirm one's faith and avoid antisocial behavior. He particularly advocates group participation for destruction rituals, as compassion and sex rituals are more private in nature. LaVey goes on to list the key components to successful ritual: desire, timing, imagery, direction, and \"The Balance Factor\" (awareness of one's own limitations). Details for the various Satanic rituals are explained in \"The Book of Belial\", and lists of necessary objects (such as clothing, altars, and the symbol of Baphomet) are given.\n\nThe final book of \"The Satanic Bible\" emphasizes the importance of spoken word and emotion to effective magic. An \"Invocation to Satan\" as well as three invocations for the three types of ritual are given. The \"Invocation to Satan\" commands the dark forces to grant power to the summoner, and lists the Infernal names for use in the invocation. The \"Invocation employed towards the conjuration of lust\" is used for attracting the attentions of another. Both male and female versions of the invocation are provided. The \"Invocation employed towards the conjuration of destruction\" commands the dark forces to destroy the subject of the invocation. The \"Invocation employed towards the conjuration of compassion\" requests protection, health, strength, and the destruction of anything ailing the subject of the invocation. The rest of \"The Book of Leviathan\" is composed of the Enochian Keys, which LaVey adapted from Dee's original work. They are given in Enochian and also translated into English. LaVey provides a brief introduction that credits Dee and explains some of the history behind the Enochian Keys and language. He maintains that the translations provided are an \"unvarnishing\" of the translations performed by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the 1800s, but others accuse LaVey of simply changing references to Christianity with those to Satan.\n\n\"The Satanic Bible\" often uses the terms \"God\" and \"Satan\" interchangeably, except when referring to the concepts of these as viewed by other religions. LaVey also occasionally uses the term \"God\" to refer to other religions' views of God, and \"Satan\" or synonyms to refer to the idea of god as interpreted by LaVeyan Satanism, as when he writes, \"When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from 'God'; closer to the 'Devil.'\" Throughout \"The Satanic Bible\", the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true \"self\"—a projection of their own personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. Satan is also used as a metaphor for the ideas connected with the early Christian view of Satan or the serpent: wise, defiant, questioning, and free-thinking. LaVey discusses this extensively in \"The Book of Lucifer\", explaining that the gods worshipped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship.\n\nThough at some points LaVey refers to Satan as a physical being, this is intended to encourage the Satanist's \"rational self-interest.\"\n\nMany of the ideas in \"The Satanic Bible\" are shaped around a secular, scientific view of the world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science. These forces are said to be manipulable by the practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, a trait of the religion that has been compared with Christian Science and Scientology.\n\nJames Lewis argues that scientific themes are so prevalent in \"The Satanic Bible\" because LaVey was appealing to the authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.\n\nSocial Darwinism and the concept of \"human nature\" are ideas that are prevalent throughout \"The Satanic Bible\". LaVey describes Satanism as \"a religion based on the universal traits of man,\" and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human's natural instinct, and are thus advocated. Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in \"The Book of Satan\", where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard's \"Might Is Right\", though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and instinct for self-preservation. LaVeyan Satanism has been described as \"institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest\" because of many of these themes.\n\n\"The Satanic Bible\" is recognized as one of the key texts of modern Satanism. The Church of Satan requires that people accept \"LaVey's principles\" before becoming members of the church. Many other Satanist groups and individual Satanists who are not part of the Church of Satan also recognize LaVey's work as influential. Many Satanists attribute their conversions or discoveries of Satanism to \"The Satanic Bible\", with 20% of respondents to a survey by James Lewis mentioning \"The Satanic Bible\" directly as influencing their conversion.\nIn Gilmore's introduction, he lists a number of novels and films supposedly influenced by \"The Satanic Bible\" and LaVeyan Satanism. These include the novels \"Rosemary's Baby\" by Ira Levin and \"Our Lady of Darkness\" by Fritz Leiber, as well as films such as \"Rosemary's Baby\", \"The Devil's Rain\", \"The Car\", and \"Dr. Dracula\". Others have lauded \"The Satanic Bible\" as heavily influential on metal and rock bands such as Black Sabbath, Venom, King Diamond, and Marilyn Manson.\n\nRichard Metzger describes \"The Satanic Bible\" as \"a razor-sharp, no-bullshit primer in natural and supernatural law.\" David G. Bromley calls it \"iconoclastic\" and \"the best-known and most influential statement of Satanic theology.\" Eugene V. Gallagher says that Satanists use LaVey's writings \"as lenses through which they view themselves, their group, and the cosmos.\" He also states: \"With a clear-eyed appreciation of true human nature, a love of ritual and pageantry, and a flair for mockery, LaVey's \"Satanic Bible\" promulgated a gospel of self-indulgence that, he argued, anyone who dispassionately considered the facts would embrace.\" The philosophy it presents has been described as \"strident libertarianism\" and \"an obvious distillation of ideas common among members of the United States counter-culture in the 1960s.\" Joshua Gunn argues that the significance of \"The Satanic Bible\" as an occult item owes to its status as a \"totem or a fetishized object in popular culture\", not the philosophy contained within. He argues that many erroneously categorize the content of \"The Satanic Bible\" as evil and depraved from the minimalist, dark cover design (composed of a purple Sigil of Baphomet and white text on the front, and a photo of LaVey superimposed over the Sigil of Baphomet on the back), the verbose, overblown style of the text, and the presence of the word \"Satan\" in the title. Contrary to this belief, he says, the philosophy presented by LaVey is \"neither offensive nor surprising.\"\n\nZeena Schreck has criticized \"The Satanic Bible\" as a financial endeavor suggested by Avon publisher, Mayer. She maintains that it contains large amounts of falsified information about LaVey's past, and that much of the book is plagiarized from Redbeard's \"Might Is Right\", Dee's Enochian Keys, and Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\". Chris Mathews, in \"Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture\", describes \"The Satanic Bible\" as \"hastily prepared\" and cynical. Both Mathews and a 1971 article in \"Newsweek\" compare the ideologies presented in \"The Satanic Bible\" to Nazism: containing \"unremitting focus on social elitism, appeals to force, and scorn for egalitarian principles\". Israel Regardie criticized LaVey's alteration of the Enochian Keys in \"The Book of Leviathan\" as stupid and of lower quality than the original Keys.\n\n\"The Satanic Bible\" has also received a large amount of criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of \"Satanic panic,\" when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as \"uncritical and sensationalized.\" Tom Harpur condemns the book as \"blasphemous\" and \"socially seditious,\" and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused \"The Satanic Bible\" of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of \"The Satanic Bible\" has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of \"The Satanic Bible\". Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for \"The Satanic Bible\" in their children's bedrooms, saying, \"You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction\" and \"It's like giving drugs to a kid who is already on the edge.\" Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to \"The Satanic Bible\" has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.\n\n"}

In 1765, after the king fired the chief magistrate and the case was retried by another court, Calas was posthumously exonerated and his family paid 36 thousand francs.\n\nVoltaire's argument is illustrated in the following passages:\n\n\"There are about forty millions of inhabitants in Europe who are not members of the Church of Rome; should we say to every one of them, 'Sir, since you are infallibly damned, I shall neither eat, converse, nor have any connections with you?'\";\n\n\"O different worshippers of a peaceful God! If you have a cruel heart, if, while you adore he whose whole law consists of these few words, \"Love God and your neighbor'...\"\n\n\"I see all the dead of past ages and of our own appearing in His presence. Are you very sure that our Creator and Father will say to the wise and virtuous Confucius, to the legislator Solon, to Pythagoras, Zaleucus, Socrates, Plato, the divine Antonins, the good Trajan, to Titus, the delights of mankind, to Epictetus, and to many others, models of men: 'Go, monsters, go and suffer torments that are infinite in intensity and duration. Let your punishment be eternal as I am. But you, my beloved ones, Jean Châtel, Ravaillac, Damiens, Cartouche, etc. who have died according to the prescribed rules, sit forever at my right hand and share my empire and my felicity.' You draw back with horror at these words; and after they have escaped me, I have nothing more to say to you.\"\n\nVoltaire finished the work by January 2, 1763, and it was printed by the Cramer brothers in Geneva in April 1763. After copies had been distributed to selected recipients include Madame de Pompadour, ministers of the French privy council, the king of Prussia, and some German princes, it began to be distributed in October 1763 and was quickly banned.\n\nIn January 2015, after the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, it was reported that \"Treatise on Tolerance\" had become a bestseller in France more than 250 years after its first publication.\n\n"}
{"id": "36625899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36625899", "title": "Tržan Castle in Modruš", "text": "Tržan Castle in Modruš\n\nThe Tržan Castle (; or \"Utvrda Tržan\") is a ruined medieval castle above the village of Modruš in the northern part of historical Lika region, central Croatia. Before (from the 11th century) the administrative seat of the former Modruš County (later renamed Modruš-Rijeka County), it is today just a ruin in the Josipdol Municipality in the southern part of the Karlovac County. \n\nHaving been built on a ridge of a steep hill above sea level on the eastern slopes of the Velika Kapela mountain, the castle was at a strategic place overlooking the road that connected the Adriatic Sea and the Pannonian Basin since ancient times. The road in question connected the Roman towns of Senia (present-day Senj) and Siscia (present-day Sisak). It was later, during the 18th century, reconstructed, improved and renamed as Josephina road.\n\nAccording to the famous Croatian historian Vjekoslav Klaić (1849–1928), a kind of a castle or stronghold most probably existed above Modruš already at the beginning of the 9th century, during a war between Borna, Duke of Dalmatian Croatia, and Ljudevit Posavski, Duke of Pannonian Croatia.\n\nAlmost ideal position, dominating over the surrounding area, made Tržan Castle never to be conquered by anyone in its history, although the town of Modruš below the castle was plundered and burned by the Ottomans in 1493, just before the battle of Krbava Field.\n\nFrom 1193 the castle was property of the Knezes (Princes) of Krk, (later, from around 1430, known as the Frankopans), a distinguished Croatian noble family. Bartol II Krčki /Bartholomew II of Krk/ was given the whole vast Modruš estate, including the castle, by the Croato-Hungarian king Bella II (III) for his merits in the wars he fought. The next more than 350 years Tržan was owned by the Frankopans, not only as one among the many castles in their property, but as the main seat and stronghold of the family in the whole continental part of Croatia. From thence ruled, among others, Ivan V Krčki /John V of Krk/ (born before 1343, died 1393) and his son Nikola IV /Nicholas IV/ (born around 1360, died 1432), the most powerful man in Croatia at the beginning of the 15th century, both Bans (Viceroys) of Croatia. They reconstructed and enlarged the old, irregular shaped castle, which was from around 1437 called Tržan or Tržan-grad, because of an increased trade that was going on there ().\n\nThe walls, bastions and towers were built of hewn stone (ashlar) in the „fishbone“ style and represented a kind of masterpiece of the contemporary building skill. There are some signs which indicate that the foreign building masters took part in the works, most probably those from the Republic of Venice. The castle itself consisted of central part with a large guard tower and a palace as residence for members of the princely family with its supporting staff, northern part with outbuildings for economic services, various workshops, warehouses, water tanks and rectangular defending tower, and southern part containing mostly facilities for retail trade, accommodation for traders and travellers etc. Following the walls and bastions of the castle, there were defensive walls, about long, around the town of Modruš, descending the slope of the hill.\n\nIn 1449 a well-known partition of the huge Frankopan estates, spread throughout central and western Croatia, took place, as the eight sons of Nikola IV Frankopan agreed to split and share their father`s property (legally valid) among themselves. In the course of this, the whole Modruš estate belonged to Stjepan III /Stephen III/ (born before 1416, died around 1481–84); in the sharing inheritance document it was written: „...to Stjepan belongs the market town Modruš with the Tržan \"Castrum\"“... It was a time of constant and steady rise, a „golden age“ of Modruš, that reached its peak in 1460, as the town became a seat of a bishop.\n\nBernardin Frankopan (1453–1529), the only son of Stjepan III, successfully managed the whole of his property further from the Tržan Castle, although there was increasing threat of the Ottoman raids from the already conquered Bosnian territory, east of Modruš County. This led to decrease of importance of Tržan by the end of the 15th century, and the population of the whole area started to move away more and more from its old places of residence to the other, safer parts of Croatia and neighbouring countries, not willing to live in endangered territory.\n\nIn the first half of the 16th century the castle was always less maintained and repaired than needed, and after 1553 came under control of the military authorities of the Croatian Military Frontier. A relatively small military deployment unit was permanently stationed there. After several unsuccessful attempts to renovate or rebuild the more and more severely damaged parts of the castle during the 17th and 18th century, the military authorities decided in 1791 to abandon it. Following the negligible Ottoman danger at that time, they presumed that it was not necessary to keep soldiers in Tržan and it was left to its own destiny, becoming a badly damaged castle ruin today.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9627199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9627199", "title": "Turnsole", "text": "Turnsole\n\nTurnsole or folium was a dyestuff prepared from the annual plant \"Chrozophora tinctoria\".\n\nTurnsole became a mainstay of medieval manuscript illuminators starting with the development of the technique for extracting it in the thirteenth century, when it joined the vegetable-based woad and indigo in the illuminator's repertory. However, the queen of blue colorants was always the expensive lapis lazuli or its substitute azurite, ground to the finest powders. According to its method of preparation, turnsole produced a range of translucent colors from blue, through purple to red, according to its reaction to the acidity or alkalinity of its environment, in the chemical reaction, not understood in the Middle Ages, that is most familiar in the Litmus test.\n\n\"Folium\" (\"leaf\"), was actually derived from the three-lobed fruit (\"illustration\"), not the leaves. In the early fifteenth century, Cennino Cennini, in his \"Libro dell' Arte\" gives a recipe \"XVIII: How you should tint paper turnsole color\" and \"LXXVI To paint a purple or turnsole drapery in fresco.\" (though neither of these recipes use or describe turnsole). Textiles soaked in the dye vat would be left in a close damp cellar in an atmosphere produced by pans of urine. It was not realized that the oxidizing urine was producing ammonia, but the technique reminds us how foul-smelling was the dyer's art.\n\nThe colorant was downgraded to a shading glaze and fell out of use in the illuminator's palette by the turn of the seventeenth century, with the easier availability of less fugitive mineral-derived blue pigments.\n\nTurnsole was used as a food colorant, mentioned in \"Du Fait de Cuisine\" which suggests steeping it in milk. \"The French Cook\" by François Pierre La Varenne (London 1653) mentions turnsole grated in water with a little powder of Iris. \n\nHerbals indicated that the plant grows on sunny, well-drained Mediterranean slopes and called it \"solsequium\" (\"sun-follower\") from its habit of turning its flowers to face the sun; alternatively it might be called \"Greater Verucaria\"; early botanical works gave it synonyms of \"Morella\", \"Heliotropium tricoccum\" and \"Croton tinctorium\".\n\n\n"}

She is a young woman of Messaline. In the beginning Viola is found shipwrecked on the shores of Illyria and separated from her twin brother, not knowing whether he is alive or dead, the Sea Captain that tells her that this place is ruled by the Duke Orsino, who is in love with the Countess Olivia. Viola wants to serve her, but, finding this impossible, she has the Sea Captain dress her up like a eunuch, so she can serve the Duke instead.\n\nViola chooses the name Cesario and secures a position as a page working for the Duke. He then entrusts Cesario (Viola) to express his love for Olivia. Cesario continues to pass messages back and forth between the Duke and Olivia, but this eventually places her in somewhat of a quandary: she is forced by duty to do her best to plead Orsino’s case to Olivia, but an internal conflict of interest arises when she falls in love with Orsino, and Olivia, believing her to be male, falls in love with her. Upon receiving a ring from Olivia's steward, Viola contemplates the love triangle her disguise has created, admitting only time can solve it.\n\nWhen Sebastian, Viola's lost twin, arrives alive and well in Illyria with a pirate named Antonio, the chaos of mistaken identity ensues because of their remarkably similar looks, only made more similar due to Viola dressing up as a male. The absurdity of the identity crisis builds until Sebastian and Viola as Cesario meet for the first time, and eventually recognise one another. Olivia and Sebastian have already been secretly married, as she mistook him for Cesario, and Sebastian, ignorant of the foregoing love triangle, was simply entranced by a beautiful woman. Ultimately then, given what he has witnessed, Orsino admits that he will no longer pursue Olivia, agreeing to love her as his sister, and decides to take Viola as his wife once she quits her disguise.\n\nAlthough Viola is the play's protagonist, her true name is not spoken by any character—including herself—until the final scene of the play (Act 5, scene 1).\n\nCirca 1771 Francis Wheatley used actress Elizabeth Younge as a model to paint Viola in Act III, Scene 4 after she and Sir Andrew have drawn swords (painting top-right).\nWilliam Hamilton painted the confrontation between Olivia and Viola circa 1797: in Act V, Scene 1 Olivia believes Viola (dressed as Cesario) to be Sebastian (Viola's twin brother) who she has just married.

Due to its links and considerable work with European and American galleries, ZCAC has been influential in the contemporary Ethiopian visual art sector and as a conduit for Ethiopian artists to be featured internationally. It is currently headed by curator .\n\nThe concept was first introduced to the public in 2002 during Giziawi #1, its first art happening. Named after Zoma Shifferaw, a young Ethiopian artist who died of cancer in 1979, ZCAC is located in two major cities in Ethiopia. ZCAC Addis is in a house built by Elias Sime in Addis Ababa, and ZCAC Harla is in Harla, a small historic village east of Dire Dawa. ZCAC is run like a family where the surrounding community is an extension of the center.\n\nThe construction of ZCAC begun in 2002 by Elias Sime, which took him about seven years to build the unique building of mud and straw. Due to Elias' solo exhibition “Eye of the Needle, Eye of the Heart” (2009) at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, the house attracted the attention of the world media. The New York Times Magazine called it “a voluptuous dream, a swirl of ancient technique and ecstatic imagination”. The house is the home of ZCAC Addis and features a showroom and a studio for visiting artists. In 2014, the New York Times selected ZCAC's photo for their article about 52 places to go in 2014.  \nHarla is a small village located in hills roughly 15 kilometers from Dire Dawa encompassing several archaeological sites. In 2007, ZCAC received a piece of land in Harla from the Dire Dawa city administration. Following ZCAC's goals, sustainable buildings are being constructed there.\n\nZoma School is an edible schoolyard where students learn to create and sustain an organic garden in a landscape that is wholly integrated into the schools’ curriculum, culture and food program. \n\nInspired by Alice Waters Edible Schoolyard project, Zoma School aims to provide an education system where children are thought mathematics, science, language and art by integrated garden and kitchen classes. \n\nOne of the activities taught to kids at the school is how to unicycle. The founders believe that children will build a lifetime of confidence through the trail and error that it takes to learn how to unicycle and with out much help from adults. \n"}
