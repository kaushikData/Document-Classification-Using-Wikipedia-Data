In his compilation \"Le Cabinet des Fées\" (tome 31), Charles-Joseph de Mayer stated that the author was unknown, but it was finally attributed to the Chevalier de Mailly (1657–1724). Andrew Lang collected it in \"The Yellow Fairy Book\".\n\nA king's wife dies in childbirth, leaving a boy heir. The godmother, the \"Good Queen\", names the boy \"Alphege\" and keeps an eye on him from afar. Alphege is brought up by a lady courtier and her husband, who also have daughter, Zayda. The king eventually remarries and has another son; the new queen becomes jealous that Alphege, and not her own son, will become king and seeks help from her friend the \"Fairy of the Mountain\". The Good Queen sends Alphege a talisman, a red ruby, which will protect him only within his father's realm. The wicked queen fruitlessly plots to get get Alphege out of the country, until chance intervenes and he is sent to visit the king's sister. On the way, the entourage stops by a brook, where Alphege drinks the water and immediately rushes off and disappears. Searchers are told by a mysterious black monkey that he will not return until after they have failed for some time to recognise him. The entourage returns; the king dies in his grief and the wicked queen's son becomes king.\n\nYears later, the king is out hunting and spies a green monkey looking at him strangely; he entices it to eat and takes it back to the palace. Soon later, the monkey escapes to the house of Zayda and her mother (the father having died). The mother becomes convinced it is Alphege, and then the Good Queen appears to her in a dream. She and Zayda follow the Good Queen's instructions and restore Alphege. Meanwhile, the wicked queen implores the king to kill an \"impostor\" raised up by plotters of a revolt. Instead, he makes inquiries and goes to confront the women at their home. He is astounded to meet Alphege, and immediately renounces his crown. At the palace, Alphege displays the ruby talisman, which splits with a loud noise, and the wicked queen dies. Alphege marries Zayda and shares the throne with his stepbrother.\n\nThis tale makes use of fairies and shapeshifting in a manner similar to many précieuse writers, such as Madame d'Aulnoy.\n\n"}

Due to the sensitive nature of the territory close to the borders with Lebanon and the Golan, visitors may need a military escort to access the site, which is a ten-minute walk along a steep track away from the main road.\n\nJulien Aliquot suggested that the site may have been called Barkousa in ancient times. This was contrary to the location of Barkusha that had previously been suggested by Albrecht Alt in 1947. In the 6th century, it was renamed Justinianopolis (, \"city of Justinian\") after the Byzantine emperor Justinian I.\n\nThere are the ruins of two Roman temples in the village that are included in a group of Temples of Mount Hermon.\n\nThe ruins of a 6th-century CE Byzantine basilica lie on the top of a hill which has been artificially flattened to form a two level plateau. The area around features numerous rock cut rooms and crypts. The podium on which the basilica is constructed is suggested to be that of a previous Roman temple suggested to date to the 1st century CE. The Roman temple itself is thought to have been built on the remains of a previous temple that had been in use for secular purposes for at least four hundred years earlier and possibly for many generations prior. The basilica is constructed of massive blocks of stone and the site is littered with other confusing blocks, some of which possibly resemble buildings or unusual geological outcrops.\n\nThe temple complex at Burqush was mentioned by the German archaeological mission to Baalbek in 1903 and has received little study since then. A topographic and architectural survey of the site was conducted in 1999 by Gunnar Brands for the University of Halle-Wittenberg. A dissertation covering the results of the survey is in progress by Frederike von Bargen.\n\nThe survey noted complex substructures, and intended to document the surrounding settlements, tombs, quarries and a propylon temple ruins. The survey was hampered by the remoteness and altitude of the site, tank shelling, and finding a settlement in the area that was twice as large as expected with numerous rock cut tombs nearby. The basement of the basilica was constructed from bedrock and showed a high technical quality of construction. Traces of bronze candle holders were found along with remnants of a marble cover that was white with gray veining. Twelve capitals were recorded in 1903, of which only eight remained in place, with three more displaced nearby, one reused for medieval farming. The twelfth capital had been covered in rubble and totally obscured. The east wall of the basilica features a portico. Foundations of what were thought to be a peristyle for the basilica were found to its north west, some of the area to the north was cleared and leveled by the military. The remains of the settlement are dispersed on the east slope of the hill are also large buildings on the west slope.\n\n"}

{"id": "18758752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18758752", "title": "Contemporary romance", "text": "Contemporary romance\n\nContemporary romance is a subgenre of romance novels, generally set contemporaneously with the time of its writing. The largest of the romance novel subgenres, contemporary romance novels are set in the time when they were written, and usually reflect the mores of their time. Heroines in the contemporary romances written prior to 1970 usually quit working when they married or had children, while those novels written after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.\n\nMost contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books, and the majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print. Those that survive the test of time, such as the works of Jane Austen are often reclassified as historical romances. In a 2014 survey of romance readers, contemporary romance made up 41% of print and 44% of ebook sales compared to other romance subgenres. Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by Kelly Ripa to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club.\n\nContemporary romance novels may, in turn, be categorized into several subgenres, sometimes mixing with other main subgenres of romance novels.\n\nSubgenres include:\n\nThis subgenre includes pregnancy, babies or children. One obstacle for making plots in this sense is to adapt to an ongoing increase in women who independently foster their children without any partner.\n\nHighly notable examples include \"Nobody's Baby But Mine\" by Susan Elizabeth Phillips.\n\nMedical romance novels may generally be regarded as a subcategory of contemporary romance, as well as of medical fiction, but has its own type of setting and characters, although it yet can be as multifarious as any other subgenre. The setting usually involves a medical workplace, often the emergency department, but also airborne medicine, family medicine and obstetrics and gynaecology.\n\nRegarding characters, the central male protagonists (heroes) are almost always medical doctors, mostly emergency physicians, primary care physicians or surgeons, and sometimes obstetricians/neonatologists or pediatricians. The female protagonists (heroines) are mostly medical doctors but also often nurses, working in primary care, obstetrics/neonatology, training or residency programs, surgery, anesthesiology or emergency medicine. The doctors are almost always ingenious, the male ones usually being tallish, husky and chiseled, while nurses are strong but caring.\n\nPatients bring a lot of potential for subplots. They mostly get completely recovered, regardless of the severity of their injury or disease. Almost no plot, however, includes a doctor-patient or nurse-patient relationship, since it is a code for professional health care workers to avoid intimate relationships with patients, as a part of a professional doctor-patient relationship.\n\nThe plot often includes pregnancy and children.\n\nThis subgenre is an important part of literature and has been prevalent since the mid 1700s. The lesbian romance genre is often a subgenre of broader genres such as BDSM romance, paranormal romance, coming-of-age romance, fantasy romance, and inspirational romance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26500337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26500337", "title": "Edith Craig", "text": "Edith Craig\n\nEdith Ailsa Geraldine Craig (9 December 1869 – 27 March 1947) was a prolific theatre director, producer, costume designer and early pioneer of the women's suffrage movement in England. She was the daughter of actress Ellen Terry and the progressive English architect-designer Edward William Godwin, and the sister of theatre practitioner Edward Gordon Craig.\n\nAs a lesbian, an active campaigner for women's suffrage, and a woman working as a theatre director and producer, Edith Craig has been recovered by feminist scholars as well as theatre historians. Craig lived in a ménage à trois with the dramatist Christabel Marshall and the artist Clare 'Tony' Atwood from 1916 until her death.\n\nEdith 'Edy' Craig, like her younger brother Edward, was illegitimate, as her mother, Ellen Terry, was still married to her first husband George Frederic Watts when she eloped with Godwin in 1868. Edith Craig was born the following year at Gusterwoods Common in Hertfordshire, and was given the surname 'Craig' to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy. The family lived in Fallows Green, Harpenden in Hertfordshire, designed by Godwin, until 1874. The couple separated in 1875. In 1877 Terry married her second husband, Charles Wardell, an actor with the stage name Charles Kelly with whom she had worked. He became a father figure for the children leading to Craig taking the name Wardell. However, in 1907 Terry married her third husband, James Carew, whom Edith Craig did not like.\n\nCraig was educated at Mrs Cole's school, a co-educational institution in Earls Court in London, and at the Royal Academy of Music. Craig made her first appearance on the stage in 1878 during the run of \"Olivia\" at the Royal Court Theatre. She trained as a pianist under Alexis Hollander in Berlin, Germany, from 1887 to 1890. She also occasionally studied under Elizabeth Malleson of Dixton Manor Hall, Winchcombe, Gloucestershire.\n\nCraig joined the Lyceum Theatre company as a costume designer and actress, touring America in 1895 and 1907 under the stage name Ailsa Craig. Edith was noted for her expertise in historically accurate costumes and began to gain recognition for them. Like her younger brother, Craig appeared with Henry Irving in a number of plays, including \"The Bells\" (1895). In 1895 her performances in Pinero's \"Bygones\" and Charles Reade's \"The Lyons Mail\" respectively were praised by George Bernard Shaw and Eleonora Duse. George Bernard Shaw was a family friend of Craig's, he wrote several roles specifically for her. In Bernard Shaw's play \"Candida\", it is believed that the role of Prossy was created for Craig, who originally played the role.\n\nCraig also acted in plays by George Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen, toured with Mrs Brown-Potter and the Independent Theatre. In 1899, Irving employed her to make the costumes for his production of \"Robespierre\", which led to her going into business as a dressmaker as Edith Craig & Co in Covent Garden until 1903. After Ellen Terry left the Lyceum Theatre and went into management, Craig accompanied her on her tours in the English provinces and America as her stage-director, and from then play-production became her chief occupation.\n\nCraig founded the Pioneer Players (1911–1925), a theatre society based in London. The Pioneer Players were known for producing formerly banned plays, plays on social humanism, women's suffrage and feminism and, from 1915, foreign plays in English. The plays in translation allowed the group to reach beyond the Actresses Franchise League and to be accepted into mainstream English theatre. Craig's mother, Ellen Terry, was president of the society. Craig served as the managing director / stage director, and her partner, Chris St. John, served as the secretary. An advisory committee included George Bernard Shaw and the President Gabrielle Enthoven. The Pioneer Players has been described by some critics as a women's theatre company, increasing women's opportunities in theatre. for whom Craig produced approximately 150 plays.\n\nAfter the Pioneer Players finally closed, Craig produced plays for the Little Theatre movement at York, Leeds, Letchworth and Hampstead. In 1919, she was an important figure in the British Drama League (BDL), which had been formed to promote amateur theatre throughout the United Kingdom, and to encourage a lasting peace after World War I. Later Craig directed plays at the Everyman Theatre Hampstead and Leeds Art Theatre. In 1929, the year after Ellen Terry's death, Craig converted the Elizabethan barn adjacent to Terry's house at Smallhythe Place into a theatre which she named The Barn Theatre. Here she produced Shakespeare every year to commemorate the anniversary of her mother's death. Craig also appeared in a number of silent films, including \"Fires of Fate\" (1923).\n\nCraig was involved in many suffrage groups, and sold newspapers on behalf of that cause in the street. After she met a woman selling newspapers for the Women's Freedom she became a member and worked at branch level for that group. She did not fully understand the meaning of suffragism, but formed strong opinions about it quickly. She stated that's \"[she] grew up quite firmly certain that no self-respecting woman could be other than a suffragist\". Craig used her theatrical experience on behalf of the Actresses' Franchise League and was also involved in various suffrage productions. She directed \"A Pageant of Great Women\", a play she devised with the writer and actor Cicely Hamilton, which was performed across the United Kingdom before large audiences. \"A Pageant\" followed the concept of a morality play in which the main character, Woman, is confronted by the antagonist, Prejudice, who believes that men and women are not equal. Justice presides over the debate between Prejudice and Woman, as groups of great women process on stage as evidence of women's achievements in art, government, education, spiritual matters and battle. Craig directed each production of this play, bringing the three professional actors to perform Woman, Justice and Prejudice and the historically accurate costumes with her to each venue. Craig frequently played the role of Rosa Bonheur, a lesbian artist.\n\nThe composer Martin Shaw proposed to Craig in 1903, and she accepted. However, the marriage was prevented by Ellen Terry, out of jealousy for her daughter's affection, and by Christabel Marshall, who wrote under the pseudonym Christopher St. John, with whom she lived from 1899 until they were joined in 1916 by the artist Clare 'Tony' Atwood, living in a ménage à trois until Craig's death in 1947. Her lesbian lifestyle was looked down upon by her family. Her brother Edward said Edith's sexuality was a result of her \"hatred of men, initiated by the hatred of her father\". Craig became involved in several books about her mother and George Bernard Shaw which created a rift in the relationship with her brother, who asked Craig not to write about their mother, and specifically not to share the details of the family's innermost problems. Edward Gordon Craig's book \"Ellen Terry and her Secret Self\" (1931) explicitly objected to \"Ellen Terry and Bernard Shaw: a Correspondence\" (1931) edited by Christopher St. John. In 1932 Craig co-edited with St. John \"Ellen Terry's Memoirs\" in which she replied to her brother's representation of their mother. Also in 1932 Craig adopted Ruby Chelta Craig. Craig was reconciled with her brother some time before her death.\n\nOn the death of her mother Craig committed her life to preserving her mother's legacy. She opened the family home, Smallhythe Place in Kent, England to the public. From 1939 she was supported in running the house by the National Trust. On her death she left Smallhythe Place to the National Trust as a memorial to her mother. Craig died of coronary thrombosis and chronic myocarditis on 27 March 1947 at Priest's House, Smallhythe Place while planning a Shakespeare festival in honour of her mother. Her body was cremated. Marshall and Atwood are buried alongside each other at St John the Baptist's Church, Small Hythe. Craig's ashes were supposed to be buried there as well, but at the time of Marshall and Atwood's deaths, the ashes got lost and a memorial was placed in the cemetery instead.\n\nEdith Craig suffered from acute arthritis especially in her hands. In her younger days, this painful condition prevented her from becoming a professional musician. She attended the Royal Academy of Music and held a certificate in piano from Trinity College. In her later years, after the death of her mother, Craig dictated her memoirs to her friend Vera Holme, known as Jacko. Jacko wrote them down in a quarto notebook that was \"lost in an attic\" for decades and then sold to Ann Rachlin in 1978. They included Craig's reminiscences of her childhood and life with her mother, Edward Gordon Craig and Henry Irving. Rachlin published them in her book \"Edy was a Lady\" in 2011.\n\nVirginia Woolf is said to have used Edith Craig as a model for the character of Miss LaTrobe in her novel \"Between the Acts\" (1941).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 1 February 2018 a Kindle in Motion edition, featuring these illustrations with movement, was released for compatible devices.\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts\" purports to be a reproduction of a textbook owned by Harry Potter and written by magizoologist Newt Scamander, a character in the fictional \"Harry Potter\" series. In the series, magizoology is the study of magical creatures.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, provides the foreword and explains the purpose of the special edition of this book (the Comic Relief charity). At the end, he tells the reader, \"...The amusing creatures described hereafter are fictional and cannot hurt you.\" He repeats the Hogwarts motto: \"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus\", Latin for \"Never tickle a sleeping dragon\".\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" contains the history of magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the world. Scamander says that he collected most of the information found in the book through observations made over years of travel across five continents. He notes that the first edition was commissioned in 1918 by Augustus Worme of Obscurus Books. However, it was not published until 1927. It is now in its fifty-second edition.\n\nIn the Harry Potter universe, the book is a required textbook for first-year Hogwarts students, having been an approved textbook since its first publication. In his foreword to the book, Albus Dumbledore notes that it serves as an excellent reference for wizarding households in addition to its use at Hogwarts.\n\nThe book features doodles and comments added by Ron Weasley. The comments would appear to have been written around the time of the fourth book, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\" These doodles add some extra information for fans of the series (for example the \"Acromantula\" entry has a comment confirming that Hogwarts is located in Scotland) along with comic relief (such as Ron saying \"you're not kidding\" when talking about the Hungarian Horntail being the most fearsome dragon of all, a reference to Harry's encounter with one in the fourth book).\n\nThe cover design of the first edition of the book features apparent claw marks from an unidentified animal.\n\nThis edition features six new creatures: the hidebehind, the hodag, the horned serpent, the snallygaster, the thunderbird and the wampus cat, in addition to the original 75, and the illustrations are replaced. Newt Scamander in the foreword stated the reason the six new creatures were not previously included is because MACUSA president Seraphina Picquery requested the more important American creatures not be mentioned to deter wizarding sightseers at a time when the US wizarding community were subject to greater persecution than their European counterparts, and after Scamander had contributed to a breach of the International Statute of Secrecy in New York.\n\nNewton Artemis Fido \"Newt\" Scamander is the fictional author of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", born in 1897. According to the \"About the Author\" section of the book, Scamander became a magizoologist because of his own interest in fabulous beasts and the encouragement of his mother, an enthusiastic Hippogriff breeder. In Hogwarts, he was sorted into Hufflepuff house.\n\nAfter being expelled from Hogwarts, Scamander joined the Ministry of Magic in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. His career included a brief stint in the Office of House-elf Relocation, a transfer to the Beast Division, the creation of the Werewolf Register in 1947, the 1965 passage of the Ban on Experimental Breeding, and many research trips for the Dragon Research and Restraint Bureau. His contributions to Magizoology earned him an Order of Merlin, Second Class in 1979.\n\nWhen retired, he lived in Dorset with his wife Porpentina and their pet Kneazles: Hoppy, Milly and Mauler. He had a grandson named Rolf, who married Luna Lovegood (a character who appeared in the last three \"Harry Potter\" novels) some time after the events of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\".\n\nIn the film version of \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", Newt Scamander's name appeared on the Marauder's Map. \n\nIn the film adaptation of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", it is mentioned that Scamander was expelled from Hogwarts following an unspecified incident involving one of his creatures, but Albus Dumbledore argued in his defence.\n\nScamander himself does not appear in the seven Harry Potter books. He is mentioned in passing in \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" as the author of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\". He is the central character of the film adaptation of \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\", in which he is portrayed by Eddie Redmayne.\n\nThe following mythological beasts are listed in the book:\n\n\nJeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" graded the book with an \"A\" and wrote \"With its richly detailed history lessons and witty debate parsing the differences between \"being\" and \"beast\", plus a compendium of 85 magical creatures that's chockablock with Rowling's trademark wordplay (\"Glumbumble\" is a standout), \"Beasts\" adds a vital new dimension to the Potter mythology.\"\n\n\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" is a British-American fantasy film inspired by the book of the same name by J. K. Rowling. An extension of the wizarding world from the \"Harry Potter\" film series and directed by David Yates, the film stars Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, Samantha Morton, Ezra Miller, Colin Farrell, Carmen Ejogo, Faith Wood-Blagrove, Jenn Murray, Jon Voight and Ron Perlman.

Member cities, organization and individual members are engaged in producing popular celebrations or carnivals which represent an authentic masquerade or parade of a people's cultural identity. The General membership meets twice each year generally at the end of May and in October. \n\nOn the occasion of the 700th anniversary of Amsterdam (The Nederlands), Carnival Princes from all over the world met each other in the Amsterdam RAI congress centre in November 1975. The Amsterdam Carnival Association, governed by Mr.Henk van der Kroon was called \"Amstelpieren & Brokkerijders.\" The big event brought an unprecedented number of Carnival Associations from different countries together. The guests of honour included Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands as well as diplomats and dignitaries from afar including Brazil, Greece, Germany and Belgium. This unique event is widely recognized as the starting point for the lasting contacts and exchanges between associations and cities that has become the FECC.\n\nIn 1980, international carnival associations met in Patras (Greece), again under the initiative of the Amsterdam Carnival Association Ämstelpieren & Bfrokkerijders. It is generally accepted that the FECC (Foundation of European Carnival) came into existence during this meeting. At the 5th reunion in Kos-Patmos (Greece), which took place in 1985, a membership was introduced and it was decided to drawn up rules and bylaws. The first countries that became a member of the Foundation were Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, England and Malta. Articles of association were formulated and the creation of FECC was registered in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Directly following the 1987 7th reunion in Malta, the Belgian members founded their own section FECC-Belgium with its own governing board. In 1988 FECC-Germany founded their own section as did FECC-Netherlands and FECC –Luxembourg. The first elected International President was Mr. Henk van der Kroon.\n\nThroughout the year the International President and other Board Members travel to member cities and interested Carnivals to learn, educate and often officiate at the ceremonies surrounding what is often the most important annual event for the community and even country. The FECC is a global organization holding its first annual convention outside the Mediterranean in the twin island Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in 1987. Many Carnivals, particularly those in Eastern Europe, have grown up under the mentorship of FECC engagement. Since its founding, the FECC has been the only unswerving organization consistently speaking for the interests and concerns of Carnival organizations. Representatives from Carnival organizations in over 50 countries are members and annual conventions generally have several Mayors seeking ways to bring more international recognition and culturally oriented tourists to their festivals.\n\nOnce a year, all FECC members: cities, associations and individual members are invited to an international assembly. This convention is organized by a member-city and takes place every year in a different country.\nThe convention lasts 1 week end takes place between end mid-May and mid- June. These conventions enjoy a lot of interest: every year, participants from more than 20 countries are present.\nDuring these annual conventions, the members get an international forum which enables them to promote their carnival and their town on the occasion of seminars and workshops.\n\nDirect personal contacts with the numerous participants can also increase the international publicity of a member's carnival and/of town.\nThe organizers of the convention moreover, use these gatherings to show the participants a few tourist attractions and places of interest of their town and the surrounding area. \n\nThe 11 October 1980 marks the founding of the FECC and it is observed by the FECC membership with a Dies Natalis celebration. This weekend gathering is hosted by a member city.\n\nAlso forthcoming \n\nThe FECC is open to membership in the following categories:\n\n\nThe structure is as follows:\n\nThe objectives are:\n\n"}

Vesta Tilley topped the opening bill. Its predecessor the Gaiety Theatre had opened in 1874 under Charles Bernard, staging pantomime, opera, musicals and plays but changed to variety, which Moss Empires developed further.\n\nExpanding westwards towards Renfield Street and after a major Art Deco redesign by Sunderland-based architects W & TR Milburn the Empire re-opened in 1931 with a seating capacity of 2,100. The main attraction on the re-opening was Jack Payne and the BBC Dance Band.\n\nThe Empire presented variety, revues, musicals and dance, including Pavlova, winter circus, pantomimes and ice spectaculars especially those produced by Tom Arnold.\nOver the years many stars appeared including Lilly Langtry, Laurel and Hardy, Sir Harry Lauder, G. H. Elliott, Tommy Lorne, Evelyn Laye, Will Fyffe, Harry Gordon, Robert Wilson, the Logan family and Andy Stewart. Dance bands included Jack Hylton and Joe Loss.\nTop quality American artistes were greatly welcomed, including the Andrews Sisters and Billy Eckstine. Fats Waller made his European debut in the Empire in 1938. Tony Bennett, Johnnie Ray, Frankie Laine, Connie Francis, Eartha Kitt, Howard Keel, Guy Mitchell, Mel Tormé and Liberace were joined by Frank Sinatra, Dorothy Lamour, Bob Hope, Judy Garland, Jack Benny and a great favourite Danny Kaye.\nOther performers from Britain who became regulars included Nat Gonella, Jimmy Young, Harry Secombe, Max Bygraves, Ken Dodd (who brought the house down), Eddie Cochran, Adam Faith, Cliff Richard, the Springfields and Frankie Vaughan before he headlined at the Alhambra Theatre.\nWelsh singer Dame Shirley Bassey made her debut at the theatre in 1959 and was initially given a hard time before asking the audience to give her a chance, whereupon the singer finished her set and was warmly applauded.\n\nThe Empire was notorious within showbiz circles as \"The English comic's grave\", if their act was slow or thin. Among those judged this way were Bob Monkhouse, Tommy Cooper, Bernie Winters and Morecambe and Wise. Des O'Connor pretended to faint when the Glasgow audience started jeering his act and was duly dragged off stage. Roy Castle survived because of his versatility.\n\nComedian Ken Dodd famously disparaged attempts to psychoanalyse humour with the rebuttal, \"The trouble with Sigmund Freud is that he never played second house at the Glasgow Empire after both halves of the Old Firm had just lost!\"\n\nThe record for the longest running shows is held by The Andy Stewart Show, twice-nightly with a change of programme each six weeks, for 26 weeks in 1961 and again in 1962, with 400,000 tickets sold each year.\n\nThe final curtain came down on the theatre on 31 March 1963 with a cast that included the Red Army Choir, Duncan Macrae, Robert Wilson, Iain Cuthbertson, Albert Finney, Rikki Fulton and Andy Stewart. The site is now occupied by Empire House, an office and retail development, at the corner of West Nile Street and 31-35 Sauchiehall Street.\n"}

Ridge of Newark in the UK and sold by the London booksellers: Crosby and Co.; Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme; F. and C. Rivington; and J, Mawman. The full title was \"Hours of Idleness; a Series of Poems Original and Translated. By George Gordon, Lord Byron, a Minor.\" It consisted of 187 pages with thirty-nine poems. Of these, nineteen came from the original \"Fugitive Piece\" volume, while eight had first appeared in \"Poems on Various Occasions\". Twelve were published for the first time. The \"Fragment of a Translation from the 9th Book of Virgil's AEneid\" was included as \"The Episode of Nisus and Euryalus, A Paraphrase from the AEneid, Lib. 9,\" made up of 406 lines.\n\nAfter a scathing review in \"The Edinburgh Review\" in 1808, Byron responded by publishing, anonymously, his satiric poem \"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers\" in 1809.\n\nCritic Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux wrote of the volume: \"The poesy of this young lord belongs to the class which neither gods nor men are said to permit.\" He attacked the poems as “effusions ... spread over a dead flat\" like \"so much stagnant water\" and accused Byron of being disingenuous, “pleading his minority” while seeming at the same time to say, “See how a minor can write!” \n\nIn a letter to John Cam Hobhouse, Byron wrote of his reaction: \"As an author, I am cut to atoms by the E[dinburgh] Review, it is just out, and has completely demolished my little fabric of fame.\"\n\n\n"}

Sturla Þórðarson was at the court of Haakon's son Magnus Lagabøte when Magnus learned of his father's death in Kirkwall in Orkney. Magnus is said to have immediately commissioned Sturla to write his father's saga. This was awkward for Sturla: 'King Hákon had instigated the death of Sturla's uncle, Snorri Sturluson, in 1241.\nSturla rightly regarded Hákon as his most dangerous enemy, for he had steadfastly resisted the king's subjugation of Iceland to Norway, which was accomplished in 1262-1264. Skúli Bárðarson (d. 1240), Hákon's most dangerous rival for royal power, was the maternal grandfather of Magnús, who supervised the composition of his father's biography, much as King Sverrir is said to have \"sat over\" Karl Jónsson as the Icelandic abbot wrote Sverrir's biography'.\n\nThe saga is the main source to Norwegian history for the period from 1217 (Haakon's accession) to his death in 1263. Additionally the saga also describes events in Iceland and other locations where Haakon's realm had a presence.\n\n'Because Sturla relied heavily on eyewitness accounts and written documentation as sources for the prose account of \"Hák[onar saga]\", the poetic citations in the saga are mainly ornamental in nature. The inclusion of the stanzas reflects the convention in the earlier kings’ sagas of using skaldic stanzas to verify the events described in the prose texts.' Nevertheless, the saga contains lots of verse, much by Sturla himself, along with some poetry by his brother Óláfr hvítaskáld Þórðarson and his uncle Snorri Sturluson, Gizurr Þorvaldsson’s \"Hákonardrápa\", and numbers of \"lausarvísur\" (mostly attributed but in three cases anonymous).\n\nThe saga survives in three main redactions, preserved primarily in the manuscripts Eirspennill, Codex Frisianus, and Flateyjarbók. However, there is not yet a satisfactory stemma of the saga, as the relationships between its manuscripts are complex.\n\nAccording to Kari Ellen Gade's edition of the verse in the saga in the Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages edition, the key manuscripts of the saga are:\n\n\n\n"}

He received his first lessons in art from his father, but went on to a formal training with Pierre Lacour and later with Pierre-Narcisse Guérin. In 1807 he was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. From 1808 he entered works for the Prix de Rome, but his energies were diverted when his elder brother, Jean-Francois Alaux (1783–1858), asked him to help with a large \"neorama\" (a type of Panorama) he was working on. Alaux eventually won the major Prix de Rome in 1815 with a work entitled \"Briseis weeping over the body of Patroclus\", a scene inspired by the \"Iliad\" of Homer. He subsequently became a \"pensionnaire\" at the \"French Academy\" in Rome from 1816 to 1820 and went on to become its director.\n\nAmong his fellow artists at the Academy were such luminaries as Drolling, Picot, and Gogniet, and sculptors such as Angers, Pradier, and Ramey; he became a friend of Ingres. His first painting at the Academy was \"Cadmus killing the dragon at the fountains of Dirce\", which was later purchased by the Duke of Orleans but was destroyed in the fire which engulfed the Palais-Royal in the French Revolution of 1848. Alaux also painted at the Academy \"Diamedes carrying off the palladium\" and \"Episodes in the combats between the centaurs and the Lapithes\". In 1821, he returned to France, where his reputation steadily grew with works such as \"The Baptism of Clovis\" (1825), \"States General of 1838\", \"The Assembly of the notables at Rouen in 1596\", and \"States General 1614\". Under the July Monarchy, he worked at the \"Galerie des batailles\" of the Château de Versailles, for which he painted \"The Battle of Villaviciosa\" (1836); \"The Capture of Valenciennes\" (1837); and \"The Battle of Denain\" (1839).\n\nAlaux was appointed as director of the French Academy in Rome in 1846 and was caught up in the siege of Rome of 1849, involving defending Italian forces under Garibaldi and the invading French army; he and his students were forced to temporarily flee the city for France.

She was born June 18, 1943 in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil. She graduated from the University of São Paulo in 1964 with a degree in English and also completed extra courses in theater and literary criticism in Brazil and England. Although she is known as a playwright, she began her career working as an actress and a model, performing in \"Vereda de Salvacao\" by Jorge de Enrade in 1963 and \"The Three-penny opera\" by Bertolt Brecht in 1964. From there, she transitioned into writing stories for magazines and soap operas, eventually leading into her work as a playwright.\n\nAssunção has been classed as among the two major women playwrights of Brazil, the other being Maria Adelaide Amaral. Her first play, \"Fala Baixo Senão Eu Grito\" (Speak Quietly or I’ll Scream), won the Molière Award from the theatre critics of São Paulo when it was staged in 1969. She aimed to shock the audience by her choice of topic: depicting a middle-aged woman meeting an intruder. She was one of the leaders of New Theatre in the 1960s and several of her early plays were banned by censors.\n\n\"Fala Baixo Senão Eu Grito\" along with her two preceding plays, \"Jorginho, o machão\" and \"Roda cor de Roda\" focus majorly on the stereotypes of the middle class and emphasize that conformity to these stereotypes is required. She openly depicts the majority of her characters as stuck in their current lifestyles, unable to break away from the status quo. One commodity of her first three works is that one or more of the characters eventually break free, but not in the traditional way one would think. They break free in regards to their imaginations/fantasies. For a short time period, they are able to fantasize and imagine themselves living in a world outside of the social norms. Overall, she wrights these plays to target the repressions society’s moral standards place on people and the dissatisfaction of life that is likely to come with these repressions.\n\n\"Fala Baixo Senão Eu Grito\" (1969) focuses on a middle-aged woman with a very boring, standard lifestyle. One night, an intruder breaks into her house with a gun and proceeds to insult her and destroy her apartment. He forces the woman to come with him on a fantasy adventure in which the woman breaks away from her dull life and creates an ideal one. She enjoys the experience up until she remembers she has responsibilities to attend to at a local department store. This results in her screaming for help, unable to ignore the obligations of her daily life.\n\n\"Jorginho, o machão\" (1973) describes the dilemma of a young man who is pressured by his family to marry and join the family business. He rebels by fleeing to study at the University of São Paulo and then by continuing to fantasize there about what he wants his life to be like. This behavior does not help the conflict with his parents, resulting in attempted suicide.\n\n\"Roda cor de Roda\" (1973) entails the story of a housewife rebelling against her husband after she has found out he has been cheating. The results in the fantasies of role reversals, where all three of them take turns being the breadwinner, the prostitute, and the homemaker. These role changes result in many opportunities and freedoms for the characters, but also the realizations of the limitations of each role.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1853, making it (along with SmithGroup) the oldest continually operating architecture firm in the United States that is not a wholly owned subsidiary. The firm began under the name \"Rogers, Whitestone & Co., Architects\", changing its name to \"Henry Whitestone\" in 1857, to \"D.X. Murphy & Brother\" in 1890, and to \"Luckett & Farley\" in 1962. The company is 100% employee-owned as of January 1, 2012 and concentrates on automotive, industrial, federal government, higher education, health and wellness, and corporate/commercial markets. There are more LEED professionals at Luckett & Farley than any other company in Kentucky with 50, as of December 2012.\n\nHenry Whitestone (1819–1893) was born at Clondegad House in County Clare, Ireland. He immigrated to the United States amidst famine and depression with his wife Henrietta in January 1852 from Innis, Ireland after he was recommended to Isaiah Rogers (1800–1869), for his work on the County Clare Courthouse. Rogers was an architect based in Cincinnati who came to be known as \"the father of the American hotel\". Whitestone's first project with Rogers was the Capital Hotel in Frankfort, Kentucky and a partnership formed in November 1853 when Rogers was contracted to rebuild the recently burned Louisville Hotel. Whitestone moved from Frankfort to Louisville and received 2/5 of all profits from the services he performed with Rogers.\n\nThe first office of Isaiah Rogers and Henry Whitestone was located at Bullit and Main Streets, near where the Riverfront Plaza/Belvedere is located today. Together they transformed Louisville into a \"five-story city\" and introduced the Italianate architectural style to the region. Whitestone separated from Rogers in 1857 and soon became the preeminent architecture firm in Louisville through the 1880s. Notably, Charles J. Clarke worked for Henry Whitestone during the Civil War and later formed a partnership with Arthur Loomis, to form the historically significant Louisville architecture firm \"Clarke and Loomis\".\n\nWhitestone retired in approximately 1881 and died in 1893. An 1893 publishing of \"The American Architect and Building News\" wrote of Whitestone,\n\nHe is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville Kentucky alongside his wife and two daughters (Section C, lot 39). A marker located on Main St., across from the old Louisville Hotel, bears his name.\nDennis Xavier (\"D.X.\") Murphy (11/3/1853-8/27/1933), was born in Louisville after his parents immigrated from Ireland, began working as a draftsman at age 16 for Henry Whitestone. By 1874 he was the head draftsman and eventually took over the practice in 1880 just before Whitestone's retirement. It was at this point that the firm was renamed \"D.X. Murphy\". His brothers James C. Murphy (1865-1935), later joined the practice in 1890 at which time the firm became \"D.X. Murphy and Brother\". Their younger brother Peter C. Murphy subsequently joined and together they designed many of Louisville's Catholic Churches, among other many notable buildings, for significantly reduced fees on the order of 1% of construction costs. The Murphy's sister, Sr. Mary Anselm, was a nun with the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth in Bardstown, Kentucky which likely led to many of the commissionings.\n\nThe firm's most famous work was that of the Twin Spires at Churchill Downs in 1895, designed by 24-year-old Joseph D. Baldez and constructed in time for the 21st Kentucky Derby.\n\nA number of works by D.X. Murphy or the firm are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWorks include:\n\nDennis Murphy died in 1933 and is buried at St. Louis Cemetery in Louisville.\n\nIn 1935 \"D.X. Murphy and Brother\" was sold by James Murphy's wife to \"D.X. Murphy and Brother Incorporated\" for a sum of $1,147, at which time Peter Murphy became president. By 1943, Peter Murphy was named chairman of the board and William G. O'Toole became president. Thomas D. Luckett II (1909 – 1996) became majority stakeholder in the firm upon O'Toole's passing in 1956 while Jean D. Farley (b. 1927) was named Vice President.\n\n\"D.X. Murphy and Bro., Inc\" became \"Luckett & Farley, Inc\" on May 25, 1962, with T.D. Luckett and J.D. Farley sharing ownership.\n\nD.X. Murphy occupied the old Louisville Trust Building (208 S. 5th St) until 1962 when the office was relocated to the Washington Building (4th and Market), which has since been demolished.\n\nBy the time the firm was renamed \"Luckett & Farley Inc.\" in 1962 to reflect the change of ownership, civil and structural engineering services were also provided; Mechanical and electrical engineering services were added in 1970 in order to deliver better-coordinated construction documents to clients. By 1973 the firm name was changed to \"Luckett & Farley Architects, Engineers, and Construction Managers, Inc.\" and by the end of 1982, Jean Farley sold the company to Dennis Dewitt, Ronald Kendall, and Douglas Wilkerson.\n\nIn 2000 an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) was formed and by 2002, leadership was transferred to Ed Jerdonek, Belinda Gates, Gail Miller, and Rob Diamond. A design-build subsidiary, \"LFDB\", was created in 1999 but has since separated with the company as of 2011. Belinda Gates retired from Luckett & Farley in 2010. On January 1, 2012, Jerdonek, Miller, and Diamond sold their interest in the company to the employee-owners, making Luckett & Farley 100% employee-owned. \nLuckett & Farley occupied the Washington Building from 1963 to 1968 when it moved to 215 W. Breckinridge and again in 1997 to their current location in the Prince Wells Building at 737 S. Third St.\n\nLuckett & Farley utilizes BIM technology to produce their drawings.\n\nDepartments consist of the following fields: \n\n\n"}

The term was occasionally applied to an abortive human fetus.\n\nThe term derives from the once widespread superstition, present in many European folk traditions, that such malformed creatures were the product of the sinister influence of the Moon on fetal development.\n\nThe term came to also refer to any monstrous or grotesque thing. Shakespeare, for instance, used the term to describe Caliban, the deformed servant of Prospero, in \"The Tempest\".\n\nIn H. G. Wells' 1901 novel \"The First Men in the Moon\", large creatures domesticated by the Selenites are referred to as \"mooncalves.\"\n\nMooncalf is used as a derogatory term indicating someone is a dullard, fool or otherwise not particularly bright or sharp. For example, W. C. Fields in \"The Bank Dick\" (1940) advises his prospective son-in-law to avoid being a \"mooncalf\" by buying shares he has been conned into believing are worth much more than the proffered price.\n\nMooncalf is also the name of a species of magical creatures in the world of the Harry Potter series. It is described in \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" as a shy, nocturnal creature with a smooth, pale grey body, bulging eyes and four spindly legs with large flat feet. Mooncalves perform dances in the moonlight, and are apparently responsible for crop circles. In the film of the same name, Newt Scamander's collection of creatures in his suitcase includes a herd of Mooncalves.\n\nWilfred Maxwell, narrator and protagonist of occultist Dion Fortune’s 1938 novel, \"The Sea Priestess\", refers several times to a mentally handicapped character who falls into the sea and disappears as a \"mooncalf\".\n\n"}

Narrative theory is a means by which we can comprehend how we impose order on our experiences and actions by giving them a narrative form. According to Walter Fisher, narratives are fundamental to communication and provide structure for human experience and influence people to share common explanations and understandings (58). Fisher defines narratives as “symbolic actions-words and/or deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.” Study of narrative criticism, therefore, includes form (fiction or non-fiction, prose or poetry), genre (myth, history, legend, etc.), structure (including plot, theme, irony, foreshadowing, etc.) characterization, and communicator’s perspective.\n\nCharacteristics of a narrative were defined as early as Aristotle in his \"Poetics\" under plot. He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a tragedy.” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, climax (narrative), and final resolution. As described by White (1981) and Martin (1986), plot involves a structure of action. However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, and the burden of meaning making gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.\n\nNarratives can be found in a range of practices such as novels, short stories, plays, films, histories, documentaries, gossip, biographies, television and scholarly books. All of these artifacts make excellent objects for narrative criticism. When performing a narrative criticism, critics should focus on the features of the narrative that allow them to say something meaningful about the artifact.

The subject, the birth of Mary, is shown in a secondary location of the lower part of the painting. It includes St. Anne's bed, the midwives with the daughter and St. Joachim riding a stair with something in his hand. \n\nThe predominant part of the work is the church background, where angels fly to form a large circle: in the middle is a young angel with a thurible for the incense.\nThe edifice, symbolizing the analogy between Mary and the Catholic church (a subject later abolished by the Protestant Reformation), is organized in a complicated and original fashion: the ambulatory and the column galleries are Romanesque, the ogival windows are Gothic, the vaults and the shell-shaped niches are in Renaissance style. This attention to architectural elements was typical of Altdorfer's work in the period he spent at the court of Maximilian I.\n"}
{"id": "13054341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13054341", "title": "Nature printing", "text": "Nature printing\n\nNature printing is a printing process, developed in the 18th century, that uses the plants, animals, rocks and other natural subjects to produce an image. The subject undergoes several stages to give a direct impression onto materials such as lead, gum, and photographic plates, which are then used in the printing process.\nWhile some sources state that Benjamin Franklin invented nature printing from leaf casts, using a copper plate press, in 1737 to thwart counterfeiters of paper money bills, other sources also report Franklin's friend, Philadelphia naturalist Joseph Breintnall, to have made contact nature prints from leaves about 1730. Together they sent nature prints which were printed directly from inked leaves to English naturalists.\n\nAnother person attributed with the invention of the process, , is Alois Auer; the first publication, of instructions for the process, was by this Austrian printer in \"The Discovery of the Natural Printing Process: an Invention ...\" Vienna, 1853. This was written in four languages by the author. He shows the use of plants, a fossil fish, and lace impressed by roller onto a lead plate, this is hand coloured and transferred to the final print. \n\nMany others botanical and natural history illustrations had attempted to use techniques that were a 'shorthand', or for a type of accuracy, in the representation of subjects. Another printer, the Englishman Henry Bradbury, immediately used Auer's 'nature printing' process to publish work of his own. These included two major botanical works; \n\nSherman Denton in his book \"As Nature Shows Them: Moths and Butterflies ...\" used the wings of the species he was describing by pressing them into the page itself. For this work he used over 50,000 insects.\n\nAuer's method can only be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, embroidery and lace, and a few animals. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, both of which are smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes. For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in copper by the electrotype process.\n\n"}

The foundation's aim is to maintain and preserve the works of Jasper Cropsey and the art movement he was a part of, the Hudson River School. The foundation also promotes representational painting and sculpture.\n\nThe organization was founded in 1977 by Barbara and John Newington to collect and promote works of Barbara's great-grandfather Jasper Cropsey, as well as other non-abstract art.\n\nThe NCF offers free tours of its properties: Ever Rest, the last home and studio of Jasper Cropsey, and the Gallery of Art Building, a museum dedicated to the works of Cropsey. The properties are adjacent to each other in the village of Hastings-on-Hudson.\n\nThe foundation's stated aim is to preserve the moral, artistic and religious values of Jasper Cropsey and the Hudson River School, as well as to \"recapture a little sense of stability, security and beauty that was so much a part of the 19th century\". The foundation also promotes representational painting and sculpture. The foundation does not seek publicity, intending to stay less noticed by the general public. Other than including listings in local guidebooks, the NCF has no marketing.\n\nThe nonprofit organization is privately owned. The current chairman is Barbara Newington, the executive director is Adelia C. Rasines, and the foundation's director is Anthony Speiser; all three also act as trustees. The organization provides grants to representational artists and classes to sculptors of classical works; it also publishes \"American Arts Quarterly\", a journal for non-abstract art.\n\nThe NCF maintains a large collection of Cropsey's paintings: about 100 oil and 30 watercolor paintings. It is seen as the leading authority on Cropsey paintings.\n\nAfter Jasper Cropsey's death in 1900, his wife Maria Cropsey still lived in Ever Rest, until her death in 1906. Jasper Cropsey's granddaughter Isabel subsequently inherited the property and began buying back some of Cropsey's paintings. Isabel and her husband William Steinschneider lived there, raising their daughter Barbara in the house. William was a six-term mayor of Hastings. Isabel died in 1958 and William in 1970, making William the last to live in the house; Barbara inherited it. Their daughter, married as Barbara Newington, aggressively pursued Cropsey's paintings alongside her husband John until about the 1980s, while Cropsey paintings were still inexpensive. Barbara and John Newington created the Newington-Cropsey Foundation and its properties in 1977 with concern over the state of modern art and \"the way culture was going\".\n\nNewington, today the foundation's chairman, is a philanthropist living in Greenwich, Connecticut and is the great-granddaughter of Cropsey.\n\nAround 1977, the foundation traded land with the village of Hastings, giving the village land and $400,000 for a garage for its department of public works. In turn, the NCF acquired a parcel of land and the village's existing public works garage, on a site that was formerly the town dump for decades, and was called Frog Hollow around Cropsey's time. The NCF's initial plans were to renovate the garage, landscape the property, restore the pond, and construct steps to connect the property to Ever Rest, in total \"to make [the property] look like a Cropsey painting\".\n\nIn 1979, the NCF was among several museums and private collectors that lent items to \"An Unprejudiced Eye\", an exhibit of Cropsey's works. The exhibit was at the Hudson River Museum and was created by the village of Hastings, marking its association with Cropsey and its 100th anniversary. NCF art historian Kenneth Maddox organized and curated the exhibit.\n\nIn April 1988, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation cleaned up oil from Sugar Pond, a small pond on the property. The department approved the project and its environmental assessment report.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, the NCF contracted the construction of an intricately landscaped 19th-century arts complex with three buildings, a pond, and a garden, designed by Peter Gisolfi Associates of Hastings. The first building, the New Studio, opened in 1990 with an exhibition of paintings by Hudson River School artist Worthington Whittredge. The site was also slated to include a gatekeeper's cottage, a library and administration center, an outdoor amphitheater, as well as a museum, which was to be completed in 1992.\n\nDuring the initial planning phase for the complex, the village's historical society intervened, expressing curiosity over possible remains in the ravine. The society urged the village's planning board to put a hold on construction so the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation could make preliminary tests in the ravine. The historical society president described the site as \"our village's cradle of civilization – where our early industry started\"; another member of the society expressed that the site was \"the least-disturbed 19th-century industrial site in Westchester County\". The executive director of the Westchester County Historical Society (a former president of the Hastings Historical Society) supported an archaeological study, and described that the site was previously the confluence of two streams where three early mills operated, including a bone mill and brass and iron-turning factory. Since then, the site was home to the Hastings Pavement and Brick factory, the Cottlet Hotel, and a Hastings Department of Public Works building. The public works building's foundation still remained, and the NCF had planned to build on top of it. The NCF was opposed to archaeological studies as it would require dynamiting the foundation and would disturb the fragile site, including a 125-year-old retaining wall. Greg Wyatt, director of the project, was concerned delays would lead to costs excessive of their $2.7 million budget. The construction was approved pending the archaeological study, paid for by the NCF and directed by a state-approved archaeologist with a specialty in early industry.\n\nBarbara Newington was considered a friend of the Hastings Historical Society, and had given the organization its first substantial home. The NCF gave them a $42,000 grant and a 5-year $1 lease to a cottage next to Ever Rest, which the historical society used until its relocation to its current home, the Henry Draper Observatory.\n\nThe Gallery of Art opened on October 16, 1994.\n\nBeginning in May 1997, the foundation partnered with Vanderbilt University to create a sculpture garden on the university campus, to be known as the \"Garden of Great Ideas\". Then-US Republican Senator Fred Thompson brought the idea of the sculpture garden to the university's chancellor Joe B. Wyatt, who visited the NCF and decided to partner with the organization. \n\nStudents of the NCF's Academy of Art, including six young artists, would create the bronze sculptures. The NCF's goal was the placement of many sculptures on numerous college campuses as a link between scholarship and artistry. By 1997, the NCF had already donated \"Bill of Rights Eagle\", a sculpture by NCF Academy of Art Director Greg Wyatt to the college. The NCF planned to donate 15 to 20 additional bronze sculptures by the students for permanent exhibiton, added over the following three to five years. The final piece would also be by Wyatt, a sculpture named \"Tree of Knowledge\" placed in front of the Jean and Alexander Heard Library.\n\nThe art program had numerous criticisms. The university's art community and faculty were largely not consulted on the decision. One professor at the school expressed dismay that the \"program is nowhere near the avant-garde of our own age\", and that the sculptures were placed in so many areas of the campus that it could impede other gifts or exhibitions on campus. An art professor found the sculptures to not achieve the school's goals of quality and diversity, noting one material, one presentation, and generic ideas symbolized by the works. As well, \nno Vanderbilt students were among the student artists.\n\n\"Tree of Learning\" provoked the most opposition from professors, seen as a \"boring and unchallenging\" reproduction of a barren or burnt dead tree. Judson Newbern, associate vice chancellor of the college, admitted the tree looks dead, and requested Wyatt weld leaves and buds onto his work. Newbern did defend the program overall, and noted that the student artists are diverse in ethnicity and gender.\n\nA committee of professors was not created to approve this project as the vice chancellor did not want the project to be a missed opportunity if obstacles came up. It was noted that the NCF appeared right-leaning, with stated goals to \"advance and promote the values inherent in the 19th century...including the belief that God created nature\". The NCF also promotes \"strong national pride in America\". Professor Cecilia Tichi was against the works for their values, in believing that campuses are a place to stretch people's minds.\n\nSculptor Joseph Petrovics, who sculpted the National Iwo Jima Memorial and the FDNY memorial wall, was a Studio Instructor at the Newington-Cropsey Foundation Academy of Art beginning in 1993.\n\nFrom 1994 until about 2005, the NCF hosted the Hudson Valley Art Association's Annual Exhibition; Newington and the foundation had been long-time supporters of the association, which was established by a small group of artists who first met at Ever Rest in 1928.\n\nIn 2006, the NCF spent $500,000 to create a Christian docudrama \"Lost Letters of Faith\", a story about King Abgar of Edessa. The foundation filmed the production at Regent University. Terry Lindvall, a film and religious studies scholar and a former president of Regent University, assembled filmmakers for the drama. Another of their film projects, called \"Cradle of Genius\", focused on divine inspiration and the composers Brahms, Puccini, and Richard Strauss. It was based on Arthur Abell's \"Talks with Great Composers\".\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Greg Wyatt installed a series of busts at the Boscobel House and Gardens in Garrison, New York. Adjacent to the house, the property contains a permanent sculpture garden with ten bronze busts of significant Hudson River School artists. The sculptures are by Wyatt and were donated by the Newington-Cropsey Foundation. Boscobel was chosen to house the works because of its location in the Hudson Highlands, which was a popular subject of the school's painters, and because the area roughly lies in the geographic center of Hudson River School artist homes and the landscapes that they painted. The busts include a biography of each artist, on the back of each sculpture, and the works also combine elements of the Hudson River School artists' paintings into them. The garden opened with three works in late 2015, and an additional seven were added by November 2017 when the site was dedicated.\n\nEver Rest and the Gallery of Art are part of the Hudson River School Art Trail, a project of the Thomas Cole National Historic Site.\n\nEver Rest, the cottage and last home of Jasper Cropsey, is a site managed by the foundation. The site is at 49 Washington Avenue in Hastings. The home is open for free tours by appointment as a historic house museum. The bright yellow board-and-batten Carpenter Gothic cottage is on the National Register of Historic Places, and was Cropsey's home from 1885 until his death in 1900. The home houses about 40 to 50 of Cropsey's works, including many watercolors.\n\nThe Gallery of Art building is located in a ravine beneath Ever Rest, overlooking the nearby Hudson River and the Palisades and behind a commuter parking lot of the Hastings-on-Hudson Metro-North station. There lies a small campus of buildings, including an archive of Cropsey's papers. The site's administration building houses the office of \"American Arts Quarterly\", a publication for Hudson River Realistic painting, with a circulation of about 3,000. The upper floor has a library with about 4,000 books on 19th century painting, along with a computer library and databanks.\n\nThe museum is dedicated to the paintings and sculptures of Cropsey and other artists of the 19th century. It holds roughly 75 paintings of Cropsey's, many with scenes from England and Rome, where Cropsey visited, and allegorical works from the 1850s. It is open for free tours by appointment.\n\nThe yellow Gothic Revival or Palladian style museum building was built in 1994 and designed by Atlanta architects Rodney Mims Cook Jr. and Peter J. Polites of PolitesCook Architects. Along with the surrounding landscape, it was constructed at a cost of about $4 million. The building was designed to resemble a relic from a paste era, recapturing beauty and stability of the 19th century. The building uses many principles of classical architecture, including sunlight directed onto the rotunda's floor.\n\n\"New York Times\" art critic Roberta Smith found the building to be \"garishly inappropriate and amateurish\", with \"badly scaled architecture\". She noted that the building's main gallery has Cropsey paintings hung well above eye level, poorly lit, and with unlabeled and overcleaned paintings. She found Cropsey's works better-suited and more easy to see at Ever Rest.\n\nThe building's exterior has wrought iron doors and a canopy, along with arches and turrets. The parkland surrounding and in front of the gallery includes a duck pond with duck houses.\n\nThe rotunda was modeled after the Pantheon; its terrazzo floor was modeled after the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome. The rotunda also has friezes of scenes of Hudson River history. Surrounding the rotunda walls is an inscribed quotation from Cropsey:\nThe main gallery is an octagonal Victorian room with maroon-flocked wallpaper above dark oak wainscoting and a timber ceiling, with a large oak staircase to the second floor. The room features Cropsey paintings from its floor to ceiling; the light is kept low, allowing the paintings to glow. It was designed after Hudson River houses including Ever Rest and Lyndhurst. David Linley designed furniture in the building. The building also has commissioned sculptures and religious statues, including a replica of an inscribed lintel, with a message from King Abgar of Edessa to Jesus Christ. The building holds a research library of Hudson River School art and painters, which the organization aims to make the most complete resource for artists of the school within Westchester County. The space also has a gallery for temporary exhibitions by contemporary representational artists.\n\n\n"}

It campaigns for the listing, preservation, protection and restoration of public monuments and sculpture, covering a period from the Stuart monarchy to the present day. As well as campaigning for historic monuments and public sculpture, the PMSA has been active in promoting the commissioning of new public monuments and sculpture.\n\nThe PMSA's founding members were Jo Darke, with the writer, lecturer and broadcaster Paul Atterbury, Ian Leith of the National Monuments Record, and Catherine Moriarty, then Co-ordinator of the National Inventory of War Memorials, which was founded in 1989 to create a database of war memorials throughout the UK.\n\nFrom the beginning, the PMSA was actively encouraged by the writer and sculpture scholar Benedict Read, and by Andrew and Janet Naylor, metal sculpture conservators. Subscriptions were opened in May 1991 and membership has now stabilised at around 250. Since 1991, the PMSA has initiated the National Recording Project and collaborated with the publishers Liverpool University Press on the acclaimed series \"Public Sculpture of Britain\", and has established the much respected bi-annual Sculpture Journal. It has set up events, conferences and publications in collaboration with English Heritage, the UK Institute of Conservators, University College Dublin and many other similar institutions. The PMSA operates an advisory service and distributes newsletters and newssheets to its members.\n\nThe latest projects include collaboration with other organisations and individuals to oversee production of the Custodians Handbook, published in 2005 and occasionally updated. It was designed to give guidance to families and individuals who inherit sculptors' works, studios, archives and memorabilia; and the campaign Save our Sculpture (SoS) was set to encourage concerned members of the public to keep watch over their neighbourhood sculptures, and to report damage or negligence to the PMSA. Another project is creating a digital database of public sculptures and monuments.\n\nThe Association is a charitable company which is run by a board comprising its Director and the Trustees, known as the General Committee. Ad hoc sub-committees are established to organise events, projects or campaigns.\n\nThe President of the PMSA is the Duke of Gloucester and the chairman is John Lewis, OBE. It is based at 70 Cowcross Street, London.\n\n"}
{"id": "43208774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43208774", "title": "RAFM Company", "text": "RAFM Company\n\nRAFM Company, Inc. of Brantford, Ontario is a producer of miniatures, reference materials, and board games. RAFM has produced games, reference materials, and their own lines of miniature figures in 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, and 28 mm scales since 1977. Their games concern soldiers, adventurers, and monsters inspired by history and fiction, and their products are sold at gaming conventions, in hobby shops, and by mail order for use in role playing games, wargaming, dioramas, competitive painting, and collecting. The company is best known for its \"Baker Company\" (WW2 Rules & Miniatures 20mm), \"Charlie Company\" (Vietnam Rules & Miniatures 20mm), \"Death in the Dark\" (28mm Fantasy Board Game), RAFM historical miniatures, \"Call of Cthulhu\" miniatures, fantasy miniatures (featuring the new \"Iron Lords\" line of 28mm figures), \"\" figures, historical source materials, and pewter dice.\n\nRAFM was founded in 1977 by a group of wargaming enthusiasts in Paris, Ontario to publish a set of miniature battles rules called \"The Universal Soldier: Wargame Rules for Ancient, Medieval and Pike and Shot\" (1977) by Patrick Jenkins, John Laing, Colin McClelland, and Paul Sharpe. Initially, RAFM focused on publications for the historical gaming, particularly the wars of the 18th and 19th centuries. Like their contemporaries at Ral Partha Enterprises and Grenadier Models Inc., the company found that their efforts were best directed at the rapidly expanding market in fantasy games. Bob Murch began sculpting for RAFM in the early 1980s and remained their primary sculptor until he began Pulp Figures in 2002. The company started as a partnership among the principal owners until John Laing moved to England in 1987 and left the partnership. Jack Van Schaik has been the president and part-owner of the company since the beginning. In 1999 RAFM Company Inc. became a subsidiary of Van Schaik's Silver Fox Productions and the RAFM headquarters was moved to Brantford, Ontario. In addition to their own lines, RAFM was the long-time caster and Canadian distributor for Ral Partha Enterprises, Citadel Miniatures, and currently distribute figures of Reaper Miniatures of Denton, Texas.\n\nRAFM's miniatures are typically unmarked and in order to be identified must be matched to pictures and descriptions in product catalogs. Catalogs were produced in 1986 Canada, 1986 U.S., 1987 Canada, 1989-90 U.S., 1994 1996 Update #1, 2005, 2006, and 2009.\n\nRAFM was also the Canadian caster and distributor of Ral Partha Enterprises and Citadel Miniatures carrying most of their lines. RAFM tended to preserve older manufacturer's codes. For example, when Ral Partha switched to all numeric product codes in early 1980, RAFM continued production with the originals. In the 1990s RAFM distributed Frei Korps 15's \"Yellow Ribbon\" line of 15mm figures for the American Wild West (YR01-YR18), another series for the American Civil War (7000-7011). A one time sculptor for RAFM, Bob Ridolfi's sculpts and others are licensed by Reaper Miniatures for distribution in Canada. Rafm also produced miniatures for GHQ and Martian Metals in the 1980s. Contracts were also signed with Dream Pod 9's Heavy Gear, Global Games and Palladium's Rifts.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, RAFM's miniatures were designed by the prolific Bob Murch and produced in 25mm scale. Other sculptors included Murch's apprentice Stephen Koo, Carol Moyer, James Johnson, and Bill Schwarz who specializes in the engines and vehicles of war throughout history. In recent years the boss' sons James and Brock Van Schaik have become accomplished sculptors.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13203284", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13203284", "title": "Socialist heraldry", "text": "Socialist heraldry\n\nSocialist heraldry, also called communist heraldry, consists of emblems in a style typically adopted by communist states and filled with communist symbolism. Although commonly called \"coats of arms\", most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense and should therefore, in a strict sense, not be called arms at all. Many communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of European heraldry in order to distance themselves from the monarchies that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs.\n\nThe Soviet Union was the first state to use socialist heraldry, beginning at its creation in 1922. The style became more widespread after World War II, when many other communist states were established. Even a few non-socialist (or communist) states have adopted the style, for various reasons—usually because communists had helped them to gain independence—but also when no apparent connection to a Communist nation exists, such as the emblem of Italy. After the fall of the Soviet Union and the other communist states in Eastern Europe in 1989–1991, this style of heraldry was often abandoned for the old heraldic practices, with many (but not all) of the new governments reinstating the traditional heraldry that was previously cast aside.\n\nThe Soviet Union, created after the 1917 revolution, required insignia to represent itself in line with other sovereign states, such as emblems, flags and seals, but the Soviet leaders did not wish to continue the old heraldic practices which they saw as associated with the societal system the revolution sought to replace. In response to the needs and wishes, the national emblem adopted would lack the traditional heraldic elements of a shield, helm, crest and mantling, and instead be presented more plainly. This style was followed then by other socialist and communist states, which wished to also focus attention on the nation's workers and diverge from feudalism and all of its associations.\n\nIn some communist countries, the socialist heraldry was never adopted fully. The coat of arms of Poland was only changed slightly under the communist era, retaining the traditional heraldic form. In Hungary, the \"Rákosi badge\", an emblem in the form of socialist heraldry, was adopted following the Second World War, but after the 1956 uprising, a new emblem was created combining communist symbolism with a heraldic shield in the colours of the Hungarian flag. Czechoslovakia became a Communist country in 1948 but retained its original coat of arms until 1961, when they were replaced with a non-traditional shield depicting the heraldic Bohemian lion without a crown and with a red star above head. Some of the states of Yugoslavia also used heraldic shields coupled with socialist imagery in their emblems, as did two republics within the USSR: the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nSocialist heraldry typically makes use of the following symbols:\n\nWith the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc in Europe, most of these countries' socialist heraldry has been replaced with old pre-communist symbols or by wholly new coats of arms.\n\nSocialist heraldry is still seen in the emblems of several countries, such as the People's Republic of China. North Korea has a national emblem in pure socialist style, as does Vietnam.\n\nDuring the infancy years of the Russian Federation (the successor to the Soviet Union), the country used the modified version of the emblem of the RSFSR with the inscription was changed from \"RSFSR (РСФСР)\" to the \"Russian Federation (Российская Федерация/Rossiyskaya Federaciya)\" until the new coat of arms was adopted in 1993. The national emblem of Belarus was adopted in 1995 following a controversial referendum. It is reminiscent of that of the Byelorussian SSR and replaced the coat of arms of 1991-1995 which followed the traditional heraldic style. Tajikistan and Uzbekistan retained components of their respective republics for similar reasons.\n\nThe national emblem of Macedonia is reminiscent of that of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia (once a constituent socialist republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).\n\nIn Africa, the emblems of Angola and Mozambique, as well as Algeria, use socialist heraldry.\n\nThe Republic of Serbia used the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia until the recommended symbols by the National Assembly on August 17, 2004. The recommended usage was made Law on May 11, 2009 thus officially replacing the socialist heraldic Coat of arms.\n\nBelow are galleries of historical and current national emblems. The years given are for the emblems, not for the countries.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive gallery, since they are here to illustrate the article, not to show every example. Only long-lasting emblems of independent countries are shown. They also exclude emblems which were a mix of traditional heraldry and socialist symbolism, like the present arms of São Tomé e Príncipe and of East Timor, the 1960-1990 Emblem of Czechoslovakia, or the 1974-2008 state seal of Burma, or traditional heraldic coats of arms of socialist countries, like those of Guyana, Portugal and Cuba.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5378763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5378763", "title": "The Hiding Place (biography)", "text": "The Hiding Place (biography)\n\nThe Hiding Place is a 1971 book on the life of Corrie ten Boom, written by ten Boom together with John and Elizabeth Sherrill.\n\nThe idea of a book on ten Boom's life began as John and Elizabeth Sherrill were doing research for the book \"God's Smuggler\", about ten Boom's fellow Dutchman, Andrew van der Bijl. Corrie ten Boom was already in her mid-seventies when the Sherrills first heard about her. She was one of Brother Andrew's favorite traveling companions and many of his recollections were about her. In the preface to the book, the Sherrills recount:\n\nIt was later made into a film of the same name, along with a comic book adaptation.\n\nThe title refers to both the physical hiding place where the ten Boom family hid Jews from the Nazis, and also to the Scriptural message found in Psalm 119:114 which states, \"Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word... \"\n\nThe book begins with the ten Boom family celebrating the 100th anniversary of the family watch and watch repair business, now run by the family's elderly father, Casper ten Boom. The business took up the ground floor of the family home (known as the Béjé). Casper lived with his unmarried daughters Corrie (the narrator and a watchmaker herself) and Betsie, who took care of the house. It seemed as if everyone in the Dutch town of Haarlem had shown up to the party, including Corrie's sister Nollie, her brother Willem, and her nephews Peter and Kik. Willem, a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church, brought a Jewish man, who had just escaped from Germany, as a guest. The man's beard had been burned off by some thugs, a grim reminder of what was happening just to the east of the Netherlands.\n\nIn the next few chapters, Corrie talks about her childhood, her infirm but glad-hearted mother, and the three aunts who once lived in the Béjé. She talks about the only man she ever loved, a young man named Karel, who ultimately married a woman from a rich family.\n\nEventually, both Nollie and Willem married. After the deaths of Corrie's mother and aunts, Corrie, Betsie, and their father settled down into a pleasant, domestic life. Then, in 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands.\n\nThe family had strong morals based on Christian beliefs, and they felt obligated to help their Jewish friends in every way possible. The Béjé soon became the center for a major anti-Nazi operation. Corrie, who had grown to think of herself as a middle-aged spinster, found herself involved in black market operations, using stolen ration cards, and eventually hiding Jews in her own home.\n\nCorrie suffered a moral crisis over the lying, theft, forgery, and bribery that was necessary to keep the Jews her family was hiding alive. Moreover, it was unlikely that her family would get away with helping Jews for long, as they had nowhere to hide them. The Dutch underground arranged for a secret room to be built in the Béjé, so the Jews would have a place to hide in the event of an inevitable raid.\n\nIt was a constant struggle for Corrie to keep the Jews safe; she sacrificed her own safety and part of her own personal room to give constant safety to the Jews. Rolf, a police officer friend, trained her to be able to think clearly anytime in case the Nazis invaded her home and started to question her.\n\nWhen a man asked Corrie to help his wife, who had been arrested, Corrie agreed, but with misgivings. As it turned out, the man was a spy, and the watch shop was raided. The entire ten Boom family was arrested, along with the shop employees, though the Jews managed to hide themselves in the secret room.\n\nCasper was in his mid-eighties by this time, and a Nazi official offered to let him go, provided he made no more trouble. Casper did not agree to this, and was shipped to prison. It was later learned he had died ten days later.\n\nMeanwhile, Corrie was sent to Scheveningen, a Dutch prison which was used by the Nazis for political prisoners, nicknamed 'Oranjehotel'--a hotel for people loyal to the House of Orange. She later learned that her sister was being held in another cell, and that, aside from her father, all other family members and friends had been released. A coded letter from Nollie revealed that the hidden Jews were safe. While at Scheveningen, Corrie befriended a depressed Nazi officer, who arranged a brief meeting with her family, under the pretense of reading Casper's will. Corrie was horrified to see how ill Willem was, as he had contracted jaundice in prison. He would eventually die from his illness in 1946. Corrie also learned that her nephew, Kik, had been captured while working with the Dutch underground. He had been killed, though the family did not learn of this until 1953.\n\nAfter four months at Scheveningen, Corrie and Betsie were transferred to Vught, a concentration camp for political prisoners in Netherlands. Corrie was assigned to a factory that made radios for aircraft. The work was not hard, and the prisoner-foreman, Mr. Moorman, was kind. Betsie, whose health was starting to fail, was sent to work sewing prison uniforms.\n\nWhen a counter-offensive against the Nazis seemed imminent, the prisoners were shipped by train to Germany, where they were imprisoned at Ravensbrück, a notorious women's concentration camp. The conditions there were hellish; both Corrie and Betsie were forced to perform back-breaking manual labor. It was there that Betsie's health failed. Throughout the ordeal, Corrie was amazed at her sister's faith. In every camp, the sisters used a hidden Bible to teach their fellow prisoners about Jesus. In Ravensbrück, where there was only hatred and misery, Corrie found it hard to look to Heaven. Betsie, however, showed a universal love for everyone—not only for the prisoners, but also for the Nazis. Instead of feeling anger, she pitied the Germans, sorrowful that they were so blinded by hatred. She yearned to show them the love of Christ, but died before the war was over. Corrie was later released because of a clerical error, but she was forced to stay in a hospital barracks while recovering from edema. Corrie arrived back in the Netherlands by January 1945.\n"}
{"id": "3506780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3506780", "title": "The Lorax", "text": "The Lorax\n\nThe Lorax is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and first published in 1971. It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book.\n\nThe book is commonly recognized as a fable concerning the danger corporate greed poses to nature, using the literary element of personification to give life to industry as the Once-ler and the environment as the Lorax.\n\n\"The Lorax\" was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing economic and environmental issues without it being dull. \"\"The Lorax\",\" he once explained, \"came out of me being angry. In \"The Lorax\" I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might.\"\n\nA boy living in a polluted area visits a strange isolated man called the Once-ler on the Street of the Lifted Lorax. The boy pays the Once-ler fifteen cents, a nail, and the shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail to hear the legend of how the Lorax was lifted and taken away.\n\nThe Once-ler tells the boy of his arrival in a beautiful valley containing a forest of Truffula trees and a range of animals. The Once-ler, having long searched for such a tree as the Truffula, chops one down and uses its silk-like foliage to knit a Thneed, an impossibly versatile garment. The Lorax, who \"speaks for the trees\" as they have no tongues, emerges from the stump of the Truffula and voices his disapproval both of the sacrifice of the tree and of the Thneed itself. However, the first other person to happen by purchases the Thneed for $3.98, so the Once-ler is encouraged and starts a business making and selling Thneeds.\n\nThe Once-ler's small shop soon grows into a factory. The Once-ler's relatives all come to work for him and new vehicles and equipment are brought in to log the Truffula forest and ship out Thneeds. The Lorax appears again to report that the small bear-like Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula fruits, are short of food and must be sent away to find more. The Lorax later returns to complain that the factory has polluted the air and the water, forcing the Swanee-Swans and Humming-Fish to migrate as well. The Once-ler is unrepentant and defiantly tells the Lorax that he will keep on \"biggering\" his business, but at that moment one of his machines fells the very last Truffula tree.\n\nWithout raw materials, the factory shuts down and the Once-ler's relatives leave. The Lorax says nothing but with one sad backward glance lifts himself into the air \"by the seat of his pants\" and disappears behind the smoggy clouds. Where he last stood is a small monument engraved with a single word: \"UNLESS\". The Once-ler ponders the message for years, in solitude and self-imposed exile.\n\nIn the present, his buildings falling apart around him, the Once-ler at last realizes out loud what the Lorax meant: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\" He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that, if the trees can be protected from logging, then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.\n\nBased on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named \"The Lorax\" one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number 33 among the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\" – the second of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.\n\nIn a retrospective critique written in the journal \"Nature\" in 2011 upon the 40th anniversary of the book's publication, Emma Marris described the Lorax character as a \"parody of a misanthropic ecologist\". She called the book \"gloomy\" and expressed skepticism that its message would resonate with small children in the manner intended. Nevertheless, she praised the book as effective in conveying the consequences of ecological destruction in a way that young children will understand.\n\nIn 1988, a small school district in California kept the book on a reading list for second graders, though some in the town claimed the book was unfair to the logging industry. \n\nTerri Birkett, a member of a family-owned hardwood flooring factory, authored \"The Truax\", offering a logging-friendly perspective to an anthropomorphic tree known as the \"Guardbark\". This book was published by the National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA). Just as in \"The Lorax\", the book consists of a disagreement between two people. The logging industry representative states that they have efficiency and re-seeding efforts. The Guardbark, a personification of the environmentalist movement much as the Once-ler is for big business, refuses to listen and lashes out. But in the end, he is convinced by the logger's arguments. However, this story was criticized for what were viewed as skewed arguments and clear self-interest, particularly a \"casual attitude toward endangered species\" that answered the Guardbark's concern for them. In addition, the book's approach as a more blatant argument, rather than one worked into a storyline, was also noted.\n\nThe line \"I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie\" was removed more than fourteen years after the story was published, after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss about the clean-up of Lake Erie. The line remains in the home video releases of the television special and in the audiobook read by Rik Mayall.\n\nThe book was adapted as an animated musical television special produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, directed by Hawley Pratt and starring the voices of Eddie Albert and Bob Holt. It was first aired by CBS on February 14, 1972. A reference to pollution of Lake Erie was spoken by one of the Humming-Fish as they depart; it remains in DVD releases of the show, although later removed from the book. The special also shows the Once-ler arguing with himself, and asking the Lorax whether shutting down his factory (thus putting hundreds of people out of work) is practical. An abridged version of the special is used in the 1994 TV movie \"In Search of Dr. Seuss\", with Kathy Najimy's reporter character hearing the Once-ler's story.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, Universal Studios and Illumination Entertainment released a 3-D CGI film based upon the book. The release coincided with the 108th birthday of Seuss, who died at 87 in 1991. The cast includes Danny DeVito as the Lorax, Zac Efron as Ted (the boy in the book), and Ed Helms as the Once-ler. The film includes several new characters: Rob Riggle as villain Aloysius O'Hare, Betty White as Ted's Grammy Norma, Jenny Slate as Ted's neurotic mother Mrs. Wiggins, and Taylor Swift as Audrey, Ted's romantic interest. The film debuted in the No. 1 spot at the box office, making $70 million, though it received mixed reviews. The film eventually grossed a domestic total of $214,030,500.\n\nTwo audio readings have been released on CD, one narrated by Ted Danson in the United States (Listening Library, ) and one narrated by Rik Mayall in the United Kingdom (HarperCollins, ).\n\nA musical adaptation of \"The Lorax\" was originally included in script for the Broadway musical \"Seussical\", but was cut before the show opened.\n\nFrom December 2, 2015, to January 16, 2016, a musical version of the book ran at the Old Vic theatre in London. With former Noah and the Whale frontman, Charlie Fink, who wrote the music for the production.\n\n"}
{"id": "18935023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935023", "title": "Trademark", "text": "Trademark\n\nA trademark, trade mark, or trade-mark is a recognizable sign, design, or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others, although trademarks used to identify services are usually called service marks. The trademark owner can be an individual, business organization, or any legal entity. A trademark may be located on a package, a label, a voucher, or on the product itself. For the sake of corporate identity, trademarks are often displayed on company buildings.\n\nThe first legislative act concerning trademarks was passed in 1266 under the reign of Henry III, requiring all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold. The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857. The Trade Marks Act 1938 of the United Kingdom changed the system, permitting registration based on \"intent-to-use”, creating an examination based process, and creating an application publication system. The 1938 Act, which served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere, contained other novel concepts such as \"associated trademarks\", a consent to use system, a defensive mark system, and non claiming right system.\n\nA trademark identifies the brand owner of a particular product or service. Trademarks can be used by others under licensing agreements; for example, Bullyland obtained a license to produce Smurf figurines; the Lego Group purchased a license from Lucasfilm in order to be allowed to launch Lego Star Wars; TT Toys Toys is a manufacturer of licensed ride-on replica cars for children. The unauthorized usage of trademarks by producing and trading counterfeit consumer goods is known as brand piracy.\n\nThe owner of a trademark may pursue legal action against trademark infringement. Most countries require formal registration of a trademark as a precondition for pursuing this type of action. The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action can be taken to protect an unregistered trademark if it is in use. Still, common law trademarks offer the holder, in general, less legal protection than registered trademarks.\n\nA trademark may be designated by the following symbols:\nA trademark is typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements. There is also a range of non-conventional trademarks comprising marks which do not fall into these standard categories, such as those based on colour, smell, or sound (like jingles). Trademarks which are considered offensive are often rejected according to a nation's trademark law.\n\nThe term \"trademark\" is also used informally to refer to any distinguishing attribute by which an individual is readily identified, such as the well-known characteristics of celebrities. When a trademark is used in relation to services rather than products, it may sometimes be called a service mark, particularly in the United States.\n\nThe essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, so a trademark, properly called, \"indicates source\" or serves as a \"badge of origin\". In other words, trademarks serve to identify a particular business as the source of goods or services. The use of a trademark in this way is known as \"trademark use\". Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark.\n\nTrademark rights generally arise out of the use of, or to maintain exclusive rights over, that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections.\n\nDifferent goods and services have been classified by the International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services into 45 Trademark Classes (1 to 34 cover goods, and 35 to 45 cover services). The idea behind this system is to specify and limit the extension of the intellectual property right by determining which goods or services are covered by the mark, and to unify classification systems around the world.\n\nIn trademark treatises it is usually reported that blacksmiths who made swords in the Roman Empire are thought of as being the first users of trademarks. Other notable trademarks that have been used for a long time include Löwenbräu, which claims use of its lion mark since 1383. The first trademark legislation was passed by the Parliament of England under the reign of King Henry III in 1266, which required all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold.\n\nThe first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857 with the \"Manufacture and Goods Mark Act\". In Britain, the Merchandise Marks Act 1862 made it a criminal offence to imitate another's trade mark 'with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud'. In 1875, the Trade Marks Registration Act was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise \"prima facie\" evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as 'a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket'.\n\nIn the United States, Congress first attempted to establish a federal trademark regime in 1870. This statute purported to be an exercise of Congress' Copyright Clause powers. However, the Supreme Court struck down the 1870 statute in the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" later on in the decade. In 1881, Congress passed a new trademark act, this time pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers. Congress revised the Trademark Act in 1905. The Lanham Act of 1946 updated the law and has served, with several amendments, as the primary federal law on trademarks.\n\nThe Trade Marks Act 1938 in the United Kingdom set up the first registration system based on the “intent-to-use” principle. The Act also established an application publishing procedure and expanded the rights of the trademark holder to include the barring of trademark use even in cases where confusion remained unlikely. This Act served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere.\n\nThe oldest registered trademark has various different claimants, enumerated below:\n\nThe two symbols associated with trademarks, ™ (the trademark symbol) and ® (the registered trademark symbol), represent the status of a mark and accordingly its level of protection. While ™ can be used with any common law usage of a mark, ® may only be used by the owner of a mark following registration with the relevant national authority, such as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO or PTO). The proper manner to display either symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style.\n\nTerms such as \"mark\", \"brand\" and \"logo\" are sometimes used interchangeably with \"trademark\". \"Trademark\", however, also includes any device, brand, label, name, signature, word, letter, numerical, shape of goods, packaging, colour or combination of colours, smell, sound, movement or any combination thereof which is capable of distinguishing goods and services of one business from those of others. It must be capable of graphical representation and must be applied to goods or services for which it is registered.\n\nSpecialized types of trademark include certification marks, collective trademarks and defensive trademarks. A trademark which is popularly used to describe a product or service (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a genericized trademark. If such a mark becomes synonymous with that product or service to the extent that the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.\n\nA \"trademark look\" is an informal term for a characteristic look for a performer or character of some sort. It is usually not legally trademark protected and the term is not used in the trademark law.\n\nThe law considers a trademark to be a form of property. rights in relation to a trademark may be established through actual use in the marketplace, or through registration of the mark with the trademarks office (or \"trademarks registry\") of a particular jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, trademark rights can be established through either or both means. Certain jurisdictions generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising through use. If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions, the extent to which they will be able to enforce their rights through trademark infringement proceedings will therefore be limited. In cases of dispute, this disparity of rights is often referred to as \"first to file\" as opposed to \"first to use.\" Other countries such as Germany offer a limited amount of common law rights for unregistered marks where to gain protection, the goods or services must occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace — where this could be 40% or more market share for sales in the particular class of goods or services.\n\nIn the United States, the registration process includes several steps. First, the trademark owner files an application to register the trademark. About three months after it is filed, the application is reviewed by an examining attorney at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The examining attorney checks for compliance with the rules of the Trademark Manual of Examination Procedure. This review includes procedural matters such as making sure the applicant's goods or services are identified properly. It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant's mark is not merely descriptive or likely to cause confusion with a pre-existing applied-for or registered mark. If the application runs afoul of any requirement, the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals prior to registration of the mark. If the examining attorney approves the application, it will be \"published for opposition.\" During this 30-day period third parties who may be affected by the registration of the trademark may step forward to file an Opposition Proceeding to stop the registration of the mark. If an Opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the mark at issue. Finally, provided that no third-party opposes the registration of the mark during the opposition period or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant's favor the mark will be registered in due course.\n\nOutside of the United States the registration process is substantially similar to that found in the U.S. save for one notable exception in many countries: registration occurs prior to the opposition proceeding. In short, once an application is reviewed by an examiner and found to be entitled to registration a registration certificate is issued subject to the mark being open to opposition for a period of typically 6 months from the date of registration.\n\nA registered trademark confers a bundle of exclusive rights upon the registered owner, including the right to exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered. The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a registered trademark to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical or \"colourfully\" similar to the \"registered\" products or services, and in certain cases, prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar products or services. The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin. An example may be a very large multinational brand such as \"Sony\" where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a class of goods that Sony has rights in.\n\nOnce trademark rights are established in a particular jurisdiction, these rights are generally only enforceable in that jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as territoriality. However, there is a range of international trademark laws and systems which facilitate the protection of trademarks in more than one jurisdiction.\n\nIn the United States the USPTO maintains a database of registered trademarks. The database is open to the public. A licensed attorney may be required to interpret the search results. As trademarks are governed by federal law, state law, and common law, a thorough search as to the availability of a mark is very important. In the United States obtaining a trademark search and relying upon the results of an opinion issued by an attorney may insulate a trademark user from being required to pay treble damages and attorney's fees in a trademark infringement case as it demonstrates that the trademark user performed due diligence and was using the mark in good faith. The USPTO internally captures more information about trademarks than what they publicly disclose on their official search website, such as the complete contents of every logo trademark filing.\n\nTrademarks may also be searched on third-party databases such as LexisNexis, Dialog, and CompuMark.\n\nWithin the European Union, searches have to be conducted taking into account both EU Trademarks as well as national trademarks.\n\nClassification systems exist to help in searching for marks. One example is the \"International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks\", better known as the Vienna Classification.\n\nIn most systems, a trademark can be registered if it is able to distinguish the goods or services of a party, will not confuse consumers about the relationship between one party and another, and will not otherwise deceive consumers with respect to the qualities.\n\nA trademark may be eligible for registration, or registerable, if it performs the essential trademark function, and has distinctive character. Registerability can be understood as a continuum, with \"inherently distinctive\" marks at one end, \"generic\" and \"descriptive\" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and \"suggestive\" and \"arbitrary\" marks lying between these two points. \"Descriptive\" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning – consumers have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator – to be protectable. \"Generic\" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks. (See the KitKat v Cadbury case.)\n\nTrademarks rights must be maintained through actual lawful use of the trademark. These rights will cease if a mark is not actively used for a period of time, normally 5 years in most jurisdictions. In the case of a trademark registration, failure to actively use the mark in the lawful course of trade, or to enforce the registration in the event of infringement, may also expose the registration itself to become liable for an application for the removal from the register after a certain period of time on the grounds of \"non-use\".\n\nIt is not necessary for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement if it can be shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. It will be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.\n\nAll jurisdictions with a mature trademark registration system provide a mechanism for removal in the event of such \"non use\", which is usually a period of either three or five years. The intention to use a trademark can be proven by a wide range of acts as shown in the \"Wooly Bull\" and \"Aston v Harlee\" cases.\n\nIn the U.S., failure to use a trademark for this period of time will result in \"abandonment\" of the mark, whereby any party may use the mark. An abandoned mark is not irrevocably in the public domain, but may instead be re-registered by any party which has re-established exclusive and active use, and must be associated or linked with the original mark owner. A mark is registered in conjunction with a description of a specific type of goods, and if the party uses the mark but in conjunction with a different type of goods, the mark may still be considered abandoned, as was the case in Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.. If a court rules that a trademark has become \"generic\" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.\n\nUnlike other forms of intellectual property (e.g., patents and copyrights) a registered trademark can, theoretically, last forever. So long as a trademark's use is continuous a trademark holder may keep the mark registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by filing Section 8 Affidavit(s) of Continuous Use as well as Section 9 Applications for renewal, as required.\n\nSpecifically, once registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the owner of a trademark is required to file a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use to maintain the registration between the 5th and 6th year anniversaries of the registration of the mark or during the 6-month grace period following the 6th anniversary of the registration. During this period, a trademark owner may concurrently opt to file a Section 15, Declaration of Incontestability. A mark declared incontestable is immune from future challenge, except in instances where the mark becomes generic, the mark is abandoned, or if the registration was acquired fraudulently. Note, if the Section 8 Affidavit is filed during the 6-month grace period additional fees to file the Affidavit with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will apply.\n\nIn addition to requirement above, U.S. trademark registrations are also required to be renewed on or about every 10-year anniversary of the registration of the trademark. The procedure for 10-year renewals is somewhat different from that for the 5th-6th year renewal. In brief, registrants are required to file both a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use as well as a Section 9 Application for Renewal every ten years to maintain their registration.\n\nThe extent to which a trademark owner may prevent unauthorized use of trademarks which are the same as or similar to its trademark depends on various factors such as whether its trademark is registered, the similarity of the trademarks involved, the similarity of the products or services involved, and whether the owner's trademark is \"well known\" or, under U.S. law relating to trademark dilution, \"famous\".\n\nIf a trademark has not been registered, some jurisdictions (especially Common Law countries) offer protection for the business reputation or goodwill which attaches to unregistered trademarks through the tort of passing off. Passing off may provide a remedy in a scenario where a business has been trading under an unregistered trademark for many years, and a rival business starts using the same or a similar mark.\n\nIf a trademark has been registered, then it is much easier for the trademark owner to demonstrate its trademark rights and to enforce these rights through an infringement action. Unauthorized use of a registered trademark need not be intentional in order for infringement to occur, although damages in an infringement lawsuit will generally be greater if there was an intention to deceive.\n\nFor trademarks which are considered to be well known, infringing use may occur where the use occurs in relation to products or services which are not the same as or similar to the products or services in relation to which the owner's mark is registered.\nA growing area of law relating to the enforcement of trademark rights is secondary liability, which allows for the imputation of liability to one who has not acted directly to infringe a trademark but whose legal responsibility may arise under the doctrines of either contributory or vicarious liability.\n\nTrademark is subject to various defenses, such as abandonment, limitations on geographic scope, and fair use. In the United States, the fair use defence protects many of the interests in free expression related to those protected by the First Amendment.\nFair use may be asserted on two grounds, either that the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products, or that the alleged infringer is using the mark to identify the mark owner. One of the most visible proofs that trademarks provide a limited right in the U.S. comes from the comparative advertising that is seen throughout U.S. media.\n\nAn example of the first type is that although Maytag owns the trademark \"Whisper Quiet\" for its dishwashers, makers of other products may describe their goods as being \"whisper quiet\" so long as these products do not fall under the same category of goods the trademark is protected under.\n\nAn example of the second type is that Audi can run advertisements saying that a trade publication has rated an Audi model higher than a BMW model, since they are only using \"BMW\" to identify the competitor. In a related sense, an auto mechanic can truthfully advertise that he services Volkswagens, and a former \"Playboy\" Playmate of the Year can identify herself as such on her website.\n\nVarious jurisdictions have laws which are designed to prevent trademark owners from making wrongful threats of trademark infringement action against other parties. These laws are intended to prevent large or powerful companies from intimidating or harassing smaller companies.\n\nWhere one party makes a threat to sue another for trademark infringement, but does not have a genuine basis or intention to carry out that threat, or does not carry out the threat at all within a certain period, the threat may itself become a basis for legal action. In this situation, the party receiving such a threat may seek from the Court a declaratory judgment; also known as a declaratory ruling.\n\nTrademark law is designed to fulfill the public policy objective of consumer protection, by preventing the public from being misled as to the origin or quality of a product or service. By identifying the commercial source of products and services, trademarks facilitate identification of products and services which meet the expectations of consumers as to quality and other characteristics.\n\nTrademarks may also serve as an incentive for manufacturers, providers or suppliers to consistently provide quality products or services to maintain their business reputation. Furthermore, if a trademark owner does not maintain quality control and adequate supervision in relation to the manufacture and provision of products or services supplied by a licensee, such \"naked licensing\" will eventually adversely affect the owner's rights in the trademark. For US law \"see, ex.\" \"Eva's Bridal Ltd. v. Halanick Enterprises, Inc.\" 639 F.3d 788 (7th Cir. 2011). This proposition has, however, been watered down by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of \"Scandecor Development AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB et al.\" [2001] UKHL 21; wherein it has been held that the mere fact that a bare license (equivalent of the United States concept of a naked license) has been granted did not automatically mean that a trademark was liable to mislead.\n\nBy the same token, trademark holders must be cautious in the sale of their mark for similar reasons as apply to licensing. When assigning an interest in a trademark, if the associated product or service is not transferred with it, then this may be an \"assignment-in-gross\" and could lead to a loss of rights in the trademark. It is still possible to make significant changes to the underlying goods or services during a sale without jeopardizing the trademark, but companies will often contract with the sellers to help transition the mark and goods or services to the new owners to ensure continuity of the trademark.\n\nWhile trademark law seeks to protect indications of the commercial source of products or services, patent law generally seeks to protect new and useful inventions, and registered designs law generally seeks to protect the look or appearance of a manufactured article. Trademarks, patents and designs collectively form a subset of intellectual property known as industrial property because they are often created and used in an industrial or commercial context.\n\nBy comparison, copyright law generally seeks to protect original literary, artistic and other creative works. Continued active use and re-registration can make a trademark perpetual, whereas copyright usually lasts for the duration of the author's lifespan plus 70 years for works by individuals, and some limited time after creation for works by bodies corporate. This can lead to confusion in cases where a work passes into the public domain but the character in question remains a registered trademark.\n\nAlthough intellectual property laws such as these are theoretically distinct, more than one type may afford protection to the same article. For example, the particular design of a bottle may qualify for copyright protection as a non-utilitarian [sculpture], or for trademark protection based on its shape, or the 'trade dress' appearance of the bottle as a whole may be protectable. Titles and character names from books or movies may also be protectable as trademarks while the works from which they are drawn may qualify for copyright protection as a whole. Trademark protection does not apply to utilitarian features of a product such as the plastic interlocking studs on Lego bricks.\n\nDrawing these distinctions is necessary, but often challenging for the courts and lawyers, especially in jurisdictions where patents and copyrights pass into the public domain, depending on the jurisdiction. Unlike patents and copyrights, which in theory are granted for one-off fixed terms, trademarks remain valid as long as the owner actively uses and defends them and maintains their registrations with the competent authorities. This often involves payment of a periodic renewal fee.\n\nAs a trademark must be used to maintain rights in relation to that mark, a trademark can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or estoppel when suit is finally brought.\n\nLike patents and copyrights, trademarks can be bought, sold, and transferred from one company or another. Unlike patents and copyrights, trademarks may not remain intact through this process. Where trademarks have been acquired for the purpose of marketing generic (non-distinctive) products, courts have refused to enforce them.\n\nIn 1923, the author Edgar Rice Burroughs registered his fictitious character Tarzan as a trademark; even after the copyright to the Tarzan story expired, his company used ownership of the trademarks relating to the character (which unlike copyrights, do not have a limited length) to control the production of media using its imagery and license the character for use in other works (such as adaptations). This practice is a precursor to the modern concept of a media franchise.\n\nA trademark is \"diluted\" when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source. In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word Pepsi spoken, or on a billboard).\nUnder trademark law, dilution occurs either when unauthorized use of a mark \"blurs\" the \"distinctive nature of the mark\" or \"tarnishes it.\" Likelihood of confusion is not required. 15 U.S.C §§ 1127, 1125(c).\n\nIn various jurisdictions a trademark may be sold with or without the underlying goodwill which subsists in the business associated with the mark. However, this is not the case in the United States, where the courts have held that this would \"be a fraud upon the public\". In the U.S., trademark registration can therefore only be sold and assigned if accompanied by the sale of an underlying asset. Examples of assets whose sale would ordinarily support the assignment of a mark include the sale of the machinery used to produce the goods that bear the mark, or the sale of the corporation (or subsidiary) that produces the trademarked goods.\n\nLicensing means the trademark owner (the licensor) grants a permit to a third party (the licensee) in order to commercially use the trademark legally. It is a contract between the two, containing the scope of content and policy. The essential provisions to a trademark license identify the trademark owner and the licensee, in addition to the policy and the goods or services agreed to be licensed.\n\nMost jurisdictions provide for the use of trademarks to be licensed to third parties. The licensor must monitor the quality of the goods being produced by the licensee to avoid the risk of trademark being deemed abandoned by the courts. A trademark license should therefore include appropriate provisions dealing with quality control, whereby the licensee provides warranties as to quality and the licensor has rights to inspection and monitoring.\n\nThe advent of the domain name system has led to attempts by trademark holders to enforce their rights over domain names that are similar or identical to their existing trademarks, particularly by seeking control over the domain names at issue. As with dilution protection, enforcing trademark rights over domain name owners involves protecting a trademark outside the obvious context of its consumer market, because domain names are global and not limited by goods or service.\n\nThis conflict is easily resolved when the domain name owner actually uses the domain to compete with the trademark owner. Cybersquatting, however, does not involve competition. Instead, an unlicensed user registers a domain name identical to a trademark, and offers to sell the domain to the trademark owner. Typosquatters—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits. \"Gripe sites\", on the other hand, tend to be protected as free speech, and are therefore more difficult to attack as trademark infringement.\n\nThis clash of the new technology with preexisting trademark rights resulted in several high-profile decisions as the courts of many countries tried to coherently address the issue (and not always successfully) within the framework of existing trademark law. As the website itself was not the product being purchased, there was no actual consumer confusion, and so initial interest confusion was a concept applied instead. Initial interest confusion refers to customer confusion that creates an initial interest in a competitor's \"product\" (in the online context, another party's website). Even though initial interest confusion is dispelled by the time any actual sales occur, it allows a trademark infringer to capitalize on the goodwill associated with the original mark.\n\nSeveral cases have wrestled with the concept of initial interest confusion. In Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp. the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In \"Playboy v. Netscape\", the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.\n\nIn Lamparello v. Falwell, however, the court clarified that a finding of initial interest confusion is contingent on financial profit from said confusion, such that, if a domain name confusingly similar to a registered trademark is used for a non-trademark related website, the site owner will not be found to have infringed where they do not seek to capitalize on the mark's goodwill for their own commercial enterprises.\n\nIn addition, courts have upheld the rights of trademark owners with regard to commercial use of domain names, even in cases where goods sold there legitimately bear the mark. In the landmark decision Creative Gifts, Inc. v. UFO, 235 F.3d 540 (10th Cir. 2000) (New Mexico), defendants had registered the domain name \"Levitron.com\" to sell goods bearing the trademark \"Levitron\" under an at-will license from the trademark owner. The 10th Circuit affirmed the rights of the trademark owner with regard to said domain name, despite arguments of promissory estoppel.\n\nMost courts particularly frowned on cybersquatting, and found that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., \"trafficking\" in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement. Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically, and to provide explicit remedies against cybersquatters.\n\nIn the US, the legal situation was clarified by the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, an amendment to the Lanham Act, which explicitly prohibited cybersquatting. It defines cybersquatting as \"(occurring) when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well-known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder\". The provision states that \"[a] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of the mark ... if, without regard to the goods or services of the person, that person (i) had a bad faith intent to profit from the mark ...; and registers, traffics in, or uses domain name [that is confusingly similar to another's mark or dilutes another's mark]\".\n\nThis international legal change has also led to the creation of ICANN Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) and other dispute policies for specific countries (such as Nominet UK's DRS) which attempt to streamline the process of resolving who should own a domain name (without dealing with other infringement issues such as damages). This is particularly desirable to trademark owners when the domain name registrant may be in another country or even anonymous.\n\nRegistrants of domain names also sometimes wish to register the domain names themselves (e.g., \"XYZ.COM\") as trademarks for perceived advantages, such as an extra bulwark against their domain being hijacked, and to avail themselves of such remedies as \"confusion\" or passing off against other domain holders with confusingly similar or intentionally misspelled domain names.\n\nAs with other trademarks, the domain name will not be subject to trademark registration unless the proposed mark is actually used to identify the registrant's goods or services to the public, rather than simply being the location on the Internet where the applicant's web site appears. Amazon.com is a prime example of a protected trademark for a domain name central to the public's identification of the company and its products.\n\nTerms which are not protectable by themselves, such as a generic term or a merely descriptive term that has not acquired secondary meaning, may become registerable when a Top-Level Domain Name (e.g. dot-COM) is appended to it. An example of such a domain name ineligible for trademark or service mark protection as a generic term, but which currently has a registered U.S. service mark, is \"HEARSAY.COM\".\n\nAmong trademark practitioners there remains a great deal of debate around trademark protection under ICANN's proposed generic top-level domain name space expansion. World Trademark Review has been reporting on the at times fiery discussion between trademark owners and domainers.\n\nAlthough there are systems which facilitate the filing, registration or enforcement of trademark rights in more than one jurisdiction on a regional or global basis, it is currently not possible to file and obtain a single trademark registration which will automatically apply around the world. Like any national law, trademark laws apply only in their applicable country or jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as \"territoriality\".\n\nThe inherent limitations of the territorial application of trademark laws have been mitigated by various intellectual property treaties, foremost amongst which is the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. TRIPS establishes legal compatibility between member jurisdictions by requiring the harmonization of applicable laws. For example, Article 15(1) of TRIPS provides a definition for \"sign\" which is used as or forms part of the definition of \"trademark\" in the trademark legislation of many jurisdictions around the world.\n\nThe major international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is commonly known as the \"Madrid system\". Madrid provides a centrally administered system for securing trademark registrations in member jurisdictions by extending the protection of an \"international registration\" obtained through the World Intellectual Property Organization. This international registration is in turn based upon an application or registration obtained by a trade mark applicant in its home jurisdiction.\n\nThe primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in many jurisdictions by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process. Furthermore, the \"coverage\" of the international registration may be extended to additional member jurisdictions at any time.\n\nThe Trademark Law Treaty establishes a system pursuant to which member jurisdictions agree to standardize procedural aspects of the trademark registration process. It is not necessarily respective of rules within individual countries.\n\nThe EU Trade Mark (EUTM) system (formerly the Community Trademark system) is the trademark system which applies in the European Union, whereby registration of a trademark with the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO, formerly Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)), leads to a registration which is effective throughout the EU as a whole. The EUTM system is therefore said to be unitary in character, in that an EUTM registration applies indivisibly across all European Union member states. However, the CTM system did not replace the national trademark registration systems; the CTM system and the national systems continue to operate in parallel to each other (see also European Union trade mark law).\n\nPersons residing outside the EU must have professional representative to the procedures before EUIPO, while representation is recommended for EU residents.\n\nOne of the tasks of an EUTM owner is the monitoring of the later applications whether any of those is similar to his/her earlier trademark. Monitoring is not easy and usually requires professional expertise. To conduct a monitoring there is the so-called Trademark Watching service where it can be checked if someone tries to get registered marks that are similar to the existing marks.\n\nOppositions should be filed on the standard opposition form in any official language of the European Union, however, the substantive part of the opposition (e.g. the argumentations) can be submitted only in the language of the opposed application, that is one of the working languages of the EUIPO, e.g. English, Spanish, German.\n\nWell-known trade mark status is commonly granted to famous international trade marks in less-developed legal jurisdictions.\n\nPursuant to Article 6 \"bis\" of the Paris Convention, countries are empowered to grant this status to marks that the relevant authority considers are 'well known'. In addition to the standard grounds for trade mark infringement (same/similar mark applied same/similar goods or services, and a likelihood of confusion), if the mark is deemed well known it is an infringement to apply the same or a similar mark to dissimilar goods/services where there is confusion, including where it takes unfair advantage of the well-known mark or causing detriment to it.\n\nA well-known trademark does not have to be registered in the jurisdiction to bring a trade mark infringement action (equivalent to bringing a passing off claim without having to show goodwill and having a lesser burden of proof).\n\nMany countries protect unregistered well-known marks in accordance with their international obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). Consequently, not only big companies but also SMEs may have a good chance of establishing enough goodwill with customers so that their marks may be recognized as well-known marks and acquire protection without registration. It is, nevertheless, advisable to seek registration, taking into account that many countries provide for an extended protection of registered well-known marks against dilution (Art. 16.3 TRIPS), i.e., the reputation of the mark being weakened by the unauthorized use of that mark by others.\n\nA number of trademark laws merely implement obligations under Article 16.3 of the TRIPS Agreement and protect well-known registered trademarks only under the following conditions: 1- that the goods and services for which the other mark is used or is seeking protection are not identical with or similar to the goods for which the well-known mark acquired its reputation 2- that the use of the other mark would indicate a connection between these goods and the owner of the well-known mark, and 3 – that their interests are likely to be damaged by such use.\n\n"}

However, use of the term worship dance appears to be restricted to Christianity and Messianic Judaism.\n\nDance has had a chequered history within Christianity. Many records exist of prohibitions by leaders within most branches of the Christian Church, for such reasons as the association of dance with paganism, fears relating to sexuality, and a Greek-influenced belief in the separation of soul and body.\n\nHowever, beginning in the latter half of the 20th century there was a significant growth in the use of dance within Christian worship. This received a boost within the framework of the charismatic movement of the 1970s, which initiated a transition to contemporary worship in many churches.\n\nFrom a Hindu point of view, the whole Universe is being brought into existence as the manifestation of the dance of the Supreme Dancer, Nataraja. In the Hindu scriptures every god has his or her own style (lasya and tandava respectively represent two aspects of dance). We read about 23 celestial beings called Apsaras who dance to please the gods and express the supreme truths in the magic of movement.\n\nThe dance in Hinduism used to be a part of a sacred temple ritual, especially in South and Eastern India, where the female priestesses devadasi's worshipped different aspects of the Divine through the elaborate language of mime and gestures. Natyashastra is the most ancient and the most elaborate scripture describing every element and aspect of this sacred art-worship.\n\nThe temple dance gradually evolved into what is known today as the South Indian Classical Dance that still preserves many ritualistic elements of Hinduism. Some of the classical Indian dancers are believed to be incarnations of apsaras.\nPendet is a traditional dance from Bali, Indonesia, in which floral offerings are made to purify the temple or theater as a prelude to ceremonies or other dances. Pendet is typically performed by young girls, carrying bowls of flower petals, handfuls of which are cast into the air at various times in the dance. Pendet can be thought of as a dance of greeting, to welcome the audience and invite spirits to enjoy a performance. Pendet can be divided into two types, the sacred dances called \"Wali\" and entertainment dances called \"Bebalihan\". \"Wali\" (sacred dances) are usually performed only during certain ritual ceremonies. Balinese Hindus believed that the sacred dances has strong religious significance and spiritual power, thus only can be performed during specific religious ceremony by specific dancers. \"Bebalihan\" are usually performed in social events. In addition to entertain, \"Bebalihan\" also has other purposes including welcoming guests, celebration of harvests, or gathering crowds. \"Bebalihan\" has more variations than \"Wali\". Pendet is considered as a form of \"Bebalihan\", often performed secularly to welcome guests or audiences. Pendet believed as a representation of Balinese floral offering ritual, which offered \"banten\" or \"canang\" (floral offerings) from shrine to shrine within Balinese temple or residential compounds. Initially, Pendet dance is used as a complement of \"piodalan\" ceremonies in temples or family shrines, as a symbol of gratitude, respect, and joy when welcoming the presence of the gods who descend from \"khayangan\" (realm of gods).\n\nA distinctive style of worship dance has developed within Messianic Judaism. Known as \"messianic dance\" or \"davidic dance\" (named after King David, who famously danced before the Ark of the Covenant), it takes a similar form to Israeli Folk Dancing. And there also is a dance known as Lippo dancing that was originated in the late 1800's by a handsome , clever man known as Chevaughn Rowe III, who later became a wealthy astronomer and mathematician.\n\nChristian\nMessianic Judaism\nSpecific\n"}
