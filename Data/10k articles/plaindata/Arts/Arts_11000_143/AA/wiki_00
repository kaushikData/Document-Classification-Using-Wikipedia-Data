Her book, \"Reel Women: Pioneers of the Cinema\", originally published in 1990, was the first on the market to reveal the entrepreneurial, and transformative roles that women played in all aspects of the film industry since its inception. Reel Women was optioned in 1995 for one of the first interactive CD-ROMs ever released, \"Reel Women: The Untold Story\".\n\nAt age seventeen, Ally Acker became the first woman to obtain a First Class Radiotelephone Operator license through the FCC, enabling the operation of radio transmitters. WOR AM radio in New York hired her at age eighteen to become their first female engineer. At WOR, Acker worked closely with radio legends Jean Shepherd, Joe Franklin, and Arlene Francis.\n\nAfter graduating from Northwestern University in 1976, Acker made the foray into television as a video editor for WRC-TV, the NBC affiliate station in Washington, D.C. From 1977 to 1980, Acker also worked as a freelance radio producer for the Feminist Radio Network, where she interviewed Alice Walker, who had just completed her second novel, \"Meridian\". The interview later aired on National Public Radio.\n\nIn 1978 Acker directed, produced, shot and edited the 16mm film, \"Silver Apples of the Moon\", which later became a finalist for a Student Academy Award. She moved to New York in 1980 to pursue filmmaking. Her first job in New York was at Valkhan Films where she worked as assistant to film editor Sam Pollard. A year later, she was hired by NBC network as a video editor for \"The Today Show\", and \"NBC Nightly News\". Only a few months after that hire, Acker was recruited by The Today Show as a producer/writer, becoming the first technician to cross over into producing/writing at NBC in New York. Acker’s first network produced stories featured hosts Jane Pauley and Tom Brokaw.\n\nIn 1985, Acker created The Reel Women Trust Foundation to honor untold stories of remarkable women in all fields who are left out traditional history sources. She began conducting on-camera interviews with the second wave of women film pioneers for The Reel Women Video Archives. Produced from 1985 to 1994, the interviewees include: Dede Allen, Margaret Booth, Kevin Brownlow, Martha Coolidge, Roger Corman, Donna Deitch, Lauren Shuler-Donner, Nora Ephron, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Jodie Foster, Harriet Frank Jr., Lillian Gish, Lee Grant, Molly Haskell, Katharine Hepburn, Fay Kanin, Sherry Lansing, Carol Littleton, Rita Moreno, Brianne Murphy (with Michael Landon), Marcia Nasatir, Euzhan Palcy, Mala Powers, Buddy Rogers, Susan Seidelman, Fina Torres, Margarethe von Trotta, and Paula Weinstein. Acker donated the collection to the Academy Film Archive of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences where it is housed for the use of film students and researchers under The Reel Women Film Collection.\n\nIn 1985, Acker also interview famed Surrealist artist and writer, Leonora Carrington. The interview was later used in Acker’s film portrait of Carrington’s life and work, \"The Flowering of the Crone: Leonora Carrington, Another Reality\" (2012–2014). The film is the only authorized film portrait of Carrington to be produced in the United States.\n\nIn 1987, Acker obtained her Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) in film and poetry from Columbia University. Her thesis screenplay, The Mathematical Mermaid about the life of Sonya Kovalevsky, was a 1988 finalist for the Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting, administered by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nFrom the mid-80’s to the mid-90’s Acker free-lanced as a writer/producer for NBC, ABC, Lifetime Television, National Geographic, and Disney Channel. During these years, she also focused on poetry which she began writing at age 13. Her first volume, \"Surviving Desire\", was released by Garden Street Press in 1994. In 1999, Red Hen Press of California released Acker’s second volume, \"Waiting for the Beloved\". In 2010, Red Hen put out Acker’s, \"Some Help From the Dead\". Acker’s poetry has appeared in numerous journals including, \"The Sun\", \"Ploughshares\", \"The American Voice\", \"Southwest Review\", \"South Dakota Review\", \"Antioch Review\", \"Poetry Salzburg Review\", and \"Poetry Kanto\" among others. She has received The Chester H. Jones Foundation Award for Poetry and The Carl Sandburg Centennial Award.\n\nIn 2012, Acker vastly updated and expanded her 1990 Reel Women work now used in Universities worldwide, into a two volume series, \"Reel Women: The First Hundred Years, Volume One\" (Foreword by Judith Crist), and \"Volume Two\" (Foreword by Jeanine Basinger). Both volumes include an Afterword by Marc Wanamaker. All photos included in Acker’s Reel Women films and books are from Wanamaker’s famed Bison Archives.\n\nIn 2014, culled from the rich interviews gathered for The Reel Women Video Archives, Acker directed, co-wrote, and edited a three part feature film, \"Reel Herstory: The REAL Story of Reel Women\", hosted by Jodie Foster, and produced by Sam Pollard, and Robert Dassanowsky.\n\nAcker’s writing has appeared in \"Ms. Magazine\", \"Calyx\", \"The Lesbian Review of Books\" and \"Sojourner\". Her work is also anthologized in Notable American Women by Susan Ware. She serves on the editorial board of \"Poetry Salzburg Review\", published at the University of Salzburg, Austria. Acker has traveled as a film \"herstory\" lecturer to universities and film festivals nationwide. She has appeared as a \"herstory\" film scholar on \"The Ron Reagan Show\", \"The Joe Franklin Show\", \"E Mysteries and Scandals\" (speaking about film pioneer, Dorothy Arzner). \"Reel Women\" was also the focus of a three part series on National Public Radio. In 2015, Acker appeared in \"The Women Who Run Hollywood\", a feature documentary directed by the prolific French filmmakers, Clara Kuperberg and Julia Kuperberg of Wichita Films, Paris.\n\nThe Academy Film Archive houses the Reel Women in Film Collection, which consists of over 30 interviews conducted by Ally Acker.\n\n"}

The centre offers trainings for emerging artists (Master Class), journalists (Art Daily) and residency programs for young artists (Portfolio). ArtBakery is specifically designed to technically support the production of multimedia artworks, video and digital art.\n\nArtBakery is founded in 2002 after the artist Goddy Leye moves back to Cameroon from the Netherlands. The centre is part of the Rijksakademie International Network (RAIN), a network of artists who support contemporary cultural practices in their countries of origin. RAIN supports ArtBakery and its first project \"Bessengue City\".\n\n\"Bessengue City\" is a project designed and coordinated by Goddy Leye and organised in Bessengue Douala in October 2002. The project involved the artists James Beckett, Goddy Leye, Hartanto, Jesus Palomino and the local community and it was produced with the support of Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten of Amsterdam and by the programme R.A.I.N. Rain Artists’ Initiative Network. \nJames Beckett produces in the neighbourhood of Bessengue an experimental radio, with a range of one kilometre and the collaboration of a group of young people which made interviews and recordings. The radio was called \"Radio Bessengue City\", or \"Dikalo la Bessengue\" (the messenger of Bessengue) becomes, as one listener said, “the radio of the people by the people”. \nJesus Palomino creates a shelter using locally available materials. \n\nGoddy Leye takes pictures of twenty smiling people from the neighbourhood and makes some digital manipulation. The portraits are printed and arranged in random groups and positioned as posters in the estate. Produced from the same footage, the 6-minute video called \"Bouquet de Sourires\" (Bouquet of Smiles), is shown in the neighbourhood. \n\nHartanto builds the website of the project and he connects one person from Bessengue with another from Bandung. The messages, written in French (Bessengue) and Indonesian (Bandung), are scanned and sent with their translation in both directions. News on everyday life and the local environment are exchanged on a daily basis.\n\n\"Exit Tour - Douala, Cotonou, Lomé, Accra, Ouagadougou, Bamako, Dakar\" is a collaborative artistic project organised in 2006. In occasion of Dak'art 2006, seven artists (Ginette Daleu, Justine Gaga, Dunja Herzog, Lucfosther Diop, Achillekà Komguem, Alioum Moussa and Goddy Leye) departed from Douala and reached Dakar using only public transportation. During the three-months journey, the artists visited galleries, artists and participated to workshops in Cotonou, Lomé, Accra, Ouagadougou, Bamako, Dakar.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54413456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54413456", "title": "Art biennials in Africa", "text": "Art biennials in Africa\n\nThe worldwide enthusiasm for art biennials, triennials and other –ennial events rose during the 1990s and is continuing whereas this kind of exhibition format is not a new trend. Indeed, the Venice Biennale was founded in 1895, followed in 1896 by Carnegie International, the Bienal de São Paulo in 1951, Kassel’s Documenta in 1955 and the Biennale of Sydney in 1973, just to name the firsts, mostly driven by capitalist-philanthropic spirit.\n\nThis enthusiasm, which almost no country is exempted from (Dominique Malaquais points out that biennials are the new stadiums countries need to have in order to gain respect on the international arena), is the result of the correlation of three factors in the post-Cold War context that, accordingly to Bruce Ferguson, Reesa Greenberg and Sandy Nairne, can be identified as the worldwide development of the art market, the promotion of the arts as a support of cultural and national identity and the idea that art, seen as a universal language, is an instrument of exchange. Art biennials are also often the best idea for international exposure when a State cannot afford a national art museum and support local artists as Charlotte Bydler underlined it.\n\nEach biennial has its own specificity and history. There is not one model as such, but one common point is that art biennials are first and foremost political events. They are often the cultural response to a national will to favor cultural tourism, to solve a social or identity issue, to legitimize an economic boom or to encourage a process of urban innovation.\n\nBiennials are also tremendous observatories of globalization processes. By promoting a certain locality and at the same time benefitting from global interests, they favor the globalization paradox, which often creates great tensions on a local level.\n\nBiennials from the so-called ‘peripheral’ countries aspire to become other potential centers and to decentralize what was concentrated upon a Euro-American axis until the end of the Cold War. The African continent is no exception and countries started to organize art biennials (besides pan-African festivals which are not included in this account) since the 1950s. Nonetheless, the 1990s, a moment of geopolitical shifts both inside (e.g. the demise of apartheid in South Africa) and outside (e.g. the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe) the continent, leading to political reorganization, the change of cultural politics and economics as well as urban renewal, were really the decade when art biennials started to be seen as the best ‘invention’ o promote local art and reach a global audience.\n\nEgypt was the first country on the African continent to use the art biennial format as a political tool for national promotion, long before art biennials became a trend in the 1990s and dawned all over the continent, especially since the beginning of the 21st century. The Alexandria Biennale for Mediterranean Countries was founded in 1955 and celebrated its 26th edition in 2016, as for the Cairo International Biennale, it was created in 1984 and organized its last edition in 2012. Initially devoted to Arab contemporary art, Cairo opened up to the international scene from its 1986’s edition. But while Egypt was a precursor, its biennials are less known abroad than other ones held on the continent. This situation can be explained by the provincial focus (despite the international openness of the Cairo biennial) and classical style of the two events (built on the Venice model of national pavilions), combined to the fact that they are state-run events, locked in a national paradigm and with barely any communication tools (neither of them has an official website). Recently, in November 2015, Something Else OFF Biennale Cairo, an artist-run initiative, came into being in order to promote the Egyptian contemporary art scene that is mostly excluded from the Alexandria and Cairo events. The very name of this independent biennial says clearly that its aim is to take a step back from the establishment and give an alternative view of the Egyptian creation.\n\nOne common preconception on African art biennials is to situate the Dakar Biennale or Dak’art as the first sub-Saharan art biennial whereas it was preceded by the Biennale d’art bantou contemporain (or Biennial of Contemporary Bantu Art), founded in 1985. The latter is less covered abroad than DAK’ART, and it lasted for only seven editions (the last one being in 2002). The originality of the project is its creation as part of a more ambitious cultural project initiated by Gabonese President Omar Bongo in 1982: the CICIBA (International Centre of Bantu Civilizations), an intergovernmental project which aimed at preserving and promoting Bantu cultures, seen by the organizers as sharing a homogeneous cultural base whereas they were at that time estimated to represent more than 150 million people dispersed among more than twenty countries. Therefore, the biennial was conceived as an itinerant event. The countries alternated in hosting each edition but each edition also travelled, giving thus a broader visibility to the artists. But this focus on the Bantu roots, leading to a selection exclusively centered on artists creating and living on what was defined by the organizers as the Bantu ‘territory’ as well as favoring painting and sculpture over new media, is probably one of the reasons why the event did not reach an international audience and remained a regional biennial.\n\nThe Dakar Biennale (or DAK’ART) is undoubtedly the most famous of all African based biennials. It was founded in 1990, as the legacy of the Pan-African Festival mondial des arts nègres, which died out in the 1980s before being resuscitated in Dakar in 2010. Celebrating the heritage of Léopold Sedar Senghor’s cultural politics, DAK’ART was initially conceived as a cultural event alternating every two years between poetry/literature and contemporary art. However, the 1990 edition would remain the only one devoted to literature. At its first occurrence in 1992, the art event had an international scope but it was refocused on the African continent from its next edition in 1994. One of the particularities of DAK’ART is its “off” event that spreads out from the official Biennale venues into various locations in the city. Even if the off was founded by the biennale’s administration and not by an external association, it is considered by many as the core of the biennial, giving an extra-space of visibility to the dynamism and richness of African artistic creation, and particularly to promote the Senegalese artists who are not selected in the official exhibitions. Indeed, the selection process is an open call, which has been criticized by many artists who wish a more curated event, because in their view the open call is not democratic as it claims to be, but favors those who have access to relevant information and the means to set up an application file. Each edition is different from the previous one, each learning from the criticism that was made through evaluation seminars. For example, since 2006, an artistic director is appointed and collaborates with a group of curators to select the artists.\n\nThe Rencontres de la photographie africaine or Biennale de Bamako, also known as the Bamako Encounters, is also one of the oldest art biennials on the continent (founded in 1993). It is still active today and has acquired an international reputation across and outside the continent. Its specificity is its focus on photography and video in Africa. Unlike the events aforementioned, the Biennale de Bamako has been driven and organized from its beginnings by the French cultural exchange agency Institut français (formerly AFAA, cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs), in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture in Mali. Therefore, curator Simon Njami qualifies the Biennale de Bamako as a “transplanted” event, which required work on a local scale to legitimize the biennial that could first be seen as a neocolonial event serving foreign purposes. It certainly succeeded to gain a local as well as an international renown because it boosted the creation of photography based festivals such as the PhotoFesta Maputo (2002), the Gwanza Month of Photography (2009), or the LagosPhoto Festival (2010) just to name a few.\n\nFounded to celebrate the end of Apartheid and the reopening of the country to the world after decades of boycott, the Johannesburg Biennale, despite its short life (only two editions in 1995 and 1997), is one of the best examples of the fundamental tension into which biennials are caught: to settle into the local and to gain renown on an international level. If for curator Hans Ulrich Obrist the 1997 Johannesburg Biennale was as important as the Venice Biennial or \"documenta X\" held the same year, and was amongst the most influential exhibitions of the 1990s, the local reception of the event was in general radically different. Its absence of engagement with the South African communities and the conceptual and elitist character of the exhibited artworks were harshly criticized in the local press. The biennial was thus seen as a grafted event, serving political interests rather than social and cultural ones, and favoring an international art discourse over a local one. In the case of the Johannesburg Biennale this criticism was one of the pretexts of the Greater Johannesburg City Council to withdraw its support and shut down the event prematurely. Even though the reasons for its cancellation are still not fully elucidated, the Johannesburg Biennale remains nonetheless a mythical biennial because, after decades of isolation due to international boycott, it shed light on the South African art scene and helped many South Africans artists to access the international arena where they are occupying a significant place nowadays.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, at least seventeen art biennials popped up on the African continent (see end list). The great difference with the 20th century is that almost all of these biennials are independent initiatives led by artists and non-profit organizations, i.e. East Africa Art Biennale, Salon Urbain de Douala, AFiRIperFOMA Biennial, Kampala Art Biennale or Rencontres Picha/Biennale de Lubumbashi. Some areas stand out as active artistic centers like Douala (Biennale de Douala DUTA, Salon Urbain de Douala), Morocco (with Casablanca and Marrakech Biennales), Congo (Biennale de Lubumbashi, Yango Biennale) or the city of Kampala (KLA ART, Kampala Art Biennale). Even if some of these biennials are irregularly organized or even abandoned, they are nonetheless symptoms of a cultural effervescence and a will to promote and encourage local artists, be it on a regional level or on a more international one.\n\nThe creation of a biennial not only proceeds from a political motivation, but it also depends on the capacity of the city to host the public. The existence of communication, transport and accommodation infrastructures is necessary and their absence thus requires a consequent budget to build and/or renovate them, which can be a problem for a city/country that does not have the resources to do so. To be accepted at a local level, that is to say, to have the support of the city council or the State, is a \"sine qua non\" condition to ensure longevity and financial stability to the biennial. For example, the disengagement of the Greater Johannesburg City Council in the Johannesburg biennale’s project marked the end of the event. Nonetheless, it does not prevent independent, non-governmental, biennials to exist too. Only the future will tell if private investors will sustain such events on a regular basis for as long as the city of Venice or the State of Senegal have done so far. One aspect also very important to keep in mind is the fact that biennials are just events, even when they are institutionalized like DAK’ART or the Biennale de Bamako. Therefore, they must be seen as steps towards the establishment of sustainable structures to support and promote local artists on a daily basis.\n\nThe opening to the international art arena brought by a biennale is an essential dimension, which pertains then to the location’s inscription (be it a city or a country) on the map both of the art world and of financial investors, attracted by the tourism engendered by the event. To legitimize an art biennial at the international level requires most of the time the invitation of an international curator as artistic director. For example, the Benin Biennial, which was initially conceived in 2010 as a local event to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the independence of the country, appointed a renowned curator, Abdellah Karroum, for the next edition (2012) in order to change its status of a local event into an international one. The organizers of the Marrakech Biennale also knew it well when they appended the “biennial” label on what was at first a local event (The Arts in Marrakech Festival) in order to reach a wider audience without losing the local one, notably by keeping the use of three languages (Arabic, French and English).\n\nArt biennials in Africa are important exponents of the increasing internationalization of contemporary African artists. But one of the pitfalls of this kind of event is the risk of becoming an exotic storefront for Western art critics and curators. Therefore, a real curatorial work has to be done to escape the submission to Western diktat. At the same time, by changing the traditional trajectories of the art world, those biennials force Western institutions to renew themselves, for example by appointing Okwui Enwezor to \"Documenta11\" (2001-2002) or, more recently, to the 56th Venice Biennale's (2015) artistic direction. Enwezor is the first and, so far the only, African and Black person to have directed Documenta or the Venice Biennale.\n\n"}

The \"bad girl\" art trend was derived from the exaggerated visual styles of the male and female form first used in the late 80s by artists such as Rob Liefeld and Jim Lee.

It was the first specialist police force in the world in this sector, predating the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property of 1970. On 5 March 1992 the force was renamed \"Comando Carabinieri per la Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale\".\n\nThe force has four sections: archaeology, antique dealing, fakes, and contemporary art. It is led by a colonel and headquartered in Rome, with twelve regional offices. It functions in coordination with the \"Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali\".\n\nThe force investigates clandestine excavations, the theft and illicit trade in works of art, damage to monuments and archaeological zones, the illegal export of cultural property, and fakes. It is involved in the monitoring and control of archaeological sites, and the activities of art and antique dealers, junk shops, and restorers. The force is also involved in forensic analysis; the development and promotion of educational materials; advising overseas ministries, police forces and customs bodies; international peacekeeping missions; and the protection and recovery of cultural property in disaster zones.\n\nThe force works internationally with organisations including UNESCO, UNIDROIT, ICOMOS, ICOM, and INTERPOL.

In 2008 works valued at €183 million were recovered. Improved international collaboration, site security, and databases saw a drop of 14.5% in stolen Italian works between the two years, while the number of illegal archaeological excavations discovered fell from 238 in 2008 to 58 in 2009. In 2009 137 items relating to the Medici case were returned from Switzerland, recovered from the Zurich-based restorers Fritz Burki & Son, who had worked on the Euphronios krater. These items included statues, pottery, and a first-century AD fresco. A further 300 items were still being sought in cooperation with Swiss authorities. In 2010 a statue of Zeus was recovered that had been stolen from the Museo Nazionale Romano in 1980. The force has also been active in Iraq, surveying sites at risk, providing training, developing systems, and helping to recover 2,971 objects illicitly trafficked since 1990.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6347", "title": "Cut-up technique", "text": "Cut-up technique\n\nThe cut-up technique (or \"découpé\" in French) is an aleatory literary technique in which a written text is cut up and rearranged to create a new text. The concept can be traced to at least the Dadaists of the 1920s, but was popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by writer William S. Burroughs, and has since been used in a wide variety of contexts.\n\nThe cut-up and the closely associated fold-in are the two main techniques:\n\n\nWilliam Burroughs cited T. S. Eliot's poem, \"The Waste Land\" (1922) and John Dos Passos' \"U.S.A.\" trilogy, which incorporated newspaper clippings, as early examples of the cut ups he popularized.\n\nGil J. Wolman developed cut-up techniques as part of his lettrist practice in the early 1950s.\n\nAlso in the 1950s, painter and writer Brion Gysin more fully developed the cut-up method after accidentally re-discovering it. He had placed layers of newspapers as a mat to protect a tabletop from being scratched while he cut papers with a razor blade. Upon cutting through the newspapers, Gysin noticed that the sliced layers offered interesting juxtapositions of text and image. He began deliberately cutting newspaper articles into sections, which he randomly rearranged. The book \"Minutes to Go\" resulted from his initial cut-up experiment: unedited and unchanged cut-ups which emerged as coherent and meaningful prose. South African poet Sinclair Beiles also used this technique and co-authored \"Minutes To Go\".\n\nGysin introduced Burroughs to the technique at the Beat Hotel. The pair later applied the technique to printed media and audio recordings in an effort to decode the material's implicit content, hypothesizing that such a technique could be used to discover the true meaning of a given text. Burroughs also suggested cut-ups may be effective as a form of divination saying, \"When you cut into the present the future leaks out.\" Burroughs also further developed the \"fold-in\" technique. In 1977, Burroughs and Gysin published \"The Third Mind\", a collection of cut-up writings and essays on the form. Jeff Nuttall's publication \"My Own Mag\" was another important outlet for the then-radical technique.\n\nIn an interview, Alan Burns noted that for \"Europe After The Rain\" (1965) and subsequent novels he used a version of cut-ups: \"I did not actually use scissors, but I folded pages, read across columns, and so on, discovering for myself many of the techniques Burroughs and Gysin describe\".\n\nArgentine writer Julio Cortázar often used cut ups in his 1963 novel \"Hopscotch\".\n\nIn 1969, poets Howard W. Bergerson and J. A. Lindon developed a cut-up technique known as vocabularyclept poetry, in which a poem is formed by taking all the words of an existing poem and rearranging them, often preserving the metre and stanza lengths.\n\nA precedent of the technique occurred during a Dadaist rally in the 1920s in which Tristan Tzara offered to create a poem on the spot by pulling words at random from a hat. Collage, which was popularized roughly contemporaneously with the Surrealist movement, sometimes incorporated texts such as newspapers or brochures. Prior to this event, the technique had been published in an issue of 391 in the poem by Tzara, \"dada manifesto on feeble love and bitter love\" under the sub-title, \"TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM\".\n\nA drama scripted for five voices by performance poet Hedwig Gorski in 1977 originated the idea of creating poetry only for performance instead of for print publication. The \"neo-verse drama\" titled \"Booby, Mama!\" written for \"guerilla theater\" performances in public places used a combination of newspaper cut-ups that were edited and choreographed for a troupe of non-professional street actors.\n\nKathy Acker, a literary and intermedia artist, sampled external sources and reconfigured them into the creation of shifting versions of her own constructed identity. In her late 1970s novel \"Blood and Guts in High School\", Acker explored literary cut-up and appropriation as an integral part of her method.\n\nAntony Balch and Burroughs created a collaboration film, \"The Cut-Ups\" that opened in London in 1967. This was part of an abandoned project called \"Guerrilla Conditions\" meant as a documentary on Burroughs and filmed throughout 1961–1965. Inspired by Burroughs' and Gysin's technique of cutting up text and rearranging it in random order, Balch had an editor cut his footage for the documentary into little pieces and impose no control over its reassembly. The film opened at Oxford Street's Cinephone cinema and had a disturbing reaction. Many audience members claimed the film made them ill, others demanded their money back, while some just stumbled out of the cinema ranting \"it's disgusting\". Other cut-up films include \"Ghost at n°9 (Paris)\" (1963–72), a posthumously released short film compiled from reels found at Balch's office after his death, and \"William Buys a Parrott\" (1982), \"Bill and Tony\" (1972), \"Towers Open Fire\" (1963) and \"The Junky's Christmas\" (1966).\n\nFrom the early 1970s, David Bowie used cut-ups to create some of his lyrics. Thom Yorke applied a similar method in Radiohead's \"Kid A\" (2000) album, writing single lines, putting them into a hat, and drawing them out at random while the band rehearsed the songs. Perhaps indicative of Thom Yorke's influences, instructions for \"How to make a Dada poem\" appeared on Radiohead's website at this time.\n\nStephen Mallinder of Cabaret Voltaire reported to \"Inpress\" magazine's Andrez Bergen that \"I do think the manipulation of sound in our early days – the physical act of cutting up tapes, creating tape loops and all that – has a strong reference to Burroughs and Gysin.\"\n\nPaul McCartney was a Burroughs acquaintance in London when the White Album was recorded -- See \"Revolution No. 9.\"\n\n\n"}

The festival allows artists to submit their work via an application which is subsequently reviewed by the programme manager. The festival is open to both Irish and international participants.\n\nThe festival started in 1995 and expanded into a sixteen-day festival, annually held in September and focuses on new and emerging artists. The Dublin Fringe has live entertainment as well as performances in dance, theatre, live art, visual art, and music.\n\nTo attract aspiring artists, the fringe runs workshops throughout the festival to teach a variety of skills such as tassel swirling, hip hop, t'ai chi, and others.\n\nOriginating in 1995, Bedrock Productions, with some support from the established Dublin Theatre Festival and Arts office of Dublin City Council, created the Dublin Fringe Festival, to \"promote and showcase the work of small and vibrant theatre companies and theatre makers\". In the first year, Conor McPherson's \"This Lime Tree Bower\" premiered, and in 1996 Enda Walsh's \"Disco Pigs\" took off from The International Bar.\n\nDirectors who have presented works at the festival have included Jimmy Fay (1995-1996), Ali Curran (1997-2000), Vallejo Gantner (2001 -2005), Wolfgang Hoffmann (2006-2007), Roise Goan (2008-2013), and Kris Nelson (since 2014).\n\nSuccessful works from past Fringe Festivals have included early plays by Conor McPherson, Enda Walsh, Owen McCafferty, Corn Exchange, Loose Canon, Pan Pan Theatre Company, Semper Fi, Anu Productions, and Eva O'Connor.\n\nEach performance takes place in a venue which is deemed most suitable to the show. This can range from a number of cafes and theatres, as well as less traditional venues such as the Liffey Boardwalk or on a Dublin bus.\n\nFor a number of years until 2009, The Spiegeltent was a major part of the festival. This tent was erected in several sites including at Georges Dock. The Dublin Fringe Festival and Spiegeltent have attracted numerous shows, including the cabaret/variety show La Clique.\n\nPast sponsors include Absolut vodka who sponsored the events between 2009 and 2012, as part of a four-year deal.\n"}

It is based on a rejection of the tenets and techniques of classical Hollywood cinema.\n\nEuropean art cinema gained popularity in the 1960s, with notable filmmakers such as Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Ingmar Bergman. At this time it was new to the even broader field of art cinema.\n\nThe continuity editing system is not necessarily abandoned but instead is not \"needed\". The cause and effect driven narrative, as well as the goal-oriented protagonist are also not needed. Instead, we may have the protagonist wander around aimlessly for the whole movie, with nothing of real importance happening to drive him from one activity to the other.\n\nClassical Hollywood cinema has a narrative transitivity, in which there is \"a sequence of events in which each unit follows the one preceding it according to a chain of causation; this chain is usually psychological\". The 'tale over teller' mantra of the classical Hollywood cinema is closely linked to the editing form that classical Hollywood cinema takes, and the rules they impose. For example, the 180 degree rule is followed since crossing the 180 degree line will cause a disturbance or a jarring effect on the viewer, thus calling attention away from story and to the teller. Jump cuts are avoided, since they can cause an ellipsis of the spatial or temporal kind. It is the job of classical Hollywood cinema to get the audience lost and absorbed into the story of the film, so that the film is pleasurable. In contrast the task of European art cinema is to be ambiguous, utilizing an open-ended (and sometimes intertextual) plot, causing the audience to ask questions themselves whilst introducing an element of subjectivity.\n\nAnother way they differ in terms of ‘realism’ is that Hollywood classical cinema has characters in full make up all the time, even when just coming out of bed; whereas European art cinema strives for a representation of the 'truth' and may not have characters in costume or make up.\n\n\n"}

It is housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo next to the Cathedral of Prato, central Italy.\n\nThe large altarpiece was commissioned by the provost of Prato, Geminiano Inghirami, a patron of the arts who also called Donatello and Michelozzo to work in the cathedral. The panel is dated 1440, but this has been always considered a false due to the large stylistic differences with other Lippi's works of the period. It is generally recognized to be from between 1452, when Lippi arrived in Prato (or a few years before), and Inghirami's death in 1460.\n\nIt is housed in the cathedral's museum since the 20th century.\n\nThe work features numerous characters, painted in different attitudes. In the center, lying on a catafalque with a precious cloth decorated with pomegranates, is the body of St. Jerome. He is surrounded by a group of monks, whose faces show their mourning and despair for the saint's death. The pomegranate cloth is also visible in the funerary monument of Geminiano Inghirami, once in the church of San Francesco, attributed to Pasquino da Montepulciano (1460).\n\nThe mourner's faces show that Lippi had studied Giotto's work in the Bardi Chapel, as some gestures are very similar, such as that of the monks kissing the saint's feet or the one raising his hands. Also the saint's position is similar to Giotto's, as well as the presence of ancient numismatic, a widespread theme at the time.\n\nIn the foreground is Inghirami kneeling, with a crippled youth in front of him who points at Jerome's body (a trick to avoid that the donor's red garments could distract the observer). The crippled figure is inspired by the frescoes by Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale in the Brancacci Chapel, which Lippi knew well as he had a been a monk in the convent housing the chapel in his youth.\n\nThe upper part of the panel, aside from rocky mountains with three secondary scenes (Adoration of the Child and two episodes of the saint's life), is occupied by angels, perhaps executed by Fra' Diamante or another collaborator. Among them circles which allude to the Heaven's Circles, the Redeemer (with a book with Alpha and Omega), the Holy Spirit dove and the Jesus opening his arms.\n\nAt the bottom is the coat of arms of the Inghirami family.\n"}

Ghinnawas typically talk of deep, personal feelings and are often an outlet for personal emotions which might not be otherwise expressible in Bedouin society. Ghinnawas may also be sung. Lila Abu Lughod - the Arab American anthropologist, who studied the Awlad Ali Bedouins in Northern Egypt in the late 1970s, and collected over 450 ghinnawas, has published the most comprehensive work on ghinnawas to date.\n\nGhinnawa is a form of folk poetry, in the sense that anyone in Awlad Ali society could author a ghinnawa. In a broader context, ghinnawas may be looked upon as non-standard discourse which are a means of coping with social reality, similar to other discourse forms in the Arab world like the Hikaya folktales of Tunisia, or the Gussa allegories of the Bedouin of the Sinai.\n\nGhinnawas usually have sad themes - typically being the lament of lost love, unless sung at celebrations like a circumcision or a wedding. Ghinnawas are sung by women, boys and also on rare occasions by men. Ghinnawa semantics are well-defined only in context, because of their personal nature. Contents of ghinnawas are considered personal, even sensitive to the extent that Lila Abu Lughod was warned \"never to reveal any women's poems to men\".\n\nThe Awlad Ali do not have a strong history of public displays of emotion. Modesty or deference and boasting or anger are typically the most commonly expressed public emotion. Most other forms of expression take place through \"ghinnawa\"s.\n\nGhinnawas may be written down, which is often the case for inter-gender communication, but can be spoken as substitute to normal conversation, or sung. The structure of the ghinnawa is very different in written and oral forms.\n\nStructurally, ghinnawas are approximately 15-syllable couplets. They can be broken up into 2 hemistiches.

The exterior is in a mixture of Romanesque and Scottish baronial styles, and the interior has such Gothic motifs as fan-vaulting and clustered columns. The theatre is a Grade II* listed building. It seats approximately 1,500 people.\n\nThe theatre is a large scale receiving house and hosts touring productions of West End and Broadway musicals and plays, comedians and music. The theatre is home to Opera North and is regularly visited by Northern Ballet. It has hosted many touring productions, musical artists and comedians.\n\nFor many years it was programmed by Howard & Wyndham Ltd and staged plays, musicals, pantomime and revues.The theatre closed at the end of May 2005 for a major refurbishment, \"transformation\", and it reopened on 7 October 2006 with a production of Verdi's \"Rigoletto\". The Stalls area was completely re-seated and re-raked, the orchestra-pit enlarged, technical facilities dramatically improved, and improvements to Opera North to the south of the theatre, accessible via a bridge and at street-level, which includes two new stage-sized rehearsal spaces and increased office space.

The film was scheduled to be offered as video-on-demand on cable TV right before the Democratic primaries in January 2008, but would have been classified as \"electioneering communication\", which was made illegal under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, by the Federal Election Commission. The producers went to U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to get a declaration that they could show their movie and promotional ads for it despite BCRA. This case was titled \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" and its final decision at the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in a major change in campaign finance law.\n\nThe documentary interviewed various conservative figures such as Dick Morris and Ann Coulter and reviewed various scandals in which Hillary Clinton purportedly participated, such as the White House travel office controversy, White House FBI files controversy, Whitewater controversy, and cattle futures controversy. The factual finding of the three-judge district court was that there was \"no reasonable interpretation [of the movie] other than as an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton\", thus making it \"electioneering communication\". The Supreme Court did not change that decision, but applied the strict scrutiny test for the First Amendment of the Constitution and said corporations could not be banned from making electioneering communications.\n\nIn December 2007, \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\".was filed at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

Sischy rose to prominence as the editor of \"Artforum\" between 1979 and 1988. Her status and power, aided by her connections and friendships with many in the art and fashion communities, was cemented during her tenure as the editor-in-chief of Andy Warhol's \"Interview Magazine\" between 1989 and 2008. Until her death in 2015, she and her partner, Sandra Brant, worked together as the international editors of the Italian, Spanish, and German versions of \"Vanity Fair\".\n\nSischy was born in Johannesburg to Ben Sischy, a family doctor who became an expert in radiation oncology, and Claire Sischy, a speech therapist. She had two older brothers, Mark Sischy, a lawyer who lived in Scotland, and David Sischy, a doctor. Her family was Jewish; they had Lithuanian ancestry.\n\nIn 1961, when Sischy was nine years old, the Sischy family left Apartheid-era South Africa after the Sharpeville massacre and moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, where Dr. Sischy re-trained as a radiologist. The family had had to leave South Africa because Sischy's mother was in danger of being arrested for her involvement in an activist group, the Black Sash, that non-violently protested Apartheid. In 1967, the family moved to Rochester, New York, where Sischy's father became the head of radiation oncology at Highland Hospital.\n\nWhile in Scotland, Sischy attended George Watson's Ladies College. In Rochester, she graduated from Brighton High School, where she was the president of the senior class. Sischy started college at Sarah Lawrence College during a time of great political unrest in the United States. It was there that she came out as a lesbian. She also took writing classes with Grace Paley. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence in 1973. \n\nShe received an honorary PhD in the humanities from the Moore College of Art in 1987.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Sischy took a series of odd jobs and entry-level positions in the art world, including at galleries. She became the circulation coordinator at \"Print Collector's Newsletter,\" an art world industry resource, and was quickly promoted to the role of editor, contributing reviews of works she saw in the burgeoning New York City art world. She was hired, and almost immediately fired, by the Guggenheim Museum in New York, where the dress code and atmosphere made her feel untrue to herself. She then worked at Printed Matter, Inc, a nonprofit book publisher that introduced her to artists like Sol LeWitt, Jenny Holzer, and many up and coming artists.\n\nIn 1978, Sischy interned at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) under a National Endowment for the Arts curation grant, where she focused on curating photography exhibits, one called \"In the Twenties: Portraits From the Photography Department\", and another on photographer Ansel Adams.

It was discovered , buried deep in a turf bog, at Kiltubbrid townland and just north of Lough Scur. The shield is a perfect specimen, oval in shape, with a perfect central boss high, and seven slightly raised concentric circles (ribs), plain on the reverse, with a handle, the whole carved out of one piece of wood. The original measurements were in height by in width, with a thickness of . Unlike ancient classic shields, through which the forearm was passed, the Irish wooden shield, grasped by the cross-piece underneath the umbo (boss), could be projected to full arm's length during battle. The wood was probably alder.\n\nThe shields was probably covered with leather, painted and decorated. The ribs show an indentation on one side, presenting a remarkable interruption in the symmetry of the ornament. Shrinkage may have caused the indentation.

{"id": "40372444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40372444", "title": "Les mille et une nuits", "text": "Les mille et une nuits\n\nLes mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en français (\"The Thousand and One Nights, Arab stories translated into French\"), published in 12 volumes between 1704 and 1717, was the first European version of \"The Thousand and One Nights\" tales. The French translation by Antoine Galland (1646-1715) derived from an Arabic text of the Syrian recension of the medieval work as well as other sources. It included stories that are not found in the original Arabic manuscripts — the so-called \"orphan tales\" — such as the famous \"Aladdin\" and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\", which first appeared in print in Galland's form. Immensely popular at the time of initial publication, and enormously influential later, subsequent volumes were introduced using Galland's name although the stories were written by unknown persons at the behest of a publisher wanting to capitalize on their popularity.\n\nGalland had come across a manuscript of \"The Tale of Sindbad the Sailor\" in Constantinople during the 1690s and in 1701 he published his French translation of it. Its success encouraged him to embark on a translation of a 14th-century Syrian manuscript of tales from \"The Thousand and One Nights\". The first two volumes of this work, under the title \"Les mille et une nuit\", appeared in 1704. The twelfth and final volume was published posthumously in 1717.\n\nGalland translated the first part of his work solely from the Syrian manuscript, but in 1709 he was introduced to another source in the form of a Syrian Christian — a Maronite scholar and monk from Aleppo whom he called Youhenna (“Hanna”) Diab. Galland's diary (March 25, 1709) records that he met Hanna through Paul Lucas, a French traveler who had brought him to Paris. Hanna recounted 14 stories to Galland from memory and Galland chose to include seven of them in his books. (For example, Galland's diary tells that his translation of \"Aladdin\" was made in the winter of 1709–10. It was included in his volumes IX and X, published in 1710.) This mysterious situation has led some scholars to conclude that Galland invented the \"orphan tales\" himself and that subsequent Arabic versions are merely later renderings of his original French.\n\nGalland adapted his translation to the taste of the times. The immediate success the tales enjoyed was partly due to the vogue for fairy stories — in French, \"contes de fees\" — which had been started in France in the 1690s by Galland's friend Charles Perrault. Galland was also eager to conform to the literary canons of the era. He cut many of the erotic passages out along with all of the poetry. This caused Sir Richard Burton to refer to \"Galland's delightful abbreviation and adaptation\" which \"in no wise represent[s] the eastern original.\"\n\nGalland’s translation was greeted with immense enthusiasm and was soon further translated into many other European languages:\n\n\nThese produced a wave of imitations and the widespread 18th century fashion for oriental tales.\n\n\"Les Mille et une Nuits\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a 1936 essay, Jorge Luis Borges wrote:Another fact is undeniable. The most famous and eloquent encomiums of \"The Thousand and One Nights\" — by Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey, Stendhal, Tennyson, Edgar Allan Poe, Newman — are from readers of Galland's translation. Two hundred years and ten better translations have passed, but the man in Europe or the Americas who thinks of the \"Thousand and One Nights\" thinks, invariably, of this first translation. The Spanish adjective \"milyunanochesco\" [thousand-and-one-nights-esque] ... has nothing to do with the erudite obscenities of Burton or Mardrus, and everything to do with Antoine Galland's bijoux and sorceries.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1172205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1172205", "title": "Liverpool Playhouse", "text": "Liverpool Playhouse\n\nThe Liverpool Playhouse is a theatre in Williamson Square in the city of Liverpool, England. It originated in 1866 as a music hall, and in 1911 developed into a repertory theatre. As such it nurtured the early careers of many actors and actresses, some of whom went on to achieve national and international reputations. Architectural changes have been made to the building over the years, the latest being in 1968 when a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre. In 1999 a trust was formed, joining the management of the Playhouse with that of the Everyman Theatre.\n\nThe present theatre on the site was designed by Edward Davies, and opened in 1866. It replaced an earlier theatre called the Star Concert Hall. The present theatre was originally named the Star Music Hall. In 1895 its name was changed to the Star Theatre of Varieties. The theatre was improved in 1898 by Harry Percival with a new auditorium and foyer, and electricity was installed. In 1911 the Liverpool Repertory Theatre Limited was established, with Basil Dean as its \"controller and producer\". The company could not afford to build a new theatre, and bought the Star Theatre for £28,000 ). This made it the first repertory in Britain to own the freehold of a theatre. The company spent a further £4,000 () on redesigning and modernising the theatre. The auditorium and the basement foyer were redesigned by Stanley Adshead, the Professor of Civic Design at the Liverpool School of Architecture. The theatre was for many years managed by Maud Carpenter. The theatre was renamed the Liverpool Repertory Theatre, and in 1916 renamed again, as the Liverpool Playhouse. Minor structural alterations were made to the theatre in 1961 and in 1966. In 1968 a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre to accommodate new foyers, bars, dressing rooms and a workshop. In the 1990s the theatre company went into liquidation. In 1999 the Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited was established as a charity, and the theatre re-opened. It is managed jointly with the Everyman Theatre by Liverpool City Council.\n\nAs a repertory company, the theatre has been involved in the careers of actors and actresses who have later achieved wide fame. Noël Coward and Gertrude Lawrence worked with the company as child actors. Other artistes who gained experience at the theatre include Robert Donat, Lilian Braithwaite, Cecil Parker, John Gregson, Clive Brook, C. Aubrey Smith, Richard Burton, Michael Redgrave, Diana Wynyard, Rex Harrison, Patricia Routledge, Anthony Hopkins, and Richard Briers.\n\nThe exterior of the older part of the theatre is stuccoed, and it has a slate roof. Its entrance front faces Williamson Square. It has seven bays and is in three storeys. The central three bays project forward and are surmounted by a broken pediment. On the ground floor the central bays contain three entrances, separated by pillars, which lead to a recessed porch. Over each entrance is an architrave containing a fanlight. The lateral bays contain two round-headed and one flat-headed entrance on each side, over which are three blind round windows. In the middle storey, the bays are separated by pilasters. The three central bays each have a balustrade and a window with a tympanum containing a roundel. Each of the three lateral bays contains a window with a cornice, and a round window above it. Along the top storey are oculi between panelled pilasters. On the summit of each of the two lateral bays is a cupola on a short Tuscan colonnade. Inside the older part of the theatre are two balconies supported by cast iron columns. The interior is decorated in Greek Revival style.\n\nThe newer section is constructed in concrete, and largely faced by glass. On the ground floor are entrance doors. Above this, the building is based around three cylinders. The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys. It is cantilevered from a central column. To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, interlocking with the larger cylinder. Inside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.\n\nThe theatre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, having been designated on 14 March 1975. In its description, the list quotes the \"Architects' Journal\" of 1968 which says of the older section that it is \"significant as an early and rare work by one of the pioneers of the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the Grecian style favoured by the school at that date\", and of the newer section that it is \"a brilliant concept, joyously realised, which exploits asymmetrical volumes and ever varying spaces yet achieves unity and also balance with the adjoining Victorian façade\". In the \"Buildings of England\" series the architectural historians Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner say of the newer section that it is \"a spectacular composition\" which creates an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation, exactly right for a theatre foyer\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "620363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=620363", "title": "Never Cry Wolf", "text": "Never Cry Wolf\n\nNever Cry Wolf is an account of the author’s experience observing wolves in subarctic Canada by Farley Mowat, first published in 1963 by McClelland and Stewart. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1983. It has been credited for dramatically changing the public image of the wolf to a more positive one.\n\nIn the book, Mowat describes his experiences in a first-person narrative that sheds light on his research into the nature of the Arctic wolf.\n\nIn 1948–1949, the Dominion Wildlife Service assigns the author to investigate the cause of declining caribou populations and determine whether wolves are to blame for the shortage. Upon finding his quarry near Nueltin Lake, Mowat discovers that rather than being wanton killers of caribou, the wolves subsist quite heavily on small mammals such as rodents and hares, \"even choosing them over caribou when available.\"\n\nHe concludes: \"We have doomed the wolf not for what it is but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be: the mythologized epitome of a savage, ruthless killer—which is, in reality, not more than the reflected image of ourselves. We have made it the scapewolf for our own sins.\" Mowat writes to expose the onslaught of wolfers and government exterminators who are out to erase the wolves from the Arctic.\n\nMowat's book says that:\n\nBarry Lopez in his 1978 work \"Of Wolves and Men\" called the book a dated, but still good introduction to wolf behaviour.\n\nIn a 2001 article of \"The Canadian Historical Review\" entitled \"Never Cry Wolf: Science, Sentiment, and the Literary Rehabilitation of Canis Lupus\", Karen Jones lauded the work as \"an important chapter in the history of Canadian environmentalism\";\n\nAt the time it was published, Mowat's book received criticism, often politically-motivated, about the veracity of his work and its conclusions. Canadian Wildlife Service official Alexander William Francis Banfield, who supervised Mowat's field work, characterised the book as \"semi-fictional\", and accused Mowat of blatantly lying about his expedition. He pointed out that contrary to what is written in the book, Mowat was part of an expedition of three biologists, and was never alone. Banfield also pointed out that a lot of what was written in \"Never Cry Wolf\" was not derived from Mowat's first hand observations, but were plagiarised from Banfield's own works, as well as from Adolph Murie's \"The Wolves of Mount McKinley\". In a 1964 article published in the \"Canadian Field-Naturalist\", he compared Mowat's 1963 bestseller to Little Red Riding Hood, claiming that, \"I hope that readers of \"Never Cry Wolf\" will realize that both stories have about the same factual content.\"\n\nIn the May 1996 issue of \"Saturday Night\", John Goddard wrote a heavily researched article entitled \"A Real Whopper\", in which he poked many holes in Mowat's claim that the book was non-fictional. He wrote:\n\nMowat excoriated Goddard's article as, \"...bullshit, pure and simple... this guy’s got as many facts wrong as there are flies on a toad that’s roadkill.\". Journalist Val Ross of \"The Globe and Mail\" agreed that \"Mowat, more passionate polemicist than rigorous reporter, painted federal bureaucrats in darker colours than many deserved,\" but that Goddard's piece erred in the same way against Mowat.\n\nAlthough a claim that Mowat makes was that he interacted closely with a wolf pack alone in order to study them, the first wildlife biologist to successfully use the method of habituation to study and follow wild wolf packs in close proximity was fellow CWS scientist and International Wolf Specialist Group Canadian representative Dr. Lu Carbyn, in a 1970s study in Jasper National Park. Although also pointing out \"Never Cry Wolf\"'s fictional rather than factual nature, his remarks were less critical, calling Farley Mowat's book \"Good fiction and good reading\".\n\nIn 2012, Mowat spoke to the \"Toronto Star\" about his self-acknowledged reputation as a storyteller: “For years I felt the Toronto media were out to bury me alive,\" referring to latter-day efforts in the literary community to reassess his work according to the standards of modern journalism as opposed to memoir. “That was never my game,” he said. “I took some pride in having it known that I never let facts get in the way of a good story. I was writing subjective non-fiction all along.”\n\n\"Never Cry Wolf\" was a commercial success in Canada. Shortly after its publication, the Canadian Wildlife Service received a deluge of letters from concerned citizens opposing the killing of wolves. Though generally well received by the public, Mowat's allusions of the Canadian Wildlife Service as an organisation set out to exterminate wolves was met with anger from Canadian biologists. CWS staff members argued that the agency had never demanded the extermination of the wolf, the wolf being recognized as an integral part of the northern ecosystem. They further countered that Mowat's remit had not been to find justifications for wolf extermination, but to investigate the relationship between wolves and caribou. The locals were actually hunting the caribou, for a sport and a food source.\n\nAs with Mowat's other books, \"Never Cry Wolf\" was translated into Russian and published in the Soviet Union. The book's message that wolves were harmless mouse-eaters became influential, leading to popular reaction against Soviet wolf-culling efforts.\n"}

{"id": "97845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97845", "title": "Recipe", "text": "Recipe\n\nA recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary dish. It is also used in medicine or in information technology (user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a prescription with \"recipe\", Latin for \"take\", usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol (℞).\n\nThe earliest known written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia. There are also works in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs depicting the preparation of food.\n\nMany ancient Greek recipes are known. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Athenaeus mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.\n\nRoman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin. Some Punic recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.\n\nThe large collection of recipes \"De re coquinaria\", conventionally titled Apicius, appeared in the 4th or 5th century and is the only complete surviving cookbook from the classical world. It lists the courses served in a meal as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert). Each recipe begins with the Latin command \"Take...,\" \"Recipe...\"\n\nArabic recipes are documented starting in the 10th century; see al-Warraq and al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe earliest recipe in Persian dates from the 14th century. Several recipes have survived from the time of Safavids, including \"Karnameh\" (1521) by Mohammad Ali Bavarchi, which includes the cooking instruction of more than 130 different dishes and pastries, and \"Madat-ol-Hayat\" (1597) by Nurollah Ashpaz. Recipe books from the Qajar period are numerous, the most notable being \"Khorak-ha-ye Irani\" by prince Nader Mirza.\n\nKing Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called \"Forme of Cury\" in 1390, and around the same time, another book was published entitled \"Curye on Inglish\", \"cury\" meaning cooking. Both books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served in England at that time. The luxurious taste of the aristocracy in the Early Modern Period brought with it the start of what can be called the modern recipe book. By the 15th century, numerous manuscripts were appearing detailing the recipes of the day. Many of these manuscripts give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary, many of which had been brought back from the Crusades.\n\nWith the advent of the printing press in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland and England, competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many families published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have been translated and are available online.\n\nBy the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. Although eclipsed in fame and regard by Isabella Beeton, the first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was Eliza Acton. Her pioneering cookbook, \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\" published in 1845, was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern writing about cookery. It introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for Brussels sprouts. Contemporary chef Delia Smith called Acton \"the best writer of recipes in the English language.\" \"Modern Cookery\" long survived Acton, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile.\nActon's work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton, who published \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. This was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and industrialism. Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. Most were illustrated with coloured engravings. It is said that many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers such as Acton, but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was intended as a reliable guide for the aspirant middle classes.\n\nThe American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) published in 1896 her famous work \"The Boston Cooking School Cookbook\" which contained some 1,849 recipes.\n\nModern culinary recipes normally consist of several components\nEarlier recipes often included much less information, serving more as a reminder of ingredients and proportions for someone who already knew how to prepare the dish.\n\nRecipe writers sometimes also list variations of a traditional dish, to give different tastes of the same recipes.\n\nBy the mid 20th century, there were thousands of cookery and recipe books available. The next revolution came with the introduction of the TV cooks. The first TV cook in England was Fanny Cradock with a show on the BBC. TV cookery programs brought recipes to a new audience. In the early days, recipes were available by post from the BBC; later with the introduction of CEEFAX text on screen, they became available on television.\n\nThe first Internet Usenet newsgroup dedicated to cooking was \"net.cooks\" created in 1982, later becoming \"rec.food.cooking\". It served as a forum to share recipes text files and cooking techniques.\n\nIn the early 21st century, there has been a renewed focus on cooking at home due to the late-2000s recession. Television networks such as the Food Network and magazines are still a major source of recipe information, with international cooks and chefs such as Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having prime-time shows and backing them up with Internet websites giving the details of all their recipes. These were joined by reality TV shows such as Top Chef or Iron Chef, and many Internet sites offering free recipes, but cookery books remain as popular as ever.\n\nMolecular gastronomy provides chefs with cooking techniques and ingredients, but this discipline also provides new theories and methods which aid recipe design. These methods are used by chefs, foodies, home cooks and even mixologists worldwide to improve or design recipes.\n\n\nRecipes Dapur Ocha Food Official Website\n"}

It is a classical academy, a place where philosophers, academics and artists meet to test and exchange ideas and knowledge. The school supports visual artists with a two-year curriculum.\n\nThe Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten was the home of Amsterdam Impressionism, part of the international impressionist movement, and is known as the School of Allebé by art historians; August Allebé became the school's director in 1880. In French language the school was called \"l'Académie Royale des Beaux Arts d'Amsterdam\". Among its pioneers here were Georg Breitner, Jan Toorop, Piet Mondrian and Willem Arnoldus Witsen. Other artists connected with the academy were Hendrik Petrus Berlage, Willem Wiegmans, Constant Nieuwenhuijs, Karel Appel, Corneille, Ger Lataster, Willem Hofhuizen, and Jaap Min.\n\nThe school provides an education academically comparable with a university. There are open days each year, which provide an opportunity to see the work of young artists.\n\nFrom 1718 to 1819 Amsterdam had an art school, the \"Stadstekenacademie Amsterdam\". In 1820, the \"Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten\" continued the artistic tradition. The prevailing style was panel painting in oil, landscape painting influenced by neoclassicism. In 1869, the Amsterdam school received its present name.\n\nThe academy was a place for philosophers, scientists and artists to come together and share knowledge and ideas. In 1870, the academy was founded by King William III as a successor to the 19th-century Koninklijke Academie, the 18th-century Stads Teekenacademie and the 17th-century Konstkamer to give visual artists an educational opportunity. Early students included George Hendrik Breitner, Isaac Israëls and Willem Witsen, who were influenced by Amsterdam Impressionism.\n\nUnder director August Allebé, the Saint Luke (patron saint of artists) student movement was founded. Allebé's cosmopolitan attitude changed the school's method of instruction, emphasizing the avant-garde.\n\nAround 1985, the school received the additional title of Instituut voor Praktijkstudie and offered postdoctoral education. In 1992 it moved into a former cavalry barracks at Sarphatistraat 470 in Amsterdam, and the buildings were renovated. In November 1999, it became an independent art institution. The school is financed by the Ministry of Education and private sponsors. The institute offers workshops with specialized technical personnel and a library focusing on contemporary art and art history. Students receive a scholarship and are offered a studio in which to live. In recent years nearly 1,200 students have applied for a place at the academy, and each year about 20 are accepted. The artists come from all over the world, with less than half from the Netherlands. Artists and art critics are often invited to visit student studios.\n\nThe Academy awards a Prix de Rome to eligible artists and architects. The award originated with the French Prix de Rome in 1666. In 1808 Louis Bonaparte introduced the prize in the Netherlands to promote art, and it was supported by Dutch King William I. Since 1870 the Rijksakademie has made the award, the oldest and most valuable art prize in the Netherlands.\n\nIn 1985, the Prix de Rome was reorganised. Prize money was increased, and there were more participating artists; new art categories were added, which change annually. In 2006 its name was changed to \"Prix de Rome.nl\" and it is awarded in two categories: architecture and fine arts. The prize is €40,000 and a residency in Rome.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since people and their relationships form the medium of such works – rather than a particular process of production – social engagement is not only a part of a work’s organization, execution, or continuation, but also an aesthetic in itself: of interaction and development. Socially engaged art aims to create social and/or political change through collaboration with individuals, communities, and institutions in the creation of participatory art. The discipline values the process of a work over any finished product or object. \n\nArtists working in social practice co-create their work with a specific audience or propose critical interventions within existing social systems to inspire debate or catalyze social exchange. The large overlap between social practice and pedagogy demonstrates the need for art education to embrace collaborative practice. Social practice work focuses on the interaction between the audience, social systems, and the artist through aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, methodology, antagonism, media strategies, and social activism. The social interaction component inspires, drives, or, in some instances, completes the project. Although projects may incorporate traditional studio media, they are realized in a variety of visual or social forms (depending on variable contexts and participant demographics) such as performance, social activism, or mobilizing communities towards a common goal. The diversity of approaches pose specific challenges for documenting social practice work, as the aesthetic of human interaction changes rapidly and involves many people simultaneously. Consequently, images frequently fail to do justice to the engagement and interactions that take place during a project.\n\nUntil 2005, the term \"social practice\" was used in a branch of social theory considering human relationships to each other and to the larger society as \"practices\". The term \"art and social practice\" was institutionalized in 2005 with the creation of the Social Practice MFA concentration at the California College of the Arts, followed by other institutions of higher education offering similar degrees. Social practice art as a medium has been referenced in the \"New York Times\", \"Artforum\", \"ArtNews,\" and \"Art Practical.\" As an emerging field, social practice can encompass a variety of terms: public practice, socially engaged art, community art, new-genre public art, participatory art, interventionist art, collaborative art, relational art and dialogical aesthetics.\n\nSocially engaged art differs from its art historical ancestors in that it is not a specific movement or style, but rather a way of defining a new social order. Thousands of existing social practice projects across the world have taken vastly different approaches to their combination of publics, methodologies, aesthetics, and environments, yet these projects all share an aesthetic of human interaction and development. The end products of such works are not commodities, but rather processes for constructive social change. Some foundational characteristics of socially engaged art remain consistently relevant to a diverse range of works. For an artist or producer to create a successful social practice work, they must consider the unique context in which they are working, and identify specific characteristics of the community and environment. They must also balance aesthetic and methodology in their work, align the timeline of a project with its purpose: a quick-impact ephemeral work, or the regularity of a longitudinal work. \n\nSocial practice artists and producers aim to affect their community and environment in a real (rather than symbolic) way that enables social and political change. Each project is tailored to the community and environment in which it will take place. In social practice the identification of the public, or audience, precedes the project's development. It is impossible to create a project founded upon engagement and collaboration without first making assumptions as to who will be involved. \"Who\" the artist or producer wishes to engage and \"where\" they wish to engage are therefore core characteristics of socially engaged art. \n\nEnvironment could be described on two primary levels: the broader community, city, or region; and the immediate space being occupied – a street, museum, studio, or other area. To understand the context in which they are working, artists and producers must develop relationships with individuals, organizations and institutions that intersect many different parts of their community and environment. One theorist makes the comparison between socially engaged art projects to exotic fruit, stating that both “usually travel poorly when “exported” to other locations to be replicated.” The community and environment are therefore not merely external influencers on a specific project – they are inherent characteristics.\n\nFor much of art history, a work's aesthetic has been upheld as the primary measure of its quality. The 20 century broadened the public understanding of art to consider concept and process alongside aesthetic, and by the new millennium the tables had turned to emphasize process over product: one of the defining characteristics of socially engaged art. Process is determined by method; thus social practice producers and artists are often more concerned with the methodology rather than the aesthetic of their work. Many argue that social practice has created a new aesthetic of its own: an aesthetic of human interaction and development that is based not on spectatorship but on participation. This aesthetic captures the diverse methods employed by socially engaged art and encompasses not only traditional methods of painting, photography, architecture, and performance; but also nontraditional forms borrowed from other disciplines, such as festivals, conferences, schools, and protests. \n\nAesthetics are typically hierarchical, highly subjective, and greatly determined by external influencers, such as the imagery of a given culture, or the relationship between appearance and market value. To escape these external influencers, aesthetics can also be defined in terms of “aesthesis,” an autonomous realm of experience and judgment that cannot be reduced to logic, reason or morality but is of great importance to humankind. Aesthetics have the capacity to critique our beliefs and values by restructuring our perception of the world. Their application can achieve one of the core aims of socially engaged art: the definition of a new social order characterized by engagement and participation.\n\nMethodology in socially engaged art refers to the set of practices used throughout the process and production of a project. The method is no longer a means to an end, but an end within itself: the experience of creation and experimentation is a central element of social practice. While aesthetics reframe ideas and beliefs outside of the disciplines in which we have accepted them, methodology takes the frameworks of those disciplines to produce new aesthetics. Socially engaged art has embraced conferences, urban regeneration projects, pedagogical projects, and protests, which are all frameworks borrowed from other disciplines.\n\nWhile aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Methodology will engage the public, but aesthetics will play a large role in determining how a project is interpreted.\nWhile aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Ultimately, the two can work together to enhance each other: the aesthetic value of a project can increase its social function, while the method can heighten the aesthetic experience through public engagement.\n\nThe method and aesthetic adopted in social practice work is greatly influenced by intended timeline. Length determines the type of social and/or political change the artist aims to achieve, the types of dialogue created, and the ways in which an individual can engage with a work. The length of a project is also extremely situational. Some projects aim to have an immediate impact, while others prefer to build relationships that foster change over an extended period.\n\nEphemeral projects are typically characterized by temporary gatherings and occupation of space. They create situations in which social interactions are momentary and not expected to become long-lasting. The immediate impact of ephemeral works often means they take place around a particular issue or concept. Protests, festivals, conferences, or pop-up performances have all been used as mediums for ephemeral social practice work.\n\nLongitudinal projects are those built upon regular and reoccurring social interactions and dialogue, organized with the intention to be sustained over a longer period. They typically occupy the same space, and are characterized by deeper partnerships and relationships that are gradually built over the course of the work’s existence. As a result, many long-term social practice projects include a pedagogical element in their work. Classes, urban regeneration work, schools, or institutional partnerships are all examples of longitudinal projects.\n\nMuch social practice has taken place in the gap between the public and cultural institutions, which has been identified and acted upon as a new site for artistic intervention. However institutions, such as museums, foundations, non-profit organizations, and universities all play a significant role in supporting and amplifying social practice work. Many institutions constitute an extension of the public sphere, regardless of whether they are public or private in their ownership and operation. Partnerships between socially engaged art and contemporary institutions have thus widened the public sphere, and provided mutual benefits to the institution, the community, those engaged in the project, and the producers.\n\nIn the traditional art world, market value and a work's collectability are deeply intertwined. This has posed a challenge to socially engaged artists seeking museum and gallery support, since many works go against the capitalist market to challenge traditional collecting practices. As a result, many socially engaged artists and producers must look elsewhere for support. The expansion of the art world in the 21 century has seen the emergence of alternative supports, such as non-profit organizations and the ever-growing biennale network. Other partners include art fairs, or commissions and residencies associated with universities, foundations, and urban regeneration. Artists and producers have also formed their own means of support, as artist-run exhibition spaces, journals and blogs demonstrate.\n\nUniversities often partner with producers, artists and theorists of socially engaged art. These relationships offer mutual benefits for both academic institutions and artists. Universities offer artists employment security, the support and validation often required for establishing grant-based and corporate partnerships, and access to a high interdisciplinary environment that not only accepts, but encourages, experimentation. Artists in turn provide knowledge, skills and research to support individuals and broader programs within the university. As producers and scholars, they generate both new theory and new practice for the field of socially engaged art.\n\nExhibitions of social practice art often include multiple artists or art collectives, and rather than exhibiting art objects, the artist’s participatory role in their work as well as their collaboration with the public becomes the exhibition. Several conferences are held nationally and internationally to bring together artists and academics involved in the field. They have featured installation, performance art, film, dance, art talks, forums, and gallery exhibitions.\n\n\n"}

Symmetry is a type of invariance: the property that something does not change under a set of transformations.\n\nGiven a structured object \"X\" of any sort, a symmetry is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases; for example, if \"X\" is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a bijective map from the set to itself, giving rise to permutation groups. If the object \"X\" is a set of points in the plane with its metric structure or any other metric space, a symmetry is a bijection of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an isometry).\n\nIn general, every kind of structure in mathematics will have its own kind of symmetry, many of which are listed in the given points mentioned above.\n\nThe types of symmetry considered in basic geometry (like reflection and rotation symmetry) are described more fully in the main article on symmetry.\n\nLet \"f\"(\"x\") be a real-valued function of a real variable. Then \"f\" is even if the following equation holds for all \"x\" and \"-x\" in the domain of \"f\":\n\nGeometrically speaking, the graph face of an even function is symmetric with respect to the \"y\"-axis, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the \"y\"-axis.\n\nExamples of even functions are x, \"x\", \"x\", cos(\"x\"), and cosh(\"x\").\n\nAgain, let \"f\"(\"x\") be a real-valued function of a real variable. Then \"f\" is odd if the following equation holds for all \"x\" and \"-x\" in the domain of \"f\":\n\nor\n\nGeometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry with respect to the origin, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.\n\nExamples of odd functions are \"x\", \"x\", sin(\"x\"), sinh(\"x\"), and erf(\"x\").\n\nThe integral of an odd function from −\"A\" to +\"A\" is zero (where \"A\" is finite, and the function has no vertical asymptotes between −\"A\" and \"A\").\n\nThe integral of an even function from −\"A\" to +\"A\" is twice the integral from 0 to +\"A\" (where \"A\" is finite, and the function has no vertical asymptotes between −\"A\" and \"A\". This also holds true when \"A\" is infinite, but only if the integral converges).\n\n\nIn linear algebra, a symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. Formally, matrix \"A\" is symmetric if\n\nBy the definition of matrix equality, which requires that the entries in all corresponding positions be equal, equal matrices must have the same dimensions (matrices of different sizes or shapes cannot be equal). Consequently, only square matrices can be symmetric.\n\nThe entries of a symmetric matrix are symmetric with respect to the main diagonal. So if the entries are written as \"A\" = (\"a\"), then \"a\" = a, for all indices \"i\" and \"j\".\n\nThe following 3×3 matrix is symmetric:\n\nEvery square diagonal matrix is symmetric, since all off-diagonal entries are zero. Similarly, each diagonal element of a skew-symmetric matrix must be zero, since each is its own negative.\n\nIn linear algebra, a real symmetric matrix represents a self-adjoint operator over a real inner product space. The corresponding object for a complex inner product space is a Hermitian matrix with complex-valued entries, which is equal to its conjugate transpose. Therefore, in linear algebra over the complex numbers, it is often assumed that a symmetric matrix refers to one which has real-valued entries. Symmetric matrices appear naturally in a variety of applications, and typical numerical linear algebra software makes special accommodations for them.\n\nThe symmetric group \"S\" on a finite set of \"n\" symbols is the group whose elements are all the permutations of the \"n\" symbols, and whose group operation is the composition of such permutations, which are treated as bijective functions from the set of symbols to itself. Since there are \"n\"! (\"n\" factorial) possible permutations of a set of \"n\" symbols, it follows that the order (the number of elements) of the symmetric group \"S\" is \"n\"!.\n\nA symmetric polynomial is a polynomial \"P\"(\"X\", \"X\", …, \"X\") in \"n\" variables, such that if any of the variables are interchanged, one obtains the same polynomial. Formally, \"P\" is a \"symmetric polynomial\", if for any permutation σ of the subscripts 1, 2, ..., \"n\" one has \"P\"(\"X\", \"X\", …, \"X\") = \"P\"(\"X\", \"X\", …, \"X\").\n\nSymmetric polynomials arise naturally in the study of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every \"symmetric\" polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nIn two variables \"X\", \"X\" one has symmetric polynomials like\nand in three variables \"X\", \"X\", \"X\" one has for instance\n\nIn mathematics, a symmetric tensor is tensor that is invariant under a permutation of its vector arguments:\nfor every permutation σ of the symbols {1,2...,\"r\"}.\nAlternatively, an \"r\" order symmetric tensor represented in coordinates as a quantity with \"r\" indices satisfies\n\nThe space of symmetric tensors of rank \"r\" on a finite-dimensional vector space is naturally isomorphic to the dual of the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree \"r\" on \"V\". Over fields of characteristic zero, the graded vector space of all symmetric tensors can be naturally identified with the symmetric algebra on \"V\". A related concept is that of the antisymmetric tensor or alternating form. Symmetric tensors occur widely in engineering, physics and mathematics.\n\nGiven a polynomial, it may be that some of the roots are connected by various algebraic equations. For example, it may be that for two of the roots, say \"A\" and \"B\", that . The central idea of Galois theory is to consider those permutations (or rearrangements) of the roots having the property that \"any\" algebraic equation satisfied by the roots is \"still satisfied\" after the roots have been permuted. An important proviso is that we restrict ourselves to algebraic equations whose coefficients are rational numbers. Thus, Galois theory studies the symmetries inherent in algebraic equations.\n\nIn abstract algebra, an automorphism is an isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself. It is, in some sense, a symmetry of the object, and a way of mapping the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group, called the automorphism group. It is, loosely speaking, the symmetry group of the object.\n\n\nIn quantum mechanics, bosons have representatives that are symmetric under permutation operators, and fermions have antisymmetric representatives.\n\nThis implies the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions. In fact, the Pauli exclusion principle with a single-valued many-particle wavefunction is equivalent to requiring the wavefunction to be antisymmetric. An antisymmetric two-particle state is represented as a sum of states in which one particle is in state formula_11 and the other in state formula_12:\n\nand antisymmetry under exchange means that . This implies that , which is Pauli exclusion. It is true in any basis, since unitary changes of basis keep antisymmetric matrices antisymmetric, although strictly speaking, the quantity is not a matrix but an antisymmetric rank-two tensor.\n\nConversely, if the diagonal quantities are zero \"in every basis\", then the wavefunction component:\n\nis necessarily antisymmetric. To prove it, consider the matrix element:\n\nThis is zero, because the two particles have zero probability to both be in the superposition state formula_16. But this is equal to\n\nThe first and last terms on the right hand side are diagonal elements and are zero, and the whole sum is equal to zero. So the wavefunction matrix elements obey:\n\nor\n\nWe call a relation symmetric if every time the relation stands from A to B, it stands too from B to A.\nNote that symmetry is not the exact opposite of antisymmetry.\n\nAn isometry is a distance-preserving map between metric spaces. Given a metric space, or a set and scheme for assigning distances between elements of the set, an isometry is a transformation which maps elements to another metric space such that the distance between the elements in the new metric space is equal to the distance between the elements in the original metric space. In a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, two geometric figures are congruent if they are related by an isometry: related by either a rigid motion, or a composition of a rigid motion and a reflection. Up to a relation by a rigid motion, they are equal if related by a direct isometry.\n\nIsometries have been used to unify the working definition of symmetry in geometry and for functions, probability distributions, matrices, strings, graphs, etc.\n\nA symmetry of a differential equation is a transformation that leaves the differential equation invariant. Knowledge of such symmetries may help solve the differential equation.\n\nA Line symmetry of a system of differential equations is a continuous symmetry of the system of differential equations. Knowledge of a Line symmetry can be used to simplify an ordinary differential equation through reduction of order.\n\nFor ordinary differential equations, knowledge of an appropriate set of Lie symmetries allows one to explicitly calculate a set of first integrals, yielding a complete solution without integration.\n\nSymmetries may be found by solving a related set of ordinary differential equations. Solving these equations is often much simpler than solving the original differential equations.\n\nIn the case of a finite number of possible outcomes, symmetry with respect to permutations (relabelings) implies a discrete uniform distribution.\n\nIn the case of a real interval of possible outcomes, symmetry with respect to interchanging sub-intervals of equal length corresponds to a continuous uniform distribution.\n\nIn other cases, such as \"taking a random integer\" or \"taking a random real number\", there are no probability distributions at all symmetric with respect to relabellings or to exchange of equally long subintervals. Other reasonable symmetries do not single out one particular distribution, or in other words, there is not a unique probability distribution providing maximum symmetry.\n\nThere is one type of isometry in one dimension that may leave the probability distribution unchanged, that is reflection in a point, for example zero.\n\nA possible symmetry for randomness with positive outcomes is that the former applies for the logarithm, i.e., the outcome and its reciprocal have the same distribution. However this symmetry does not single out any particular distribution uniquely.\n\nFor a \"random point\" in a plane or in space, one can choose an origin, and consider a probability distribution with circular or spherical symmetry, respectively.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "689785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=689785", "title": "The Accused (1988 film)", "text": "The Accused (1988 film)\n\nThe Accused is a 1988 American legal drama film directed by Jonathan Kaplan, written by Tom Topor and starring Jodie Foster, Kelly McGillis, Bernie Coulson, Leo Rossi, Ann Hearn, Carmen Argenziano, Steve Antin and Tom O'Brien. In the film Sarah Tobias, a young waitress, is gang-raped by three men at a local bar; she and district attorney Kathryn Murphy set out to prosecute the rapists as well as the men who encouraged them.\n\nSet in Washington state, but filmed in Vancouver, Canada, it is loosely based on the 1983 gang rape of Cheryl Araujo in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and the resulting trial, which received national coverage. The film explores the themes of classism, misogyny, Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), slut shaming, victim blaming and women's empowerment.\n\n\"The Accused\" premiered at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival, where it competed for the Golden Bear. It was released in limited theatres on October 14, 1988 by Paramount Pictures and was highly controversial upon release, mostly due to its graphic representation of gang rape. The film became a critical and commercial success grossing over $37 million worldwide, against its $6 million budget. Major praise was drawn towards Foster's performance, marking her breakthrough to adult roles and brought her numerous accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nOn April 18, 1987, at a local bar called \"The Mill\", 24-years old working-class woman Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster) is gang raped by several drunk bar patrons, while onlookers cheer them on. Assistant district attorney Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) is assigned to the rape case. Her superior instructs Murphy to offer a plea bargain with the rape defendants that requires some jail time. They make a plea bargain to charges of reckless endangerment, and are sentenced to prison. Sarah is enraged by the deal, as there is no acknowledgment on the record that the men raped her.\n\nSarah rams a pickup truck after recognizing its driver as one of the patrons from the bar who had been cheering during the rape, and being outraged by his crude proposition of her. Her injuries require hospitalization. After this, Murphy decides to prosecute the men who cheered the rape for criminal solicitation. Sarah's friend Sally, a waitress at the bar where the rape took place, picks three men out of a line-up as those who encouraged the attackers. They get three different defense attorneys for the ensuing trial.\n\nSarah testifies that she was raped. College student Kenneth Joyce (Bernie Coulson), a friend of one of the rapists, testifies to watching the rape before he made a 911 call to notify police. After Murphy's closing statement and a single summation from the three defense lawyers, the jury deliberates for a long time. They ask several times for Joyce's testimony to be reread to them.\n\nIn the end, the jury convicts the three defendants. As the trial provides testimony and evidence that the men raped Sarah, the three men already serving prison time for reckless endangerment are unlikely to be granted parole.\n\nScreenwriter Tom Topor was inspired to write the film after the real trial of Cheryl Araujo became national news. Dawn Steel called him to ask if he'd be interested in doing a movie on the subject and following which Sherry Lansing and Stanley Jaffe from Paramount Pictures, where signed on to produce the film. Topor interviewed 30 rape victims and numerous rapists, prosecutors, defense attorneys and scrub nurses. Jonathan Kaplan met Steel following the dawn of Araujo's trail and discussed the possibility of having a film on the subject. The original draft of the script focused on the lawyer's story while the rape victim was just that — a victim, a prop. Kaplan wanted the rape victim character to be front and center with the lawyer, while the script also had the pool table (similar from the real life incident), but the producers were concerned of being sued, so it was changed to a pinball machine. \n\nFollowing the test screenings, the film received lowest scores in the history of Paramount. According to Lansing, \"The audience thought that Jodie's character deserved the rape.\" The studio executives wanted to put the film on the shelf and were looking for ways to not get it released. Lansing asked for another screening with just women. She got that screening, and it went through the roof. Of the 20 women in the room, 18 had experience with rape — that either they or someone they knew had been raped. When tested again months later, it got among the highest scores in studio's history.\n\nThe casting process of the film was extremely muddling. The studio was looking for a banakable actress who could sell the film. Numerous actresses were considered for the part of Sarah Tobias, including; Valerie Bertinelli, Jennifer Grey, Meg Ryan, Mia Sara, Annabeth Gish, Joan Cusack, Jennifer Beals, Alyssa Milano, Uma Thurman, Ally Sheedy and Kelly Preston but all of them rejected it due to the film's gruesome and controversial themes. Foster, who had recently graduated from Yale and didn't make any successful film during her time at school, wasn't the fruitful choice for the producers. Following numerous auditions as well as rejection from various established actresses, she was finally cast in the part.\nJane Fonda was initially attached to play Kathryn Murphy but left the project as she found the script exploitative and poorly written. Ellen Barkin, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver, Debra Winger, Meryl Streep and Geena Davis were also considered for the part. Kelly McGillis, who just came off \"Top Gun\" (1987) was cast for the bankable prospects of the film. McGillis was initially offered to play Sarah but declined, citing her personal experience. \nShe acknowledged at the time of film's release that she had survived an attack and rape, in 1982. Based on her experience, she took on the role of Murphy. Brad Pitt auditioned for the part of Ken Joyce.\n\nFoster viewed the film as a last ditch effort to give her acting career a much needed boost. She had taken a sabbatical from Hollywood to attend Yale, which was prolonged due to John Hinckley's assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan (which he carried out as a means to impress Foster with whom he had obsessed after seeing her in \"Taxi Driver\") in March 1981. After recovering from the media frenzy surrounding her following the incident, she had experienced a bit of a dry spell upon her return to acting. Most of her films had a lukewarm response both with critics and at the box office. She stated that she would have retired from acting had \"The Accused\" followed suit. Ultimately, the film's success revitalised her career.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"The Accused\" began on April 22, 1987 and concluded on June 2, 1987. Although set in Washington state, it was filmed in Vancouver, Canada. The gang rape scene was highly controversial at the time of its release, as being the longest, most graphic and boldest representation of the assault in cinematic history. It took five days to complete and the filming was a difficult experience for the cast and crew involved. Everyone felt protective of Foster and worried how traumatic the situation could be for her. In an interview, Foster explained that the rape scene was meticulously rehearsed beforehand, so there would be no unpleasant surprises for anyone involved in the actual scene. She herself has admitted that she does not remember filming the scene and completely blacked-out and broke blood vessels in her right eye from crying during shooting of the scene. Contrarily, the male actors were overwhelmingly upset. Leo Rossi (who played Cliff \"Scorpion\" Albrect, the by-stander), recalled the experience of Woody Brown (who played Danny, one of the rapists), following the filming of the scene, being bolted and throwing up in his trailer. \"Complex\" ranked the rape scene from the film #16 on its list of \"The 53 Most Hard-To-Watch Scenes in Movie History\".\n\n\"The Accused\" was released in limited theatres in North America on October 14, 1988. Although it was supposed to be released in April, it was deferred to October due to Writers Guild of America's strike. The film premiered at the 39th Berlin International Film Festival in 1989, where it competed for the Golden Bear .\n\nIn its opening weekend in North America, \"The Accused\" was #1 at the box office, grossing $4.3 million in 796 theaters. The film grossed a total of $37.07 million worldwide, against a $6 million budget becoming a major commercial success.\n\n\"The Accused\" received positive reviews from critics upon release with major acclaim drawn towards Foster's performance.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 95% based on 20 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads : \"Simultaneously gut-wrenching and provocative, \"The Accused\" provides with a harrowing and haunting rape drama, layered by an outstanding performance by Jodie Foster\". On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 65 out of 100 indicating \"generally favourable reviews\".\n\nIn a positive review, writing of the two criminal prosecutions in the film, Roger Ebert finds that the lesson of the trial \"may be the most important message this movie has to offer...that verbal sexual harassment, whether crudely in a saloon back room or subtly in an everyday situation, is a form of violence - one that leaves no visible marks but can make its victims feel unable to move freely and casually in society. It is a form of imprisonment.\" Rob Beattie from \"Empire\", gave the film five out of five stars, calling it phenomenal and called the controversial rape scene \"devastating, harrowing and utterly convincing\". Judy Steed from \"The Globe and Mail\" said about the film; \"An experience that is sometimes unbearable and always riveting\". Vincent Canby from \"The New York Times\" said: \"A consistently engrossing melodrama, modest in its aims and as effective for the cliches it avoids as for the clear eye through which it sees its working-class American lives\".\n\nMarjorie Heins, in the 1998 book \"The V-Chip Debate: Content Filtering from Television to the Internet\", said that educators worried that the film would \"receive V ratings and be subject to at least a presumption against curricular use in many public schools.\"\n\nAt the 61st Academy Awards, Foster won the award for Best Actress. This was the film's only nomination, thus marking the first occurrence since 1961 (when Sophia Loren won for \"Two Women\") that the winner of the aforementioned category won for a film with a single nomination. In 2006, Foster's performance as Sarah Tobias was ranked #56 on \"Premiere's\" 100 Greatest Film Performances of all-time.\n\n\n\n"}

Yves Bonnefoy writes that it was \"certainly inspired by Hölderlin.\" According to Glenn Magee, most Hegel scholars assume that Hegel is the author of the document.\n\nSchelling, Hegel, and Hölderlin were classmates and roommates at Tübinger Stift, the seminary of the University of Tübingen at the time, and are collectively known as the \"Tübingen Three\".

Jason Josephson-Storm has interpreted the essay as a source on Hegel's view of myth, especially Hegel's perception (in line with other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German philosophers) that myth has disappeared and left a cultural vacuum, which Josephson-Storm argues anticipates the idea of disenchantment.\n\n"}
{"id": "44237394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44237394", "title": "The Perfect Moment", "text": "The Perfect Moment\n\nThe Perfect Moment was the most comprehensive retrospective of works by New York photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. The show spanned twenty-five years of his career, featuring celebrity portraits, self-portraits, interracial figure studies, floral still lifes, homoerotic images, and collages. The exhibition, organized by Janet Kardon of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in Philadelphia, opened in the winter of 1988 just months before Mapplethorpe’s death from AIDS complications on March 9, 1989. On tour, in the summer of 1989, the exhibition became the centerpiece of a controversy concerning federal funding of the arts and censorship.\n\n\"The Perfect Moment\" covered all aspects of the photographer’s career from the late 1960s to 1988. The traveling exhibition had been scheduled to appear at five other museums in various regions of the country during the next year and a half. It included more than 150 images. Despite the controversial character of some of the photographs, critical response was enthusiastic and attendance was robust throughout the show's Philadelphia run (from December 1988 through January 1989).\n\n\"The Perfect Moment\" traveled to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. Again, it generated no unfavorable public or critical attention. In June 1989, after the cancellation of the exhibition by the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., two and a half weeks before it was to open there, \"The Perfect Moment\" unexpectedly provoked national controversy and ICA became a key player in the congressional debate over what public funds should and should not fund. The issues of censorship and artistic freedom that the show raised occupied the forefront of the debates between conservatives and liberals during the Ronald Reagan era and in its aftermath. Members of the religious right, especially, criticized academics and artists for what they regarded as their indecent, subversive and blasphemous works. \n\n\"The Perfect Moment\" grouped photos into three categories: \n\nRobert Mapplethorpe’s XYZ portfolios, explored three subjects: homosexual sadomasochism (X); flower still lifes (Y); and nude portraits of African American men (Z). The extremely graphic S&M photos from Mapplethorpe’s X Portfolio were displayed in a separate, age-restricted area during at each venue of the exhibition. The portfolios were displayed with a series of poems by poet and singer Patti Smith. The poems echo Mapplethorpe's X,Y,Z trope.\n\nThe images that sparked the most controversy include:\nRosie, a black and white portrait of a very young girl crouched down on a bench outdoors with part of her dress lifted, exposing her genitals, generated controversy because of the subject's age and the issue of consent. This photograph was deemed child pornography by Mapplethorpe's detractors, and it is surprising that it was featured in the exhibition catalogue, considering that the printer had refused to print it for the Mapplethorpe retrospective at the Whitney Museum of Art in 1988. There was one other photograph of a naked child, \"Jessie McBride\" which also contributed to the controversy created by \"Rosie\". \nA 55-minute videotape of a BBC interview with the photographer accompanied the exhibition.\n\nThe art critics in Philadelphia, the show's first venue, critiqued Mapplethorpe's work along formalist lines, without commenting on the provocative content of the X portfolio photographs. Overall, the exhibition was met enthusiastically by critics both Philadelphia and in Chicago, where the show appeared at the Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nHowever, a campaign launched by the American Family Association, a conservative watchdog group, to censor what they considered “indecent” art changed the climate of reception. In June 12, 1989 Christina Orr-Cahall, the director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, cancelled “The Perfect Moment,” which was scheduled to open there on June 30. Orr-Cahall feared that \"The Perfect Moment\" would endanger National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) appropriations in the United States Congress.\n\nThe exhibition set off one of the fiercest episodes of America's \"culture wars\" — and sparked a recurring debate about state-funded cultural production and the support of sexually explicit or sacrilegious art by public funds.\n\nThe canceling of the \"Perfect Moment\" provoked a censorship battle about national funding for the arts that was front page news for the next year.\n\nOn June 30, 1989, protesters angered by the cancellation of the show by the Corcoran Gallery projected slides of Mapplethorpe’s photographs on the facade of the museum. Seven hundred people rallied to express their outrage about the Corcoran's decision. Michael Brenson, art critic for the \"New York Times\" wrote, “This exhibit should be seen. It is extremely unfortunate that the Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled it last month in the hope of averting a political outcry…. As much as he has been made out to be a renegade and outlaw, Mapplethorpe is an utterly mainstream artist. He loved freshness and glamor and was obsessed with the moment, which his photographs always reflect. In his restricted spaces and his feeling for abstraction and attentiveness to every shape, edge and texture, Mapplethorpe is a child of the Formalism of the 1960’s.\" The Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) stepped in to host the show, and on July 22, 1989, “The Perfect Moment” opened at this alternative art space. No incidents marred the show's run at the Washington Project for the Arts.\n\nHowever, Senator Jesse Helms introduced legislation that would stop the NEA from funding artwork he considered “obscene.” The legislation subsequently required any recipients of NEA funds to sign an oath that declared they would not promote obscenity. The oath provoked protests from artists and arts organizations. When, during the next grant cycle, in this climate of fear, applications for support equaling hundreds of thousands of dollars were rejected. Outraged artists filed lawsuits against the agency. A compromise was reached in Congress. Although the radically restrictive Helms amendment did not pass, restrictions were placed on NEA funding procedures.\n\nIn March 1990, anti-pornography advocates in Cincinnati Ohio, the Citizens for Community Values, launched a campaign to pressure the Contemporary Arts Center (CAC) to cancel “The Perfect Moment.” Cincinnati law enforcement ordered four hundred visitors from the museum to leave while they videotaped Mapplethorpe’s photographs as evidence to support obscenity charges brought against Dennis Barrie, the director of the CAC, and against the CAC. This was the first time a museum in the United States faced prosecution for the art it displayed.\n\nOn October 5, 1990, Dennis Barrie and the CAC were acquitted in the obscenity case. The prosecution failed to convince the jury that Mapplethorpe’s photographs lacked artistic merit. In Cincinnati, more than 80,000 people saw the show. The censorship proceedings doubtless brought more attention to Mapplethorpe's work than it would have otherwise received.\n\nSince the CAC debacle, images from \"The Perfect Moment\", including the X, Y, and Z portfolios, have circulated to in hundreds of exhibitions internationally. Mapplethorpe's work is currently represented by 12 galleries worldwide, with the largest collection of his works at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. These photographs and history of their attempted censorship during the 1990s have influenced artists, inspired LGBTQ advocates, and generated much scholarship.\n\n"}
{"id": "855241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=855241", "title": "Troilus and Criseyde", "text": "Troilus and Criseyde\n\nTroilus and Criseyde () is an epic poem by Geoffrey Chaucer which re-tells in Middle English the tragic story of the lovers Troilus and Criseyde set against a backdrop of war during the Siege of Troy. It was composed using \"rime royale\" and probably completed during the mid 1380s. Many Chaucer scholars regard it as the poet's finest work. As a finished long poem it is more self-contained than the better known but ultimately unfinished \"Canterbury Tales.\" This poem is often considered the source of the phrase: \"all good things must come to an end\" (3.615).\n\nAlthough Troilus is a character from Ancient Greek literature, the expanded story of him as a lover was of Medieval origin. The first known version is from Benoît de Sainte-Maure's poem \"Roman de Troie\", but Chaucer's principal source appears to have been Boccaccio who re-wrote the tale in his \"Il Filostrato\". Chaucer attributes the story to a \"Lollius\" (whom he also mentions in \"The House of Fame\"), although no writer with this name is known. Chaucer's version can be said to reflect a less cynical and less misogynistic world-view than Boccaccio's, casting Criseyde as fearful and sincere rather than simply fickle and having been led astray by the eloquent and perfidious Pandarus. It also inflects the sorrow of the story with humour.\n\nThe poem had an important legacy for later writers. Robert Henryson's Scots poem \"The Testament of Cresseid\" imagined a tragic fate for Criseyde not given by Chaucer. In historical editions of the English \"Troilus and Criseyde\", Henryson's distinct and separate work was sometimes included without accreditation as an \"epilogue\" to Chaucer's tale. Other texts, for example John Metham's \"Amoryus and Cleopes\" (c. 1449), adapt language and authorship strategies from the famous predecessor poem. Shakespeare's tragedy \"Troilus and Cressida\", although much blacker in tone, was also based in part on the material.\n\n\"Troilus and Criseyde\" is usually considered to be a courtly romance, although the generic classification is an area of significant debate in most Middle English literature. It is part of the Matter of Rome cycle, a fact which Chaucer emphasizes.\n\n\nCalchas, a soothsayer, foresees the fall of Troy and abandons the city in favour of the Greeks; his daughter, Criseyde, receives some ill will on account of her father's betrayal. Troilus, a warrior of Troy, publicly mocks love and is punished by the God of Love by being struck with irreconcilable desire for Criseyde, whom he sees passing through the temple. With the help of sly Pandarus, Criseyde's uncle, Troilus and Criseyde begin to exchange letters. Eventually, Pandarus develops a plan to urge the two into bed together; Troilus swoons when he thinks the plan is going amiss, but Pandarus and Criseyde revive him. Pandarus leaves, and Troilus and Criseyde spend a night of bliss together. Calchas eventually persuades the Greeks to exchange a prisoner of war, Antenor, for his daughter Criseyde. Hector, of Troy, objects; as does Troilus, although he does not voice his concern. Troilus speaks to Criseyde and suggests they elope but she offers a logical argument as to why it would not be practical. Criseyde promises to deceive her father and return to Troy after ten days; Troilus leaves her with a sense of foreboding. Upon arriving in the Greek camp, Criseyde realizes the unlikeliness of her being able to keep her promise to Troilus. She writes dismissively in response to his letters and on the tenth day accepts a meeting with Diomede, and listens to him speak of love. Later, she accepts him as a lover. Pandarus and Troilus wait for Criseyde: Pandarus sees that she will not return and eventually Troilus realizes this as well. Troilus curses Fortune, even more so because he still loves Criseyde; Pandarus offers some condolences. The narrator, with an apology for giving women a bad name, bids farewell to his book, and briefly recounts Troilus's death in battle and his ascent to the eighth sphere, draws a moral about the transience of earthly joys and the inadequacy of paganism, dedicates his poem to Gower and Strode, asks the protection of the Trinity, and prays that we be worthy of Christ's mercy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "435180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435180", "title": "Unreliable narrator", "text": "Unreliable narrator\n\nAn unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility has been seriously compromised. The term was coined in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth in \"The Rhetoric of Fiction\". While unreliable narrators are almost by definition first-person narrators, arguments have been made for the existence of unreliable second- and third-person narrators, especially within the context of film and television, although sometimes also in literature.\n\nSometimes the narrator's unreliability is made immediately evident. For instance, a story may open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or the story itself may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider their point of view and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to wonder how much the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.\n\nAttempts have been made at a classification of unreliable narrators. William Riggan analysed in a 1981 study discernible types of unreliable narrators, focusing on the first-person narrator as this is the most common kind of unreliable narration. Adapted from his findings is the following list:\n\n\nIt remains a matter of debate whether and how a non-first-person narrator can be unreliable, though the deliberate restriction of information to the audience can provide instances of unreliable \"narrative\", even if not necessarily of an unreliable \"narrator\". For example, in the three interweaving plays of Alan Ayckbourn's \"The Norman Conquests\", each confines the action to one of three locations during the course of a weekend.\n\nWayne C. Booth was the earliest to formulate a reader-centered approach to unreliable narration and to distinguish between a reliable and unreliable narrator on the grounds of whether the narrator's speech violates or conforms with general norms and values. He writes, \"I have called a narrator \"reliable\" when he speaks for or acts in accordance with the norms of the work (which is to say the implied author's norms), \"unreliable\" when he does not.\" Peter J. Rabinowitz criticized Booth's definition for relying too much on facts external to the narrative, such as norms and ethics, which must necessarily be tainted by personal opinion. He consequently modified the approach to unreliable narration.\n\nRabinowitz' main focus is the status of fictional discourse in opposition to factuality. He debates the issues of truth in fiction, bringing forward four types of audience who serve as receptors of any given literary work:\n\n\nRabinowitz suggests that \"In the proper reading of a novel, then, events which are portrayed must be treated as both 'true' and 'untrue' at the same time. Although there are many ways to understand this duality, I propose to analyze the four audiences which it generates.\" Similarly, Tamar Yacobi has proposed a model of five criteria ('integrating mechanisms') which determine if a narrator is unreliable. Instead of relying on the device of the implied author and a text-centered analysis of unreliable narration, Ansgar Nünning gives evidence that narrative unreliability can be reconceptualized in the context of frame theory and of readers' cognitive strategies.\n\nUnreliable Narration in this view becomes purely a reader's strategy of making sense of a text, i.e. of reconciling discrepancies in the narrator's account (cf. signals of unreliable narration). Nünning thus effectively eliminates the reliance on value judgments and moral codes which are always tainted by personal outlook and taste. Greta Olson recently debated both Nünning's and Booth's models, revealing discrepancies in their respective views.\n\nand offers \"... an update of Booth's model by making his implicit differentiation between fallible and untrustworthy narrators explicit.\" Olson then argues \"... that these two types of narrators elicit different responses in readers and are best described using scales for fallibility and untrustworthiness.\" She proffers that all fictional texts that employ the device of unreliability can best be considered along a spectrum of fallibility that begins with trustworthiness and ends with unreliability. This model allows for all shades of grey in between the poles of trustworthiness and unreliability. It is consequently up to each individual reader to determine the credibility of a narrator in a fictional text.\n\nWhichever definition of unreliability one follows, there are a number of signs that constitute or at least hint at a narrator's unreliability. Nünning has suggested to divide these signals into three broad categories.\n\n\nOne of the earliest uses of unreliability in literature is in \"The Frogs\" by Aristophanes. After the god Dionysus claims to have sunk 12 or 13 enemy ships with Cleisthenes, his slave Xanthias says \"Then I woke up.\" A more well-known version is in Plautus' comedy \"Miles Gloriosus\" (3rd–2nd centuries BC), which features a soldier who constantly embellishes his accomplishments while his slave Artotrogus, in asides, claims the stories are untrue and he is only backing them up to get fed.\n\nThe literary device of the \"unreliable narrator\" was used in several medieval fictional Arabic tales of the \"One Thousand and One Nights\", also known as the \"Arabian Nights\". In one tale, \"The Seven Viziers\", a courtesan accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the Biblical/Qur'anic story of Joseph). The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate suspense in another \"Arabian Nights\" tale, \"The Three Apples\", an early murder mystery. At one point of the story, two men claim to be the murderer, one of whom is revealed to be lying. At another point in the story, in a flashback showing the reasons for the murder, it is revealed that an unreliable narrator convinced the man of his wife's infidelity, thus leading to her murder.\n\nAnother early example of unreliable narration is Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\". In \"The Merchant's Tale\" for example, the narrator, being unhappy in his marriage, allows his bias to slant much of his tale. In the prologue to \"The Wife of Bath\", the Wife often makes inaccurate quotations and incorrectly remembers stories.\n\nA controversial example of an unreliable narrator occurs in Agatha Christie's novel \"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\", where the narrator hides essential truths in the text (mainly through evasion, omission, and obfuscation) without ever overtly lying. Many readers at the time felt that the plot twist at the climax of the novel was nevertheless unfair. Christie used the concept again in her 1967 novel \"Endless Night\". The same technique was employed (baldly) in William Makepeace Thackeray's 1847–8 serial and novel \"Vanity Fair\"—one of the few examples of an unreliable authorial narrator in the English novel—where he admits passing over the worst of Becky's misdeeds in silence while providing enough allusions and clues (including in the content and captions of the illustrations, also done by Thackeray) to show the way to those interested in them; even their accuracy, however, is made dubious by his admission that he learned the story second-hand from the diplomat Tapeworm. The Norwegian crime writer Sven Elvestad's 1909 \"The Iron Wagon\" is another early example of the trope.\n\nSimilar unreliable narrators often appear in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader in order to preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's \"The Golden Rendezvous\" and John Grisham's \"The Racketeer\"). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably \"The Killer Inside Me\", \"Savage Night\", \"A Hell of a Woman\", and \"Pop. 1280\".\n\nMany novels are narrated by children, whose inexperience can impair their judgment and make them unreliable. In \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1884), Huck's innocence leads him to make overly charitable judgments about the characters in the novel.\n\nKen Kesey's two most famous novels feature unreliable narrators. \"Chief\" Bromden in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" has schizophrenia, and his telling of the events often includes things such as people growing or shrinking, walls oozing with slime, or the orderlies kidnapping and \"curing\" Santa Claus. Narration in \"Sometimes a Great Notion\" switches between several of the main characters, whose bias tends to switch the reader's sympathies from one person to another, especially in the rivalry between main character Leland and Hank Stamper. Many of Susan Howatch's novels similarly use this technique; each chapter is narrated by a different character, and only after reading chapters by each of the narrators does the reader realize each of the narrators has biases and \"blind spots\" that cause him or her to perceive shared experiences differently.\n\nThe technique is often employed by Vladimir Nabokov. Humbert Humbert, the main character and narrator of Nabokov's \"Lolita\", often tells the story in such a way as to justify his hebephilia (fixation on young girls), in particular his sexual relationship with his 12-year-old stepdaughter. In Nabokov's \"Pale Fire,\" the reliability, sanity and intentions of the narrator, Charles Kinbote, is one of the central themes of the novel. \n\nThe narrator of A. M. Homes' \"The End of Alice\" deliberately withholds the full story of the crime that put him in prison—the rape and subsequent murder of a young girl—until the end of the novel.\n\nIn some instances, unreliable narration can bring about the fantastic in works of fiction. In Kingsley Amis' \"The Green Man\", for example, the unreliability of the narrator Maurice Allington destabilizes the boundaries between reality and the fantastic. The same applies to Nigel Williams's \"Witchcraft\". \"An Instance of the Fingerpost\" by Iain Pears also employs several points of view from narrators whose accounts are found to be unreliable and in conflict with each other.\n\nMike Engleby, the narrator of Sebastian Faulks' \"Engleby\", leads the reader to believe a version of events of his life that is shown to be increasingly at odds with reality.\n\nZeno Cosini, the narrator of Italo Svevo's \"Zeno's Conscience\", is a typical example of unreliable narrator: in fact the novel is presented as a diary of Zeno himself, who unintentionally distorts the facts to justify his faults. His psychiatrist, who publishes the diary, claims in the introduction that it's a mix of truths and lies.\n\nPi Patel, the narrator of Yann Martel's 2001 novel \"Life of Pi\" tells two conflicting versions of his story. After spending many days adrift at sea, he recounts a fanciful story in which he shared his lifeboat with a zebra, orangutan, hyena (which killed the zebra and orangutan), and tiger (which killed the hyena). When they question his story, he provides a darker, but more plausible recounting of events, in which a sailor and Pi's mother are murdered by the ship's cook, whom Pi then kills and eats to survive. The rescuers notice that the animals in the first story could be allegories for the people in the second one. Pi points out that neither story is provable and both have the same outcome, and the rescuers choose to believe the story featuring the animals, because it is a \"better\" story.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of the use of an unreliable narrator in film is the German expressionist film \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\", from 1920. In this film, an epilogue to the main story is a twist ending revealing that Francis, through whose eyes we see the action, is a patient in an insane asylum, and the flashback which forms the majority of the film is simply his mental delusion.\n\nThe 1945 film noir \"Detour\" is told from the perspective of an unreliable protagonist who may be trying to justify his actions.\n\nIn \"Possessed\" (1947), Joan Crawford plays a woman who is taken to a psychiatric hospital in a state of shock. She gradually tells the story of how she came to be there to her doctors, which is related to the audience in flashbacks, some of which are later revealed to be hallucinations or distorted by paranoia.\n\nIn \"Rashômon\" (1950), a Japanese crime drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa, adapted from \"In a Grove\" (1921), uses multiple narrators to tell the story of the death of a samurai. Each of the witnesses describe the same basic events but differ wildly in the details, alternately claiming that the samurai died by accident, suicide, or murder. The term \"Rashômon effect\" is used to describe how different witnesses are able to produce contradictory accounts of the same event, though each version is presented with equal sincerity and each is plausible when considered independently of the others. The film does not select the \"authentic\" narrator from the differing accounts: at its conclusion, all versions remain equally plausible and equally suspect.\n\nThe 1950 Alfred Hitchcock film \"Stage Fright\" (1950) uses the device of unreliable narration by presenting the aftermath of a murder in a flashback, as told by the murderer. The details of the flashback provide an explanation which helps convince the innocent main protagonist of the film to help the murderer, believing him innocent.\n\nIn the film \"Forrest Gump\" (1994), the simple-minded title character narrates his life story, demonstrating misunderstandings that are clear to the audience, such as Apple Computer being a \"fruit company\", and that one would get paid for sustaining a \"million-dollar wound\". He states that the father of his beloved Jenny treated her well, not understanding that the man's ongoing kissing and touching of her and her sisters was indicative of sexual abuse.\n\nThe ending of the 1995 film \"The Usual Suspects\" reveals that the narrator had been deceiving another character – and hence the audience – by inventing the events and characters he is describing from whole cloth, and rather than being the weak, humble, and quiet criminal he presents as, is in fact Keyser Söze, the film's fabled crime boss.\n\nIn the 1999 film \"Fight Club\", it is revealed that its protagonist the Narrator has dissociative identity disorder and that some events were fabricated, which means only one of the two main protagonists actually exists, as the other is in the Narrator's mind.\n\nIn the 2001 film \"A Beautiful Mind\", it is eventually revealed that the protagonist has paranoid schizophrenia, and many of the events he witnessed occurred only in his own mind.\n\nIn the 2002 film \"Hero\", the protagonist is identified as an unreliable narrator by the antagonist, who responds by constructing his own alternate version of the false story. In the last part of the film, the protagonist tells the real story, which explains his presence in the current situation.\n\nIn the 2013 film \"The Lone Ranger,\" the narrator Tonto is identified quickly as potentially unreliable by a child attending a 1930s carnival sideshow and questioning him about the origin of the Wild West legend of the Lone Ranger. Tonto's story vaguely follows an alternative version of the story as told in the popular radio dramas and television series, but with novel disclosures of graphic details. Along with the child, the audience is left to make their own judgments about his reliability.\n\nAs a framing device on the sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\", the main character Ted Mosby, in the year 2030, recounts to his son and daughter the events that led him to meeting their mother. Show creator Craig Thomas explicitly said in a 2008 interview that the narrator, \"Future Ted\" (voiced by Bob Saget), is unreliable.\n\nThe 2012-2015 TNT series, \"Perception\" featured a protagonist Daniel Pierce (played by Eric McCormack), a talented but eccentric neuropsychiatrist with schizophrenia who assists the FBI on some of their most complex cases. Much of the plot tension revolves around the viewer being unsure of whether events are actually happening or are just inside the mind of Daniel Pierce.\n\nIn the 2014 Showtime series, \"The Affair\", the storyline is set to two independent and overlapping re-tellings of the events surrounding the affair, neither of which are shown to be completely accurate.\n\nThe 2015 USA Network series \"Mr. Robot\" features an unreliable narrator as the main character and also a plot-device.\n\nCritics have claimed that Yuri Katsuki, the title character in the Japanese anime series \"Yuri on Ice\", is an unreliable narrator due to his anxiety.\n\nThe FX television series \"Legion\" focuses on the mutant David Haller, who suffers from Schizophrenia. Haller's fractured psyche acts as a plot-device, warping Haller's view of the world. Creator Noah Hawley described Haller as an unreliable narrator.\n\nIn Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's \"\", the Joker, who is the villain of the story, reflects on the pitiful life that transformed him into a psychotic murderer. Although the Joker's version of the story is not implausible given overall Joker storylines in the Batman comics, the Joker admits at the end of \"The Killing Joke\" that he is uncertain if it is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It represented some of the best known 20th century entertainers in film, television, and music. During its 109 year tenure it came to be regarded as the \"first great talent agency in show business\".\n\nIn April 2009, WMA announced it would merge with the Endeavor Talent Agency to form William Morris Endeavor which owns Miss Universe.\n\nIn 1898, William Morris (born Zelman Moses), a German Jewish immigrant to the US, posted a cross-hatch trademark above an office door in New York City four \"X's\", representing a W superimposed on an M and went into business as William Morris, Vaudeville Agent. By the time WMA formally incorporated in New York State on January 31, 1918, Morris' son William Morris Jr. and an office boy named Abraham Lastfogel, who, after becoming a talent agent in his own right, entered into a business partnership with Morris Sr.\n\nAs silent film grew into widely viewed entertainment, Morris encouraged his clients to experiment in the new medium. Stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Al Jolson, the Marx Brothers, and Mae West were all represented by the company.\n\nBy 1930, Morris had turned over leadership of the agency to his son and Lastfogel. In 1932, five years after his retirement, William Morris, Sr. died from heart failure. By that time, the Agency had begun the process of relocating from Hollywood and Vine to Canon Drive in Beverly Hills.\n\nThe William Morris Agency attained further industry dominance with the December 1949 acquisition of the Berg-Allenberg Agency. The senior agent in the motion picture department during the 1950s was Mike Zimring.\n\nBy 1965, WMA's Music Department had emerged as an industry powerhouse, representing, among others, the Rolling Stones, Sonny & Cher, the Beach Boys, and the Byrds. Less than 10 years later, in 1973, the Agency's newly established Nashville office provided another significant boost to the operations of William Morris, extending the Agency's reach into country music and beyond.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WMA built the William Morris Plaza located at 150 El Camino Drive, directly across the street from its main building at 151 El Camino. In 1989, WMA acquired the Jim Halsey Company.\n\nIn the early 1990s, WMA's Literary Department announced the largest book-to-screen deal ever inked when it sold the television rights for \"Scarlett\", the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\". In 2000, WMA acquired The Writers Shop, which was owned by Jennifer Rudolph Walsh.\n\nWMA's Miami Beach office opened in 2003, and WMA's Shanghai office opened in 2004. In 2007, the Agency expanded its London music operation, underscoring WMA's continued commitment to the international marketplace. Along with the addition of new personnel, the London office moved into the iconic Centre Point Tower.\n\nIn 2003, a seismic shift occurred in the agency landscape when WMA's SVP and Theatre topper, George Lane, and fellow agent in charge of foreign rights, Michael Cardonick, left WMA to open Creative Artists Agency's New York City office and Theatrical Department.\n\nOn April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were merging to form William Morris Endeavor. Endeavor executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell were widely recognized as the architects of the deal and ultimately took the roles of WME Co-CEOs. Following the official announcement of the merger, nearly 100 WMA employees and former board members were let go. One of those leaving was Jim Wiatt, who came to WMA in 1999 from International Creative Management, where he was Vice-Chairman, in 1999. He had joined WMA as President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and had risen to Board Chairman.\n\nAfter the merger, WMA permanently relocated its offices to the Endeavor building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nThe WMA Agent Training Program, often referred to as the \"mailroom\", was established in the 1940s and is well known for its roster of successful alumni. Since the 1970s the program has been replicated at other talent agencies and studios, many of which were headed by former mailroom trainees. Once accepted, trainees rotate through different departments, starting with the mailroom, before becoming a full-time assistant or coordinator.\n\nWMA's longtime competitor, Creative Artists Agency, was founded in 1975 by Michael Ovitz, Ronald Meyer, William Haber, Michael S. Rosenfeld, and Rowland Perkins, all former WMA agent trainees. David Geffen once called the WMA Agent Training Program \"The Harvard School of Show Business – only better: no grades, no exams, a small stipend and great placement opportunities.\" Graduates from the Training Program were perceived at a high level of prestige within the entertainment industry, because of the caliber of notable alums that have graduated from the program.\n\nFormer Chairman Norman Brokaw became the first mailboy in the Beverly Hills Mailroom at age 15. The Agent Training program still exists today at William Morris Endeavor. It was famously documented in David Rensin's 2003 book, \"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "5390576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5390576", "title": "Young fogey", "text": "Young fogey\n\n\"Young fogey\" is a term humorously applied, in British context, to some younger-generation, rather buttoned-down writers and journalists, such as Simon Heffer, Charles Moore and, for a while, A. N. Wilson. The term is attributed to Alan Watkins writing in 1984 in \"The Spectator\".\n\n\"Young fogey\" is still used to describe conservative young men (aged approximately between 15 and 40) who dress in a vintage style (usually that of the 1920s-1930s, also known as the \"Brideshead\" look (after the influence of the Evelyn Waugh novel \"Brideshead Revisited\"). Young-fogeys tend towards erudite, conservative cultural pursuits, especically art and traditional architecture, rather than sports. The young-fogey style of dress also has some surface similarity with the American preppy style, but is endogenous to the United Kingdom and anglo-centric areas of the British Commonwealth such as Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe movement reached its peak in the 1980s with champions such as A.N. Wilson, Gavin Stamp and John Martin Robinson and a relatively widespread following, but has declined since. Though generally a middle class phenomenon, it had a wider influence on fashions in the 1980s. Young-fogeys are rarely rich or upper class and sometimes make a style virtue of genteel poverty, especially when rescuing old houses. They often combine a conservative cultural outlook with a distate of Conservative political activity. They find feminism perpexing but are often open to bisexuality with men; even firmly heterosexual youg-fogeys have homosocial tendencies. Often religious, their conservative outlook extends to refuting progressive theology.\n\nToday committed young-fogeys may found amongst students at Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, Edinburgh and St Andrews universities; and at some universities in the Commonwealth, notably the University of Melbourne and Sydney. Adherents tend to concentrate in some professions: in particular the antiques and art dealing, residential estate agency, conservative classical architecture practices and certain strata of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. Strongholds of young fogeys include the Oxford University Conservative Association and Trinity College, Cambridge, but they are also seen elsewhere.\n\nIrish broadcaster Ryan Tubridy, who hosts \"The Late Late Show\", has described himself as a \"young fogey\".\n\nBritish Member of Parliament Jacob Rees-Mogg was described as a \"young fogey\" after his 2010 election to Westminster.\n\nBritish writer, editor, and broadcaster Anthony Lejeune was described by \"The Times\" as: \"always out of period, a misfit in the modern world for whom the term 'young fogey' might have been invented\".\n\n\n\n"}
