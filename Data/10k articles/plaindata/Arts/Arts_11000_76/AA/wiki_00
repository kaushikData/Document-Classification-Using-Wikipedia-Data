Western art had been, from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.\n\nAbstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.\n\nAbstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In geometric abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total abstraction are almost mutually exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contains partial abstraction.\n\nBoth geometric abstraction and lyrical abstraction are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous art movements that embody partial abstraction would be for instance fauvism in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and cubism, which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.\n\nMuch of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose. It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates. One can enjoy the beauty of Chinese calligraphy or Islamic calligraphy without being able to read it.\n\nIn Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the Tang dynasty painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style. While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings. The Chan buddhist painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his \"Immortal in splashed ink\" in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to Tiantai buddhism, created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by Sesshu Toyo in his later years.\n\nAnother instance of abstraction in Chinese painting is seen in Zhu Derun's \"Cosmic Circle\". On the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass) floats in the void. The painting is a reflection of the Daoist metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.\nIn Tokugawa Japan some zen monk-painters created Enso, a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. Usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.\n\nPatronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.\n\nThree art movements which contributed to the development of abstract art were Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An \"objective interest in what is seen\", can be discerned from the paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the \"plein air\" painting of the Barbizon school.\n\nEarly intimations of a new art had been made by James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting \"\", (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.\n\nExpressionist painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to Impressionism and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like Edvard Munch and James Ensor drew influences principally from the work of the Post-Impressionists they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.\nPaul Cézanne had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point, with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into Cubism by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.\n\nPost Impressionism as practiced by Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne had an enormous impact on 20th-century art and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in \"French Window at Collioure\" (1914), \"View of Notre-Dame\" (1914), and \"The Yellow Curtain\" from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the Fauves directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nAlthough Cubism ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with Fauvism, the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. With the painting \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions. Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by Synthetic cubism, practiced by Braque, Picasso, Fernand Léger, Juan Gris, Albert Gleizes, Marcel Duchamp and others into the 1920s. Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like Kurt Schwitters and Man Ray and others taking the clue from Cubism were instrumental to the development of the movement called Dada.\n\nThe Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published the Manifesto of Futurism in 1909, which later inspired artists such as Carlo Carra in \"Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells\" and Umberto Boccioni \"Train in Motion\", 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with Cubism, profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.\n\nDuring the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or, where František Kupka exhibited the abstract painting \"Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs\" (\"Fugue in Two Colors\") (1912), the poet Guillaume Apollinaire named the work of several artists including Robert Delaunay, Orphism. He defined it as, \"the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art.\"\n\nSince the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of modernism. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist's books, exhibitions and manifestos so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from \"The World Backwards\" gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: \"David Burliuk's knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second Knave of Diamonds exhibition, held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German Die Brücke group, while from Paris came work by Robert Delaunay, Henri Matisse and Fernand Léger, as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance. He went abroad in May and came back determined to rival the almanac \"Der Blaue Reiter\" which had emerged from the printers while he was in Germany\".\n\nFrom 1909 to 1913 many experimental works in the search for this 'pure art' had been created by a number of artists: Francis Picabia painted \"Caoutchouc\", 1909, \"The Spring\", 1912, \"Dances at the Spring\" and \"The Procession, Seville\", 1912; Wassily Kandinsky painted \"Untitled (First Abstract Watercolor)\", 1913, \"Improvisation 21A\", the \"Impression\" series, and \"Picture with a Circle\" (1911); František Kupka had painted the Orphist works, \"Discs of Newton\" (Study for \"Fugue in Two Colors\"), 1912 and \"Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs\" (\"Fugue in Two Colors\"), 1912; Robert Delaunay painted a series entitled \"Simultaneous Windows\" and \"Formes Circulaires, Soleil n°2\" (1912–13); Léopold Survage created \"Colored Rhythm\" (Study for the film), 1913; Piet Mondrian, painted \"Tableau No. 1\" and \"Composition No. 11\", 1913.\n\nAnd the search continued: The Rayist (Luchizm) drawings of Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, used lines like rays of light to make a construction. Kasimir Malevich completed his first entirely abstract work, the Suprematist, \"Black Square\", in 1915. Another of the Suprematist group' Liubov Popova, created the Architectonic Constructions and Spatial Force Constructions between 1916 and 1921. Piet Mondrian was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, Neo-Plasticism was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group De Stijl intended to reshape the environment of the future.\n\nAs visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. Wassily Kandinsky, himself an amateur musician, was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color \"resounding in the soul.\" The idea had been put forward by Charles Baudelaire, that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.\n\nClosely related to this, is the idea that art has \"The spiritual dimension\" and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The Theosophical Society popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, Hilma af Klint and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.\nThe universal and timeless shapes found in geometry: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.\n\nMany of the abstract artists in Russia became Constructivists believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. \"Art into life!\" was Vladimir Tatlin's slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. Varvara Stepanova and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.\nOn the other side stood Kazimir Malevich, Anton Pevsner and Naum Gabo. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the Bauhaus. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only socialist realism was allowed.\n\nThe Bauhaus at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius. The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the Arts and Crafts movement in England and the Deutscher Werkbund. Among the teachers were Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, Anni Albers, and László Moholy-Nagy. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the Nazi party gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of degenerate art, 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of avant-garde art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.\n\nDuring the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of totalitarianism. Sophie Tauber and Jean Arp collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish Katarzyna Kobro applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the Cercle et Carré group organized by Joaquin Torres-Garcia assisted by Michel Seuphor contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and Kurt Schwitters. Criticized by Theo van Doesburg to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal \"Art Concret\" setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality. Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international \"Abstract and Concrete\" exhibition was organized by Nicolete Gray including work by Piet Mondrian, Joan Miró, Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the St. Ives group in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.\n\nDuring the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, surrealism, and dada were represented in New York: Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Léger, Piet Mondrian, Jacques Lipchitz, André Masson, Max Ernst, André Breton, were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York. The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting \"Composition No. 10\", 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.\nSome artists of the period defied categorization, such as Georgia O'Keeffe who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.\n\nEventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the Abstract expressionists and the New York School. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers John D. Graham and Hans Hofmann became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. Mark Rothko, born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The expressionistic gesture and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and Franz Kline. While during the 1940s Arshile Gorky's and Willem de Kooning's figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.\n\nDigital art, hard-edge painting, geometric abstraction, minimalism, lyrical abstraction, op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, monochrome painting, assemblage, neo-Dada, shaped canvas painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nIn the United States, \"Art as Object\" as seen in the Minimalist sculpture of Donald Judd and the paintings of Frank Stella are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include Lyrical Abstraction and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as Robert Motherwell, Patrick Heron, Kenneth Noland, Sam Francis, Cy Twombly, Richard Diebenkorn, Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell.\n\nOne socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of Theodor W. Adorno – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in industrial society.\n\nFrederic Jameson similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values. The social \"content\" of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of late modernity.\n\nPost-Jungians by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.\n\n\n\n"}

It contains an antiseptic agent such as denatured alcohol, stearate citrate or witch hazel to prevent infection of cuts, as well as to act as an astringent to reduce skin irritation. Menthol is used in some varieties as well to numb damaged skin, and it is an ingredient that shaving cream manufacturers have started including in their formulations, too.\n\nAn alcohol-based aftershave usually causes an immediate stinging sensation after applying it post-shave, with effects sometimes lasting several minutes, but most commonly only for seconds. For this reason, a market consisting of highly differentiated products has been created—some using alcohols, some not.\n\nSome aftershaves use fragrance or essential oil to enhance scent. Moisturizers—natural and artificial, are often touted as able to soften the skin.\n\nAftershave is sometimes mistakenly referred to as eau de cologne due to the very similar nature of the two products. Some aftershave manufacturers encourage using their fragranced aftershave as if it were cologne, in order to increase sales by encouraging consumers to use it in a more versatile manner, rather than just after a shaving session. Some aftershaves were inspired by a cologne.\n\nEarly aftershaves included witch-hazel and bay rum, and have been documented in shaving guides. Both still are sold as aftershaves.\n\n"}

Begun in 1633, it was nearly finished in three years; upon Cortona's return from Venice, it was extensively reworked to completion in 1639. The Palazzo, since the 1620s, had been the palatial home of the Barberini family headed by Maffeo Barberini, by then Urban VIII, who had launched an extensive program of refurbishment of the city with art and architecture.\n\nThese commissioned artworks often teem with suns and bees (the Barberini family coat of arms had three bees), as also the Cortona fresco does. At one end of the sky sits the eminent solar Divine Providence, while at the other end are putti and flying maidens holding aloft the papal keys, tiara, with robe belt above a swarm of heraldic giant golden bees. Below Providence, the simulated frame crumbles. Time with a scythe seems to swallow a putti's arm. A starry Crown of Immortality is ferried up to the heraldic swarm. Some scholars have suggested that one of the fresco's goals was to portray the Barberini papal election, which had been rumored to have been rigged, as divine providence. At one edge, are laborers in a forge so hard at work, they shatter the outer frame.\n\nFrescoes were numerous in Rome at the time; most represented galleries of framed episodes, \"quadro riportato\" such as found on the ceilings of the Sistine Chapel ceiling or in Annibale Carracci's Palazzo Farnese (completed in 1601) cycle. Baldassare Peruzzi had pioneered this style of painting called quadratura, in which the fresco replaces or simulates some of the architectural framework, using often forced perspective. Such trompe-l'oeil artifices were not novel to Italian art, since for example Mantegna and Giulio Romano in Mantua had featured such frescoes; however, for Cortona, the luminous sky became a teeming tour de force, a style that became influenced many other large fresco spectacles such as those by Tiepolo for example, in Madrid, by Ehrenstrahl in his \"Council of the Virtues\" from the House of Nobility, in Stockholm and in the frescoes depicting the \"Apotheosis of the Pisani Family\" in the Villa Pisani at Stra. Other famous \"sotto in su\" frescoes in Rome include Andrea Pozzo's \"Apotheosis of St Ignatius\" at the Roman church of Sant'Ignazio.\n\n\n"}

The song was written by the duo and appeared on their debut album \"Homework\" in 1997 and was released as a single the same year. It became a major club hit around the world and reached number one in the dance charts. It also peaked at number one in Iceland and Italy. The song's only lyrics are the title. The music video was directed by Michel Gondry and choreographed by Blanca Li. In October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 21 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\nThe key hook is a steady bassline and a robotic voice singing \"around the world\" in continuous chains. Daft Punk recalled that the song \"was like making a Chic record with a talk box and just playing the bass on the synthesizer\". The phrase occurs 144 times in the album version and 80 times in the radio edit. It is composed in the key of E minor.\n\nUpon analysis of the song, Michel Gondry noted its distinctive structure: \"I realized how genius and simple the music was. Only five different instruments, with very few patterns, each to create numerous possibilities of figures. Always using the repetition, and stopping just before it's too much.\" He also noted the similarity between the bassline of \"Around the World\" and that of the Chic song \"Good Times\". In 2017, computer scientist Colin Morris analyzed 15,000 \"Billboard\" Hot 100 hits for repetitiveness, based on compression algorithms. \"Around the World\" was found to be the most repetitive of the songs analyzed.\n\nA cover version of \"Around the World\" was released in 2006 as \"Around the World Again\" by Nicky Van She and Dangerous Dan. A remix of the will.i.am song \"I Got It from My Mama\" included a sample from \"Around the World\". Daft Punk did not approve use of the sample, however, and as such subsequently refused will.i.am permission to release the remix. A music video was produced with the sample included, however. A song titled \"Around the World\" was released by rapper P.M. that contains a sample of \"Around the World\". Señor Coconut released a cover of \"Around the World\" on his 2008 album, \"Atom™ presents: Around the World with Señor Coconut and his Orchestra\".\n\n\"Around the World\" was featured in one episode of first season of MTV animated series \"Daria\". It was also used in the video games \"Dance Central 3\",\"NBA 2K13\" and \"Rayman Raving Rabbids 2\".\n\n\"Blender\" put \"Around the World\" at 172nd place on their list of '500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'. They wrote: \n\nMichel Gondry's music video for the song features five groups of characters on a platform representing a vinyl record: four robots walking around in a circle; four tall athletes (as described by Gondry) wearing tracksuits with small prosthetic heads walking up and down stairs; four women dressed like synchronized swimmers (described by Gondry as \"disco girls\") moving up and down another set of stairs; four skeletons dancing in the center of the platform; and four mummies dancing in time with the song's drum pattern.\n\nThis is meant to be a visual representation of the song; each group of characters represents a different instrument. According to Gondry's notes, the robots represent the singing voice; the physicality and small-minded rapidity of the athletes symbolizes the ascending/descending bass guitar; the femininity of the disco girls represents the high-pitched keyboard; the \"itchy\" skeletons dance to the guitar line; and the mummies represent the drum machine.\n\n\"Around the World\" was Gondry's first attempt at bringing organized dancing to his music videos. \"I was sick to see choreography being mistreated in videos like filler with fast cutting and fast editing, really shallow. I don't think choreography should be shot in close-ups.\" The sequence, initially developed by Gondry, was further expanded and streamlined by choreographer Blanca Li. Costumes for the video were designed by Florence Fontaine, the mother of Gondry's son. The flashing lights were operated by the director's brother, Olivier \"Twist\" Gondry. As Michel Gondry stated, \"It all came down to a family affair.\"\n\nElements of the music video appear in the video for the LCD Soundsystem song \"Daft Punk Is Playing at My House\". The overall design has also been replicated for the Freemasons' \"Rain Down Love\" video.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5047550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5047550", "title": "Book packaging", "text": "Book packaging\n\nBook-packaging (or book producing) is a publishing activity in which a publishing company outsources the myriad tasks involved in putting together a book—writing, researching, editing, illustrating, and even printing—to an outside company called a book-packaging company. Once the book-packaging company has produced the book, they then sell it to the final publishing company.\n\nIn this arrangement, the book-packaging company acts as a liaison between a publishing company and the writers, researchers, editors, and printers that design and produce the book. Book packagers thus blend the roles of agent, editor, and publisher. Book-packaging is common in the genre fiction market, particularly for books aimed at preteens and teenagers, and in the illustrated non-fiction co-edition market.\n\nPublishing companies use the services of book-packaging companies in cases where the publishing company does not have the in-house resources to handle a project. There are two main reasons that publishing houses hire a book-packaging company: labor-intensive books (books with many illustrations or photographs, books which require coordinating the input of several authors, or 'novelty' books, such as gardening books that contain seed packages) and series books (e.g., Nancy Drew, Sweet Valley High, Goosebumps, and the For Dummies series).\n\nIn many cases, the book is first conceived as a marketing concept, and a writer is then hired to write the book on a work for hire basis. In some cases, book packaging companies use a celebrity with a very marketable name as the credited author, while using a professional ghostwriter to do most of the writing, researching, and editing.\n\nBook-packaging is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different territorial markets where the company that first buys the intellectual property rights, sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all territories and thereby obtain the maximum quantity discounts on the print run for all.\n\nWhile the book-packaging sector is little-known outside the publishing world, it provides employment to many freelance authors and illustrators, particularly for those willing to work as ghostwriters, without credit in the book. Most book packaging companies pay a flat rate for manuscripts ranging from several thousand dollars to $1 per word. However, most book packaging companies do not pay royalties, which means that even if a ghostwriter's novel becomes a bestseller, the writer will not receive additional payment.\n\nOften, writers or creators working for book-packagers work anonymously as ghostwriters, under the book-packaging company name (\"by our staff writers\"), or under a pen name. In some cases, a writer's work will be credited to someone else’s name, such as a celebrity, who is paid to be listed as the credited author as a way of increasing sales.\n\n"}

Governments were worried about the influence this would have on the population and bans against films depicting bushrangers were introduced in South Australia (1911), New South Wales (a 1912 amendment to the 1908 New South Wales Theatres and Public Halls Act) and Victoria (1912).\n\nThe decision had a considerable impact on the local industry as it meant filmmakers could not work in a popular genre. Australian film production, which in 1911 was one of the highest in the world, went into decline.\n\nThe ban was still in effect in the 1930s and hurt efforts to make a number of Australian movies, including an adaptation of \"Robbery Under Arms\" from director Ken G. Hall. A ban on a film about Ned Kelly, \"When the Kellys Rode\" was not lifted until 1942.\n\nThe Hollywood bushranging film \"Stingaree\" (1934) was screened in every state of Australia except for New South Wales because of the ban.\n\nThe bushranger genre of Australian film fictionalized the experiences of bushrangers from Australian history. Bushrangers were outlaws, most active in the 19th century, and remembered in Australian folklore for their acts of robbery and violent crime, including murder. The genre showed how the bushrangers’ intimate connection with the bush allowed them to skirt the law and engage in outlaw activity. Many of the films made before the ban glorified bushrangers, rather than making them seem criminal.\n\nEarly bushranger films include \"Bushranging in Northern Queensland\" and \"Robbery of a Mail Coach by Bushrangers.\" Both were released in 1904 and ran five minutes long and six minutes long respectively. \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\", about the bushranger Ned Kelly, was released in Melbourne on December 26, 1906. \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" is notable for being the first feature film ever made. At the time of its release, it was considered to be the longest film that had ever been made, running at around seventy to eighty minutes.\n\nLike the majority of the bushranger films that would follow it, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" was relatively sympathetic to the outlaws whose lives it fictionalized. As a result, the government of Victoria tried to censor it when it was first released, claiming that it was encouraging crime. It was banned in two towns that had a relation to the gang presented in the movie. Despite government discontent, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" was a major commercial success, both nationally and internationally. One of the producers of the film stated that it made 25,000 pounds, in comparison to its budget of 1000 pounds.\n\nThe success of \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\" encouraged filmmakers to produce even more bushranger films. Between 1900 and 1914, one hundred and sixteen bushranger films were made in Australia. Most, if not all, of these films focused on the lives of white male bushrangers. A few of the most significant bushranger films made in this period include \"Thunderbolt\" (1910), \"Captain Midnight, the Bush King\" (1911), multiple adaptations of the classic bushranger novel \"Robbery Under Arms\", and \"Dan Morgan\" (1911). \"Dan Morgan\" was notable for depicting its protagonist, the historical outlaw Dan Morgan, as a true criminal, rather than an anti-hero. The graphic violence of \"Dan Morgan\" was unlike the content of any bushranger film before it, and it spurred the governments of New South Wales and Victoria to pass regulations on film content the very next year.\n\nIn 1912, New South Wales’s Theatres and Public Halls Act was amended to directly target the content of films. Specifically, the 1912 amendment was meant to prohibit the screening of “objectionable” films – films with“scenes suggestive of immorality or indecency, executions, murders, or other revolting scenes; scenes of debauchery, low habits of life, or other scenes such as would have a demoralizing effect on young person; successful crime, such as bushranging, robberies, or other acts of lawlessness…”The New South Wales government claimed that the Theatres and Public Halls Act of 1912 was meant to protect film audiences, particularly young audiences, from “injurious influence.” This included the criminal activity of bushrangers. They were also against most bushranger films' depiction of the police as an antagonistic force. Anyone going against the Act could be subject to a fine of up to 20 pounds.\n\nThe police were placed in charge of censoring films in accordance with the standards set by the 1912 amendment. They were to look over film summaries in order to determine their appropriateness, and could also demand a screening of a film if they thought it contained any “objectionable” material.\n\nIn 1917, state censor boards were supplemented by a national Commonwealth Film Censorship Board. The national Censorship Board judged the content of imported films, primarily those from Britain and the USA. State censor boards could take additional action if they believed that the Commonwealth Film Censorship Board had acted too leniently.\n\nIn 1920, the Chief Secretary of Victoria attempted to prevent the development of a film about the Kelly Gang that he believed would spread a negative image of Victoria. The Australian government feared that attempts to ban the film in Australia would result in its international distribution. The government worried that the international release of any films that portrayed Australia negatively would damage the country’s global image. Though the government could not intervene in the creation of a film, it could control its distribution. That year, the Minister of Customs was placed in charge of regulating the export of films from Australia to other parts of the world.\n\nBefore the bushranger ban, bushranging had been the most common topic for Australian films. After the ban, film production in Australia decreased as creators lost their most popular genre and the audiences it drew to the theatres. Unsurprisingly, the new censorship forces were met with discontent from the Australian film industry. H.M. Hawkins, the managing director of Spencer’s Pictures, argued that censorship would limit the industry’s ability grow, since depictions of crime were essential to the creation of a successful drama. In December of 1916, a week after a violent film about gambling was prevented from being screened, a group of Australian film exhibitors gathered to discuss the impact of censorship on their business. They expressed frustration with the fact that the police were in charge of film censors, claiming that the police department was most threatened by bushranger films' depictions of crime and as a result was hardest on crime in film over all other content. They also pointed out that films were being censored far more harshly than written material with the same content.\n\nThe primary threat the New South Wales government saw in bushranger films was their apparent glorification of crime. As a result, some bushranger films could get through the censors if the criminal activity they depicted was condemned within the film and law enforcement wasn’t shown in a negative light. However, because of the stigma that had developed around the genre, few directors were willing to risk making bushranger films, especially if they had established reputations to uphold. In 1920, the director Raymond Longford avoided adapting \"Robbery Under Arms\" in order to preserve his status within the Australian film industry.\n\nThe end of the bushranger ban was arguably indicated by the 1942 release of \"When the Kellys Rode\" in New South Wales. \"When the Kellys Rode\", a bushranger film about the Kelly Gang, had been banned in 1934. It was the last film banned under the Theatres and Public Halls Act for bushranging content. Jack Baddeley, Chief Secretary of New South Wales, finally allowed it to screen in New South Wales in the midst of World War II, claiming that the crimes that the film depicted were nothing compared to “the unbridled horrors of war.” After \"When the Kellys Rode\", the Theatres and Public Halls Act was invoked again by Chief Secretary Baddeley to ban the violent British film \"Brighton Rock\". \"Brighton Rock\" had been allowed into Australia by the Commonwealth Film Censorship Appeals Board, and the Chief Secretary would state no reason for the decision to ban the film in New South Wales.\n\nBy the time that bushranger ban was finally lifted in the 1940s, the popularity of and demand for the genre had already faded. Even after bushranging in film was legal, at least one attempt to produce a bushranger film was met with discontent from Australian citizens. In 1947, residents of Glenrowan, a town associated with the Kelly Gang, protested against Harry Southwell’s plans to shoot a film about Ned Kelly in their town. Glenrowan’s farmers sent a petition to Parliament to ban the film, claiming that bushranger films had given a negative reputation to the descendants of the Kelly Gang.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6710035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6710035", "title": "Chris Kraus (American writer)", "text": "Chris Kraus (American writer)\n\nChris Kraus (born 1955) is an American writer and filmmaker. Her novels include \"I Love Dick\", \"Aliens & Anorexia\", \"Torpor\", and \"Summer of Hate\". \"Video Green\", Kraus' first non-fiction book examines the explosion of late 1990s art by high-profile graduate programs that catapulted Los Angeles into the center of the international art world. Her films include \"Gravity & Grace\", \"How To Shoot A Crime\", and \"The Golden Bowl, or, Repression\".\n\nKraus was born in New York City and spent her childhood in Connecticut and New Zealand. After obtaining a BA at a young age from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, Kraus worked as a journalist for five years, and then moved to New York City. Kraus was aged 21 when she arrived in New York and began studying with actor Ruth Maleczech and director Lee Breuer, whose studio in the East Village was called ReCherChez. \nKraus made films and video art and staged performances and plays at many venues. In the late 1970s she was a member of The Artists Project, a City-funded public service venture of painters, poets, writers, filmmakers and dancers.\n\nHer work as a performance and video artist satirized the Downtown scene's gender politics and favored literary tropes, blending theatrical techniques with Dada, literary criticism, social activism, and performance art.\n\nKraus is Jewish and deals with many spiritual and social aspects of Judaism in her works. She says that her parents attended Christian church and did not tell her that her family is Jewish until she moved back to Manhattan at age 21, possibly to shield her from antisemitism.\n\nShe continued to make films through the mid-1990s. As of 2006 she was married to Sylvère Lotringer, a Jewish man who survived the Holocaust as a child, but they had divorced by 2016. Some of her works are based on her marriage and her ex-husband. She now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2017, Kraus published \"After Kathy Acker\", a biography of Kathy Acker.\n\n\"I Love Dick\" is an epistolary novel, a series of love letters to an elusive addressee, later identified as Dick Hebdige. In an introduction to the second edition of the novel, Eileen Myles writes, \"Chris' ultimate achievement is philosophical. She's turned female abjection inside out and aimed it at a man. As if her decades of experience were both a painting and a weapon. As if she, a hag, a jew, a poet, a failed filmmaker, a former go-go dancer—an intellectual, a wife, as if she had the right to go right up to the end of the book and \"live\" having felt all that. \"I Love Dick\" boldly suggests that Chris Kraus' unswervingly attempted and felt female life is a total work \"and\" it didn't kill her.\" In 2016, Jill Soloway adapted the novel as a TV series, produced by Amazon Studios. The first season was released on May 12, 2017.\n\n\"Aliens and Anorexia\" jumps back and forth in time and location, tracing the life and activism of Ulrike Meinhof, the downtown theatre scene in late seventies New York, the drug experiments of Aldous Huxley, the paintings and writings of Paul Thek, through the narrator Chris's fruitless attempts to make and sell a feature film, \"Gravity and Grace\", (which takes its title from the Simone Weil volume of the same name).\n\nA series of 23 essays written between 1998 and 2003, mostly in her column \"Torpor\" in the magazine Artext, \"Video Green\" is dense with the literary, the personal, and the culturally marginal. A few of the collection's notable essays \"not\" about L.A. include the elegiac \"Posthumous Lives\", about the performance artist Penny Arcade's loving curation of the estate of the filmmaker Jack Smith, and \"How to Shoot a Crime,\" about Kraus's 1987 film of the same name. The volume's first essay and its lengthiest, \"Art Collection\" follows the idea of collecting through L.A.'s M.F.A. art scene and real estate market, ending up in rural upstate New York with the extraordinary poetry—and art collection—of the all-but forgotten William Bronk.\n\n\"Torpor\" follows Jerome Shafir, a literature professor at Columbia, his wife, Sylvie Green, a writer and filmmaker with an inconclusive career, and their dog Lily through rustbelt New York City, Paris, Berlin, and the Eastern Bloc at the dawn of the New World Order. As much a shattering portrait of a Holocaust survivor as portrait of a marriage, \"Torpor\" is also the portrait of a lady rarely found in literature: a down-and-out intellectual bearing witness to a culture in collapse. In \"Torpor\", Kraus shifts out of the first-person narration of \"I Love Dick\", employing a kind of free-indirect discourse. In naming her central characters Sylvie and Jerome, Kraus alludes to the hapless, interchangeable protagonists of George Perec's first novel, \"Les Choses\". Perec, a childhood friend of both \"Torpor\"'s Jerome and Kraus's real-life husband, Sylvère Lotringer, is quoted several times in the novel. Felix Guattari and Nan Goldin also make appearances, among other cultural figures, though Kraus's use of \"reality\" comes to more subversive effect than a simple \"roman à clef\".\n\n\"Summer of Hate\" is the story of Catt Dunlop who, like Kraus, is an art critic and occasional professor of Cultural Studies. Emerging rattled from a dangerous relationship with a dominant sex partner she met online, Catt invests in a handful of corroding properties in Albuquerque and moves there to prepare them for rental. She hires Paul Garcia to work as her property manager, and they begin a romantic relationship, though Catt is still married to an older philosopher in New York City. A recovering alcoholic, Paul is on parole after spending two years in prison for “stealing less than an art gallery spends on an after-party.” Eventually Paul is pulled over for speeding and arrested in fulfillment of an outstanding warrant, and the pair embarks on a grueling legal process involving inhumane prison practices and impossible parole stipulations. Back in Los Angeles Catt studies and teaches “all the books about symbolic violence, soft forms of control,” but the forms of control to which Paul is subject are neither soft nor symbolic. As the course of her life fuses with the course of Paul’s, Catt's relationship to class, race, citizenship and criminality become increasingly complicated, forming the basis of Kraus' novelistic critique.\n\n\"After Kathy Acker\" is a biography of Kathy Acker, a radical American experimental novelist, poet, and essayist. Writing in the \"FT\", Lauren Elkin wrote that Kraus \"is the perfect mediator for Acker, finding in her work an aesthetics of provocation, discomfiture, risk and radical empathy.\" Reviewing the book for \"The Guardian\", Olivia Laing noted, \"Acker was the previous girlfriend of Kraus's now ex-husband, Sylvère Lotringer, like Kraus an editor at the independent publisher Semiotext(e) and a frequent interlocutor here. Is it crass to point this out? It certainly complicates any objective perspective, and maybe it would have been better to state it plainly, especially since it's logged in \"I Love Dick\", the roman-à-clef that made Kraus famous. That said, Kraus reconstitutes Acker's wanderings with real wit and beauty, understanding without pandering to the painfully high stakes of her identity games.\"\n\nSylvère Lotringer, Kraus's husband from the late eighties to the late nineties, founded Semiotexte's Foreign Agents series, which mostly published French critical theorists, in 1980. Ten years later Kraus founded the press's Native Agents imprint to publish fiction, mostly by women, as an analogue to the French theories of subjectivity in the Foreign Agents series. In addition to groundbreaking works of fiction by writers like Michelle Tea and Ann Rower, Native Agents has published notable volumes of poetry and prose by Eileen Myles, Barbara Barg, and Fanny Howe, as well as memoirs and interviews by Kathy Acker, Bob Flanagan, David Rattray, and William Burroughs. In a 2012 piece for \"n+1\", senior editor Elizabeth Gumport wrote \"What united the Native Agents authors was the way their work combined elements of theory, fiction, and biography, explicitly refusing to identify absolutely with any single genre.\"\n\nBefore beginning her career as writer, Kraus was an artist and filmmaker, making a number of short films and videos, including one feature \"Gravity & Grace\". Her films have been the focus of a number of international retrospective exhibitions and screenings, beginning in 2008 with “Plastic is Leather, Fuck You: Film and Video 1983-1993” at Galerie Cinzia Friedlaender, Berlin. In the press release for the 2011 exhibition at Real Fine Arts in Brooklyn, Kraus detailed her thoughts behind the production of these films.\n\nThe Chance Event: Three Days in the Desert: Primm, Nevada, November 1996. Curated by Chris Kraus, Chance brought together Jean Baudrillard, Rosanne Alluquere Stone, DJ Spooky, Diane di Prima, the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians, visual artists, garage noise bands and 600 participants to investigate the mystery of chance at Whiskey Pete's Casino. Variously described as \"a philosophy rave\" and \"one of the landmark LA events of the 90s,\" The Chance Event was reviewed on the front page of the LA Times and throughout the art press. Highlights, including a performance by Baudrillard wearing a gold Elvis-inspired blazer and accompanied by the 'Chance' band, were broadcast on European television. The event was funded by the French Cultural Service and Art Center College of Design.\n\nThough best known in the art world for much of her career, Kraus's readership is beginning to increase. She's been referenced in the work of poet Ariana Reines, novelist and memoirist Kate Zambreno, and n+1's pamphlet No Regrets.\n\nIn an introduction to her September 2013 interview with Kraus in The Believer, author Sheila Heti wrote \"I know there was a time before I read Chris Kraus’s \"I Love Dick\" (in fact, that time was only five years ago), but it’s hard to imagine; some works of art do this to you. They tear down so many assumptions about what the form can handle (in this case, what the form of the novel can handle) that there is no way to re-create your mind before your encounter with them.\"\n\nIn 2008, Kraus received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for Art Criticism from the College Art Association.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17474955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17474955", "title": "Dimanche", "text": "Dimanche\n\nDimanche (\"Sunday\"), also known as Dimanche - Le Journal d'un Seul Jour (\"Sunday - The Newspaper for Only One Day\") is an artist's book by the French artist Yves Klein. Taking the form of a 4-page Sunday broadsheet, the piece was published on Sunday 27 November 1960 and sold on newsstands throughout Paris for one day only, as well as being handed out at a press conference held by Klein at the Galerie Rive Droite at 11.00am on the same day.\n\nAn early example of conceptual art, it is most famous for being the first time that the photo-montage commonly known as \"The Leap Into The Void\" was published.\n\n'Dimanche combines appropriation, performance, actionism, conceptual art, and photo-montage all in one, and hints at this range of art movements just then coming into existence. It takes the form of a one-day newspaper, designed as an alternative to the regular Sunday paper, and includes texts and visual works by Klein, including his manifesto, \"Theatre du Vide\" (Theater of the Void). The photograph, captioned \"Un homme dans l'espace\" (A man in open space) depicts the artist leaping from his dealer's second-story window into the void. It inspired numerous artists to explore their bodies as a medium for art.' \n\nThe work was part of the second \"Festival d’Art d’Avant-Garde\" (\"Festival of Avant-garde Art\") at the Palais des Expositions, Porte de Versailles, Paris. Taking the form of a parody of the French newspaper 'Journal du Dimanche', the Sunday edition of France Soir, the book presents Klein’s ideas about the \"Théâtre du Vide\" (\"Theatre of the Void\") and was the first time the famous photo \"Un Homme Dans L’Espace-Le Peintre de l’Espace se Jette Dans le Vide!\" (\"Man In Space! The Painter of Space Throws Himself into The Void!\") was published.\n\nAccording to Klein, the intention was to declare the entire 24-hour period an international theatrical happening, 'a holiday, a veritable spectacle of the void, at the culminating point of my theories.' Merging art and life seamlessly, Klein's theatre would encapsulate each spectator's life as they lived it on that day. Several thousand copies were printed and distributed to news stands throughout Paris, with the help of Klein's friends. The artwork cost 0.35 Francs and sold well.\n\nThe most famous section of the book was the photographic collage, published with the caption 'The painter of space throws himself into the void! ' but usually known as the \"Leap Into The Void\". This photomontage, taken by Harry Shunk, was montaged from a number of photos. The leap itself took place at 3 Rue Gentil Bernard, Fontenay-Aux_Roses, in October 1960, using about a dozen Judokas from a Judo School opposite, holding a large tarpaulin to land on. Klein himself was a 4th Dan Judo Master. Shunk then montaged a shot of the empty street onto the photo. In fact there were 3 versions of this photo produced; one with Klein’s 2CV was never used; the one with a train and a cyclist was used for Dimanche; the third with an empty street and without the train was requested by Klein himself the next day to be used in the forthcoming catalogue for his retrospective at Krefeld. This strategy of employing two versions of the same montage, effectively bringing attention to the deception was typical of Klein's artistic strategy.\n\n\"I am the painter of Space. I am not an abstract painter but, on the contrary, a figurative and realist painter. Let's be honest, in order to paint space, I must put myself on the spot, in space itself.\" Yves Klein, quoted underneath the photo 'Man In Space' on the front cover of Dimanche\nAs well as declarations of intent, the book contains a series of theatre pieces, \"Théâtre du Vide\" (\"Theatre of the Void\") that prefigure various Fluxus scores of a kind that would later come to be known as happenings.\nPieces contained within the book include;\n\n\"Sleep\"; The setting is a bedroom. The scene opens with a man asleep in a big bed. The actor must really be sleeping. Each performance lasts about 10 minutes and in silence. There is to be applause at the end.\n\n\"Inversion\"; For one performance, any play will be presented upside down. All the actors will have their feet on the ceiling and their heads hanging down. This will be possible by trickery. All the furniture will also be on the ceiling, which will really be the floor. A chandelier will therefore levitate in space.\n\n\"The Five Rooms\"; In order to promote the feeling and matter without the intermediary of energy, spectators pass through 5 rooms, their feet bound by ball and chain. 9 monochrome blue paintings of the same format are in the first room; the second room is empty and entirely white; nine monogold paintings of the same format are in the third room; the fourth room is empty and dark, almost black; 9 monopink paintings of the same format are in the fifth room.\n\n\"From Dizziness to Prestige\"; Having practiced levitation and attempted a kind of purifying sublimation by which he would free himself from the exasperation of the ego, and having created or proposed various aerostatic sculptures that were free from the enslavement of pedestals, Klein presents himself on stage stretched out in space a few meters above the ground for 5 or 10 minutes. The performance takes place without commentary.\n\nThese pieces hover between the possible and the imaginary, establishing that the pieces aren’t meant to exist literally, but in the mind of the reader. This prefigures many of the concerns of conceptual art. The book also contained a b/w reproduction of an International Klein Blue monochrome painting, and some sketches of Judo manoeuvres.\n\nWhilst some of the pieces relate to earlier writings and statements by Klein, most were written in a hectic four-day period immediately prior to publication, in a bar with friends.\n\n\"Joseph Kosuth hailed him as the father of conceptual art; the fluxus movement, happenings, performances, and body art, each in its own way, was structurally related to [Klein's] work. What these streams had in common was an incentive to discover a mode of creativity that transcended national frontiers, to define its aesthetic criteria, and to disseminate the results. In this process, Klein figured in the classical role of emissary, heralding a new culture to come- invisible to the eye, yet universally present nonetheless.\" Hannah Weitemeier \n\n\n"}
{"id": "610989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=610989", "title": "Diorama", "text": "Diorama\n\nThe word diorama can either refer to a 19th-century mobile theatre device, or, in modern usage, a three-dimensional full-size or miniature model, sometimes enclosed in a glass showcase for a museum. Dioramas are often built by hobbyists as part of related hobbies such as military vehicle modeling, miniature figure modeling, or aircraft modeling.\n\nThe word \"diorama\" originated in 1823 as a type of picture-viewing device, from the French in 1822. The word literally means \"through that which is seen\", from the Greek di- \"through\" + orama \"that which is seen, a sight\". The diorama was invented by Louis Daguerre and Charles Marie Bouton, first exhibited in Paris in July 1822 and in London on September 29, 1823. The meaning \"small-scale replica of a scene, etc.\" is from 1902.\n\nDaguerre's and Bouton's diorama consisted of a piece of material painted on both sides. When illuminated from the front, the scene would be shown in one state and by switching to illumination from behind another phase or aspect would be seen. Scenes in daylight changed to moonlight, a train travelling on a track would crash, or an earthquake would be shown in before and after pictures.\n\nThe current, popular understanding of the term \"diorama\" denotes a partially three-dimensional, full-size replica or scale model of a landscape typically showing historical events, nature scenes or cityscapes, for purposes of education or entertainment.\n\nOne of the first uses of dioramas in a museum was in Stockholm, Sweden, where the Biological Museum opened in 1893. It had several dioramas, over three floors. They were also implemented by the National Museum Grigore Antipa from Bucharest Romania and constituted a source of inspiration for many important museums in the world (such as the Museum of Natural History of New York and the Great Oceanographic Museum in Berlin) [reference below]. \n\nMiniature dioramas are typically much smaller, and use scale models and landscaping to create historical or fictional scenes. Such a scale model-based diorama is used, for example, in Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry to display railroading. This diorama employs a common model railroading scale of 1:87 (HO scale). Hobbyist dioramas often use scales such as 1:35 or 1:48.\n\nAn early, and exceptionally large example was created between 1830 and 1838 by a British Army officer. William Siborne, and represents the Battle of Waterloo at about 7.45 pm, on 18 June, 1815. The diorama measures and used around 70,000 model soldiers in its construction. It is now part of the collection of the National Army Museum in London.\n\nSheperd Paine, a prominent hobbyist, popularized the modern miniature diorama beginning in the 1970s.\n\nModern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the illusion through depth perception in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the binocular perception of depth.\n\nMiniature dioramas may be used to represent scenes from historic events. A typical example of this type are the dioramas to be seen at Norway's Resistance Museum in Oslo, Norway.\n\nLandscapes built around model railways can also be considered dioramas, even though they often have to compromise scale accuracy for better operating characteristics.\n\nHobbyists also build dioramas of historical or quasi-historical events using a variety of materials, including plastic models of military vehicles, ships or other equipment, along with scale figures and landscaping.\n\nIn the 19th and beginning 20th century, building dioramas of sailing ships had been a popular handcraft of mariners. Building a diorama instead of a normal model had the advantage that in the diorama, the model was protected inside the framework and could easily be stowed below the bunk or behind the sea chest. Nowadays, such antique sailing ship dioramas are valuable collectors' items.\n\nOne of the largest dioramas ever created was a model of the entire State of California built for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition of 1915 and that for a long time was installed in San Francisco's Ferry Building.\n\nDioramas are widely used in the American educational system, mostly in elementary and middle schools. They are often made to represent historical events, ecological biomes, cultural scenes, or to visually depict literature. They are usually made from a shoebox and contain a trompe-l'œil in the background contrasted with two or three-dimensional models in the foreground.\n\nThe Diorama was a popular entertainment that originated in Paris in 1822. An alternative to the also popular \"Panorama\" (panoramic painting), the Diorama was a theatrical experience viewed by an audience in a highly specialized theatre. As many as 350 patrons would file in to view a landscape painting that would change its appearance both subtly and dramatically. Most would stand, though limited seating was provided. The show lasted 10 to 15 minutes, after which time the entire audience (on a massive turntable) would rotate to view a second painting. Later models of the Diorama theater even held a third painting.\n\nThe size of the proscenium was wide by high (7.3 meters x 6.4 meters). Each scene was hand-painted on linen, which was made transparent in selected areas. A series of these multi-layered, linen panels were arranged in a deep, truncated tunnel, then illuminated by sunlight re-directed via skylights, screens, shutters, and colored blinds. Depending on the direction and intensity of the skillfully manipulated light, the scene would appear to change. The effect was so subtle and finely rendered that both critics and the public were astounded, believing they were looking at a natural scene.\n\nThe inventors and proprietors of the Diorama were Charles-Marie Bouton (1781– 1853), a Troubador painter who also worked at the Panorama under Pierre Prévost, and Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre (1787–1851), formerly a decorator, manufacturer of mirrors, painter of Panoramas, and designer and painter of theatrical stage illusions. Daguerre would later co-invent the daguerreotype, the first widely used method of photography.\n\nA second Diorama building in Regent's Park in London was opened by an association of Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, a year after the debut of Daguerre's Paris original. The building which exhibited the diorama was designed by Augustus Charles Pugin, father of the notable English architect and designer Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like Clarkson Stanfield and David Roberts produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some \"typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains,\" waterfalls, thunder and lightning, and ringing bells. A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town Bry-sur-Marne, where he lived and died.\n\n\nExhibition venues : Paris (Pa.1822-28) : London (Lo.1823-32) : Liverpool (Li.1827-32) : Manchester (Ma.1825-27) : Dublin (Du.1826-28) : Edinburgh (Ed.1828-36)\n\n\nUntil 1968, Britain boasted a large collection of dioramas. These collections were originally housed in the Royal United Services Institute Museum, (formerly the Banqueting House), in Whitehall. However, when the museum closed, the various exhibits and their 15 known dioramas were distributed to smaller museums throughout England, some ending up in Canada and elsewhere. These dioramas were the brainchild of the wealthy furrier Otto Gottstein (1892–1951) of Leipzig, a Jewish immigrant from Hitler's Germany, who was an avid collector and designer of flat model figures called flats. In 1930, Gottstein's influence is first seen at the Leipzig International Exhibition, along with the dioramas of Hahnemann of Kiel, Biebel of Berlin and Muller of Erfurt, all displaying their own figures, and those commissioned from such as Ludwig Frank in large diorama form. In 1933, Gottstein left Germany, and in 1935 founded the British Model Soldier Society. Gottstein persuaded designer and painter friends in both Germany and France to help in the construction of dioramas depicting notable events in English history. But due to the war, many of the figures arrived in England incomplete. The task of turning Gottstein's ideas into reality fell to his English friends and those friends who had managed to escape from the Continent. Dennis (Denny) C. Stokes, a talented painter and diorama maker in his own right, was responsible for the painting of the backgrounds of all the dioramas, creating a unity seen throughout the whole series. Denny Stokes was given the overall supervision of the fifteen dioramas.\n\n\nKrunert, Schirmer, Frank, Frauendorf, Maier, Franz Rieche, and Oesterrich were also involved in the manufacture and design of figures for the various dioramas. Krunert (a Viennese), like Gottstein an exile in London, was given the job of engraving for \"‘The Battle of Quebec’\". Unfortunately, the \"‘death of Wolfe’\" was found to be inaccurate and had to be re-designed. The names of the vast majority of painters employed by Gottstein are mostly unknown, most lived and worked on the continent, among them Gustave Kenmow, Leopold Rieche, L. Dunekate, M. Alexandre, A. Ochel, Honey Ray, and, perhaps Gottstein's top painter, Vladimir Douchkine (a Russian émigré who lived in Paris). Douchkine was responsible for painting two figures of the Duke of Marlborough on horseback for \"‘The Blenheim Diorama’\", one of which was used, the other, Gottstein being the true collector, was never released.\n\nDenny Stokes painted all the backgrounds of all the dioramas, Herbert Norris, the Historical Costume Designer, whom Dr. J. F. Lovel-Barnes introduced to Gottstein, was responsible for the costume design of the Ancient Britons, the Normans and Saxons, some of the figures of \"‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’\" and the Elizabethan figures for \"‘Queen Elizabeth at Tilbury’\". Dr. J.F. Lovel-Barnes was himself responsible for the \"‘Battle of Blenheim’\" diorama, selecting the figures, and arrangement of the scene. Due to World War II, when flat figures became unavailable, Gottstein completed his ideas by using Greenwood and Ball's 20 mm figures. In time, a fifteenth diorama was added, using these 20 mm figures, this diorama representing the \"‘D-Day landings’\". When all the dioramas were completed, they were displayed along one wall in the Royal United Services Institute Museum. When the museum was closed the fifteen dioramas were distributed to various museums and institutions. The greatest number are to be found at the Glenbow Museum, (130-9th Avenue, S. E. Calgary, Alberta, Canada): RE: \"'The Landing of the Romans under Julius Caesar in 55 BC', 'The Battle Of Crecy', 'The Battle of Blenheim', 'The Old Guard at Waterloo', 'The Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaclava'.\"\nThe state of these dioramas is one of debate; John Garratt (\"The World of Model Soldiers\") claimed in 1968, that the dioramas \"appear to have been partially broken up and individual figures have been sold to collectors\". According to the Glenbow Institute (Barry Agnew, Curator) \"the figures are still in reasonable condition, but the plaster groundwork has suffered considerable deterioration\". Unfortunately, there are no photographs available of the dioramas. \"‘The Battle of Hastings’\" diorama was to be found in the Old Town Museum, Hastings, and is still in reasonable condition. It shows the Norman cavalry charging up Senlac Hill towards the Saxon lines. \n'‘The Storming of Acre’\" is in the Museum of Artillery at the Rotunda, Woolwich. John Garratt, in the \"Encyclopedia of Model Soldiers\", states that \"‘The Field of the Cloth of Gold’\" was in the possession of the Royal Military School of Music, Kneller Hall; however, according to the Curator, the diorama had not been in his possession since 1980, nor is it listed in their Accession Book, so the whereabouts of this diorama is unknown.\n\nSan Francisco, California artist Frank Wong (born 22 September 1932) created miniature dioramas that depict the San Francisco Chinatown of his youth during the 1930s and 1940s. \nIn 2004, Wong donated seven miniatures of scenes of Chinatown, titled \"The Chinatown Miniatures Collection\", to Chinese Historical Society of America (CHSA). The dioramas are on permanent display in CHSA's Main Gallery:\n\n\nSan Francisco filmmaker James Chan is producing and directing a documentary about Wong and the \"changing landscape of Chinatown\" in San Francisco. The documentary is tentatively titled, \"Frank Wong's Chinatown\".\n\nPainters of the Romantic era like John Martin and Francis Danby were influenced to create large and highly dramatic pictures by the sensational dioramas and panoramas of their day. In one case, the connection between life and diorama art became intensely circular. On 1 February 1829, John Martin's brother Jonathan, known as \"Mad Martin,\" set fire to the roof of York Minster. Clarkson Stanfield created a diorama re-enactment of the event, which premiered on 20 April of the same year; it employed a \"safe fire\" via chemical reaction as a special effect. On 27 May, the \"safe\" fire proved to be less safe than planned: it set a real fire in the painted cloths of the imitation fire, which burned down the theater and all of its dioramas.\n\nNonetheless, dioramas remained popular in England, Scotland, and Ireland through most of the 19th century, lasting until 1880.\n\nA small scale version of the diorama called the Polyrama Panoptique could display images in the home and was marketed from the 1820s.\n\nNatural history dioramas seek to imitate nature and, since their conception in the late 19th century, aim to \"nurture a reverence for nature [with its] beauty and grandeur\". They have also been described as a means to visually preserve nature as different environments change due to human involvement. They were extremely popular during the first half of the 20th century, both in the USA and UK, later on giving way to television, film, and new perspectives on science.\nLike historical dioramas, natural history dioramas are a mix of two- and three-dimensional elements. What sets natural history dioramas apart from other categories is the use of taxidermy in addition to the foreground replicas and painted background. The use of taxidermy means that natural history dioramas derive not only from Daguerre's work, but also from that of taxidermists, who were used to preparing specimens for either science or spectacle. It was only with the dioramas' precursors (and, later on, dioramas) that both these objectives merged. Popular diorama precursors were produced by Charles Willson Peale, an artist with an interest in taxidermy, during the early 19th century. To present his specimens, Peale \"painted skies and landscapes on the back of cases displaying his taxidermy specimens\". By the late 19th century, the British Museum held an exhibition featuring taxidermy birds set on models of plants.\n\nThe first habitat diorama created for a museum was constructed by taxidermist Carl Akeley for the Milwaukee Public Museum in 1889, where it is still held. Akeley set taxidermy muskrats in a three-dimensional re-creation of their wetland habitat with a realistic painted background. With the support of curator Frank M. Chapman, Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the American Museum of Natural History. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for habitat conservation. The modern AMNH Exhibitions Lab is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.\n\nA predecessor of Akeley, naturalist and taxidermist Martha Maxwell, created a famous habitat diorama for the first World's Fair in 1876. The complex diorama featured taxidermied animals in realistic action poses, running water, and live prairie dogs. It is speculated this display was the first of its kind [outside of a museum]. Maxwell's pioneering diorama work is said to have influenced major figures in taxidermy history who entered the field later, such as Akeley and William Temple Hornaday. \n\nSoon, the concern for accuracy came. Groups of scientists, taxidermists, and artists would go on expeditions to ensure accurate backgrounds and collect specimens, though some would be donated by game hunters. Natural history dioramas reached the peak of their grandeur with the opening of the Akeley Hall of African Mammals in 1936, which featured large animals, such as elephants, surrounded by even larger scenery. Nowadays, various institutions lay different claims to notable dioramas. The Milwaukee Public Museum still displays the world's first diorama, created by Akeley; the American Museum of Natural History, in New York, has what might be the world's largest diorama: a life-size replica of a blue whale; the Powell-Cotton Museum, in Kent, UK, is known for having the world's oldest, unchanged, room-sized diorama, built in 1896.\n\nNatural history dioramas consist of 3 parts:\n\n\nPreparations for the background begin on the field, where an artist takes photographs and sketches references pieces. Once back at the museum, the artist has to depict the scenery with as much realism as possible. The challenge lies in the fact that the wall used is curved: this allows the background to surround the display without seams joining different panels. At times the wall also curves upward to meet the light above and form a sky. By having a curved wall, whatever the artist paints will be distorted by perspective; it is the artist's job to paint in such a way that minimises this distortion.\n\nThe foreground is created to mimic the ground, plants and other accessories to scenery. The ground, hills, rocks, and large trees are created with wood, wire mesh, and plaster. Smaller trees are either used in their entirety or replicated using casts. Grasses and shrubs can be preserved in solution or dried to then be added to the diorama. Ground debris, such as leaf litter, is collected on site and soaked in wallpaper paste for preservation and presentation in the diorama. Water is simulated using glass or plexiglass with ripples carved on the surface. For a diorama to be successful, the foreground and background must merge, so both artists have to work together.\n\nTaxidermy specimens are usually the centrepiece of dioramas. Since they must entertain, as well as educate, specimens are set in lifelike poses, so as to convey a narrative of an animal's life. Smaller animals are usually made with rubber moulds and painted. Larger animals are prepared by first making a clay sculpture of the animal. This sculpture is made over the actual, posed skeleton of the animal, with reference to moulds and measurements taken on the field. A papier-mâché mannequin is prepared from the clay sculpture and the animal's tanned skin is sewn onto the mannequin. Glass eyes substitute the real ones.\n\nIf an animal is large enough, the scaffolding that holds the specimen needs to be incorporated into the foreground design and construction.\n\n\n\n"}

The movement to include children and youth with disabilities into mainstream society has led to new approaches on the part of authors, as well as educators.\n\nIn the United States, 10% of the population has a physical, cognitive, mental or health disability, a rate that is consistent worldwide. Disabilities may also include sensory or learning difficulties, and may range from severe to mild. The approach of children and youth literature (collectively called \"juvenile literature\") can have a significant impact on the children reading it, whether they personally have experienced disability or not; literature \"has proven to be an agent capable of influencing attitudes and acceptance of impairments\". \n\nFrom 1940 to 1970, around 311 books for children were published in the United States that included characters with disabilities. Some of these books romanticized the disability, some were infantilized, while others portrayed the disabled characters as avoiding the world. One example is the classic children's book \"Heidi\". It portrays the character Clara as a spoiled and insulated child, who regains the ability to walk after befriending Heidi and overcoming a vague and unexplained psychological problem, the apparent cause of her physical paralysis, which in reality would be medically unlikely. Another oddity is that the portrayal of blind individuals was in excess of their actual numbers in the real population. Blindness was noted as being the most common disability among African-American characters in children's fiction, used as a plot device to represent the ability to see beyond racial prejudices, making the disability secondary to its significance as a plot device.\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, the United States Congress passed several Acts to legally protect the right of children and adults with disabilities to be included in schools and the workforce, first with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and then the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. In 1986, the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) was put into force in the United States, which ended the exclusion of children with disabilities from publicly funded school systems. With the integration of children with disabilities into public schools, educators, librarians and publishers took a new interest in children's literature that dealt with disability in a balanced, accurate, and constructive way. An overall growth in public awareness of disability and its portrayal in media has supported a trend towards more detailed medical descriptions of conditions in juvenile literature. Barbara Holland Baskin and Karen H. Harris conducted influential research into the portrayal of disability in children and youth literature in the late 1970s. They published the seminal study \"Notes from a Different Drummer\" (1977), followed by \"More Notes from a Different Drummer\" (1984). Today, disability in juvenile literature is a standard topic included in bibliographies, research, criticism, and review sources. Several bibliographies and studies reviewing fiction and non-fiction have been produced in the years since.\n\nThe evolution of the portrayal of disability can be seen in the books written since the 1970s. Judy Blume shows the experience of a teenage girl diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis in \"Deenie\" (1973). The protagonist, Deenie, faces the challenges brought by having to wear a body brace during her treatment, which impacts her perceptions of herself and those of her family and fellow students. Deenie does not overcome the disability by the end of the story, nor is she defeated by it; the conclusion more realistically shows her continuing to face challenges and learning to adjust to them. \n\nA trend in current juvenile fiction is the portrayal of characters with \"hidden disabilities\" that have become more common diagnoses in recent decades. Examples include Petra Mathers' \"Sophie and Lou\", about extreme shyness that is an emotional and social disability, and Caroline Janover's \"The Worst Speller in Jr. High\" (1995) about a boy with dyslexia. In fiction for older youth, disability has recently been dealt with in complex situations with nuanced techniques such as multiple-perspective narrative; an example is Erika Tamar's \"Fair Game\" (1993), about a group of male students who repeatedly sexually assault an intellectually disabled girl at their school. \n\nBibliographer Debra Robertson, who wrote \"Portraying Persons with Disabilities: An Annotated Bibliography of Fiction for Children and Teenagers\" (1992), pointed out in the early 1990s that not every disability has to be a \"metaphor for a protagonist's development\", and the tendency of writers to romanticize or stigmatize medical conditions in this way is a persistent problem in juvenile literature. \n\nMore recent studies have indicated that educators may improve student understanding of disability with \"follow-up discussion or activities and stories that portray characters with disabilities accurately, realistically, and positively\".\n\n"}

The Community Design Center offers its services through the pro bono contributions of area architects, landscape architects, planners and other professionals. It is located in Knoxville, Tennessee and is registered as a nonprofit corporation chartered as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization under IRS regulations.\n\nThe Community Design Center has been in existence since 1969, when Bruce McCarty, then the President of the local chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), visited the community design center in Philadelphia. Bruce returned to \"pitch the idea\" to some 40 local professionals that Knoxville too was in need of a community design center. McCarty founded the ETCDC to offer technical expertise to non-profit organizations. Dozens of professional architects and students from the University of Tennessee donate their time and talent in order to assist charitable groups.\n\nIn the beginning, the Community Design Center was a part of a national movement instigated by the American Institute of Architects and the National Urban League. Bruce McCarty was the local instigator. Bruce heard that architects, planners, and other designers in other cities were helping change communities by donating their professional services to low-income communities and groups. Bruce took his son, Doug, and other architecture students to see how it was being done in Philadelphia, location of one of the first Community Design Centers. Back home in Knoxville, Tennessee, Bruce led a local coalition of planners, community organizers, social workers, architects, and landscape architects in formation of the East Tennessee Community Design Center. On July 1, 1970 the center was incorporated for one purpose, to bring professional design and planning services to non-profit groups and agencies that lack the resources to pay for the service. By 1971, there were at least 83 such programs across the country.\n\nThe first project of the Community Design Center was a neighborhood plan for Fort Sanders, funded through the East Tennessee Development District, using a Housing and Urban Development grant intended to assist grassroots planning. Members of the first Board of Directors, with their own hands, rehabilitated the Design Center's historic home in Knoxville. These early board members also organized a process for accepting and assisting new projects, provided planning and design assistance to the Fort Sanders study, and recruited their colleagues to help with the additional project requests that began to pour in.\n\nThe mission statement given by the East Tennessee Community Design Center is \"to make East Tennessee a better place to live and work by bringing professional design and planning assistance to community groups and non-profit organizations.\"\n\n<br>\nThe first Coordinator of the Community Design Center was Ed Dusek, an architect from Nashville, Tennessee, who led the Center through the completion of the Fort Sanders plan. His successor was landscape architect Bill Oliphant, one of the Center's founders. Oliphant brought the first VISTA's to the Center in 1972. Those \"Knoxville Nine\" were the first of many VISTA's who served East Tennessee and their own career development by their work on Community Design Center projects. The Community Design Center hosted the longest lasting Americorps VISTA program in the country. Annette Anderson began her 22 year tenure as the Coordinator of the Center in 1973 and remained the director until 1995.\n\nThe center has an all-volunteer board of directors and a small staff of two full-time personnel, the Executive Director and the Assistant to the Director. Part-time staff includes an administrative assistant, a Studio Director and a DesignWorks Program coordinator, along with a variable number of paid students primarily from The University of Tennessee College of Architecture and Design.\n\nThe majority of assistance provided by the East Tennessee Community Design Center is architectural and engineering services to nonprofit groups whose projects serve the community at large. Early design support leads to complete projects. The main types of projects that the staff works are community facilities, long range visioning and planning, landscaping, parks and playgrounds, as well as rehabilitation and reuse.\n\nSome of the services provided are:\n\nFunding to sustain the operations is solely from competitive grants and donations from corporate sponsors and individuals in the community. The East Tennessee Community Design Center does request a donation from their clients as well, which is used to help offset the cost associated with providing the design assistance. Funding for preliminary design services is hard to find. The Design Center fills this gap by providing conceptual only architectural and engineering services to community groups and nonprofit organizations early in the project development process.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41811383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41811383", "title": "Ecovention", "text": "Ecovention\n\nEcovention was a term invented by Amy Lipton and Sue Spaid in 1999 to refer to an ecological art intervention in environmental degradation. The Ecovention movement in art is associated with land art, earthworks, and environmental art, and landscape architecture, but remains its own distinct category. Many ecoventions bear tendencies similar to public works projects such as sewage and waste-water treatment plants, public gardens, landfills, mines, and sustainable building projects.\n\nThe term ‘Ecovention’ appears by the composition of the terms 'ecology' and 'innovation' or 'intervention'. The intention was to concrete a kind of art that alludes to the interventions that artists were made in degraded natural territories, pretending to generate a public consciousness, showing the existence of solutions. The fact of restoring make the artists enter in a collaboration process with the nature in a social way. They help to generate a new paradigm teaching how art could help the society not only in a social or political criticism, but getting directly involved in the world. They are responsible for extending the various environmental principles and practices to the community. \n\nArtists will focus on various aspects like: biological, cultural, political or historical. At the same time, different professionals work that are fundamental; architects, botanists, zoologists, engineers, ecologists... all based on the imaginative idea of an artist 4.\nActivism, the re-evaluation of territories, the study of diversity and the recovery of spaces will be some of its main characteristics. To carry them out, they use new techniques in order to transform that local ecology in order to reestablish natural resources and stabilize environments. His works have as a common goal to motivate the viewer to visit these spaces generating awareness and in turn encourage more interventions. \nArtists associated with ecovention include: Joseph Beuys, Mel Chin, Agnes Denes, Helen and Newton Harrison, Ocean Earth, Robert Smithson, Alan Sonfist, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles, among others.\n\n\"Ecovention\" is also the title of a 2002 exhibition at the \"Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center\" in Ohio, and the title of exhibition catalog, joint published with the Greenmuseum. It was considered the definitive text on ecological art for several years and the only text available for teaching the topic at the college and University level.\n\nOther major exhibitions apart from the CAC's \"Ecovention\" exhibition include: \"Earth Art\" (1969) at Cornell University, \"Elements of Art: Earth, Air and Fire\" (1971) at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, \"Earthworks: Land Reclamation as Sculpture\" (1979) at the Seattle Art Museum, and \"Fragile Ecologies\" (1992) curated by Barbara Matilsky at the Queens Museum of Art.\n\nThere is a new exhibition, Ecovention Europe, planned to open in the Fall of 2017. The show is also curated by Sue Spaid, and will feature a new text furthering the conversation around what an \"Ecovention\" is. The show will be held at the Museum De Domijnen in Sittard, Netherlands.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1151595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1151595", "title": "Escapism", "text": "Escapism\n\nEscapism is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of daily life. It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persistent feelings of depression or general sadness.\n\nEntire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world. Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word \"escapism\" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action. Indeed, the OED defined escapism as \"The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured\".\n\nHowever, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. C. S. Lewis was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers; and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers. Similarly J. R. R. Tolkien argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism'). Terry Pratchett considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature. Apart from literature, music has been seen and valued as an artistic medium of escape, too.\n\nFreud considered a quota of escapist fantasy a necessary element in the life of humans: \"[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', Theodor Fontane once said\". His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted moods, especially anger and sadness.\n\nHowever, if permanent residence is taken up in some such psychic retreats, the results will often be negative and even pathological. Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.\n\nSome social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of actually bettering the condition of the people – what Juvenal called “bread and the games”. Escapist societies appear often in literature. \"The Time Machine\" depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror their happy lifestyle belies. The novel subtly criticizes capitalism, or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the \"Fahrenheit 451\" society, television and \"seashell radios\" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction anime \"Summer Wars\" and the game \"Society\" in the 2009 American science fiction film \"Gamer\", a play on the real-life MMO game \"Second Life\". Other escapist societies in literature include \"The Reality Bug\" by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect in order to regain control over their dying planet.\n\nSocial philosopher Ernst Bloch wrote that utopias and images of fulfilment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere \"daydreaming\" or \"escapism\" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an \"immature, but honest substitute for revolution\".\n\nThe Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state (Csikszentmihalyi) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation (Baumeister). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the \"escape scale\" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people´s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:\n\nAlan Brinkley, author of \"Culture and Politics in the Great Depression\", presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by the stock market crash in 1929: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. \"Life\" magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give \"no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment”. Famous director Preston Sturges aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called \"Sullivan's Travels\". The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic Mickey Mouse cartoon that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how \"foolish and vain and self-indulgent\" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films \"consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems\", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53742216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53742216", "title": "Hannah Baker", "text": "Hannah Baker\n\nHannah Baker is a fictional character created by American author Jay Asher. She is the subject of his 2007 young adult fiction mystery novel \"Thirteen Reasons Why\", which was adapted by the media company Netflix as \"13 Reasons Why\". Hannah is introduced as a sophomore at the fictional Liberty High School; she struggles to adjust to living in an unsympathetic school environment. In the television series, Hannah is portrayed by Australian actress Katherine Langford, who returned for the show's second season, which was released in 2018.\n\n\"13 Reasons Why\" received largely positive, though also polarizing, reviews from critics and audiences. Although critics were divided on several aspects of the show, in particular how it handled mental health and its depictions of rape and suicide, they praised Langford's performance. Langford later received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. She was catapulted to worldwide attention and was variously called \"a revelation\", \"believable and raw\", and \"magnetic\". Daniel Montgomery of the Gold Derby said she was an early frontrunner for an Emmy Award nomination.\n\nAt the beginning of the series, 17-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Baker commits suicide by slitting her wrists—in the novel she swallows and overdoses on pills. Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters and her pictures. On his doorstep, Hannah's friend Clay Jensen finds a box containing audio cassette tapes containing a recording of Hannah talking about the 13 reasons for her suicide. \nClay listens to the first tape, on which Hannah narrates the events that led to her suicide. She talks about her first kiss with Justin Foley, who later spreads a rumour about their encounter. Justin's friend Bryce Walker forwards Hannah's private photograph from his phone to everyone at school, further embarrassing her. Clay recalls being rude to Hannah about her leaked photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals the thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, the second set of tapes, held by personal friend Tony, who is not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was secretly in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her. He finds listening to Hannah's story difficult, but his friend Tony finds him and reveals he helped Hannah record the tapes and knows Clay is mentioned on them. He warns Clay things will go wrong if he does not obey the tapes.\n\nOn the B side of the first tape, Hannah talks about her friendship with Jessica Davis and Alex Standall, who later start dating and stop hanging out with Hannah. When Alex breaks up with Jessica, she blames Hannah for the breakup and slaps her in public. Alex is the subject of the A side of the second tape. In the present, Hannah's mother, Olivia Baker, finds the \"hot or not\" list, on which Hannah was voted as the \"best ass\", at her house, leading her to believe her daughter was being bullied. She seeks the school principal's help. Clay turns to Alex for answers and reveals that Alex made the list to get back at Jessica, who refused to have sex with him. What Alex did not know, is that his list has led to Hannah being touched by unknown boys sexually and finally being raped by Bryce.\n\nAs Clay progresses through the tapes, he encounters the other people mentioned on Hannah's recordings. He discovers everyone on the tapes either took advantage of Hannah or abandoned her. Tyler Down, the school photographer, stalks Hannah and distributes a photograph of her and her only friend Courtney Crimsen kissing. Afraid of her classmates discovering that she is a lesbian, Courtney spreads a rumor that the girls in the leaked photos are Hannah and Laura, another lesbian classmate, and adds to the rumor about Hannah and Justin. Marcus Cole humiliates Hannah in public, and Zach Dempsey steals her class notes as revenge for her rejecting him.\n\nHannah later joins a poetry club where she meets the student Ryan Shaver, who publishes her personal poem against her wishes in his school magazine \"Lost'n Found\".In the present day, Tony confides in Clay about the night of Hannah's death. Hannah attends a party at Jessica's house; while hiding in Jessica's room, Hannah watches Bryce rape a drunk, unconscious Jessica, with Justin's complicity. Hannah is afraid to tell anyone and decides to leave. Sheri Holland, the subject of the next tape, offers Hannah a ride home but abandons her after crashing her car into a stop sign and refusing to report it, which later leads to the death of Jeff Atkins. \n\nClay struggles to continue listening to Hannah's recordings, thinking he has let her down. He decides to return the tapes to Tony, who tells him he is the subject of the next tape. Clay hesitates to listen to \"his\" tape, but decides to continue.\n\nHannah continues to talk about the night of Jessica's party. Hoping for a fresh start to the school year, she wants to admit to her feelings for Clay. The two spend most of the time together at the party and kiss in Jessica's room. Hannah is overwhelmed by the memories of her previous encounters with boys at school, which include Justin, Marcus and Zach. She screams at Clay and asks him to leave. Thinking he has provoked Hannah's breakdown, Clay leaves her alone in the room. Hannah witnesses Bryce raping Jessica. Hannah says though Clay does not deserve to be on the tapes, she could not have told her story without talking about him.\n\nOn the B side of tape 6, Hannah talks of \"the most difficult day\" of her life.In the present day, Olivia finds a list with all the names of the people on the tapes, but does not know the meaning behind them. The Bakers decide to file a lawsuit against the school and everyone on the list is subpoenaed. After accidentally losing her parent's deposits, which were supposed to go to the bank, Hannah's parents angrily confront her, later that night, after feeling extremely depressed and a burden to everyone around her, she goes to a party at Bryce's house, after being peer pressured to join in the hot tub, Hannah unfortunately finds herself alone with Bryce, who proceeds to rape her. After returning home Hannah starts recalling how her life came to this point, and after writing down a list of the people who hurt her, she decides that \"No one will hurt her again\". . \n\nOn the final tape, Hannah recalls the day of her suicide. She records 12 tapes, starting with Jessica, and ending with Bryce, after recording the tapes, Hannah said she felt \"Something shift\", and decides to get help and give life one more try. She visits school counselor Mr. Porter and asks for his help, and tells him about the rape but refuses to disclose her rapist's identity, after failing to extract the boy's name, Mr. Porter tells her to \"Move on\". Hannah leaves his office, in hopes of him following her, he doesn't. Hannah drops off her uniform on the counter at the Crestmont before delivering the tapes to Tony. Hannah returns home, cleans her room and put on old clothing, she fills up her bathtub and slits her wrists with a razor blade. Hannah dies of blood loss and is found by her parents, who attempt to save her by calling 911 but are too late.\n\nAsher's book was criticized for the poor characterization of Hannah Baker, which many critics said the television series improved upon. In her book review for \"The Guardian\", Katherine Hughes wrote that Hannah \"comes across not so much as a young soul in distress as a vengeful harpy\". The character was inspired by one of Asher’s relatives, who had tried to commit suicide.\n\nAt the beginning to the series, Hannah is a 16-year-old high school junior, \"from a white picket fence town with an almost perfect family\". Noting the realism and relatability of the character with real-life people, Quinn Keaney of Popsugar wrote that Hannah, \"is just like you ... like someone you know; she's smart, she has a bright future ahead of herself, she has loving parents, she just wants to be liked\". \"Variety\"s Maureen Ryan offered a similar observation on the realistic portrayal of teenagers, writing that the \"darkness\" in Hannah's life is \"constantly interwoven with the natural resilience and questioning optimism of adolescence\". Writing for \"TVLine\", Andy Swift described her as \"a fresh-faced teen with a bright future\", while Sarah Hughes of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called her \"smart, funny, beautiful, and sometimes awkward in that way that teenagers are\".\n\nFor most of the story, Hannah is characterized by her struggle adjusting to an unsympathetic school environment and her \"desire to fit in\" which \"trumps everything\". Her mental health deteriorates as she is subjected to bullying, slut-shaming, and physical assaults. Towards the end of the narrative, Hannah's meeting with Mr. Porter marks her complete descent into depression. While some critics lauded the honest treatment, Lauren Hoffman of \"Cosmopolitan\" said the series is so \"enamored with this idea of Hannah as someone who does things to others that it neglects to tell us who she is herself\". She said it was a failure of \"telling a story\" and a missed opportunity to \"undo stigma around mental illness\".\n\nAlthough Hannah's story is mostly told by the use of voice-overs and flashbacks following her suicide, her character is also viewed from the perspective of Clay Jensen. In an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Asher said, \"Clay is also the eyes and ears for the reader. That’s the person you’re connecting with.\" Elaborating on the use of the first-person narrative style, Joanna Robinson of \"Vanity Fair\" wrote, \"Clay's romantic treatment of Hannah as an unattainable dream girl\", and that the idea undergoes some \"smart and nuanced scrutiny\"; so much so that it leads to a need for an assessment of his complicity in Hannah's death. \"Vox\"s Constance Grady, who described Hannah as \"attractively damaged but secretly pure, sarcastic but unthreatening [\"sic\"]\", also acknowledged the connection between Clay and Hannah and wrote that the series heavily depended upon \"a secret connection\" between the two.\n\nHannah Baker was played by Katherine Langford on the television series; her first major acting credit. The show's director Tom McCarthy, script-writer Brian Yorkey, and the executive producer Selena Gomez selected Langford following a Skype audition. Yorkey called the casting process especially hard because of the extra effort needed to match the actor with the visions of the novel's readers. Speaking with James Gill of the \"Radio Times\", he expressed his satisfaction on the casting of Langford and Dylan Minnette as the leading duo, and said, \"It was well worth it, because it was about finding two people who could not only portray Hannah and Clay but really understand at a deep level what their journey is\".\n\nUniversal Studios purchased film rights to Asher's novel on February 8, 2011, and Gomez began the process of casting the role of Hannah Baker. On October 29, 2015, it was announced that Netflix would be making a television adaptation of the book, with Gomez as an executive producer. Tom McCarthy was hired to direct the first two episodes. The series is produced by Anonymous Content and Paramount Television with Gomez, McCarthy, Joy Gorman, Michael Sugar, Steve Golin, Mandy Teefey, and Kristel Laiblin serving as executive producers. Filming for the show took place in the Northern Californian towns of Vallejo, Benicia, San Rafael, Crockett and Sebastopol during the summer of 2016. The first season and the special were released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.\n\nThe character has received polarized responses from television critics and mental health analysts, but was well received by the readers and audiences. Katherine Langford garnered acclaim for her performance in the television series and was variously called \"a revelation\", \"believable and raw\" and \"magnetic\". Jesse Schedeen of IGN praised her performance stating, \"Langford shines in the lead role [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well\". Daniel Feinberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised Langford's \"dynamic\" performance and wrote, \"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible\". Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying, \"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\". Schedeen of IGN agreed, saying the lead actors are \"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\".\n"}

It was first revealed to the general public at the Salon de la Section d'Or, \"Galerie La Boétie\" in Paris, October 1912 (no. 43). This work, along with \"La Ville de Paris\" (\"City of Paris\") by Robert Delaunay, is the largest and most ambitious Cubist painting undertaken during the pre-War Cubist period. Formerly in the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, this monumental painting by Gleizes is exhibited at the National Museum of Western Art, in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nThe work is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 269 x 353 cm (106 x 138 in), signed and dated lower right, Gleizes, 1912. \"Harvest Threshing\", wrote curator and art historian Daniel Robbins for the Gleizes Guggenheim Retrospective in 1964, \"summarizes Gleizes' interest in presenting an epic panorama of mountains, valleys, clouds and smoke, towns, workers and wheat, a simultaneous celebration of the harvest, nature and man in idealistic harmony.\" Gleizes' painting, as Henri Le Fauconnier's \"Abundance\", likely takes its theme from the social and synthetic program of the Abbaye de Créteil, and too, from the poem of , \"La Montagne, Poèmes légendaires\", part 5 of \"La Terrestre Tragedie\" (Paris, Mercure de France, 1908): \"Les Moissonneurs dans les Epis, armes de faux et de faucilles...\" (pp. 49–56).\n\nWhile the still-life and nude are common themes of pre-World War I Cubism, the work of Gleizes is characterized by ambitious subjects: the harvest, the hunt, the city, and, later, \"Broadway\" in New York City, and the \"Brooklyn Bridge\" (1915, Guggenheim, New York), one of his most abstract paintings of this period. Gleizes took this, according to Peter Brooke, as symbolic of the need to express the whole vast drama, the collection of unprecedented sensations of modern life.\n\"Harvest Threshing\" represents a big subject, rich in plastic possibilities. The interest of the painting resides in its rich and complex fabric of interwoven latticework, with 'the institution of relations between straight lines and curves' or the 'thousand surprises of fire and of shadow' proposed in \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" (co-authored with Jean Metzinger in 1912). The subject matter is entirely, as Le Fauconnier and Gleizes himself says, 'a pretext'. A pencil transcription done to scale by Geneviève Dalban, as Peter Brooke points out, reveals the greatness of the construction. \"The 'duration' that has been so much talked about is entirely a matter of the length of time that can be spent looking at it, as one thing leads to another, in and out and round about, in an endless visual dance. It is a mark of the failure of the Cubist revolution – its hi-jacking by the champions of the subject – that nearly one hundred years later there are writers on art who can see in such a picture only peasants, a church tower, a rustic meal, mountains, clouds...\"\n\nIn this painting can be observed the summing up of all present in the art of Georges Seurat: \"the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value\", it represented the furthest extension of Paul Cézanne's preoccupations: his will to deconstruct, his revolt against imitation and refusal of Renaissance perspective.\n\nMuch as that of \"Les Baigneuses\" and \"Man on a Balcony (Portrait of Dr. Théo Morinaud)\" painted the same year, the subject matter of \"Harvest Threshing\"—a semi-urban landscape that possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, juxtaposing sharply contrasting elements of both traditional and modern life—is derived from an unsentimental observation of the world. On the one hand the artist makes illusion to the traditional process of threshing—a step in grain preparation after harvesting and before winnowing, now mostly done by machine—and on the other, the artist includes elements from a society in the process of inexorable industrialization. Yet the compositional relationships between the two are formally resolved. The representation of this transition between classical tradition and contemporary life was noticeably of interest to Gleizes, as it was to other artists of the Section d'Or.\n\n\"The organic process of life and civilization, moving irresistibly toward harmonious interaction,\" wrote Robbins, \"was the subject of Gleizes' art.\" It was treated neither as a \"confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but was instead presented in concrete and precise terms. Gleizes' \"Harvest Threshing\", the masterpiece of the Section d'Or (no. 34), is not merely an anecdote in a scene. Rather, it is a multiple panorama celebrating the worker, his material life and his collective activity in securing that life on a permanently changing land. Gleizes confronts us not with one action or place, but with many: not with one time, but with past and future as well as present.\"(Robbins, 1964)\n\nGleizes had no intention of analyzing and describing neutral objects from daily life; a bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar. His 'empathetic' consciousness and complex idealistic concepts of the world led him to portray—rather than 'mundane' objects—subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance. For Gleizes, consciousness and reality could meet and reconcile on the surface of the canvas. There is no period that corresponds closely to the analytic Cubism developed by Picasso and Braque in the work of Gleizes, as of Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger. The \"iconography\" of these artists, in contrast to that of Picasso and Braque, helps elucidate the reasons. At the same time, iconography explains how Gleizes and Delaunay were to become abstract painters, theoretically closer to Wassily Kandinsky and Piet Mondrian than to Picasso, Braque or even Gris.\n\nThe intention of Gleizes had been to reconstitute and synthesize the real-world according to his own consciousness. Important factors in this process were the relationships and interactions between volumes to convey solidity, structure, weight, placement. Also important was a principal lessons of Cézanne: the indivisibility of form and color; a change in one would alter the other.\n\nUnlike Picasso and Braque, the work of Gleizes always involved the synthetic treatment of broad subjects, each section of canvas receiving equal attention. As a consequence, almost a year after the completion of \"The Harvesters\", Gleizes would develop compositional innovations: broad tilting planes that provide a transition from the outer rectangles to the rotating forms at the core of the work.\n\nGleizes was aware of the differences between his own interests and those of Picasso and Braque. He wrote an article after seeing Picasso's work for the first time (in 1911). After quoting Apollinaire about returning to the principles of structure, color and inspiration, he wrote that the \"valuable [precieuses] indications of Picasso and Braque, in spite of everything, did not depart from an impressionism of form which, nevertheless, they opposed (an impressionism of) color.\"\n\nIn preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, and in the wake of their controversial showing at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1911, Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger published a major defense of Cubism and the first theoretical essay on the new movement, entitled \"Du \"Cubisme\"\".\n\nPassages of their text which attempted to reconcile goals and methods of modern painting were read to the circle around the Duchamp brothers (the Puteaux group) during the summer of 1912 and it was published before the conclusion of the Salon de la Section d’Or, where Gleizes exhibited his monumental Cubist painting \"The Harvesters\". Gleizes believed that artists could explain themselves in writing as well as (or better than) critics. He continued writing throughout the following years as \"Du \"Cubisme\"\" enjoyed wide circulation within a continuously growing circle of artists and connoisseurs. By placing the artist at the centre of society, Albert Gleizes, along with a generation of painters from diverse classes and nations, helped revolutionize the bourgeois canons. By observing and thinking, as opposed to serving solely as an ornamenter, Gleizes concluded, the artist realized a fundamental service to humanity.\n\nShortly after the 1912 publication of \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", Guillaume Apollinaire published \"Les Peintres Cubiste\" (1913, written in 1912), in which he wrote \"Majesty: this is what, above all, characterizes the art of Albert Gleizes. [...] This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination; considered from the plastic point of view, it is the immensity of things. [...] The pictures of Albert Gleizes are realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels.\"\n\n\nAt the outset of 1938, Gleizes learned that the religious community that owned Moly Sabata, a large house he had rented in Sablons, was ready to sell. Despite his success at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne, he lacked the funds necessary to purchase the house. In August, however, the American collector, Solomon R. Guggenheim purchased a large number of paintings directly from Gleizes, including his pre-war Cubist masterpiece, \"Le Dépiquage des Moissons\"; a work he hoped would have been taken by a museum in France.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse, where he was a pupil of Alexandre Cabanel. A journey to Morocco in 1872 strongly influenced his early artistic development and lead him to produce Romantic scenes under the spell of Orientalism.

The location of discovery was part of the Iron Age Luwian kingdom of Tuwana. According to the testimony of local landowner Abdullah Tanik about the find, it was discovered by Turkish archaeologist Aykut Çınaroğlu in a 1962 survey.

Her elder brother was the artist Solomon J Solomon and Flora Lion would be a cousin. Joseph attended the Ridley School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London. She painted portraits, interiors and urban landscapes in a style clearly influenced by Impressionism but often with a limited palette.\n\nJoseph was also an activist in both the women's sufferage movement and in support of Jewish charities. She was among the founders of the Ladies' Guild at the Hammersmith Synagogue in west London and also ran reading rooms in the Whitechapel area. After meeting Isaac Rosenberg in 1911, she helped pay for his studies at the Slade School of Art. Joseph was arrested, at least, once during the women's suffrage campagn. When her 1912 exhibition at the Baille Gallery, \"Some London and Country Interiors\", was reviewed in the Jewish Chronicle a notice appeared on the same page apologising for her absence from the show's Private View reception on the grounds that \"she was detained at Holloway Goal in connection with the Women's Sufferage Movement\".\n\nIn 1924, Joseph and her architect husband held a joint exhibition of drawings and paintings at the Suffolk Street Galleries. Throughout her life Joseph was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy, showing some twenty-five paintings between 1904 and 1938. She also exhibited with the Society of Women Artists, the New English Art Club and the Royal Society of British Artists. Joseph exhibited at the Paris Salon receiving an \"Honourable Mention\" on one occasion and in 1929 winning a selver medal. In 1946 the Ben Uri Gallery in London had a joint exhibition of works by Joseph and her brother Solomom and examples of her paintings were included in the \"Jewish Art of Great Britain 1845-1945\" exhibition held at the Belgrave Gallery in 1978. The Ben Uri Gallery holds her \"Self-Portrait with Candles\" which shows Joseph holding two Sabbath candles and with her head covered observing the Jewish Sabbath. The Tate collection includes a 1937 London scene by Joseph, \"Roofs, High Holborn\", showing the view from her studio towards the Old Bailey.\n"}

New York Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff wrote that the building exhibited a tension \"between the desire to uphold core democratic values and a growing sense of instability\". The building is conceived as an eight-story cube, its interlocking forms resting on a concrete base. Deep recesses set into the building create a play of light and shadow. The visual game continues inside, where the walls and walkways enclosing a lobby atrium dissolve into a cubist composition of intersecting planes. The lightness of the forms recalls the theoretical structures of Frederick Kiesler, the utopian who imagined weightless buildings suspended in air. But if you circle around to the back of the model, the upper floors begin to shift, setting the entire structure off balance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25062", "title": "Palestinian views on the peace process", "text": "Palestinian views on the peace process\n\nPalestinian views on the peace process with Israel are wide ranging. The goal that unites Palestinians is the establishment of a Palestinian state where, among other things, Palestinian refugees may resettle. Some Palestinians want that state to be established in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whereas other Palestinians want that state to replace the State of Israel.\n\nPalestinians have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause. 'New Historian' Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. However, Jerome Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the state of Israel’s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for the \"Right of Return\" (ROR) by descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.\n\nThe PLO has complex, often contradictory attitudes toward the peace process. Officially, the PLO acceptance of Israel's right to exist in peace was the first of the PLO's obligations in the Oslo Accords. In Yasser Arafat's September 9, 1993 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as part of the first Oslo accord, Arafat stated that \"The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.\" Remarks from Arafat a shift away from one of the PLO's primary aims—the destruction of Israel.\n\nHowever, evidence throughout history and even during the 1990s and 2000s have shown that the PLO leadership considered any peace made with Israel to be temporary until the dream of Israel's destruction could be realized. Arafat often spoke of the peace process in terms of \"justice\" for the Palestinians; terms historian Efraim Karsh described as \"euphemisms rooted in Islamic and Arabic history for the liberation of the whole of Palestine from 'foreign occupiers.'\" When describing his views of the peace process among Arab leaders and in the media of the Arab world, Arafat's rhetoric became noticeably more bellicose than it was when among Western leaders and media outside of the Arab world. The period saw a disconnect between what the PLO's second in command Abu Iyad referred to as \"the language of peace\" and support of Palestinian terrorism.\n\nSince the 1990s, there has been a debate within the PLO as to whether to halt terrorist activities completely or to continue attacking Israel as well as negotiate diplomatically with Israel. In practice, terrorism was never fully banned. Furthermore, assassination attempts by radical Palestinian factions within the PLO since the early years of the peace process kept Arafat from expressing full, public support of the peace process or condemnation of terrorism without risking further danger to his own life.\n\nIn 2000, after Yasser Arafat rejected the offer made to him by Ehud Barak based on the two-state solution and declined to negotiate for a more favorable offer, it became clear that Arafat would not make a deal with Israel unless it included the full Palestinian right of return, which would demographically destroy the Jewish character of the State of Israel. For this reason, critics of Arafat claim that he put his desire to destroy the Jewish state above his dream of building an autonomous Palestinian state.\n\nThe stated goal of Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is to conquer Israel and replace it with an Islamist state. Both groups reject the Oslo Accords and other plans for peace with Israel. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the two groups worked together to derail the peace process by attacking Israeli civilians. Hamas undertook a ceasefire with Israel in August 2004. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad was unhappy with the ceasefire. In September 2005, Hamas was criticized by Islamic Jihad for calling off rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza.\n\nIn 2008, Hamas publicly offered a long-term hudna (truce) with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and to grant the \"right of return\" to all Palestinian refugees. In 2010, Ismail Haniyeh announced that Hamas would accept the outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a peace treaty with Israel even if the results were not in line with their ideology. This represented a departure from their earlier insistence that they would not be bound by any such result. In 2012, Mousa Abu Marzook, a high-ranking Hamas official in competition with Haniyeh for Hamas' top leadership post, gave an interview in which he expressed a range of opinions, some of which differed from the organisation's actual stance. He said that Hamas will not recognize Israel and will not feel bound to understand a peace treaty negotiated by Fatah as a recognition of Israel, calling instead for a \"hudna\" (temporary truce). Abu Marzook echoed Haniyeh's demand that Palestinians should be given the unconditional right to return into what is now Israel proper.\n\nRashid Abu Shbak, a senior PA security official declared, \"The light which has shone over Gaza and Jericho [when the PA assumed control over those areas] will also reach the Negev and the Galilee [which constitute a large portion of pre-1967 Israel].\"\n\nThe PA's Voice of Palestine radio station broadcast a Friday prayer sermon by Yusuf Abu Sneineh, official preacher at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, over the radio. In it, he asserted, \"The struggle we are waging is an ideological struggle and the question is: where has the Islamic land of Palestine gone? Where [are] Haifa and Jaffa, Lod and Ramle, Acre, Safed and Tiberias? Where is Hebron and Jerusalem?\"\n\nPA cabinet minister Abdul Aziz Shaheen told the official PA newspaper, \"Al-Havat Al-Jadida\", on January 4, 1998, \"The Oslo accord was a preface for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority will be a preface for the Palestinian state which, in its turn, will be a preface for the liberation of the entire Palestinian land.\"\n\nFaisal Husseini, former Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem, compared the al-Aqsa intifada following the Oslo peace process to the tactic of coming out of the Trojan Horse used by the Greeks in the myth of the Trojan War.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23288", "title": "Point-of-view shot", "text": "Point-of-view shot\n\nA point of view shot (also known as POV shot, first-person shot or a subjective camera) is a short film scene that shows what a character (the subject) is looking at (represented through the camera). It is usually established by being positioned between a shot of a character looking at something, and a shot showing the character's reaction (see shot reverse shot). The technique of POV is one of the foundations of film editing.\n\nA POV shot need not be the strict point-of-view of an actual single character in a film. Sometimes the point-of-view shot is taken over the shoulder of the character (third person), who remains visible on the screen. Sometimes a POV shot is \"shared\" (\"dual\" or \"triple\"), i.e. it represents the joint POV of two (or more) characters.\n\nPoint-of-view, or simply p.o.v., camera angles record the scene from a particular player's viewpoint. The point-of-view is an objective angle, but since it falls between the objective and subjective angle, it should be placed in a separate category and given special consideration. A point-of-view shot is as close as an objective shot can approach a subjective shot—and still remain objective. The camera is positioned at the side of a subjective player—whose viewpoint is being depicted—so that the audience is given the impression they are standing cheek-to-cheek with the off-screen player. The viewer does not see the event through the player's eyes, as in a subjective shot in which the camera trades places with the screen player. He sees the event from the player's viewpoint, as if standing alongside him. Thus, the camera angle remains objective, since it is an unseen observer not involved in the action.\" \n\nSupporting narrative elements are required to indicate the shot to the viewer as a POV shot. These may include shot sequencing, sound effects, visual effects and acting.\n\nWhen the leading actor is the subject of the POV it is known as the subjective viewpoint. The audience sees events through the leading actor's eyes, as if they were experiencing the events themselves. Some films are partially or totally shot using this technique, for example the 1947 film noir \"Lady in the Lake\", which is shot entirely through the subjective POV of its central character in an attempt to replicate the first-person narrative style of the Raymond Chandler novel upon which the film is based.\n\nPOV footage has existed since the first cameras were mounted in early airplanes and cars, anywhere a film’s creator intended to take viewers inside the action with the psychological purpose of giving viewers a feel of \"What he or she is going through\", he or she being a participant in the subject matter. Cameras were increasingly introduced into more difficult experiences.\n\nDick Barrymore, an early action filmmaker akin to Warren Miller, experimented with film cameras and counter weights mounted to a helmet. Barrymore could ski unencumbered while capturing footage of scenery and other skiers. Though the unit was heavy relative to its manner of use, it was considered hands-free, and worked.\n\nNumerous companies have developed successful POV designs, from laparoscopic video equipment used inside the body during medical procedures, to high tech film and digital cameras mounted to jets and employed during flight. On professional levels, the equipment is well defined, expensive, and requires intensive training and support.\n\nHowever the race for hands-free POV cameras for use on a consumer level has always faced problems. The technology has had issues with usability, combining lenses with microphones with batteries with recording units; all connected using spidery cables, which proved cumbersome in use when compared to the quality of the end content.\n\nIn making 1927's \"Napoléon\", director Abel Gance wrapped a camera and much of the lens in sponge padding so that it could be punched by other actors to portray the leading character's point of view during a fist fight, part of a larger snowball fight between schoolboys including young Napoleon. Gance wrote in the technical scenario that the camera \"defends itself as if it were Bonaparte himself. It is in the fortress and fights back. It clambers on the wall of snow and jumps down, as if it were human. A punch in the lens. Arms at the side of the camera as if the camera itself had arms. Camera K falls on the ground, struggles, gets up.\" In the scenario, \"Camera K\" refers to Gance's main photographer, Jules Kruger, who wore the camera mounted to a breastplate strapped to his chest for these shots.\n\nPOV shots were used extensively by Alfred Hitchock for various narrative effects.\n\nThe long running British sitcom \"Peep Show\", is filmed entirely in point of view shots.\n\n\"Enter the Void\" (2009) by Gaspar Noé is shot from the first-person viewpoint, although in an unusual way, since most of the movie involves an out-of-body experience.\n\nThe film \"Hardcore Henry\" (2015) consists almost entirely of POV shots, presenting events from the perspective of the title character, in the style of a first-person shooter video game. Deep Web Smooth Criminal\n\nNearly the entire film \"Maniac\", is shot from the murderer's point of view, with his face being shown only in reflections and occasionally in the third person.\n"}
{"id": "24703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24703", "title": "Portland Vase", "text": "Portland Vase\n\nThe Portland Vase is a Roman cameo glass vase, which is dated to between AD 1 and AD 25, though low BC dates have some scholarly support. It is the best known piece of Roman cameo glass and has served as an inspiration to many glass and porcelain makers from about the beginning of the 18th century onwards. It is first recorded in Rome in 1600–1601, and since 1810 has been in the British Museum in London. It was bought by the museum in 1945 (GR 1945,0927.1) and is normally on display in Room 70.\n\nThe vase is about high and in circumference. It is made of violet-blue glass, and surrounded with a single continuous white glass cameo making two distinct scenes, depicting seven human figures, plus a large snake, and two bearded and horned heads below the handles, marking the break between the scenes.\n\nThe bottom of the vase was a cameo glass disc, also in blue and white, showing a head, presumed to be of Paris or Priam on the basis of the Phrygian cap it wears. This roundel clearly does not belong to the vase, and has been displayed separately since 1845. It may have been added to mend a break in antiquity or after, or the result of a conversion from an original amphora form (paralleled by a similar blue-glass cameo vessel from Pompeii) – it was attached to the bottom from at least 1826.\n\nThe meaning of the images on the vase is unclear, and none of the many theories put forward has been found generally satisfactory. They fall into two main groups: mythological and historical, though a historical interpretation of a myth is also a possibility. Historical interpretations focus on Augustus, his family and his rivals, especially given the quality and expense of the object, and the somewhat remote neo-classicism of the style, which compares with some Imperial gemstone cameos featuring Augustus and his family with divine attributes, such as the Gemma Augustea, the Great Cameo of France and the Blacas Cameo (the last also in the British Museum). Interpretations of the portrayals have included that of a marine setting (due to the presence of a ketos or sea-snake), and of a marriage theme/context, as the vase may have been a wedding gift. Many scholars (including Charles Towneley) have concluded that the figures do not fit into a single iconographic set.\n\nInterpretations include:\n\nInterpretations include:\n\nAnother variant theory is that the vase dates back to circa 32 BC, and was commissioned by Octavian (later Caesar Augustus), as an attempt to promote his case against his fellow-consuls, Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus in the period after the death of Julius Caesar. It is based on the skill of the famous Greek carver of engraved gems Dioskourides, who is recorded as active and at his peak circa 40–15 BC and three of whose attributed cameos bear a close resemblance in line and quality to the Portland vase figures. This theory proposes that the first two figures are Gaius Octavius, father of the future emperor, and Atia Balba Caesonia, his mother (hence Cupid with the arrow) who had a dream of being impregnated by Apollo in the form of a sea serpent (ketos), note the snake's prominent teeth. The onlooker with his staff, could be Aeneas, a hero of the Trojan Wars who saved his father by carrying over his back (hence his hunched position, and his Trojan beard) and who is believed to have founded Rome, and from whom the Julian gens, including Julius Caesar and Attia, claimed descent, witnessing the conception of Rome's future savior as an Empire, and the greatest of all the Emperors.\n\nOn the reverse is Octavian, Octavia his sister, widow of Mark Anthony (downcast flambeau, broken tablets) and Livia, Octavian's third wife who outlived him. These two are looking directly at each other. Octavian commanded she divorce her then husband and marry him with a few weeks of meeting, she was mother to the future Emperor Tiberius.\n\nThis vase suggests Octavian was descended partly from Apollo (thus partly divine, shades of Achilles), whom he worshiped as a God, gave private parties in his honor together with Minerva, Roman Goddess of War, from the founder of Rome, and his connection to his uncle Julius Caesar, for whom as a young man he gave a remarkable funeral oratory, and who adopted him on his father's death, when he was only four. All the pieces and people fit in this theory and it explains most mysteries (apart from who actually made it). It would have been a fabulously expensive piece to commission, so that few men of the period could have afforded it. Several attempts at creating the vase must have been made, as modern reproduction trials show today (see below). Historians and archeologists dismiss this modern theory as gods and goddesses with mythical allegories were usually portrayed, but could this remarkable vase have broken convention, and shown realism in portraiture, known solely on coins of the period, before it, in turn, was broken?\n\nCameo-glass vessels were probably all made within about two generations, as experiments when the blowing technique (discovered in about 50 BC) was still in its infancy. Recent research suggests that the Portland vase, like the majority of cameo-glass vessels, was made by the dip-overlay method, whereby an elongated bubble of glass was partially dipped into a crucible of white glass, before the two were blown together. After cooling the white layer was cut away to form the design.\n\nThe work in making a 19th-century copy proved to be incredibly painstaking, and based on this it is believed that the Portland Vase must have taken its original artisan no less than two years to produce. The cutting was probably performed by a skilled gem-cutter. It is believed that the cutter may have been Dioskourides, as engraved gems thought to be cut by him of a similar period and signed by him (Vollenweider 1966, see Gem in the collection of the Duke of Devonshire \"Diomedes stealing the Palladium\") are extant. This is confirmed by the Corning Museum in their 190-page study of the vase – see above.\n\nAccording to a controversial theory by Rosemarie Lierke, the vase, along with the rest of Roman cameo glass, was moulded rather than cold-cut, probably using white glass powder for the white layer.\n\nJerome Eisenberg has argued in \"Minerva\" that the vase was produced in the 16th century AD and not antiquity, because the iconography is incoherent, but this theory has not been widely accepted.\n\nOne story suggests that it was discovered by Fabrizio Lazzaro in what was then thought to be the sarcophagus of the Emperor Alexander Severus (died 235) and his mother, at Monte del Grano near Rome, and excavated some time around 1582.\n\nThe first historical reference to the vase is in a letter of 1601 from the French scholar Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc to the painter Peter Paul Rubens, where it is recorded as in the collection of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte in Italy. In 1626 it passed into the Barberini family collection (which also included sculptures such as the Barberini Faun and Barberini Apollo) where it remained for some two hundred years, being one of the treasures of Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII (1623–1644). It was at this point that the Severan connection is first recorded. The vase was known as the \"Barberini Vase\" in this period.\n\nBetween 1778 and 1780, Sir William Hamilton, British ambassador in Naples, bought the vase from James Byres, a Scottish art dealer, who had acquired it after it was sold by Cornelia Barberini-Colonna, Princess of Palestrina. She had inherited the vase from the Barberini family. Hamilton brought it to England on his next leave, after the death of his first wife, Catherine. In 1784, with the assistance of his niece, Mary, he arranged a private sale of the vase to Margaret Cavendish-Harley, widow of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and dowager Duchess of Portland. It was sold at auction in 1786 and passed into the possession of the duchess's son, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.\n\nThe 3rd Duke lent the original vase to Josiah Wedgwood (see below) and then to the British Museum for safe-keeping, by which point it was known as the \"Portland Vase\". It was deposited there permanently by the fourth Duke in 1810, after a friend of his broke its base. The original Roman vase has remained in the British Museum ever since 1810, apart from three years in 1929–32 when the 6th Duke put it up for sale at Christie's where it failed to reach its reserve. It was finally purchased by the museum from the 7th Duke in 1945 with the aid of a bequest from James Rose Vallentin.\n\nThe 3rd Duke lent the vase to Josiah Wedgwood, who had already had it described to him as \"the finest production of Art that has been brought to England and seems to be the very apex of perfection to which you are endeavoring\" by the sculptor John Flaxman. Wedgwood devoted four years of painstaking trials at duplicating the vase – not in glass but in black and white jasperware. He had problems with his copies ranging from cracking and blistering (clearly visible on the example at the Victoria and Albert Museum) to the sprigged reliefs 'lifting' during the firing, and in 1786 he feared that he could never apply the Jasper relief thinly enough to match the glass original's subtlety and delicacy. He finally managed to perfect it in 1790, with the issue of the \"first-edition\" of copies (with some of this edition, including the V&A one, copying the cameo's delicacy by a combination of undercutting and shading the reliefs in grey), and it marks his last major achievement.\n\nWedgwood put the first edition on private show between April and May 1790, with that exhibition proving so popular that visitor numbers had to be restricted by only printing 1,900 tickets, before going on show in his public London showrooms. (One ticket to the private exhibition, illustrated by Samuel Alkin and printed with 'Admission to see Mr Wedgwood's copy of The Portland Vase, Greek Street, Soho, between 12 o'clock and 5', was bound into the Wedgwood catalogue on view in the Victoria and Albert Museum's British Galleries.) As well as the V&A copy (said to have come from the collection of Wedgwood's grandson, the naturalist Charles Darwin)\n, others are held at the Fitzwilliam Museum (this is the copy sent by Wedgwood to Erasmus Darwin which his descendants lent to the Museum in 1963 and later sold to them); the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Department of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum.\n\nThe vase also inspired a 19th-century competition to duplicate its cameo-work in glass, with Benjamin Richardson offering a £1,000 prize to anyone who could achieve that feat. Taking three years, glass maker Philip Pargeter made a copy and John Northwood engraved it, to win the prize. This copy is in the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York.\n\nThe Wedgwood Museum, in Barlaston, near Stoke-on-Trent, contains a display describing the trials of replicating the vase, and several examples of the early experiments are shown.\n\nOn 7 February 1845, the vase was shattered by William Lloyd, who, after drinking all the previous week, threw a nearby sculpture on top of the case, smashing both it and the vase. He was arrested and charged with the crime of wilful damage. When his lawyer pointed out an error in the wording of the act which seemed to limit its application to the destruction of objects worth no more than five pounds, he was convicted instead of the destruction of the glass case in which the vase had sat. He was ordered to pay a fine of three pounds or spend two months in prison. He remained in prison until an anonymous benefactor paid the fine by mail. The name William Lloyd is thought to be a pseudonym. Investigators hired by the British Museum concluded that he was actually William Mulcahy, a student who had gone missing from Trinity College. Detectives reported that the Mulcahy family was impoverished. The owner of the vase declined to bring a civil action against William Mulcahy because he did not want his family to suffer for \"an act of folly or madness which they could not control\".\n\nThe vase was pieced together with fair success, though the restorer was unable to replace all of the pieces and thirty-seven small fragments were left when he was done. It appears they had been put into a box and forgotten. In 1948, the keeper Bernard Ashmole received thirty-seven fragments in a box from Mr Croker of Putney, who did not know what they were. In 1845 John Doubleday, the first restorer, had not been able to determine where these fragments went. A colleague took them to Mr Gabb, a box maker, who was asked to make a box with thirty seven compartments, one for each fragment. The colleague died, the box was never collected, Mr Gabb died and his executrix Miss Revees asked Croker to ask the museum if they could identify them.\n\nBy 1948, the restoration appeared aged and it was decided to restore the vase again, but the restorer was successful in replacing only three fragments. The adhesive from this weakened: by 1986 the joints rattled when the vase was gently tapped.\n\nThe third and current reconstruction took place from 1 June 1988 and was completed on 1 October 1989 by Nigel Williams and Sandra Smith, and overseen by David Akehurst (CCO of Glass and Ceramics) who had assessed the vase's condition during its appearance as the focal piece of an international exhibition of Roman glass and, at the conclusion of the exhibition, it was decided to go ahead with reconstruction and stabilization. The treatment had scholarly attention and press coverage. The vase was photographed and drawn to record the position of fragments before dismantling; the BBC filmed the conservation process. All the adhesives used in previous restorations had deteriorated, so to find one that would last, conservation scientists at the museum tested many adhesives for long-term stability. Finally, an epoxy resin with excellent ageing properties was chosen. Reassembly of the vase was made more difficult as the edges of some fragments were found to have been filed down during the restorations. Nevertheless, all of the fragments were replaced except for a few small splinters. Areas that were still missing were gap-filled with a blue or white resin.\n\nThe newly conserved Portland Vase was returned to display. Little sign of the original damage is visible and, except for light cleaning, it is hoped that the vase should not require major conservation work for at least another century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "170593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170593", "title": "Stage management", "text": "Stage management\n\nStage management is a broad field that is generally defined as the practice of organization and coordination of an event or theatrical production. Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and  coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently.\n\nA Stage Manager is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or \"Production Stage Manager\", and one or more Assistant Stage Managers.\n\nThe title of Stage Manager was not used until the 18th century. Though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer.\n\nMoving into the Middle Ages there is evidence of a Conducteurs De Secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines, this was a common practice of the time. \n\nBetween the Renaissance and 17th century the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. During the Elizabethan and Jacobean Theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: Stage Keeper and Book Keeper. The Stage Keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The Book Keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects. \n\nBetween the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management. Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time. During Shakespeare’s time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time.\n\nThough it wasn't until the 18th century in England that the term Stage Manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions—\"director\" and \"stage manager\".\n\nMany playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director Preston Sturges, for example, was employed as an ASM on Isadora Duncan's production of \"Oedipus Rex\" at the age of 16 and a half:\n\nWhen one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily...\n\nSturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later Brock Pemberton hired him as an ASM on Antoinette Perry's production of \"Goin' Home\", which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, \"The Guinea Pig\", in 1929.\n\n\n\nThe stage management kit can be as expansive as a huge tackle box, or a smaller bag containing only the absolute essentials. Some common items in a kit include:\n\n\n\nOther items may be needed specifically during the rehearsal period, such as:\n\nIt is important to keep lines of communication open between the stage manager and all other departments of the production.\n\nThe prompt book contains the script from which the SM calls the show, labeled with light and sound cues. It may also contain:\n\nIn the United States, \"Stage Manager\" is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as \"the stage manager\". Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled Production Stage Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant Stage Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as \"Production Stage Manager\" (first or head stage manager), \"Stage Manager\" (second stage manager), and \"Assistant Stage Manager\" (third stage manager).\n\nSome professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the Actors' Equity Association, which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals.\n\nIn the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A fringe theatre show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a West End theatre show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the British Actors' Equity Association, which also represents performers.\n\nThe DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes. The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.\n\nThe assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in. The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing.\n\nMany live shows around the world are produced with the forehand knowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. Often, they are on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, show control systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.\n\nThe role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are Opera, Music and Dance concerts and, Film and Television.\n\nFor music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.\n\nWith being a Stage Manager you also need to know what unions you will be working with. Some of the things that a Stage Manager needs to know about working with a union is how often do they take breaks, and who is represented by which union. \nCommonly referred to as Actors Equity (AEA). Actors Equity represents the stage actors and stage managers in the live theatre industry. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living conditions, livable wages, and benefits.\nInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents the stage hands in the theatre.\nUnited Scenic Artist also known as United Scenic Artists of America. It organizes designers, artists and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries.<ref>United Scenic Artists is affiliated with International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees since 1999.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

This tale type is quite common in Norway and Iceland and very rare elsewhere.\n\nA version of the tale also appears in \"A Book of Witches\" and \"A Choice of Magic\", by Ruth Manning-Sanders.\n\nA king and queen had no children, which grieved the queen greatly. To alleviate the queen's loneliness, they adopted a girl to raise as their own. One day, when the queen saw her adopted daughter playing with a beggar girl, she scolded her adopted daughter and tried to drive the other girl off. However, the beggar girl mentioned that her mother knows a way for the queen to become pregnant.\n\nWhen the queen approached the beggar woman, the woman denies having such knowledge. The queen treated the woman to as much wine as the woman pleased until the woman is drunk. When the queen asked the drunk beggar woman how she could get a child of her own, the beggar woman told her to wash herself in two pails of water before going to bed, and afterward pour the water under the bed. The next morning, two flowers will have sprung up from under the bed: one fair and one rare. The beggar tells the queen that she must eat the beautiful one, but not to eat the hideous one no matter what. The queen followed this advice, and the next morning under the bed were two flowers. One was bright and lovely, and the other was black and foul. The queen ate the beautiful flower at once, but it tasted so sweet that she craved the other and ate it as well.\n\nNot long afterward, the queen bore a child. She gave birth to a girl who carried a wooden spoon in her hand and rode upon a goat. She was very ugly and loud from the moment she was born. The queen despairs having such a daughter until the girl tells her mother that her next child will be fair and agreeable. As the girl promised, the queen gave birth to a second daughter, one who was born fair and sweet, which pleased the queen very much. The sisters were as different as they could be, but they were very fond of each other. The elder daughter was named Tatterhood, because she wore a tattered hood over her unruly hair.\n\nOne Christmas Eve, when the girls were half grown, there was great noise in the gallery outside the queen's rooms. When Tatterhood demanded to know what was causing the noise, the queen reluctantly reveals that it was a pack of trolls (in some versions, witches) who come to the palace every seven years. Tatterhood, being headstrong, decides to drive the trolls off and instructs her mother keep the door tightly shut. Worried about Tatterhood, Tatterhood's younger sister opens one of the doors during the battle with the trolls. Her head is instantly snatched off by a troll and replaced with a calf's head, after which the trolls flee from the castle.\n\nTo restore her sister's head, Tatterhood sets off in a ship with no crew or company aside from her own sister. They arrive at the isle of the trolls and Tatterhood battles the trolls and successfully regain her sister's head. The sisters escape and arrive in a distant kingdom. The king, a widower with one son, fell in love with the younger sister at first sight. However, she declared she will not marry until Tatterhood does. The king begged his son to marry Tatterhood, and eventually he reluctantly agreed. \n\nThe two sisters were to be married to their grooms on the same day. The king, his young princess bride, and the king's son were regally adorned, while Tatterhood refused to dress up and happily wore her rags. As the couples rode to church to be married, Tatterhood asked her bridegroom why he did not ask why she rides a goat, and when he duly asked, she answered that she rode a grand horse, which it promptly becomes. She asked the prince why he does not ask why she carries a wooden spoon, which he asks, and she declares it to be a fan (or in some versions a wand), which it turns into. This is repeated with the tattered hood, which is turned into a golden crown, and with Tatterhood herself, whose beauty she declares to surpass her sister's, which it then does. The prince now understands that she chooses to appear ragged, and that her beauty matters not. He now is glad to be married to her.\n\n"}

{"id": "113700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113700", "title": "Tintin and Alph-Art", "text": "Tintin and Alph-Art\n\nTintin and Alph-Art () is the unfinished twenty-fourth and final volume of \"The Adventures of Tintin\", the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Left incomplete on Hergé's death, the manuscript was posthumously published in 1986. The story revolves around Brussels' modern art scene, where the young reporter Tintin discovers that a local art dealer has been murdered. Investigating further, he encounters a conspiracy of art forgery, masterminded by a religious guru named Endaddine Akass.\n\nReflecting his own fascination for modern art, Hergé began work on \"Tintin and Alph-Art\" in 1978. However, it was left unfinished at the time of his death in March 1983. At this point it consisted of around 150 pages of pencil-drawn notes, outlines and sketches – not yet rendered in Hergé's trademark \"ligne claire\" drawing style – with no ending having been devised for the story. Hergé's colleague Bob de Moor offered to complete the story for publication, and while Hergé's widow Fanny Vlamynck initially agreed, she changed her decision, citing the fact that her late husband had not wanted anyone else to continue \"The Adventures of Tintin\". A selection of the original notes were collected together and published in book form by Casterman in 1986. Since that point, several other cartoonists, such as Yves Rodier, have produced their own finished, unauthorized versions of the story. Critical reception of the work has been mixed; some commentators on \"The Adventures of Tintin\" have believed that \"Tintin and Alph-Art\" would have been an improvement over much of Hergé's later work, while others have characterised this as wishful thinking.\n\nTintin and Captain Haddock receive a phone call from their friend, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who informs them about a new spiritual leader whom she has begun following, Endaddine Akass, stating her intention to stay at his villa in Ischia. Later that day, Haddock enters the Fourcart Gallery in Brussels, where Jamaican avant-garde artist Ramó Nash convinces him to purchase one of his \"Alph-Art\" works, a perspex letter \"H\". The gallery's owner, Henri Fourcart, arranges to meet Tintin, but is killed in a car accident while on his way to do so. Tintin begins to investigate, discovering that Fourcart's death was murder. Tintin and Haddock attend one of Akass' lectures; there, Tintin recognises Akass' voice, but is unsure why. Investigating further, he concludes that Akass was spying on Fourcart through a micro-transmitter hidden in a pendant worn by the latter's assistant, Martine Vandezande. Tintin soon faces a number of attacks designed to kill him, but survives both.\n\nTo further his investigations, Tintin decides to visit Akass' villa. Arriving at Ischia, Tintin and Haddock receive death threats warning them to leave. When Castafiore hears that they are on the island, she welcomes them to Akass' villa, informing them that Akass himself is in Rome. At the villa, they meet a number of acquaintances, the corrupt industrialists W.R. Gibbons (from \"The Blue Lotus\") and R.W. Trickler (from \"The Broken Ear\"), Emir Ben Kalish Ezab (from \"Land of Black Gold\"), Luigi Randazzo (a singer), and Ramó Nash. Tintin and Haddock stay the night at the villa on Castafiore's insistence. During the night, Tintin witnesses men loading canvases into a van, and exploring the villa discovers a room full of faked paintings by prominent artists. He is discovered by Akass, who informs him that he uses Nash's \"Alph-Art\" as a front for his criminal forgery business. Akass declares his intention to kill Tintin by having him covered in liquid polyester and sold as a work of art by César Baldaccini.\n\nIn 1976, a few months after the publication of \"Tintin and the Picaros\", Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating setting the next \"Adventure of Tintin\" in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each \"Adventure\", British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.\n\nHergé initially titled this new work \"Tintin et les Faussaires\" (\"Tintin and the Forgers\") before changing this working title to \"Tintin et L'Alph-Art\". The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, was based on a real-life art forger, Fernand Legros, whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the \"Paris Match\". In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980. Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.\n\nThree months before he died, Hergé stated that \"Unfortunately I cannot say much about this forthcoming Tintin adventure because, though I started it three years ago, I have not had much time to work on it and still do not know how it will turn out. I know very roughly where I am going... I am continuing my research and I really do not know where this story will lead me.\"\nUpon his death, Hergé left around one hundred and fifty pages of pencil sketches for the story. The story itself had no ending, and is left on a cliffhanger, with Tintin's fate left unexplained.\n\nHergé's main assistant, Bob de Moor, showed an interest in completing the book following Hergé's death. In de Moor's words, \"Personally I would have loved to finish \"Alph-Art\". It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it.\"\nIn the end, Fanny decided Hergé would not have approved and the book must remain unfinished. Hergé had made it clear that he did not want anyone else to continue \"The Adventures of Tintin\" after his death, informing Sadoul that \"After me there will be no more Tintin. Tintin is my creation—my blood, my sweat, my guts.\"\n\nFanny ultimately decided that Hergé's unfinished sketches could be published in book form. To do so, the sketches were edited by a team of experts, including Benoît Peeters, Michel Bareau and Jean-Manuel Duvivier, with forty-four being selected for publication. The book produced devoted one half to reproducing the sketches, and the other to producing a transcript of Hergé's text for the story. Published on 8 October 1986 by Casterman, it proved to be a best-seller.\nAn English language translation was published in 1990.\n\nFor Michael Farr, \"Tintin and Alph-Art\" provided \"an almost perfect ending to more than fifty years of defying danger, threats to his life and a succession of villains\". He believed that it was \"full of a vigour and enthusiasm disappointingly absent from the two previous adventures\", and that as a result \"it promised to be Hergé's most accomplished Tintin story for twenty years\". Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier stated that had the story been completed, it \"may have turned out to be a smaller-scale, unpretentious yet far more exciting and true-to-life adventure\" than various recent volumes.\nHergé biographer Benoît Peeters felt that \"despite its limitations, and perhaps on account of them, this unfinished story fits perfectly alongside the other 23 Tintin adventures. Full of promise, it ends the series admirably by leaving the last word to every reader's imagination.\" Philippe Goddin opined that \"Tintin and Alph-Art\"'s opening \"promised much, coming like new breath\".\n\nIn a later publication, Peeters expressed a different view, stating that \"one cannot help but feel disappointed\" with \"Alph-Art\". Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed the view that Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while \"many critics like to think... \"Tintin and Alph-Art\" was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece\", he disagreed, describing this as \"surely just wishful thinking\". He added that it could be seen as \"a nostalgic, or regressive book, depending on your point of view.\"\n\nThe literary critic Tom McCarthy suggested that some of the early scenes of the book \"take the form almost of Platonic dialogues, dramatized theoretical discussions about art itself\", although later in the book Hergé turns to revealing \"the deeper and more essential Platonic truth of art: that it is fake, that its whole currency is fakeness.\" Discussing the final scene in the book, he opined that it \"reads like a snuff movie: not of Tintin, ultimately, but of Hergé\". Further, he argued that \"Tintin and Alph-Art\" reflected a number of themes that also appear in other \"Adventures of Tintin\"; these include the idea of Castafiore bridging the connection between the protagonist and the villains, and the concept of Haddock being confronted \"with his own inauthenticity\", in this case through purchasing a giant plastic 'H' artwork.\n\nA number of pirated versions of the story exist, produced by other artists and illegally distributed among fans. In 1987, such a version was completed by an artist using the pseudonym of Ramó Nash. Several further versions were produced by the Canadian artist Yves Rodier during the 1990s. A further version appeared in the 1990s, produced by an individual known as Regric.\n\nIn honour of Hergé's legacy, the awards handed out at the Angoulême International Comics Festival were named Alph-Art Awards, having previously been named after Alain Saint-Ogan's character Alfred.\n\nIn November 2015, Somerset House in London held the exhibition \"Tintin: Hergé's Masterpiece\", which featured the final sketch from \"Tintin and Alph-Art\" as one of its displays.\n\n"}
{"id": "44103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44103", "title": "Tribute in Light", "text": "Tribute in Light\n\nThe Tribute in Light is an art installation of 88 searchlights placed six blocks south of the World Trade Center on top of the Battery Parking Garage in New York City to create two vertical columns of light to represent the Twin Towers in remembrance of the September 11, 2001 attacks. \"Tribute in Light\" began initially as a temporary commemoration of the attacks in early 2002 but became an annual commemoration, currently produced on September 11th by the Municipal Art Society of New York.\n\nOn clear nights, the lights can be seen from over away, visible in all of New York City and most of suburban Northern New Jersey and Long Island. The lights can also be seen in Fairfield County, Connecticut, as well as Westchester, Orange, and Rockland counties in New York. The beams have been clearly visible as far north as the terrace at Century Country Club in Purchase, New York, from at least as far west as western Morris County, in Flanders, New Jersey, at least as far east as the barrier beach of Fire Island in Suffolk County, New York on Long Island, and as far south near Trenton, New Jersey in nearby Hamilton.\n\nThe two beams cost approximately $1,626 (assuming $0.11 per kWh) to run for 24 hours. There are 88 xenon spotlights (44 for each tower) which each consume 7,000 watts.\n\nThe idea of two vertical beams of light was first suggested by Ezra Orion, an Israeli sculptor, in 1997. Orion proposed an art installation in which 120 Xenon searchlights were to be placed on the tops of the Twin Towers for the 1998 4th of July celebration. On September 25th, 1997, Orion met with Richard Hart, the president of Xenotech Lighting, and the municipal art adviser, at the top of the south tower. Although the response to Orion’s suggestion was enthusiastic, it was deemed too expensive. \n\nThe \"Tribute in Light\" initially ran as a temporary installation from March 11 to April 14, 2002, and ran again on September 11, 2003 to mark the second anniversary of the attack. Since then, it has been repeated every year on September 11. It was announced that 2008 would be its final year, but the tribute was continued in 2009.\n\nOn December 17, 2009, it was confirmed that the tribute would continue through to the tenth anniversary of the attacks in 2011, but continued again in 2012. As of July 23, 2012, plans are underway for the National September 11 Memorial & Museum to assume the lease for the MTA property used during this tribute, and to begin transitioning operation of the tribute from the Municipal Art Society to the memorial foundation.\n\nThose working on the project came up with the concept in the week following the attack. On September 13, 2001, the concept was introduced by John Englehart in a meeting with the crisis communications task force at the electric utility Consolidated Edison, as a signal of support for the community. Architects John Bennett and Gustavo Bonevardi of PROUN Space Studio distributed their \"Project for the Immediate Reconstruction of Manhattan's Skyline\". Artists Julian LaVerdiere and Paul Myoda, who before September 11 were working on the 91st floor of the World Trade Center north tower on a proposed light sculpture on the giant radio antenna with Creative Time, conceived of a project called \"Phantom Towers\". They were commissioned by \"The New York Times Magazine,\" (Janet Froelich, art director) to create an image of the project for its September 23 cover.\n\nRichard Nash Gould, a New York architect, presented the concept to the Municipal Art Society. On September 19, Municipal Art Society chairman Philip K. Howard wrote to Mayor Rudy Giuliani, asking him \"to consider placing two large searchlights near the disaster site, projecting their light straight up into the sky.\"\n\nAfter some consideration, it was decided to contact lighting experts in the field of high intensity light displays. A Las Vegas-based company, Light America, was chosen because of their vast knowledge of high intensity light displays. Gary Evans, the VP of Light America, and Michael Burns, the designer of the \"Tribute in Light\", said that the company did testing of the lighting fixtures in the Las Vegas Valley before bringing the fixtures to the World Trade Center site.\n\nThe project was originally going to be named \"Towers of Light\", but the victims' families felt that the name emphasized the buildings destroyed instead of the people killed.\n\nA permanent fixture of the \"Tribute in Light\" was at one point intended to be installed on the roof of One World Trade Center, but it was not included in the finished design.\n\nSince 2008, the generators that power \"Tribute in Light\" have been fueled with biodiesel made from used cooking oil collected from local restaurants.\n\nThe light pollution from \"Tribute in Light\" has caused confusion for thousands of migrating birds, trapping them in the beams. As a result of this effect, the lights are switched off for 20-minute periods to allow the birds to escape. To ensure the lights do not affect migrating birds, the Municipal Art Society works with the New York City Audubon on the illumination. A 2017 study on the effects of the installation on migrating birds found that the birds resumed their normal flight patterns after the installation was turned off.\n\n\"Tribute in Light\" was featured in Boyz II Men's music video for \"Color of Love\". It made a notable appearance during the opening credits of Spike Lee's 2002 film \"25th Hour\". It also appeared as a virtual memorial in the \"Spider-Man 2\" video game for Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube. The tribute was also shown and referenced in the CBS series \"Blue Bloods\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4058023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4058023", "title": "Vanity sizing", "text": "Vanity sizing\n\nVanity sizing, or size inflation, is the phenomenon of ready-to-wear clothing of the same nominal size becoming bigger in physical size over time. This has been documented primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom. US standard clothing sizes are no longer used by manufacturers as the official guidelines for clothing sizes was abandoned in 1983. In the United States, although clothing size standards exist (i.e., ASTM), most companies do not use them any longer.\n\nSize inconsistency has existed since at least 1937. In Sears's 1937 catalog, a size 14 dress had a bust size of . In 1967, the same bust size was a size 8. In 2011, it was a size 0. Some argue that vanity sizing is designed to satisfy wearers' wishes to appear thin and feel better about themselves. This works by adhering to the theory of compensatory self-enhancement, as vanity sizing promotes a more positive self-image of one upon seeing a smaller label. Designer Nicole Miller introduced size 0 because of its strong California presence and to satisfy the request of many Asian customers. It introduced subzero sizes for naturally petite women. However, the increasing size of clothing with the same nominal size caused Nicole Miller to introduce size 0, 00, or subzero sizes. The UK's Chief Medical Officer has suggested that vanity sizing has contributed to the normalisation of obesity in society. \n\nIn 2003, a study that measured over 1,000 pairs of women's pants found that pants from more expensive brands tended to be smaller than those from cheaper brands with the same nominal size.\n\nAlthough more common in women's apparel, vanity sizing occurs in men's clothing as well. For example, men's pants are traditionally marked with two numbers, \"waist\" (waist circumference) and \"inseam\" (distance from the crotch to the hem of the pant). While the nominal inseam is fairly accurate, the nominal waist may be quite a bit smaller than the actual waist, in US sizes. In 2010, Abram Sauer of \"Esquire\" measured several pairs of dress pants with a nominal waist size of 36 at different US retailers and found that actual measurements ranged from 37 to 41 inches. The phenomenon has also been noticed in the United Kingdom, where a 2011 study found misleading labels on more than half of checked items of clothing. In that study, worst offenders understated waist circumferences by 1.5 to 2 inches. London-based market analyst Mintel say that the number of men reporting varying waistlines from store to store doubled between 2005 and 2011.\n\n\n"}

Evaristo described the work as \"timely and accessible\", \"comprehensive and journalistic\" as well as \"resolutely unacademic\", comparing it to the work of African-American writer Roxane Gay, whose 2014 anthology \"Bad Feminist\" \"treads some of the same ground\". However, she critiques Eddo-Lodge for not engaging in enough \"rigorous research, particularly into the past\" and for the fact that she \"completely overlooks\" the work of Black British feminist writers like Beverley Bryan, Stella Dadzie and Suzanne Scafe. Evaristo also noted that the book leaves open further questions, such as \"What is the responsibility of black people in creating change for ourselves? Without also taking responsibility, we are dependent and powerless. What about the numerous positive developments since \"Windrush\"?\" \n\nArifa Akbar reviewed the work for the \"Financial Times\", noting that Eddo-Lodge \"builds on a critical tradition drawn from black American writers\" like W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and bell hooks. Akbar notes that \"Not everyone will find the answer to racial inequality in Eddo-Lodge's reliance on white consciousness-raising, but it is an important shift that undermines the idea that racism is the BAME community's burden to carry. The liberation that this book offers is in the reversal of responsibilities.\"\n\nWriting for \"The Guardian\", Colin Grant places the book within a wider tradition of \"angry warnings to an ignorant white readership\", the majority of which have been produced by African-American rather than Black British writers. Grant opined that \"Eddo-Lodge accurately takes the temperature of racial discussions in the UK\" but that several sections, such as its discussion of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, are too brief, stating that \"this kind of book is not designed to delve beyond the headlines in order to draw lessons from the past\".\n\nReviewing the work for NPR, the journalist Silvia Viñas stated that the work's \"boldness\" and \"straight talk\" is what makes it \"memorable\", also noting that while focusing \"on events in Britain, it's still accessible to readers of black American history.\"\n"}
