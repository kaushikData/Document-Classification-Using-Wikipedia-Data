The book contains thirteen ghost stories from the U.S. state of Alabama. The book was the first in a series of seven \"Jeffrey\" books, most featuring ghost stories from a Southern state. Jeffrey in the book's title refers to a ghost that allegedly haunts Windham's home.\n\nThe foreword of the book describes how Windham came to be interested in ghost stories. It began with ghostly incidents in the Windham family home in Selma that Windham attributed to a spirit she dubbed \"Jeffrey\". At first, the family heard footsteps in rooms that would later be found empty. A supposed photograph of Jeffrey, included in the book, was taken inside the home. On the night the picture was made, some young people visiting the house decided to play with a Ouija board, trying to contact Jeffrey. When they developed the photos taken that night, a shadowy vaguely human-like shape was seen beside a girl in the photograph. Soon after it was taken Windham contacted Figh, who was a noted collector of ghost stories, to ask about Jeffrey. Out of that meeting, the idea of \"13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey\" was born.\n\nIn the preface to the book, Windham says that although there are many ghost stories in Alabama, she wanted to choose stories for her book that had \"entertained many generations\" and were \"a treasured part of Southern folklore\". Windham sought stories from which she could describe not only the ghost, but also the community and lifestyles of the people who first reported the haunting. Windham spends as much time describing the people and places around the ghost stories as she does the ghost itself.\n\n\nDespite being very popular in Alabama, the book attracted some controversy from certain Christians in the state who said that the book promoted beliefs incompatible with Christianity. In fact, Windham said that she had received letters from people telling her she is doomed to hell for writing the \"Jeffrey\" books. In an interview with \"The Birmingham News\", Windham responded to these claims, saying \"If I'm going to hell — and I can't deny that, because it's not for me to judge — it won't be for telling ghost stories; I have far greater shortcomings than that.\"\n\n\"13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey\" has been adapted into a stage musical by Don Everett Garrett and Kevin Francis Finn. Kathryn Tucker Windham gave her blessing for the adaptation and saw the premiere at Red Mountain Theatre Company's Cabaret Theatre in October 2010, prior to her death. The musical is now available to schools and arts organizations from the authors.\n"}
{"id": "26423308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26423308", "title": "Anyeint", "text": "Anyeint\n\nAnyeint (; ; ; also spelt a-nyeint) is a traditional Burmese entertainment form that combines dance with instrumental music, song, and comedy routines, in theatrical performances. It is a form of \"pwe\", the Burmese word for traditional entertainment. While classical \"pwe\" can be quite formal and almost ritualistic, \"anyeint\" is considered light entertainment.\n\nIn recent years, popular \"anyeint\" troupes such as Thee Lay Thee & Say Yaung Zoun () and \"Htawara Hninzi\" () have performed overseas, including Thailand, Singapore and the United States, which have large Burmese immigrant populations. VCDs of popular troupes' performances are also widely distributed; politically insensitive ones, including \"Say Yaung Zoun\" (), have been banned by Burmese authorities.\n\nThe lead singer and dancer in an \"anyeint\" performance is called the \"anyeint minthami\" (). Well-known film actresses and singers, including May Than Nu and Yadana Khin, are often featured as lead \"anyeint\" actresses. The \"anyeint minthami\" dances to instrumental music and singing either a cappella or to music are interspersed with comedic dialogue and slapstick performed by clowns. The result is a sequence of solo and group dances. The costumes of \"anyeint\" performers are identical to those worn by puppets in traditional marionette theater. Although lead actresses were once the main focus of performances, the focus has now shifted to the comedic skits performed.\n\nSlapstick comedians, known as \"lu shwin daw\" () or \"lu pyet\" (, although this term is falling out of usage) provide entertainment while the \"minthami\" changes outfits. Zaganar and Kutho were successful comedians in early \"anyeint\" revival. In more recent times, well-known film actors and singers, such as Ye Lay, Nay Toe and Htun Htun, Kyaw Kyaw Bo, have featured as comedians. Comedians typically dressed in checkered-patterned Taungshay-style \"longyi\" (sarongs) and wear loose coats, a development innovated by U Po Sein, an influential 19th-century performer.\n\nA small all-male music orchestra, led by the \"pattala\" (xylophone) music, accompanies the performance.\n\nAnyeint performances begin with a recitation and explanation of ancient verses, followed by a \"pari kamma\" (), a formal speech by troupe members to introduce themselves and thank the show's patron. Comedians then provide an introductory slapstick skit, before inviting the lead actress to the stage for a performance, during which they will provide improvised jokes and playful insults to the audience. At the end of the dance set, comedians direct jokes at the actress, who rebuts them and defends herself.\n\nIn the past, the anyeint performance was concluded with a verse play called \"zat kyi\" (), although this portion is now omitted from contemporary anyeint programmes.\n\nThe name \"anyeint\" comes from a Burmese language word meaning \"gentle\". The form originated as a royal court dance performed by female dancers and was originally confined to the royal court. However, after the end of the Konbaung dynasty in 1885, anyeint troupes were forced to seek work outside and popularized a hybrid dance and comedic performance that has become popular throughout Burma, especially appealing to the growing merchant class in British Burma, who patronised and sponsored these performances. The first known anyeint troupe was formed in Mandalay around 1900, by comedian U Chit Phwe and his wife, dancer Ma Sein Thone.\n\nIn the colonial era, famous anyeint actresses often became recording artists and were the headlines of anyeint shows, as composers wrote individual songs and dances suited to them. However, the importance of the lead actress has diminished. Anyeint reached its height in the 1970s, during a period of socialist rule, with one of the most influential troupes being Mandalay's \"Lamin Taya\" (The Hundred Moon Troupe). In 1973, the troupe's scriptwriter, Maung Myat Hmaing wrote \"Dancer of the Ganges\", which was one of the first Burmese plays to include the concept of democracy.\n\nDuring the colonial, U Nu and Ne Win administrations, troupes commonly included political satire and critiques, including social commentary, as part of their skits. However, since 1988, regulations have become stricter, with comedians who perform political satire subject to arrest. From 1988 to 1992, a military curfew at night prohibited all-night anyeint performances.\n\nSince the release of the \"anyeint\" play \"Hninzi Thakhin\" (, lit. \"Rose Master\") in 2010, censorship of play contents have become stricter; the Myanmar Motion Picture Enterprise, the censorship body that regulates all \"anyeint\" troupes in the country, now mandates a full dress rehearsal to audit for any questionable content (such as jokes targeted at government officials, or cross-dressing scenes).\n\nThe Burmese comedian, Zarganar, has frequently performed in anyeint. In 1986, he formed the Mya Ponnama Anyeint troupe, whose performances have appeared on television. The Burmese performance art Htein Lin has also performed anyeint, which is an influence in his performance art.\n"}

Along with the \"Ostasiatische Zeitschrift\" (founded in 1912) it was one of the most successful journals in its field in the German-speaking part of Europe. The first number of \"Artibus Asiae\" appeared in 1925. While earlier issues contained articles in German, French and English, today's contributions are mainly in English. \"Artibus Asiae\" is owned and published by the Museum Rietberg in Zurich. \"Artibus Asiae\" also published occasional monographs since 1937.\n\nThe first volume of the journal was published by the Avalun-Verlag Hellerau-Dresden in 1925 and was edited by Carl Hentze (1883–1975) and Alfred Salmony (1890–1958). The early volumes appeared in four issues each, up to vol. 59. All subsequent volumes were published in two parts. \n\nThe typographer, publisher and later editor-in-chief Richard Hadl (1876–1944) had worked for the Leipzig-based publisher \"Drugulin\" as a director since 1922. \"Drugulin\" was one of the leading publishing houses and known for their wide array of unusual typesets. Hadl established his own publishing house, \"Offizin Richard Hadl\", in 1926. and published five volumes of the journal \"Artibus Asiae\".\n\nDuring the Second World War all publishing activities were moved to Switzerland and the journal would only appear irregularly. Vol. 8 no. 1 was the first issue to be published in Switzerland, printed by the \"Kommissionsverlag Braus Riggenbach\" in Basel. All further volumes were published by \"Artibus Asiae\" in Ascona, where Hadl and his co-worker and publisher, Luise C. Tarabori-Flesch from Trier had settled in 1938/39. After Hadl had died in 1944, Miss Flesch kept the journal afloat on her own until 1946, when Alfred Salmony became editor-in-chief. Salmony edited the journal until his death in 1958.\n\n\"Artibus Asiae\"'s link to the current owner, the Museum Rietberg, was established through the museums's former director Elsy Leuzinger, who edited an issue (vol. 20 no. 1, 1957) to commemorate the founding donor of the Museum Rietberg, Eduard von der Heydt. In 1985 (from vol. 46 on), the Arthur M. Sackler Foundation started to sponsor the journal. The Museum Rietberg was granted a special publication endowment in 1991 (vol. 51) and it henceforth became the owner of both the journal and the monograph series.\n\nThe following persons have served as editors-in-chief of \"Artibus Asiae\":\nLonger articles submitted to \"Artibus Asiae\" were often split into parts and published in several numbers of the journal. \"Artibus Asiae\" started to publish monographs on selected topics in 1937 to allow more lengthy contributions to the field. They are conceived as a supplemental series to the journal and present a broad range of lavishly illustrated studies. Early monographs were on topics only remotely related to the arts, such as publications on the Tibetan grammar books Sum cu pa and Rtags kyi ‘ajug or on Chinese literature. \n"}
{"id": "35803371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35803371", "title": "As I Opened Fire", "text": "As I Opened Fire\n\nAs I Opened Fire (sometimes As I Opened Fire...) is a 1964 oil and magna on canvas painting by Roy Lichtenstein. The work is hosted at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. The source of the subject matter is Jerry Grandenetti's panels from \"Wingmate of Doom,\" in \"All American Men of War\", no. 90 (March–April 1962), DC Comics.\n\nMeasuring 170 cm × 430 cm (68 in × 168 in), \"As I Opened Fire\" is a triptych with verbal and temporal continuity. In 1972, it was regarded as \"...perhaps Lichtenstein's most ambitious exercise in strangely uniting, visually (as well as figuratively) warring elements.\" Depicting a short few seconds during an aircraft battle, the painting is based on three panels of the original narrative which Lichtenstein has altered to improve its formal coherence. This piece represents his affinity towards \"...highly emotional content, yet detached impersonal handling...\" \"As I Opened Fire\" exhibits Lichtenstein's \"formal imagination\". We see successive tighter views of the gun muzzles in action accompanied by an onomatopoeia, which provides cinematic flow despite the varying skies. \"As I Opened Fire\" is regarded as a \"very uncompromising military triptych\".\nLichtenstein desired his paintings to look as mechanical as possible despite being painted by hand. He chose as his subjects teen and action comics because he valued the impersonal quality of their artwork, the products of teams of illustrators. The similarities to the original source are extensive: narrative text and general message of the gunfire. However, he made the joint image more coherent by repositioning the second and third panels for better alignment.\n\nAlong with \"Whaam!\" (the other of his monumental war paintings), this is regarded as the culmination of the dramatic war-comic works of Lichtenstein. Compared with \"Whaam!\", \"As I Opened Fire\" is more abstract. Lichtenstein commented on his war imagery: \"A minor purpose of my war paintings is to put military aggressiveness in an absurd light. My personal opinion is that much of our foreign policy has been unbelievably terrifying, but this is not what my work is about and I don't want to capitalize on this popular position. My work is more about our American definition of images and visual communication.\" Lichtenstein's alterations from the original source change the uniform perspective of the images, causing it to flow \"like a series of movie clips\".\n\nThe work is considered relatively lacking in unity of its narrative progression. The narrative of the first frame seems unrelated to its graphics and the other frames are equally confusing: It is not clear which frames represent an enemy or an ally, or whether the speaker is the enemy, an ally or the viewer. In general the work is misleading in \"spatial, temporal and psychological viewpoint\".\n\n\n\n"}

Cassidy explained in an essay titled \"Private Parts: A Judicial View\" that exposure of a buttock cleavage may come under \"other private parts\" in Australian law, though indecency generally involves exposure of the genital area.\n\nIn the early 2000s it became fashionable for young women and men to expose their buttocks this way, often in tandem with low rise jeans. \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" called it the \"new cleavage\", and expressed views that \"It's virtually impossible to find jeans to cover your hipbone\". In August 2001, \"The Sun\" celebrated a \"bum cleavage week\" claiming that \"bums are the new tits\".

The expression \"builder's bum\" was first recorded in 1988. The terms are based on the popular impression that work in these professions frequently involves bending over in locations where bystanders are observing from the rear.\n\nIn the Netherlands the term and in Germany and in Poland is used, which can be translated as \"builder's/mason's/plumber's cleavage\".

In physics, C-symmetry means the symmetry of physical laws under a charge-conjugation transformation. Electromagnetism, gravity and the strong interaction all obey C-symmetry, but weak interactions violate C-symmetry.\n\nThe laws of electromagnetism (both classical and quantum) are invariant under this transformation: if each charge \"q\" were to be replaced with a charge −\"q\", and thus the directions of the electric and magnetic fields were reversed, the dynamics would preserve the same form. In the language of quantum field theory, charge conjugation transforms:\n\n\nNotice that these transformations do not alter the chirality of particles. A left-handed neutrino would be taken by charge conjugation into a left-handed antineutrino, which does not interact in the Standard Model. This property is what is meant by the \"maximal violation\" of C-symmetry in the weak interaction.\n\nIt was believed for some time that C-symmetry could be combined with the parity-inversion transformation (see P-symmetry) to preserve a combined CP-symmetry. However, violations of this symmetry have been identified in the weak interactions (particularly in the kaons and B mesons). In the Standard Model, this CP violation is due to a single phase in the CKM matrix. If CP is combined with time reversal (T-symmetry), the resulting CPT-symmetry can be shown using only the Wightman axioms to be universally obeyed.\n\nTo give an example, take two real scalar fields, \"φ\" and \"χ\". Suppose both fields have even C-parity (even C-parity refers to even symmetry under charge conjugation e.g., formula_4, as opposed to odd C-parity which refers to antisymmetry under charge conjugation, e.g., formula_5). \n\nDefine formula_6. Now, and have even \"C\"-parities, and the imaginary number \"i\" has an odd \"C\"-parity (\"C\" is anti-unitary). Under \"C\", \"ψ\" goes to \"ψ\".\n\nIn other models, it is also possible for both \"φ\" and \"χ\" to have odd C-parities.\n\n"}

His father was a successful military tailor with an establishment (Thomas Holt & Son) in Piccadilly. He was variously described in his younger days as actor, acrobat and comedian and eventually adopted the stage name of Clarance. Holt made his stage debut in 1842 as Timothy in William Thomas Moncrieff's farce \"All at Coventry\" at the Victoria Theatre, London. He married Marian Browne (sometimes named Marian Vaughan) in 1847 and they were acting together by 1850 when he was appointed manager of the Theatre Royal, Norwich under the name of Joseph Clarance.\n\nHolt went to Melbourne with his wife in September 1854 at the suggestion of George Coppin.

She was the founder of Daisy Film, which produced ...\"Bolscevismo??\" (...\"Bolshevism,\" 1922) and \"Sovrana\" (\"Sovereign,\" 1923), both considered lost films.\n\nSylvan was born Elena Mazzantini in Rome on July 12, 1874. Her parentage is unknown, although it is unlikely that she was born to aristocrats, as was once thought.\n\nLittle is known about Sylvan's early life and career. It is likely that she studied with well-known actor and acting coach Luigi Rasi in Florence. In 1918, Sylvan announced that she had written two film scripts, presumably for ...\"Bolscevismo??\" and \"Sovrana\". In 1919, Sylvan legally established her own production company, Daisy Film, located on Via Strozzi in Florence. Both films were completed in 1920, though seemingly not distributed until 1922 and 1923, respectively. Sylvan was plagued by accusations of union violations throughout her tenure as studio head. Records suggest that Sylvan may have unlawfully terminated workers at Daisy Film, though it is likely that these infractions were amplified in the press by Sylvan's professional rivals.\n\nWhile this film in not extant, promotional materials show that \"...Bolscevismo??\" was a morality play set during the Russian Revolution. \"...Bolscevismo??\" was based loosely on the novel \"The\" \"Flame in the Steppe\" by Danilo Korsakoff. The film tells the story of sisters Elena and Enelia Morgani, both played by Sylvan. Elena is represented as hardworking and good while Enelia is shown to be disloyal and morally corrupt. Indeed, one pamphlet for the film suggests that Enelia has stolen Elena's husband. Elena, Sylvan's namesake and surrogate in the film, manages workers at a factory in a town called Selenio. A vicious Bolshevik journalist named Zobisant sets out to destroy Elena's personal life and career. Ultimately, Elena defeats Zobisant, leaving him begging for her forgiveness at the end of the film.\n\nThis film was shot largely on location in Florence, with some scenes filmed at Daisy Film's small studio.\n\nSylvan began working on ...\"Bolscevismo\" around 1918 and completed filming by 1920, according to news sources. Though passed by censors and distributed in 1922, the film was never shown theatrically.\n\nLike \"...Bolscevismo??\", \"Sovrana\" is considered a lost film. Existing promotional materials suggest that the film was based on a comedic play by Dario Nicodemi. The plot concerns a young woman, Giana, who is rescued from the underworld by actor Luigi Rasi (Daisy Sylvan's real life mentor). It seems that the film's title, \"Sovrana (Sovereign),\" refers to the protagonist's rejection of romantic overtures, choosing instead to remain \"sovereign of her heart.\"\n\nSylvan married Francesco Rosso in Rome in 1897. The couple officially separated in 1902, though remained legally married until Rosso's death in 1920. Sylvan and Rosso had at least one child (a son) together.\n"}
{"id": "25739612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25739612", "title": "Digital Live Art", "text": "Digital Live Art\n\nDigital Live Art is the intersection of Live Art (art form), Computing and Human Computer Interaction (HCI). It is used to describe live performance which is computer mediated - an orchestrated, temporal witnessed event occurring for any length of time and in any place using technological means. Digital Live Art borrows the methods, tools and theories from HCI to help inform and analyze the design and evaluation of Digital Live Art experiences.\n\nCentral to the understanding of Digital Live Art is the concept of performance framing (social sciences). First identified by Gregory Bateson, the performance frame is described as a cognitive context where all the rules of behavior, symbols, and their interpretations are bound within a particular activity within its own structure. The concept has since been used extensively in ethnography by Erving Goffman in his discussions of face to face encounters in the everyday, in discourse structures; in theatrical and ritual events; sporting events and festivals; and trance phenomena (see:).\n\nGoffman’s work uses the concept of performance frame to broadly mean a constructed context within the limits of which individual human agency and social interaction takes place. For example, a theatrical frame, pp. 124–155) involves the construction of a higher-level frame on top of a ‘primary framework’, i.e., the reality in which the fantasy takes place. In this example, actors assume a character, audiences suspend disbelief and events have their meaning transformed (e.g., compare the use of a mobile phone in public with its use in a theatre). Additionally, framings are temporal, meaning that they have specific beginning and endings. While many theorists argue that all social interaction may be seen from a dramaturgical perspective, meaning all everyday social interaction becomes performance in some sense, Digital Live Art theorists often deliberately align their work with Richard Schechner, narrowing their analysis to cover more stabilized ‘established’ forms of performance so that performance framing is defined as an activity done within the intended frame ‘by an individual or group’ who have some established knowledge about the frame, and are ‘in the presence of and for another individual or group’. Performance framings then, are intentional, temporal and for an audience.\n\nThe goal of interaction in Digital Live Art goes beyond that of traditional HCI methods and theory which focus on usability, functionality and efficiency. HCI and CSCW models often focus on workplace activities and their tasks, artefacts and goals. This research often leads to a better understanding of how to increase efficiency in the workplace by providing more efficient and usable interfaces. For example, one could conduct usability testing or task analysis of how a DJ uses his DJ decks and one could then use this information to design a more efficient system.\n\nHowever, traditional HCI models tell us little about how the performer-audience relationship develops as a result of users wittingness to interact with the system. The intention with Digital Live Art is not to make more \"usable\" systems but rather to allow for \"participatory transitions\" - transitions between \"witting and unwitting\", between observation and participation, between participation and performance. Since the goal with Digital Live Art systems is to \"mediate wittingness\" rather than task-focused interaction, the application of many HCI models, frameworks and methods become insufficient for analyzing and evaluating Digital Live Art.\n\nSheridan first introduced the Performance Triad Model for analyzing \"tripartite interaction\" - interaction between observers, participants and performers. In the Performance Triad Model, tripartite interaction where technology binds tripartite interaction to context and environment. Reeves et al. draws a distinction between a performer and a spectator and how their transitioning relationship as mediated by the interface.\n\nDix and Sheridan introduced a formal method for analyzing \"performative interaction\" in Digital Live Art. This formal method provides a mathematical technique for deconstructing interaction between witting and unwitting bystanders and observers, participants in the performance and the performers themselves. The work attempts to formalise some of the basic attributes of performative interaction against a background of sociological analysis in order to better understand how computer interfaces may support performance. This work shows how this generic formalisation can be used in the deconstruction, analysis and understanding of performative action and more broadly in live performance.\n\nBigDog Interactive\n\nBlast Theory\n\nLady Gaga\n\nMixed Reality Lab\n\n.:thePooch:.\n"}

A total of 22 unions belonging to different trades in the film and television industry are affiliated to the FEFSI that has around 25,000 members.\n\nIn June 1997, some members of the FEFSI resorted to a flash strike during the shooting of the film \"Raman Abdullah\", directed by Balu Mahendra, protesting against the director engaging \"outsiders\". This led into a major crisis when FEFSI launched an indefinite strike, affecting other film units as well. The state government's intervened and FEFSI called off the strike after a week. However, the producers hardened their stand and insisted that they would not engage any technician or worker associated with FEFSI. They complained that the rising wages of technical staff and artistes were contributing towards the box office run of Tamil films in 1997. They demanded that workers and technicians form new organisations exclusively for the production of Tamil films, on the lines of organisations in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. The issue escalated when the organisation's leader Vijayan declined to budge from his demands and was able failed to gather support from a series of prominent actors and film director Bharathiraja. vijayan also became the key person for the strike which led to suicide of some members and some lost their asserts due to this strike.\n\nFilms delayed included \"Marudhanayagam\", \"Jeans\", \"Sethu\" and \"Kadhal Rojave\". Producer K. T. Kunjumon said his losses amounted to 3 lakhs after a large set he had erected for his film \"Ratchagan\" (a replica of the massive Rajaji Hall) was destroyed in the rain. Several new Cielo cars parked near the set were also damaged, resulting in a loss of another 7 lakhs, he claimed. The strike lasted for over six months, delaying the production of several films before easing. In June 1998, FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Association (TFPA) merged and formed a new organisation called the Tamil Nadu Film Producers and Employees Federation. An agreement to this effect was signed by the representatives of the two organisations in the presence of then Chief Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi.\n\nTalks between FEFSI and the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) over wages and working hours became a heated matter in early 2011 and FEFSI members wanted the issue regarding increase in salary to be sorted out immediately, calling for a strike in June 2011.\n\nAn unofficial two-week strike was held in early February 2012, with nearly 5000 members of FEFSI engaging on a day-long hunger strike at Isai Kalaignargal Sangam in Vadapalani, demanding that the Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC) implement the revised wages for its members. The strike was made official briefly in April 2012 but did not disrupt any big-budget film productions, and soon the problems were eased out after the intervention of the State's Labour Minister S. T. Chellapandian.\n\nA clash broke out when the drivers' union learnt that one of the camera crews supposedly hired a private agency for their logistics, instead of approaching the assigned drivers and this was contrary to union expectations. After brief disturbances in May 2013, FEFSI announced a decision to boycott all vehicles of the drivers’ union. In June 2013, FEFSI announced that they would go an indefinite strike after it was alleged that members of the drivers union had assaulted members of the technicians union at Nerkundram Paadhai on Monday, when they were loading food into an autorickshaw for a film shoot. Two days later the strike was cancelled and film shootings resumed.\n\nAs a fallout of the strike, the Tamil Nadu Chinna Thirai Producers Council president Raadhika announced that the council had decided to break away from FEFSI.\n\nleaders\n\n"}
{"id": "14597486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14597486", "title": "Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream", "text": "Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream\n\nFriday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream is a 1990 non-fiction book written by H. G. Bissinger. The book follows the story of the 1988 Permian High School Panthers football team from Odessa, Texas, as they made a run towards the Texas state championship. While originally intended to be a \"Hoosiers\"-type chronicle of high school sports that holds together a small town, the final book ended up being critical about life in the town of Odessa. It was later adapted for television and film.\n\nBissinger was a journalist for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" when he was selected as a Harvard Neiman Fellow. It was while he was at Harvard that the idea to write a book focused upon the role high school football plays within American society, in particular rural society, took hold. Bissinger returned to \"The Inquirer\" briefly, received a Pulitzer Prize, and then took off in search of a community for which high school football was paramount. He settled on Odessa, Texas. Permian High School and its football team, the Permian Panthers, had a substantial, rich history of winning in Texas' 4A and 5A division, having won championships in 1965, 1972, 1980, and 1984. Bissinger moved his family to Odessa and spent the entire 1988 football season with the Permian Panther players, their families, their coaches, and even many of the townspeople in an effort to understand the town and its football-mad culture.\n\n\nIn the 5A playoff semifinals, Permian meets Dallas Carter Cowboys, a predominantly black team. In a hard fought game in the rain at Memorial Stadium in Austin, the Panthers are defeated 14–9. Dallas Carter, led by future Miami Hurricanes and New York Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead, goes on to win the state championship, but faced severe penalties for their grade tampering, giving the state championship to Judson High School almost three years later.\n\nThe book ends with Coach erasing names of the seniors from his board and replacing them with names of the juniors who will replace them next season. Permian goes undefeated the next year, with future NFL player Stoney Case as quarterback, and becomes the 1989 Texas state football champions.\n\nPrologue\n\nBissinger discusses the Midland Lee game, as Permian's arch rival. The game is played on October 28, 1988. He introduces the characters of Gary Gaines, Mike Winchell, Don Billingsley, Boobie Miles, Ivory Christian, Brian Chavez and Jerrod McDougal and gives insight into their personalities, thoughts and their pregame rituals. Former star, Boobie knows his performance against Midland Lee will be important for his future. He hasn't played well since August when he injured his knee in a preseason scrimmage, but the coaches never put Boobie in the game. Permian puts up a valiant fight but lose 22–21. After the game, a furious Boobie storms out of the locker room and quits the team two days later.\n\nChapter 1: Odessa\n\nBissinger begins the book at the start of the 1988 football season in August and how Gaines is preparing for it. Bissinger then chronicles the history of Odessa. It was founded in the 1880s by land speculators from Zanesville, Ohio. They advertised the land as being as fertile farmland like in Kansas and Iowa. However, the settlers quickly discovered that it was dry and arid. The town saw little growth until 1926 when oil was discovered in the Permian Basin (hence the high school's name). Almost overnight, the town boomed and it saw more growth in a month than it had seen in ten years. The population increased dramatically and money was everywhere. In town, the roads were so muddy that the oil workers, (nicknamed boomers), often had to bring in cattle to pull the equipment to the oil fields. According to the book, \"diarrhea, lawlessness, overcrowding, bad water, prostitution, and a rat problem\" plagued the town. Out in the oil fields, the boomers worked round the clock to make their money. Meanwhile, Odessa High School's football team garnered success by winning the state championship in 1946 and making it back to the championship in 1953, thus laying the foundation for football fanaticism. Another boom in the 1950s led to the opening of Permian High School in 1959. Permian proved quickly that it was not going to play second to Odessa High. They became known as the embodiment of Odessa: small, white and overachieving. Meanwhile, due to demographic shifts and oddly drawn boundaries, Odessa High became populated with mainly poor whites and poor Hispanics—while a substantial majority of the city's relatively small black population ended up in the Permian attendance zone. This is not to say, however, that Permian didn't have its share of poor people from all major ethnic groups.\n\nChapter 2: The Watermelon Feed\n\nBissinger talks about the Watermelon Feed held at Permian in August as a preseason celebration. He then chronicles the history of Permian football. Since its founding in 1959, it had won the state championship in 1965, 1972, 1980 and 1984. Despite the fact that it only won one state championship in the 1970s, Permian had statistically been the winningest team in the state of Texas. Bissinger then discusses the pressure that Gaines is constantly under because of how intensely devoted the Permian fans are. High school football is used as a distraction for the once thriving community of Odessa which had gone into a slump when the second boom ended.\n\nChapter 3: Boobie\n\nThis chapter focuses upon the black star fullback, James \"Boobie\" Miles, who is Permian's ticket to the state championship. Bissinger uses Boobie as an example of the negative effect high school football can have its players. Boobie is not a good student and doesn't have to worry about grades because he will most likely get a football scholarship to a major college. The dream seems all too real until, in August, during a scrimmage in Lubbock, Boobie injured his knee. With the season opener only a week away, no one knows what to do. Now the pressure is on quarterback Mike Winchell. Meanwhile, junior running back Chris Comer is called up to replace Boobie.\n\nChapter 4: Dreaming of Heroes\n\nThis chapter focuses upon the life of Mike Winchell, Permian's starting quarterback. Mike lived with his mother. His father, Billy, died when Mike was just thirteen. Billy had always been keen on Mike's playing football when he was a little kid. Mike's older brother, Joe Bill, took over that role but, in 1988, Joe Bill had moved out. Mike was very intelligent and received an offer of admission from Brown University but had prospects of playing football only at a smaller college. Don Billingsley is Permian's starting Tailback and son of the legendary Charlie Billingsley who played football in the 1960s. Don, whose mother had been a Permian cheerleader while Charlie played football, moved from Blanchard, Oklahoma to Odessa in 1986 before his sophomore year. Don and Charlie had always had a rocky relationship but it was all made better by football. Don was always inspired by his father's stories and always tried to live up to him. Yet, sometimes he faltered because he sometimes fumbled the ball on key plays.\n\nChapter 5: Black and White\n\nBissinger discusses the issue of race relations in Odessa which he describes as the ugliest racism he had ever witnessed. The town didn't desegregate until the 1980s and even then the schools were racially divided. Many viewed football as exploiting the talented black athletes by using them and then spitting them out afterwards.\n\nChapter 6: The Ambivalence of Ivory\n\nBissinger begins by discussing the life of Permian linebacker Ivory Christian. He originally thought he would go to Ector High School, where many poor blacks went, until Permian was desegregated in the early 1980s. Ivory had ambitions of becoming a minister at a Baptist church. Ivory gains these ambitions when he has a life changing dream that involves a dark tunnel and light. Because of this dream, Ivory decides that he will change his partying ways and turn his life over to God. Because of this decision, he becomes ambivalent towards football, what it represents, and for its beginning the inner battle between Homeric and Christian values.\n\nChapter 7: School Days\n\nBissinger spends the chapter discussing the situation at Permian High School. He highlights the misplaced priorities as well as bad spending. More money is spent on sports medical supplies than the entire English department. The teachers make less money than the coaches who are financially at the mercy of the boosters who seldom care about education. Permian's SAT scores have plummeted dramatically since the 1970s and no one seems to care as long as Permian wins football games. As a result, everyone including the football players suffers. As the season progresses, Permian begins winning games.\n\nChapter 8: East versus West\n\nBissnger discusses the Permian–Odessa High game. The cross town rivalry is fueled by the cultural difference between the schools. For one thing, Permian also got the majority of the Ector County education budget while Odessa High typically got what was left (which wasn't that much). Odessa High had once been the beacon of hope in the city. It won the 1946 state championship and did well overall. Then, Permian opened in 1959. The middle class whites went to Permian and the Mexicans went to Odessa High. Also, Permian hasn't lost to Odessa in over twenty years. Permian wins the game 35–7.\n\nChapter 9: Friday Night Politics\n\nBissinger discusses the political views in Odessa which has long been a Republican voting city. The 1988 election is coming up and it is clear that majority of its residents are going to vote for Republican candidate and then Vice President George H. W. Bush, who lived in the area in the 1940s and 1950s. They had loved Ronald Reagan so the choice was clear. Many view Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis as far too liberal and think he is out to destroy their way of life from his comfortable home in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, Permian rolls over Midland High School winning 35–0. Bissinger also discusses the life of Brian Chavez, the Permian tight end. Chavez is extremely smart and has ambitions of going to Harvard. His father Tony is a successful lawyer originally from El Paso, Texas. Tony had enlisted in the United States Army after high school. After he was discharged, he took his GI Bill money and decided to take law classes at Texas Tech in Lubbock eventually graduating with a law degree in 1978. He supported the family by working as a police officer in El Paso. On his trips between the two cities, he drove through Odessa and thought it was dirty, seedy and trashy, and so decided to work in Midland. However, once he graduated, he got a job offer in Odessa and moved his family there. In 1982, the family moved to the Country Club estates, the nicest part of town. Tony was, in many ways, the embodiment of the American dream.\n\nChapter 10: Boobie Who?\n\nBissinger discusses Boobie's football career after his injury. He thought the injury wasn't that serious and constantly tried to convince the coaches he could play. He played as a back up in several games but never got any serious playing time. But as Boobie's career is falling Mike Winchell's is soaring.\n\nChapter 11: Sisters\n\nBissinger discusses the Permian-Midland Lee rivalry. Even though the two towns were very similar, the hatred ran deep. Odessans viewed Midland as a town full of rich snobs and Midlanders view Odessa as a city full of rednecks, money burners and drunks. In 1983 an article in \"Forbes\" magazine named Midland one of the nicest places to live in America. At the same time, \"Newsweek\" named Odessa \"Murder Capital U.S.A.\" with a record 29.8 murders per 100,000 residents. Bissinger traces the roots of the hatred to the second oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The boom had been brought by the oil embargo by OPEC as well as the Iranian Revolution, the 1973 Oil Crisis, the 1979 Energy Crisis and the Carter Energy Policy. Oil prices skyrocketed and for the second time in forty years the boom was on. People were making money left and right in both Midland and Odessa. There were stories of welders who could barely read making as much as $90,000 a year. Stories abounded of business men buying Lear jets and building huge homes for no other reason than the fact that they could. The oil executives thought they were in control of everything and didn't realize it was all circumstantial. Once the embargo ended, the boom was over. The final nail in the coffin was the closing of the First National Bank of Midland in October 1983 as a result of the 1980s oil glut and the Permian Basin never fully recovered. Bissinger also discusses the effects that the Reagan 1980s had on the Odessa-Midland Area.\n\nChapter 12: Civil War\n\nAfter Permian loses to Midland Lee the fate of the season is unclear. Gaines is now under tremendous pressure and wonders if he will still have a job in a year's time. In two seasons Gaines had only gotten as far as the third round of playoffs. Boobie Miles quietly quits the team. Meanwhile, Jerrod McDougal, the Permian defensive tackle who knew he wouldn't play football in college, was devastated at the prospect of the season ending so early. Permian, Midland High and Midland Lee are all tied with one district loss each and only two can go to represent the district in the 1988 playoffs. It will be decided in a coin toss.\n\nPermian ends the regular season beating the San Angelo Bobcats 41–7. But now it all comes down to a coin toss. Coach Gaines and Mike Belew drive to meet the head coaches of Midland High and Midland Lee. The event is held at a truck stop on the south side of Midland at 2:00 am local time. The location is undisclosed and it is broadcast live on TV. When the coin toss finally happens there it is originally thought to be a tie. Then it turns out that Permian and Midland Lee landed heads and Midland High landed tails. The two teams will continue their seasons while Midland High's season is over.\n\nChapter 14: Friday Night addiction\n\nThe playoffs have finally arrived. Permian first defeats Tascosa High School in Amarillo 21–7. They then play Andress High School in El Paso in the Sun Bowl, winning 41–13. The Saturday after Thanksgiving, Permian beats the Irving Nimitz Vikings, a team ranked sixth in the state, 41–7. Bissinger also explores the fates of many famous Permian players and how many of them ended right back in Odessa. He cites these stories as key examples of the false world Permian football can have on its players. Permian then beats Arlington Lamar 21–7. But now it was on to play the team many called the best high school football team in the state if not the country—the David W. Carter High School Cowboys from Dallas.\n\nChapter 15: The Algebraic Equation\n\nBissinger spends the chapter discussing the football players at Dallas Carter High School, which is an all black upper middle class high school. The football obsession at Dallas Carter dwarfs the one at Permian. Players skipped classes, left school to get lunch, and had their grades fixed by teachers so that they could play. This led to a court case when a teacher, Will Bates, refused to lie about the algebra grade of a key player, Gary Edwards. The case was won and Dallas Carter got to continue their season. During the week of the game the coaches from Permian and Dallas Carter meet to decide where the game will be played. They eventually agree on Texas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas at Austin. They also agree on a racially mixed officiating crew to minimize any possible bias from that source.\n\nChapter 16: Field of Dreams\n\nPermian plays Dallas Carter on December 17, 1988. The game is extremely close with Permian initially ahead. Don Billingsley makes some great blocks. Ivory Christian makes an interception. Jerrod McDougal blocks exceptionally well, and Chris Comer moves the ball exceptionally well. But then a bad call in which the football bounced off the artificial turf of the field into a Carter receiver's hand. Carter then scores. Permian is now down 14–9. As the game draws to an end in the fourth quarter Permian gains the ball and starts gaining yards fast until finally the final seconds of the game are at hand with Permian on the Carter 24-yard line. Winchell gets ready to pass to Robert Brown. The ball is snapped, Winchell looks to Brown and throws the ball. It is incomplete. Permian loses 14–9. For the players, high school football is over and a big part of their lives has just ended. Right after the game the team heads home. McDougal, who loved football to death, lingered in the team locker room for a little longer than everyone else but eventually left to the locker room. Then Gaines and the coaches took down the magnetic names on the board. Bissinger ends the chapter saying, \"The season had ended, but another one had begun. People everywhere, young and old were already dreaming of heroes.\"\n\nEpilogue\n\nA week later, Dallas Carter won the 1988 Texas state championship. For the players, the sense of entitlement and the feeling that they could do whatever they wanted to reach an all-time high. Gary Edwards got a full scholarship to the University of Houston. However, in May 1989, Edwards and several other players committed an armed robbery in Dallas. They were arrested and they were tried in September. It was then discovered they had committed as many as ten robberies prior. Edwards, who initially thought he would just get probation, was sentenced to 16 years in prison. After some review it was decided that because of grade changing on the player's action, Dallas Carter was stripped of their state championship.\n\nBissinger then discusses the fates of the 1988 Permian Panthers. Brian Chavez went to Harvard but quit the football team after only one day because there was no bond. He instead decided to play rugby. Boobie Miles played football at Ranger College, a junior college. Jerrod McDougal attended Odessa College and then Midland College. Although he missed football he could find happiness in the knowledge that Permian football would go on forever. Don Billingsley went back to Oklahoma and at first played football for East Central University but then he severely injured his knee and needed surgery. Ivory Christian went to play for Texas Christian University but quit playing football after his freshman year. Mike Winchell played football for Baylor University but said it wasn't as great as Permian and lost a lot of his abilities.\n\n1989 saw the price of oil rise as high as $20 a barrel. Yet that same year saw 46% of the nation's oil imported, the highest in twelve years. As a result, West Texas continued to suffer economically. That year Odessa was named the second-worst place to live in America by the \"Places Rated Almanac\". Meanwhile, Permian was dominating on the football field. They redeemed themselves, beating Midland Lee 17–13. Permian continued to win in the playoffs and eventually got to the state championship. Among the players was quarterback Stoney Case who would eventually go on to play in the NFL for the Arizona Cardinals and Baltimore Ravens. Before the game Gary Gaines told the players, \"Everybody in this room has paid a dear, dear price. That ought to make your effort that much more intense, that much more fanatical, because of all the hard work and sacrifice that's gone into getting you here. It ought to make you play that much harder. You represent a lot of people. We're gonna represent them well and we're gonna win this sucker!\" The players then took the field. Odessa had gone through a ridiculous amount of change in the 1980s going from a place where anything was possible to a place where nothing was certain and everything was finite. Yet football had always been there. Bissinger ends the book by saying, \"It would always go on just as Jerrod McDougal had realized, because it was a way of life. The Permian Panthers ended the decade the same way they had begun it. Two days before Christmas, they became the state football champions of Texas.\"\n\nWhile Bissinger, who had taken a leave of absence from reporting for \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" to follow the team and write \"Friday Night Lights\", was writing the book, the University Interscholastic League (UIL) investigated the Permian Panthers football program, alleging that Bissinger took players out to eat and paid for the meals while interviewing them for the book, a violation of amateur rules. He also paid for Boobie Miles' car for an interview.\n\nThe book's release during the 1990 season coincided with the investigation of the team for holding illegal off-season practices, which resulted in the team's being declared ineligible for the playoffs and thus not participating in the post season for only the second time since 1980. Permian's absence from the playoffs allowed San Angelo Central into the playoffs for only the 3rd time since 1966. The negative reaction to the playoff situation was exacerbated by the book, and many residents of Odessa received the book with responses ranging from mild indignation to threats of physical violence aimed at the book's author.\n\nIn response to the negative reaction in Odessa, a bookstore cancelled a booksigning by the author, and T-shirts possessed by the population bore the words, \"Buzz off, Bissinger\".\n\nHowever, over time, the accuracy of the story has held up. The book has been reprinted frequently, including a 2000 reprint with a new afterword by the author detailing the team's accomplishments in the early part of the 1990s followed by the demise of the program in the latter part of the decade.\n\nIn 2002, \"Sports Illustrated\" named \"Friday Night Lights\" the fourth-greatest book ever written about sports.\n\nThe book inspired the short-lived television series \"Against the Grain\" (1993), starring a young Ben Affleck.\n\nA movie version of \"Friday Night Lights\" was made and then released in the United States on October 6, 2004. It starred Billy Bob Thornton as Permian Coach Gary Gaines. The film was a box office and critical success and, in turn, spawned the NBC television series of the same name, which ran five seasons from 2006–2011.\n\n"}

There have been found about 1500 punched out and carved rock images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings, and also people, carriages and various symbols. Chaotically drawn images of dancing people can be also met among the images. \n\nMany of these images were fixed not far from springs, in the territory of Garangush plateau. Images of people were carved schematically. Single, pair and group images can also be found there. A person’s image near a horse is considered one of the unique ones. \n\nImages of goats pointing to that, goats took a main place in cattle-breeding life of local population. On one of the rocks a painter portrayed a stressed leopard. Realistic drawings of deer are also very interesting. \n\nBeside the Garangush flat, there are rock carvings in Nabiyurdy and Jamishoglan territories. Petroglyphs drawn on black and gray stones have a pink appearance. Stone chipping, carving, and scrapping techniques were used while drawing images on Gamigaya. Images illustrate the rituals and spiritual life of ancient people in Nakhchivan as well as their economic life, lifestyle, craftsmanship skills.  Petroglyphs cover the ancient history of many centuries from primitive communal society to feudalism.\n\nTopographical positions of drawings are complicated. Drawings that are in group shape are mainly located near the water resources. Such drawings are observed in the northeast of Dali bulag. Far from these sources, drawings are observed less.\n\nA collection of Gamigaya petroglyphs, especially the ones nearby Bibgatal worship place, proves that they do not only illustrate people’s semi-nomadic lifestyle, but also the beliefs of ancient humans. For instance, there are pictures of a person and moon and sun above him shows the astrological beliefs and religious-ideological views of ancient people. Those pictures date back to IV-I millenniums B.C.\n\nBeside the pictures of animals, dancing people, and hunting people, there were found pictographic signs such as circles, triangles, rectangles, and fortune symbols. Those sings were found in I Kultapa, on the surface of clay plaque, which belongs to Bronze Age. \n\nDue to tough climate and heavy rains, approximately 150 settlements were buried under water in Kura-Aras lowlands. For that reason, people who lived in that territory moved to the mountains in west, where they put the foundation of Gamigaya rock art culture.\n\nThe investigation of Gamigaya petroglyphs started in 1968.  During 1970-1987, 2001-2002, and afterwards, A. Seyidov, N. Museyibli, V. Aliyev, and V. Bakhshaliyev conducted archaeological expeditions.  On 26 April 2001, Supreme Council of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic passed an order on “Research of Gamigaya monument in Ordubad district”. After the order, the number of archaeological expeditions increased.  New Gamigaya petroglyphs were found in 2008.\n\nRock art\n\nMinistry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan \n"}

Strongly anti-clerical and republican, his work was often on historical and religious themes, through which he sought to convey a message of opposition to monarchical and clerical oppression. His erudition and technical mastery were much admired in his time, but in later years his highly realistic technique, coupled to a theatrical \"mise-en-scène\", came to be regarded by some art-historians as overly didactic. More recently, however, his work has been re-evaluated as an important and original renewal of history painting, a genre of painting that was in decline during Laurens' lifetime.\n\nLaurens was commissioned to paint numerous public works by the French Third Republic, including the steel vault of the Paris City Hall, the monumental series on the life of Saint Genevieve in the apse of the Panthéon, the decorated ceiling of the Odéon Theater, and the hall of distinguished citizens at the Toulouse capitol. He also provided illustrations for Augustin Thierry's \"Récits des temps mérovingiens\" (\"Accounts of Merovingian Times\").\n\nLaurens was highly respected teacher at the Académie Julian, Paris, and a professor at the \"École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts\" in Paris, where he taught André Dunoyer de Segonzac and George Barbier. He died in Paris, aged 82. Two of his sons, Paul Albert Laurens (1870–1934) and Jean-Pierre Laurens (1875–1932), both also became painters and teachers at the Académie Julian.\n\n\n"}

It is listed at item 178 as \"Khurja Pottery\" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.\n\nOrigin of Khurja’s pottery work has been said with at least two different stories. In one legend, Afghan King Taimur Lung accompanied Egyptian and Syrian potters during his campaign in the Khurja region over 500 years ago. In another legend, potters had been moved to the region during Mughal Empire while another version says there we no long historical events in accordance with pottery tradition in Khurja.\n\nHowever, the author of \"Pottery-making Cultures and Indian Civilization\" mentioned that \"Khurja in Bulandshaher is one of the oldest centers for glazed pottery in India\". Further mentioned, \"These potters often call themselves as Multani Kumhars suggesting that their origin was Multan”.\n\nModern-day pottery manufacture flourished in the 1940s, and the Uttar Pradesh government set up a pottery factory in 1942.

In Spain, he was sentenced to death in 1936 for espionage under Francisco Franco's regime. Here, he witnessed many executions, and was held in solitary confinement. He was arrested in France a few years later and held in the Le Vernet Internment Camp for subversion. Koestler was released and fled to England, where he was held at Pentonville as a suspected illegal immigrant.\n\nHis experiences in prison led him to write \"Darkness at Noon\" and newspaper articles campaigning for the abolition of capital punishment in the 1950s. He also attempted to change the experience of incarceration, stating that in prison, \"the main problem is apathy, depression and gradual dehumanisation. The spark dies.\" Koestler spoke of being intellectually under-stimulated and terrorized in prison, and wanted to provide \"an imaginative and exciting way to stimulate as far as possible and in as many cases as possible the mind and spirit of the prisoner.\"\n\nIn 1962, Koestler arranged the Arthur Koestler Award (now Koestler Trust) through the Home Office of the United Kingdom, to award monetary prizes for artistic achievement to prisoners, detainees, and psychiatric patients.\n\nToday the Koestler Awards cover over 61 artforms, across music, writing, crafts, design, performance and fine art.

{"id": "2264137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2264137", "title": "Language of the birds", "text": "Language of the birds\n\nIn mythology, medieval literature and occultism, the language of the birds is postulated as a mystical, perfect divine language, green language, adamic language, Enochian, angelic language or a mythical or magical language used by birds to communicate with the initiated.\n\nIn Indo-European religion, the behavior of birds has long been used for the purposes of divination by augurs. According to a suggestion by Walter Burkert, these customs may have their roots in the Paleolithic when, during the Ice Age, early humans looked for carrion by observing scavenging birds.\n\nThere are also examples of contemporary bird-human communication and symbiosis. In North America, ravens have been known to lead wolves (and native hunters) to prey they otherwise would be unable to consume. In Africa, the greater honeyguide is known to guide humans to beehives in the hope that the hive will be incapacitated and opened for them.\n\nDating to the Renaissance, birdsong was the inspiration for some magical engineered languages, in particular musical languages. Whistled languages based on spoken natural languages are also sometimes referred to as the language of the birds. Some language games are also referred to as the language of birds, such as in Oromo and Amharic of Ethiopia.\n\nUkrainian language is known as \"nightingale speech\" amongst its speakers.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the power to understand the language of the birds was a sign of great wisdom. The god Odin had two ravens, called Hugin and Munin, who flew around the world and told Odin what happened among mortal men.\n\nThe legendary king of Sweden Dag the Wise was so wise that he could understand what birds said. He had a tame house sparrow which flew around and brought back news to him. Once, a farmer in Reidgotaland killed Dag's sparrow, which brought on a terrible retribution from the Swedes.\n\nIn the \"Rígsþula\", Konr was able to understand the speech of birds. When Konr was riding through the forest hunting and snaring birds, a crow spoke to him and suggested he would win more if he stopped hunting mere birds and rode to battle against foemen.\n\nThe ability could also be acquired by tasting dragon blood. According to the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Völsunga saga\", Sigurd accidentally tasted dragon blood while roasting the heart of Fafnir. This gave him the ability to understand the language of birds, and his life was saved as the birds were discussing Regin's plans to kill Sigurd. Through the same ability Áslaug, Sigurd's daughter, found out the betrothment of her husband Ragnar Lodbrok, to another woman.\nThe 11th century Ramsund carving in Sweden depicts how Sigurd learnt the language of birds, in the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Völsunga saga\".\n\nIn an eddic poem loosely connected with the Sigurd tradition which is named \"Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar\", the reason why a man named Atli once had the ability is not explained. Atli's lord's son Helgi would marry what was presumably Sigurd's aunt, the Valkyrie Sváfa.\n\nAccording to Apollonius Rhodius, the figurehead of Jason's ship, the \"Argo\", was built of oak from the sacred grove at Dodona and could speak the language of birds. Tiresias was also said to have been given the ability to understand the language of the birds by Athena. The language of birds in Greek mythology may be attained by magical means. Democritus, Anaximander, Apollonius of Tyana, Melampus and Aesopus were all said to have understood the birds.\n\nThe 'birds' are also mentioned in Homer's Odyssey : \"“[...] although I am no prophet really, and I do not know much about the meaning of birds. I tell you he will not long be absent from his dear native land, not if chains of iron hold him fast. He will find a way to get back, for he is never at a loss.\"\n\nIn the Quran, Suleiman (Solomon) and David are said to have been taught the language of the birds. Within Sufism, the language of birds is a mystical divine language. \"The Conference of the Birds\" is a mystical poem of 4647 verses by the 12th century Persian poet Attar of Nishapur.\n\nIn the Jerusalem Talmud, Solomon's proverbial wisdom was due to his being granted understanding of the language of birds by God.\n\nIn Egyptian Arabic, hieroglyphic writing is called \"the alphabet of the birds\".\n\nThe concept is also known from many folk tales (including Welsh, Russian, German, Estonian, Greek, Romany), where usually the protagonist is granted the gift of understanding the language of the birds either by some magical transformation, or as a boon by the king of birds. The birds then inform or warn the hero about some danger or hidden treasure. One example is the Russian story The Language of the Birds.\n\nIn Kabbalah, Renaissance magic, and alchemy, the language of the birds was considered a secret and perfect language and the key to perfect knowledge, sometimes also called the \"langue verte\", or green language (Jean Julien Fulcanelli, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa \"de occulta philosophia\", (Emmanuel-Yves Monin, \"Hieroglyphes Français Et Langue Des Oiseaux)\", \n\nCompare also the rather comical and satirical \"Birds\" of Aristophanes and \"Parliament of Fowls\" by Chaucer.\n\nIn medieval France, the language of the birds (\"la langue des oiseaux\") was a secret language of the Troubadours, connected with the Tarot, allegedly based on puns and symbolism drawn from homophony, e. g. an inn called \"au lion d'or\" (\"the Golden Lion\") is allegedly \"code\" for \"au lit on dort\" \"in the bed one sleeps\".\n\nRené Guénon has written an article about the symbolism of the language of the birds.\n\n\"Hiéroglyphes Français Et La Langue Des Oiseaux, Editions du Point d'Eau\" by Emmanuel Yves-Monin is a systematic study on the subject but is only available in French.\n\nThe artificial language zaum of Russian Futurism was described as \"language of the birds\" by Velimir Khlebnikov.\n\nThe children's book author Rafe Martin has written \"The Language of Birds\" as an adaptation of a Russian folk tale; it was made into a children's opera by composer John Kennedy.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "307235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=307235", "title": "Liceu", "text": "Liceu\n\nThe Gran Teatre del Liceu (), or simply Liceu in Catalan, is an opera house on La Rambla in Barcelona, Catalonia. The Liceu opened on 4 April 1847. The adjacent Liceu metro station is named for the theatre.\n\nIn 1837, the \"Liceo Filodramático de Montesión\" (Philodramatic Lyceum of Montesión, now named \"Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu\") was founded in Barcelona to promote musical education (hence the name \"Liceo\", or lyceum) and organize scenic representations of opera performed by Liceo students. \n\nA theater was built in the convent building — named \"Teatro de Montesión\" or \"Teatro del Liceo de Montesión\" — and plays and operas performed: the first was Vicenzo Bellini's \"Norma\" (3 February 1838). The repertoire was Italian, the most performed composers being Donizetti and Mercadante as well as Bellini and Rossini. The Barcelona premiere of Hérold's \"Zampa\" was held here.\n\nIn 1838 the society changed its name to \"Liceo Dramático Filarmónico de S. M. la Reina Isabel II\" (Dramatic Philharmonic Lyceum of H.M. Queen Elisabeth). Lack of space, as well as pressures brought to bear by a group of nuns (who were the former proprietors of the convent and had recovered rights to return), motivated the Liceu to leave its headquarters in 1844. The last theatre performance was on 8 September.\n\nThe Trinitarian convent building located in the centre of the town at la Rambla was purchased. The managers of the Liceu entrusted Joaquim de Gispert d'Anglí with a project to make the construction of the new building viable. Two different societies were created: a \"building society\" and an \"auxiliary building society\". Shareholders of the building society obtained the right of use \"in perpetuity\" of some theatre boxes and seats in exchange for their economic contributions. Those of the second society contributed the rest of the money necessary in exchange for property of other spaces in the building including some shops and a private club called the \"Círculo del Liceo\".\n\nIn contrast with many other European cities, where the monarchy took on the responsibility of the building and upkeep of opera houses, the Liceu was funded by private shareholders of what would become the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu (Great Liceu Theatre Society), organized in a similar way to a trading company or \"societat\". This is reflected in the building's architecture; for example, there is no royal box. The queen did not contribute to the construction, and the name of the society was changed to \"Liceo Filarmónico Dramático\", deleting the queen's name from it.\n\nMiquel Garriga i Roca was the architect contracted; construction began on 11 April 1845. The Theatre was inaugurated on 4 April 1847.\n\nThe inauguration presented a mixed program including the premieres of José Melchior Gomis' musical ouverture, a historical play \"Don Fernando de Antequera\" by Ventura de la Vega, the ballet \"La rondeña\" (\"The girl from Ronda\") by Josep Jurch, and a cantata \"Il regio himene\" with music by the musical director of the theatre Marià Obiols. The first complete opera, Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena\" on 17 April. At this point Liceu was the biggest opera house in Europe with 3,500 seats. Other operas performed in the Liceu during the first year were (in chronological order): \"I due Foscari\" (Verdi), \"Il bravo\" (Mercadante), \"Parisina d'Este\" (Donizetti), \"Giovanna d'Arco\" (Verdi), \"Leonora\" (Mercadante), \"Ernani\" (Verdi), \"Norma\" (Bellini), \"Linda di Chamounix\" (Donizetti) and \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" (Rossini).\n\nThe building was severely damaged by fire on 9 April 1861, but it was rebuilt by the architect Josep Oriol Mestres and opened on 20 April 1862, performing Bellini's \"I puritani\". From the old building only the façade, the entrance hall and the foyer (Mirrors Hall) remained.\nOn 7 November 1893, on the opening night of the season and during the second act of the opera \"Guillaume Tell\" by Rossini, two Orsini bombs were thrown into the stalls of the opera house. Only one of the bombs exploded; some twenty people were killed and many more were injured. The attack was the work of the anarchist Santiago Salvador and it deeply shocked Barcelona, becoming a symbol of the turbulent social unrest of the time. The Liceu reopened its doors on 18 January 1894, but the seats occupied by those killed by the bombs were not used for a number of years. The second bomb was put on display in the Van Gogh Museum in 2007 during an exhibit on \"Barcelona around 1900\".\n\nIn 1909 the auditorium ornamentation was renewed. Spanish neutrality during World War I allowed the Catalan textile industry to amass enormous wealth through supplying the warring parties. The 1920s were prosperous years and the Liceu became fully established as a leading opera house welcoming better singers, the orchestra leaders of the time and companies such as Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.\n\nWhen the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931 political instability meant that the Liceu suffered a severe financial crisis which was only overcome though subsidies from Barcelona City Council and the government of Catalonia. During the Spanish Civil War the Liceu was nationalized and took the name the Teatre del Liceu – Teatre Nacional de Catalunya (Liceu Opera House – the National Theatre of Catalonia). The opera seasons were suspended. After the war it was returned to its original owners in 1939.\n\nFrom 1940 to the 1960s the seasons were high quality ones. The year 1955, thanks to the creation of a special board, saw a historic event when for the first time since its foundation the Bayreuth Festival was staged away from its normal venue. Performances of \"Parsifal\", \"Tristan und Isolde\" and \"Die Walküre\" with innovative stage sets by Wieland Wagner were enthusiastically received.\n\nIn the 1970s an economic crisis affected the theatre and the privately based organization was not able to afford the increasing budgets of modern opera productions and general quality declined.\n\nThe death of in 1980 revealed the need for the intervention of the official bodies if the institution was to remain a leading opera house. In 1981 the Generalitat de Catalunya with Barcelona's City Council and the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu created the Consorci del Gran Teatre del Liceu (Consortium of the Great Liceu Theater) responsible for the theater's management.\n\nThe Diputation of Barcelona and the Spanish Ministry of Culture joined the Consortium in 1985 and 1986 respectively. The Consortium managed to quickly attract the public back to the Liceu owing to a considerable improvement in its artistic standard. This included a more complete and up-to-date perspective of the very nature of an opera performance, a great improvement in the choir and orchestra, careful casting, and attracting the interest of the public to other aspects of productions besides the leading roles alone. This approach, coupled with the new economic support and a more demanding and discerning public, resulted in a high standard of productions.\n\nThe seasons organised by the Consortium maintained high standards in casting, production and public loyalty, as measured by public attendance, but all this came to a halt with a fire on 31 January 1994. The building was destroyed by a fire caused by a spark that accidentally fell on the curtain during a routine repair. At this time Paul Hindemith's \"Mathis der Maler\" was performing at the theatre and the following opera to be performed was Puccini's \"Turandot\".\n\nPublic and institutional response was unanimous on the need to rebuild a new opera house on the same site with improved facilities. The new Liceu is the result of a series of actions to preserve those parts of the building unaffected by the fire, the same ones as had survived the 1861 fire. The auditorium was rebuilt with the same layout, except for the roof paintings which were replaced by new art works by Perejaume, and state-of-the-art stage technology.\n\nIn order to rebuild and improve the theater, the theater became public. The \"Fundació del Gran Teatre del Liceu\" (Liceu Great Theater Foundation) was created and the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu handed over owners of the building to the Foundation. Some owners disagreed with the decision, which was challenged unsuccessfully in court.\n\nFrom 1994 until the reopening in 1999 the opera seasons in Barcelona took place in: Palau Sant Jordi arena (only some massive performances in 1994), Palau de la Música Catalana and Teatre Victòria. The rebuilt, improved and expanded theater opened on 7 October 1999, with Puccini's \"Turandot\" as previewed in 1994 before the fire. The new venue had the same traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium as before but with greatly improved technical, rehearsal, office and educational facilities, a new rehearsal hall, a new chamber opera and small performances hall, and much more public space. Architects for the rebuilding project were Ignasi de Solà-Morales and Xavier Fabré i Lluís Dilmé.\n\nSurtitles, projected onto a screen above the proscenium, are used for all opera performances and some lieder concerts. Also, the electronic libretto system provides translations (to English, Spanish or Catalan, as you choose) onto small individual monitors for the most of the seats.\n\nThe theatre is in la Rambla, in downtown Barcelona. The building has only two façades as the other two sides were limited, until 1994, by dwelling buildings.\n\nSome parts of the first building remain:\n\nThe auditorium is huge. Rebuilt after the 1994 fire it is a faithful rebuilding of the 1861 auditorium with some improvements. With 2,292 seats it is one of the biggest opera houses in Europe. It is a typical Italian horseshoe-shaped theatre. Maximum length and width are 33 and 27 m. There is a platea (main floor) and five tiers (or balconies). Boxes, with small rooms attached, are in the forestage, in the platea and in some of the galleries. There is no significant physical divisions among boxes: only a low screen separates one box from another. No columns are in the theatre apart from inside the platea giving the appearance of the galleries of a golden horseshoe without visual interruptions. Another peculiarity is in the first gallery where the \"amfiteatre ubicare\" is located. This is a projecting part of this gallery, with a less pronounced horseshoe shape, that allows three ranks of seats to be located there and are considered the best in the theatre.\n\nBuilding expenses were covered by the sale of boxes and seats. Boxes were lavishly decorated by their owners but they disappeared in the 1994 fire. Upper balconies (4th and 5th tiers) are the cheapest seats and are called the \"galliner\" (literally \"henroost\").\nThe forestage, or proscenium, reproduces the old one which was rebuilt in 1909. It has a big central arch with two Corinthian columns on both sides and, among the columns, four tiers of boxes parapets with the wider and more luxurious boxes in the theatre being called \"banyeres\" (literally \"bathtubs\").\n\nThe auditorium ornamentation reproduces that of 1909: sumptuous with golden and polychromed plaster moldings, as usual in 19th-century European theatres. Lamps are of brass and glass in the shape of a drake. Armchairs on the main floor are made of strained iron and red velvet.\n\nIn the rebuilding some modern features were introduced. The eight circular paintings in the roof, and the three in the forestage, were all lost in the fire and have been re-created by contemporary artist Perejaume. The stage curtain is a work of the Catalan designer Antoni Miró. The new hemispheric lamp in the center of the roof is a platform for technological facilities (lighting, sound and computer).\n\nOther technological facilities are control and projecting cabins in some balconies, a \"technical floor\" over the roof, and high-tech equipment to record and broadcast performances. With computerized cameras the auditorium could also be used as a television set. Stage facilities are among the most modern and allow quick scene changes and to perform four different sets simultaneously.\n\nA new foyer has been built under the main auditorium. It is a room where is the main bar and the restaurant are located and is used also to stage concerts, small format performances, lectures, cultural activities, and meetings etc.\n\nAt present, the Liceu is both a receiving and producing house, with two or three new productions staged each year. The Liceu company consists of a permanent orchestra and choir and some singers for the supporting roles. Leading roles are usually sung by guest singers. Stagecraft is in part produced internally by the theatre (alone or together with other opera houses) and also rented from other external houses. Until the 1990s Liceu had its own ballet company which was at its best in the 1920–1930s under Joan Magriñà.\n\nMost of the performed operas were from the Italian and German schools of 19th century: Verdi, Wagner, belcanto authors and in more recent times Puccini, Richard Strauss and Mozart are included.\n\nThe history of Liceu premieres is a good instance of the evolution of European opera tastes. At first opera was only a part of the artistic activities and opera alternated with other forms of performance such zarzuela (Spanish light opera), classical dance (\"Giselle\" was given its first Barcelona performance in 1847), theatrical performances, magic shows and a large number of activities which today might appear more appropriate for a variety concert or a music hall.\n\nThe first performed operas, Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena\" and Verdi's \"I due Foscari\", are symptomatic of the taste for belcanto and Italian romantic melodrama: Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi etc. They are still in the repertory, and Verdi is by far the most performed composer.\n\nThe first operas by non Italian composers which were put on in the Liceu were Ferdinand Hérold's \"Zampa\" (1848), Carl Maria von Weber's \"Der Freischütz\" (1849), Giacomo Meyerbeer's \"Robert le diable\", Auber's \"La muette de Portici\" (1852) and \"Fra Diavolo\" (1853). All of these were sung in Italian as was the custom of the time.\n\nThe first performances of \"Il trovatore\" (1854) and \"La traviata\" (1855) led to the crowning of Giuseppe Verdi as the king of opera. In 1866 Mozart was staged at the Liceu for the first time with \"Don Giovanni\".\n\n1883 is a landmark when Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" is first performed. From there, and especially from the 1880s to 1950s, Wagner become one of the most beloved and highly regarded composers at Liceu. The theatre had the first staged performance of \"Parsifal\" outside Bayreuth on December 31, 1913, after the Bayreuth monopoly ended (although performance started 30 minutes before the deadline of 00:00 on January 1, 1914) with Francesc Viñas in the title role and conducted by Franz Beidler. In 1955 the Bayreuth Festival company visited the theatre and performed three operas.\n\nVerismo, especially Puccini, is an esteemed school from the end of 19th century. The first Russian opera was given in 1915 with a great success. Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky being often performed. The first years of the 20th century saw Richard Strauss conducting his own works. In 1904, Siegfried Wagner conducted a concert and a year afterwards Pietro Mascagni conducted a work.\n\nIn 1915 impresario Mestres Calvet broadened the repertory and introduced composers such as Mozart, Richard Strauss, de Falla, Stravinsky, etc. It was a golden age for Russian and German operas which were now sung in their original language. Mestres also was closely associated with the success commencing in 1917 with the ballets of Diaghilev, with Nijinsky, Massine, Lopokova, Chernicheva and other great figures. Years later another famous dancer, Anna Pavlova, was also to perform here.\n\nIn 1947 the directing company changed and came into the hands of Arquer and Pàmias. In contrast with the preceding years, which had been marked by the almost exclusive programming of the great repertory works, the first season of the new directorship saw a special renewal of the repertoire featuring the first performances in Barcelona of some 100 works by a large number of composers. Various revivals featured Donizetti's \"Anna Bolena\", which had first been staged in the Liceu one hundred years earlier. For 33 years, Pàmias was the leading figure of the Liceu's activity during a period when it seemed that it would be impossible to maintain the opera house without any official aid.\n\nFrom the 1950s to now, the repertory has largely comprised the most performed titles in the world, including practically all the great 20th-century composers: Bartók, Honegger, Gershwin, Berg, Janáček, Weill, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Britten, Schönberg, Hindemith, etc., along with Baroque and classical composers Monteverdi, Handel and Gluck.\n\nBallet seasons are an important part of the theatre's activities with some of the best known companies in the world performing, including Diaghilev and Béjart.\n\nThe adjacent Liceu metro station is named for the theatre.\n\nMost performed operas in the history of Liceu are (in January 2009):\n\nAs a prominent theatre the Liceu has been the location for the premieres of several works of theatre and music, and for the Spanish premieres of a lot of musical works. Among these premieres are:\n\nThe Liceu has also been the location for the Spanish premieres of prominent operas. Amongst them are:\n\nThe theatre is managed by a general director or intendant (\"empresari\" or \"administrador\"). From 1980 there is also an artistic director (\"director artístic\").\n\nGeneral directors:\n\nArtistic directors:\nThe theatre has had its own orchestra from its foundation in 1847, the Orquestra Simfònica del Gran Teatre del Liceu. It is the oldest still working orchestra in Spain. Its first conductor was Marià Obiols.\n\nOrchestra music directors and chief conductors:\n\nThe current music director of the company is Josep Pons, since 2012. In November 2017, the Liceu announced the extension of Pons' contract through the 2021-2022 season.\n\nThe choir was consolidated during the 1960s by its conductor Riccardo Bottino (1960–1982). From 1982 the choir conductors were (1982–1993), with Vittorio Sicuri (1982–1990), and Andrés Máspero (from 1990). The present choir conductor is William Spaulding.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, a school of stagecraft and theatrical scenery was developed at the Liceu. After the beginnings with Joan Ballester, well known for his setting for L'Africaine, the leading scenographer was Francesc Soler i Rovirosa, working in the 1880–1900s. The style was very realistic using painted paper flats and curtains. Settings and costumes were made in the theatre workshops. From the 1900s to 1930s the school is represented by scenic painters including Maurici Vilomara, Fèlix Urgellés, Salvador Alarma and Oleguer Junyent. The last of these painters was Josep Mestres Cabanes who painted sceneries in the 1930–1950s.\n\nMany famous singers have sung at the Liceu. Composer Camille Saint-Saëns, when visiting the Liceu, once said: \"Ils aiment trop the ténor\" (They [the Liceu public] love tenors too much). In brackets are the dates of the house debuts and final/most recent performances of prominent singers who have appeared at the Liceu:\n\n\nLinked to the theatre is the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu, a music college founded in 1837 which is part of the same corporation.\n\nThe \"Círculo del Liceo\" is an exclusive private club located in the Liceu building. The \"Círculo\" opened in November 1847, a few months after the Liceu opera house, with 125 founding members, according to its earliest records. The club's facilities include numerous elegant lounges, conference rooms, a restaurant, a library and other services. \n\nFor the society's first 150 years, only men were permitted to become members; women were allowed access solely as guests of male society members. In 2001, following public controversy over the club's exclusively male membership, the club's constitution was amended and ten women (including renowned soprano Montserrat Caballé and several family members of existing members) were permitted to apply for membership for the first time. All ten women were initially turned down, then later admitted after a subsequent vote by members, with a final vote of 373 votes in favor and 279 against their admission. At present the society has around one thousand members.\n\nThe \"Círculo del Liceo\" is the oldest club in Spain which retains its original location. The club's long history has enabled it to accumulate a unique heritage of artistic works. Many of its rooms are decorated in an Art Nouveau style. Four large windows in the low foyer serve as a testimony to the influence of Wagnerism in Catalan culture at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn addition to the furniture and decor, the club retains a collection of sculptures, marquetry, enamels, engravings, etchings and paintings by Catalan artists: Alexandre de Riquer, Santiago Rusiñol, Modest Urgell Inglada and Francesc Miralles, among others. The most notable work belonging to the club is a set of twelve oils on fabric, commissioned to Ramon Casas and installed in the rotunda of the club. Each of the twelve paintings, Casas' most ambitious work, is inspired by a musical topic.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

{"id": "341981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341981", "title": "Lotte Reiniger", "text": "Lotte Reiniger\n\nCharlotte \"Lotte\" Reiniger (2 June 1899 – 19 June 1981) was a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\", from 1926—thought to be one of the oldest surviving feature-length animated films—and \"Papageno\" (1935). Reiniger is also noted for having devised a predecessor to the first multiplane camera; she made more than 40 films, all using her invention.\n\nLotte Reiniger was born in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin on 2 June 1899 to Carl Reiniger and Eleonore Lina Wilhelmine Rakette. As a child, she was fascinated with the Chinese arts of paper cutting of silhouette puppetry, even building her own puppet theatre so that she could put on shows for her family and friends.\n\nAs a teenager, Reiniger developed a love of cinema, first with the films of Georges Méliès for their special effects, then the films of the actor and director Paul Wegener, known today for \"\" (1920). In 1915, she attended a lecture by Wegener that focused on the fantastic possibilities of animation. Reiniger eventually convinced her parents to allow her to enroll in the acting group to which Wegener belonged, the Theatre of Max Reinhardt. She began by making costumes and props and working backstage. She started making silhouette portraits of the various actors around her, and soon she was making elaborate title cards for Wegener's films, many of which featured her silhouettes.\n\nIn 1918, Reiniger animated wooden rats and created the animated intertitles for Wegener's \"Der Rattenfänger von Hameln\" (\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\"). The success of this work got her admitted into the Institut für Kulturforschung (Institute for Cultural Research), an experimental animation and shortfilm studio. It was here that she met her future creative partner and husband (from 1921), Carl Koch, as well as other avant-garde artists including Hans Cürlis, Bertolt Brecht, and Berthold Bartosch.\n\nThe first film Reiniger directed was \"Das Ornament des verliebten Herzens\" (\"The Ornament of the Enamoured Heart\", 1919), a five-minute piece involving two lovers and an ornament that reflects their moods. The film was very well received, and its success opened up many new connections for Reiniger in the animation industry.\n\nShe made six short films over the next few years, all produced and photographed by her husband, including the fairytale animation \"Aschenputtel\" (1922). These shorts were interspersed with advertising films (the Julius Pinschewer advertising agency innovated ad films and sponsored a large number of abstract animators during the Weimar period) and special effects for various feature films—most famously a silhouette falcon for a dream sequence in Part One of \"Die Nibelungen\" by Fritz Lang. During this time, she found herself at the centre of a large group of ambitious German animators, including Bartosch, Hans Richter, Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger.\n\nIn 1923, she was approached by Louis Hagen, who had bought a large quantity of raw film stock as an investment to fight the spiraling inflation of the period. He asked her to do a feature-length animated film.There was some difficulty that came with doing this, however. Reiniger is quoted as saying \"We had to think twice. This was a never heard of thing. Animated films were supposed to make people roar with laughter, and nobody had dared to entertain an audience with them for more than ten minutes. Everybody to whom we talked in the industry about the proposition was horrified.\" The result was \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\", completed in 1926, one of the first animated feature films, with a plot that is a pastiche of stories from \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Although it failed to find a distributor for almost a year, once premiered in Paris (thanks to the support of Jean Renoir), it became a critical and popular success. Because of this delay, however, \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\"s expressionistic style did not quite fit with the realism that was becoming popular in cinema in 1926. Reiniger uses lines that can almost be called \"colorful\" to represent the film's exotic locations. Today, \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\" is thought to be one of the oldest surviving feature-length animated films, if not the oldest. It is also considered to be the first avant-garde full-length animated feature.\n\nReiniger, in devising the predecessor to the first multiplane camera for certain effects, preceded Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks by a decade. Above her animation table, a camera with a manual shutter was placed in order to achieve this. She placed planes of glass to achieve a layered effect. The setup was then backlit. This camera setup was later popular in cel animation. Reiniger wrote instructions on how to construct her \"trick-table\" in her book, \"Shadow puppets, shadow theatres, and shadow films.\" In addition to Reiniger's silhouette actors, \"Prince Achmed\" boasted dream-like backgrounds by Walter Ruttmann (her partner in the \"Die Nibelungen\" sequence) and Walter Türck, and a symphonic score by Wolfgang Zeller. Additional effects were added by Carl Koch and Berthold Bartosch.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Prince Achmed,\" Reiniger was able to make a second feature. \"Doktor Dolittle und seine Tiere\" (\"Doctor Dolittle and his Animals\", 1928) was based on the first of the English children's books by Hugh Lofting. The film tells of the good Doctor's voyage to Africa to help heal sick animals. It is currently available only in a television version with new music, voice-over narration and the images playing at too many frames per second. The score of this three-part film was composed by Kurt Weill, Paul Hindemith and Paul Dessau.\n\nA year later, Reiniger co-directed her first live-action film with Rochus Gliese, \"Die Jagd nach dem Glück\" (\"The Pursuit of Happiness\", 1929), a tale about a shadow-puppet troupe. The film starred Jean Renoir and Berthold Bartosch and included a 20-minute silhouette performance by Reiniger. Unfortunately, the film was completed just as sound came to Germany and release of the film was delayed until 1930 to dub in voices by different actors—the result being disappointing.\n\nReiniger attempted to make a third animated feature, inspired by Maurice Ravel's opera \"L'enfant et les sortilèges\" (\"The Child and the Bewitched Things\", 1925), but was unable to clear all of the individual rights to Ravel's music, the libretto (by the novelist Colette), and an unexpected number of copyright holders. When Ravel died in 1937 the clearance became even more complex and Lotte finally abandoned the project, although she had designed sequences and animated some scenes to convince potential backers and the rights-holders.\n\nReiniger worked on several films with British poet, critic, and musician Eric Walter White, who wrote an early book-length essay on her work.\n\nWith the rise of the Nazi Party, Reiniger and Koch decided to emigrate (both were involved in left-wing politics), but found that no other country would give them permanent visas. As a result, the couple spent the years 1933–1944 moving from country to country, staying as long as visas would allow. With the release of sound film, Reiniger and her husband began to work with music in relation to animation. They worked with film-makers Jean Renoir in Paris and Luchino Visconti in Rome. They managed to make 12 films during this period, the best-known being \"Carmen\" (1933) and \"Papageno\" (1935), both based on popular operas (Bizet's \"Carmen\" and Mozart's \"Die Zauberflöte\"). When World War II commenced they stayed with Visconti in Rome until 1944, then moved back to Berlin to take care of Reiniger's sick mother. Under the rule of Hitler, Reiniger was forced to make propaganda films for Germany. One of these films is called (The Golden Goose, 1944). She had to work under stringent and limiting conditions to please the German state, which is why some of her work in this time period may appear creatively stifled.\n\nIn 1949, Reiniger and Koch moved to London, where she made a few short advertising films for John Grierson and his General Post Office Film Unit (later to be renamed the \"Crown Film Unit\"). While she was living in London in the early 1950s she became friends with Freddy Bloom, the chair of the National Deaf Children's Society and editor of quarterly magazine called \"TALK\", who asked her to design a logo. Reiniger responded by cutting out silhouettes of four children running up a hill. Freddy Bloom was amazed at her skill with the scissors—in a few moments she created about four different silhouettes of the children from black paper. One of them was used as cover design on the magazine TALK from 1956. The logo was used until the 1990s, when a design company was invited to revamp it. The result was a very minor modification, but this new design was dropped a few years later.\n\nWith Louis Hagen Jr. (the son of Reiniger's financier of \"Prince Achmed\" in Potsdam), they founded Primrose Productions in 1953 and, over the next two years, produced more than a dozen short silhouette films based on \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\" for the BBC and Telecasting America. Reiniger also provided illustrations for the 1953 book \"King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table\" by Roger Lancelyn Green.\n\nAfter a period of seclusion after her husband's death in 1963, renewed interest in her work resulted in Reiniger's return to Germany. She later visited the United States, and began making films again soon after. She made three more films, the last of which, \"Die vier Jahreszeiten,\" was completed the year before she died.\n\nReiniger was awarded the of the Deutscher Filmpreis in 1972; in 1979 she received the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Reiniger died in Dettenhausen, Germany, on 19 June 1981, just after her 82nd birthday.\n\nReiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s, particularly in terms of characters. In the 1920s especially, characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action, while Reiniger's characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions. She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations. This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories. \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\" specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality. Reiniger considered animation's separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium.\n\nBecause of this, Reiniger's characters are not usually biologically correct, but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism. Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques, Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation. Reiniger's figures resemble stop-motion animation in the way that they move.\n\nAlthough all subsequent makers of animated fairy tales could be said to have been influenced by Reiniger, Bruno J. Böttge is probably the one who has made the most explicit references to her work.\n\nDisney's \"Fantasia\" uses Reiniger's style in the beginning of the scene where Mickey Mouse is in the same shot as the live-action musicians.\n\nStarting with the silhouette format in the 1989 television series \"Ciné si\", French animator Michel Ocelot employs many of the techniques created by Reiniger, along with others of his own invention, in his silhouette film \"Princes et princesses\".\n\nReiniger's cut-out animation style was utilized in the credits of the 2004 film \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\".\n\nIn the 2010 film, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\", animator Ben Hibon used Reiniger's style of animation in the short film titled \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\".\n\nThe animated series \"Steven Universe\" paid homage to the style of Reiniger's films in the episode \"The Answer\".\n\nThe municipal museum in Tübingen holds much of her original materials and hosts a permanent exhibition, \"The World in Light and Shadow: Silhouette, shadow theatre, silhouette film\". The Filmmuseum Düsseldorf also holds many materials of Lotte Reiniger's work, including her animation table, and a part of the permanent exhibition is dedicated to her. Collections relating to her are also held at the BFI National Archive.\n\nOn June 2, 2016, Google celebrated Reiniger's 117th birthday with a Google Doodle about her.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1792011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1792011", "title": "Mari (goddess)", "text": "Mari (goddess)\n\nMari, also called Mari Urraca, Anbotoko Mari (\"the lady of Anboto\"), and Murumendiko Dama (\"lady of Murumendi\") was a goddess—a \"lamia\"—of the Basques. She was married to the god Sugaar (also known as Sugoi or Maju). Legends connect her to the weather: when she and Maju travelled together hail would fall, her departures from her cave would be accompanied by storms or droughts, and which cave she lived in at different times would determine dry or wet weather: wet when she was in Anboto; dry when she was elsewhere (the details vary). Other places where she was said to dwell include the chasm of Murumendi, the cave of Gurutzegorri (Ataun), Aizkorri and Aralar, although it is not always possible to be certain which Basque legends should be considered to pertain to the same lamia.\n\nIt is believed that Mari is a modification of Emari (gift) or Amari (mother + the suffix of profession) by losing the first vowel. The closeness in names between Mary and Mari may have helped pagans adapt their worship of Mari to undertake Christian veneration of the Virgin Mary. The first known written citation of the \"Dame of Amboto\" was made by Charles V's chronicler Esteban de Garibay Zamalloa in his Memorial histórico español.\n\nMari lives underground, normally in a cave in a high mountain, where she and her consort Sugaar meet every Friday (the night of the \"Akelarre\" or witch-meeting) to conceive the storms that will bring fertility (and sometimes disgrace) to the land and the people. Mari is served by a court of \"sorginak\" (witches), and is said to feed \"on the negation and affirmation\" (that is, on falsehood).\n\nOccasionally the figure of Mari is linked to the kidnapping or theft of cows. The presence of Christian priests in those myths may indicate that they are Christian fabrications or distortions of original material. Legends do not recount any kind of sacrifices offered to Mari under normal circumstances, in contrast to food given to lesser spirits (\"lamiak\", \"jentilak\", etc.), as recompense for their work in the fields.\n\nIn various legends, Mari is said to have sons or daughters, but their number and character fluctuate. The two most well-known were her two sons, Atxular and Mikelatz. Atxular represents largely the Christianized Basque soul, becoming a priest after having learned from the Devil in a church in Salamanca and then having escaped. Mikelatz seems to have a more negative or wild character ; he is sometimes assimilated into the spirit of storms, Hodei, or embodied as a young red bull.\n\nAnother legend presents Mari as wife to the Lord of Biscay, Diego López I de Haro. This marriage may symbolize the legitimacy of the dynasty, much in the style of the Irish goddess marrying the kings of that island as a religious act of legitimacy. In any case, the condition that Mari imposes on her husband is that, while he could keep his Christian faith, he was obliged to keep it outside the home. Once, apparently after discovering that his wife had a goat leg instead of a normal human foot, he made the sign of the cross. Immediately after that act, Mari took her daughter, jumped through the window and disappeared, never to return. This account can be heard as delegitimizing the de Haro family, who had been placed as lords by the Castilian conquerors not long before this myth arose.\n\nOther legends are more simple. For example, there is a legend that when one is lost in the wild, one only has to cry Mari's name loudly three times to have her appear over one's head to help the person find his or her way.\n\nThe people of Oñati believed that the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, and dry when she was in Aloña. In Zeanuri, Biscay, they say that she would stay seven years in Anboto, then the next seven in a cave in Oiz called Supelegor. A similar legend in Olaeta, Biscay substitutes Gorbea for Supelegor.\n\nA legend from Otxandio, Biscay tells that Mari was born in Lazkao, Gipuzkoa, and that she was the evil sister of a Roman Catholic priest. In other legends, the priest is her cousin Juanito Chistu, rather than a brother, and is a great hunter. She was said to take a distaff by the middle and walk along spinning, and leaving storms in her wake.\n\nIn Elorrieta, Biscay, it was said that she would be in her cave, combing her hair, and not even a shepherd could draw near to her. It was also said that her malign power did not extend to those who were innocent of sin.\n\nFolklorist Resurrección María de Azkue ties Mari Urraca to a legend about a princess of the Kingdom of Navarre, widow of a 12th-century nobleman who lived in the Tower of Muncharaz in the valley known as the Merindad de Durango. She vanished at the time of his death and was said to have headed for the cave of Anboto. According to Azkue, Iturriza tells this story in his \"Historia de Vizcaya.\" Labayru in her \"Historia de Vizcaya\" doubts it.\n\nLegends attached to the Lady of Murumendi, according to Azkue, include that she had seven brothers and was changed into a witch for her disobedience, and that the weather would be warm (or turbulent) when she walked about. In Beizama, Gipuzkoa, they say that if she stays in her cave and if, on the day of the Holy Cross, appropriate spells are cast, hail can be prevented. They also say that she and her husband once went to church in a cart and that upon leaving church, she rose into the air saying, \"Domingo, Domingo el de Murua, siete hijos para el mundo, ninguno para el cielo\" (\"Domingo, Domingo of Murua, seven children for the world, none for heaven\").\n\nMari was associated with various forces of nature, including thunder and wind. As the personification of the Earth, she may have been worshipped in association with Lurbira.\n\nMari was regarded as the protectoress of senators and the executive branch. She is depicted as riding through the sky in a chariot pulled by horses or rams. Her idols usually feature a full moon behind her head.\n\nMari is the main character of Basque mythology, having, unlike other creatures that share the same spiritual environment, a god-like nature. Mari is often witnessed as a woman dressed in red. She is also seen as a woman of fire, woman-tree and as thunderbolt. Additionally, she is identified with red animals (cow, ram, horse), and with the black he-goat.\n\nSanta Marina, a saint revered in the Basque Country, is a Christianized version of Mari. Basque women still invoke Santa Marina's protection against curses and for aid in childbirth.\n\nThe most accepted syncretism is with the Virgin Mary; she is widely venerated by modern Christian Basques.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40623944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40623944", "title": "Merry company", "text": "Merry company\n\nMerry company is the term in art history for a painting, usually from the 17th century, showing a small group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making. These scenes are a very common type of genre painting of the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque; it is estimated that nearly two thirds of Dutch genre scenes show people drinking.\n\nThe term is the usual translation of the Dutch \"geselschapje\", or \"vrolijk gezelschap\", and is capitalized when used as a title for a work, and sometimes as a term for the type. The scenes may be set in the home, a garden, or a tavern, and the gatherings range from decorous groups in wealthy interiors to groups of drunk men with prostitutes. Gatherings that are relatively decorous and expensively dressed, with similar numbers of men and women, often standing, may be called \"Elegant Company\" or \"Gallant Company\", while those showing people who are clearly peasants are more likely to use that word in their title. Such subjects in painting are most common in Dutch art between about 1620 and 1670.\n\nThe definition of a \"merry company\" is far from rigid, and overlaps with several other types of painting. Portraits of family groups or bodies such as militia companies may borrow an informal style of composition from them, but works where the figures were intended to represent specific individuals are excluded. There are normally between four and about a dozen figures shown, which typically includes both men and women, but may just consist of men, perhaps with female servants, as in the Buytewech illustrated. Contemporary Dutch descriptions of paintings from inventories, auction catalogues and the like, use (no doubt somewhat arbitrarily) other terms for similar compositions including \"a \"buitenpartij\" (an outdoor party or picnic), a \"cortegaarddje\" (a barrack-room or guardroom scene), a \"borddeeltjen\" (a bordello scene), and a \"beeldeken\" or \"moderne beelden\" (a picture with little figures or modern figures)\". \n\n\"Musical party\" or \"concert\" is often used when some of the main figures are playing instruments. More generally such works may be referred to as \"company paintings\" or \"company subjects\" (but this is not to be confused with Indian Company painting, a style patronized by the British East India Company). Few if any titles used for 17th century genre paintings can be traced to the artist; those used by museums and art historians today may derive from a record in the provenance or be made up in modern times.\n\nPaintings showing specific celebrations such as weddings or the festivities for Twelfth Night, the main mid-winter celebration in the Netherlands, or the playing of specific games, are likely to have titles relating to these where the subject is still clear. For example, a painting by Godfried Schalcken (1665–1670, Royal Collection) is known from his biography by his pupil Arnold Houbraken to represent \"The game of 'Lady, Come into the Garden\"', and is so titled, although the rules of this are now unknown but \"clearly involved the removal of clothes\", at least by some male participants. In \"La Main Chaud\" (\"the hot hand\") male participants just got smacked. Paintings showing the parable of the Prodigal Son in his prodigal phase are conceived as merry company scenes of the brothel type, though they are often larger, as was expected of a history painting.\n\nAs with other types of Netherlandish genre painting, the body of merry company paintings include some with a clear moralistic intention, carrying a message to avoid excess in drink, lavish spending, low company and fornication. Others seem merely to celebrate the pleasures of sociability, often with a socially aspirational element. Many fall somewhere in between, are hard to interpret, and \"contain within them an obvious contradiction between their goal of condemning certain types of excessive behaviour and the amusing and attractive aspect of this very behaviour and its representation\". \nOften the art historian wishing to interpret them has first to decide such questions as whether the scene is placed in a home, a tavern or a brothel, and if a tavern whether the women present are respectable or prostitutes, or whether the artist had a intention to convey definite meaning to his contemporary viewers on these questions at all. The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between \"taverns\" or \"inns\" and \"brothels\", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: \"Inn in front; brothel behind\" was a Dutch proverb.\n\nScenes with prostitutes do not reflect the realities of 17th century prostitution in many ways, but offer a conventionalized visual code. The madam or (as art historians like to call them) \"procuress\" is always an aged crone, whereas court records for Amsterdam (the national centre for Dutch prostitution) show that most were still fairly young, and 40% in their twenties. The presence of a procuress figure is by itself sufficient to justify interpreting a painting as a brothel scene. Fine clothes (rented from the madam) and in particular feathers in headresses are said to be signifiers of prostitutes, as well as the more obvious loosened clothes, low cleavages, and a provocative frontal stance. But in the later part of the century demure downcast looks by the woman feature in many scenes thought to represent prostitution; in the famously ambiguous threesome \"The Gallant Conversation\" by Gerard ter Borch, the young woman is seen only from behind. Of one painting by Jacob Ochtervelt, (c. 1670, now Cleveland, illustrated at left) Wayne Franits says: \nAt first glance, the \"Musical Company in an Interior\" appears to be an elegant gathering of well-heeled youths [and women and a servant]... The picture exudes an aura of calmness and finesse. Nevertheless, the series of female portraits on the wall behind the figures discloses the true nature of its subject. There is strong evidence that actual brothels displayed portraits like these to assist clients in selecting their partners.\n\nAccording to Simon Schama,\n\n...when we are unsure whether we are looking at a picture of a home or a tavern, or whether what seems to be a tavern is actually a brothel, it may not be because we lack hard-and-fast clues to the artist's unambiguous intention, but because he meant us to be unsure. ... It would be futile to attempt to distinguish between scenes of good homely fun and public-house dissipation, because the figurative and actual territories were themselves deliberately mixed up. Where goings-on take place in a household or, conversely, children run around with gleeful worldliness in a tavern, there is a good chance that the picture is about the conmingling of innocence and corruption.\n\nJan Steen owned a tavern for a period, living on the premises, and often included portraits of himself and members of his family in \"genre\" works. Gerrit van Honthorst, who painted several scenes that, like the one illustrated here, clearly do show prostitution, married the daughter of the proprietress of a tavern and a wine merchant, who was a distant cousin and something of an heiress. The traditional interpretation and title of his \"Prodigal Son\" in Munich has been challenged, with the assertion that it merely shows a \"festive\" tavern scene, despite the presence of an older woman and feathers in the girls' hair, often taken as diagnostic of a brothel scene. \n\nElmer Kolfin, in \"the first comprehensive study to date on the merry company in Dutch art during the first half of the seventeenth century\" divides the pictures \"into three iconographic categories: \"idealistic\", which present mainly positive views of the festive activities depicted; \"moralistic\", in which such activities are condemned from a moral point of view; and \"satirical\", in which they are held up for ridicule, but chiefly for comic rather than moralizing effect\" seeing a movement away from moralistic to idealistic treatments from the 16th to the 17th century. Other scholars see a large group of paintings as deliberately ambiguous or open in their meaning; the limited evidence we have suggests they were often displayed in the main rooms of their owners' houses.\n\nThe exceptional freedom allowed to Dutch women amazed and usually horrified foreign visitors; according to the visiting Englishman Fynes Moryson:\n\n... mothers of good fame permit their daughters at home after they themselves go to bed, to sit up with young men all or most part of the night, banqueting and talking, yea with leave and without leave to walk abroad with young men in the streets by night. And this they do out of a customed liberty without prejudice to their fame whereas the Italian women, strictly kept, think it folly to omit every opportunity they can get to do ill\".\n\nMany paintings have lightly worn allegorical schemes; a plate of food, tobacco pipe, musical instrument and a squeeze, kiss or slap will be enough to make any group into an \"Allegory of the Five Senses\". Many may illustrate the endless supply of moralistic Dutch proverbs.\n\nCourtly party scenes, typically of couples of young lovers in a \"garden of love\", were popular in the late Middle Ages, mostly in illuminated manuscripts and prints rather than panel paintings, and often as part of calendar series showing the months, or book illustrations. In the Renaissance such scenes tended to be given specific settings from religion or classical mythology, such as the \"Feast of the Gods\" which, unlike merry company scenes, was an excuse for copious amounts of nudity. In 16th century Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting traditions of genre painting of festivities or parties began to develop, most famously in the peasant scenes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which were the first large paintings to have peasant life as their sole subject. \n\nThere was also a tradition of moralizing urban scenes, including subjects such as the \"Ill-matched Couple\" and \"Prodigal Son\", and a court tradition of recording actual or typical entertainments at a particular court, with portraits of the leading personages. The \"Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist\" by the German-Silesian artist Bartholomeus Strobel (c. 1630-43, Prado) is an exceptionally large treatment of a subject often used since the 15th century to depict a courtly banquet. \"The Feast in the House of Levi\" by Paolo Veronese (1573, Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice) is another famous and huge treatment of a grand feast.\n\nThe \"courtly company scene\" with anonymous genre figures developed in the first years of the 17th century in both the Northern and Southern Netherlands, now separated by the Eighty Years War. As the subject type developed, so did differences between the two regions: Flemish painting covered a wider range of settings in terms of class, with peasant scenes remaining strongly represented, and many scenes showing court milieus. Dutch painting concentrated on a class spectrum that might all be called middle-class, though ranging from elegant patrician companies to scruffy and rowdy groups. Flemish scenes tend to have far more characters, and the tranquil middle class group of four or five people sitting round a table at home is not seen. Whereas most Dutch paintings, except for those by the Utrecht Caravaggisti, had small figures, the \"monumental company scene\" remained part of Flemish painting, with Jacob Jordaens producing several examples, especially of Twelfth Night festivities. By the 1630s artists in both regions, but especially the north, tended to specialize in particular genres, and the merry company was no exception.\n\nThe first generation of Dutch painters included Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech (1591/1592–1624), who can claim to have invented the small interior merry company, Other early artists were David Vinckboons (1576–1629), and Esaias van de Velde (1587–1630), who was an even more significant pioneer of realistic landscape painting, in a completely different style to his elegant garden parties. The famous portraitist Frans Hals was attributed with a single very early merry company, a gallant picnic of about 1610, which was destroyed in Berlin in World War II; he also painted a \"close-up\" genre depiction of three revellers. His younger brother Dirck Hals (1591–1656) was a prolific specialist in small merry company groups.\n\nBy about 1630 active painters included Hendrik Gerritsz. Pot (1587–1657), also a portraitist, Anthonie Palamedesz. (1601–1673), Pieter Codde (1599–1678), and Jacob Duck (1600–1667). Codde and Duck, with Willem Duyster, were also painters of \"guardroom scenes\", which showed soldiers specifically, and became popular in the 1630s; as Lucy van de Pol notes, the sailors who made up a great part of the clientele of taverns and brothels, at least in Amsterdam, are very rarely represented. \n\nAfter about the mid-century many \"company paintings\" showed smaller and more quiet groups more firmly located in homes, often with more narrative elements and a greater concentration on effects of lighting and texture. Pictures showing many of the same interests as \"company\" works, but just using couples or individuals become very common. The paintings of Vermeer, none of which quite fall into the category of \"merry company\" works, exemplify this trend, which is also seen in those of Gerard ter Borch, Gabriel Metsu, Gerrit Dou, and Pieter de Hooch. The works of Jan Steen (c. 1626–1679) maintained the tradition of rowdy drinking groups, but usually with a setting showing a specific occasion, or illustrating a proverb. Many show family groups, and often a self-portrait is included. \nFlemish artists include David Vinckboons, who moved to the north as a young adult, Frans Francken II with his uncle Hieronymus I and brother Hieronymus II, Sebastian Vrancx, Louis de Caullery, all painting courtly scenes, often with small figures and much attention given to the architectural settings in or outside sumptuous palaces. Simon de Vos (1603–1676), painted smaller scenes closer to the Dutch style.\n\nThe Bruegel tradition of peasant scenes was continued by his sons Jan Brueghel I and Peter Brueghel the Younger, mostly painting \"kermesse\"-type festivities with large numbers of figures, most often outdoors. Smaller groups in interiors were pioneered by the intensely naturalistic Adriaen Brouwer, who was Flemish but also worked and sold in Haarlem in the north, where he greatly influenced Adriaen van Ostade, the leading Dutch painter of peasants. Brouwer's sordid scenes are short on merriment, but van Ostade softened and sentimentalized his style.\n\nDavid Teniers the Elder, his son David Teniers the Younger as well as other members of the family included many peasant scenes in their large and varied output. Most of the works of all these painters lie outside the typical boundaries of the \"merry company\", in terms of the number of figures or their class, but many fall within; there was also a later generation of Flemish painters of peasant scenes. Rubens, who owned 17 paintings by Adriaen Brouwer, painted a few \"kermesse\" and other peasant scenes that are highly successful, despite their very heroic style. He also painted a few large courtly company scenes, including his \"Garden of Love\", (Prado, 1634-5).\n\nApart from Jordaens and Rubens, Flemish painters of monumental company scenes included Theodoor Rombouts (1597–1637), who made several large paintings of card-players, Cornelis de Vos, and Jan Cossiers.\n\n\n\n"}

It was cultivated in the 13th century by Spanish learned poets, usually clerics (hence the name 'clerecía'). .\n\nUnlike Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía was written on paper, not anonymous, with regular metre (the \"cuaderna vía\") and done by educated authors. Also the topics are more serious: religious, historical and novelesque. The stanzas in them are composed of 4 alexandrine lines which contain 14 syllables each.\n\nThe most famous authors of this period are Gonzalo de Berceo and Arcipreste de Hita. The \"Poema de Fernán González\" is an example of anonymous mester de clerecía.\n\nThese poets carefully counted the number of syllables in each line and strived to achieve perfect lines. The line form is the Alexandrine line (14 syllables) with consonantal rhyme in stanzas of four lines each. This form is also known as the \"cuaderna vía\" or the fourfold way, and was borrowed from France and was popular until the late fourteenth century. Popular themes of these poets were Christian legends, lives of saints, and tales from classical antiquity. The poems were recited to villagers in public plazas. Two traits separate this form from the mester de juglaría: didacticism and erudition. Castilian priest and poet Gonzalo de Berceo was one of the greatest followers of the mester de clerecía. All of his works were religious; two of the most well known are \"Milagros de Nuestra Señora\" (about the miracles worked by the Virgin Mary) and \"Vida de Santa Oria\". Fourteenth-century poet Juan Ruíz, also known as the Arcipreste de Hita, used the cuaderna vía in parts of his famous work \"Libro de buen amor\". He introduced sixteen-syllable lines.\n"}

Standards for what may be termed a miniature rather than just a small book have changed through time. Today, most collectors consider a book to be miniature only if it is 3 inches or smaller in height, width, and thickness, particularly in the United States. Many collectors consider nineteenth-century and earlier books of 4 inches to fit in the category of miniatures. Book from 3-4 inches in all dimensions are termed macrominiature books. Books less than 1 inch in all dimensions are called microminiature books. Books less than 1/4 inch in all dimensions are known as ultra-microminiature books.\n\nMiniature books stretch back far in history; many collections contain cuneiform tablets stretching back thousands of years, and exquisite medieval Books of Hours. Printers began testing the limits of size not long after the technology of printing began, and around 200 miniature books were printed in the sixteenth century. Exquisite specimens from the 17th century abound. In the 19th century, technological innovations in printing enabled the creation of smaller and smaller type. Fine and popular additions alike grew in number throughout the 19th century. While some miniature books are objects of high craft, bound in fine Moroccan leather, with gilt decoration and excellent examples of woodcuts, etchings, and watermarks, others are cheap, disposable, sometimes highly functional items not expected to survive. Today, miniature books are produced both as fine works of craft and as commercial products found in chain bookstores.\n\nSome popular types of miniature books from various periods include Bibles, encyclopedias, dictionaries, Bilingual dictionaries, short stories, verse, famous speeches, political propaganda, travel guides, almanacs, children's stories, and the miniaturization of well-known books such as \"The Compleat Angler\", \"The Art of War\", and Sherlock Holmes stories. \n\nAbraham Lincoln, \"Proclamation of Emancipation\" (Boston : John Murray Forbes, 1863).

For instance, the pages of a miniature book do not fall open as do those of larger books, because the pages are not heavy enough. Bindings require exceptionally thin materials, and creating type that is readable and beautiful requires great skill.

Beginning in 1917 Otto Falckenberg served as director; in 1926 he moved the company into the \"Schauspielhaus\", built in Art Nouveau style in 1901 by Richard Riemerschmid and Max Littmann. Since 1933 the Münchner Kammerspiele has been a municipal theatre company of the City of Munich. Since 1961 the \"Werkraumtheater\" has served as its second stage. In 2001 the company gained a rehearsal stage next to the \"Schauspielhaus\" in a large building designed by Gustav Peichl.\n\nSince the 1920s the Münchner Kammerspiele has presented numerous world premieres, including works by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Frank Wedekind and Bertolt Brecht. Brecht, Bruno Hübner, Axel von Ambesser, Fritz Kortner, Peter Stein, Franz Xaver Kroetz, Robert Wilson, George Tabori, Erwin Faber, Max Schreck and other important actors and writers have staged plays with the company, often resulting in awards. \n\nOne famous producing-director (Intendant) of the Münchner Kammerspiele was Falckenberg (1917-1944). Known as an expert in Expressionism in Germany during the Weimar Republic, he was credited with producing or directing many celebrated productions at the company, including Brecht’s first staged play, Drums in the Night, in 1922, as well as works by Wedekind, August Strindberg and William Shakespeare. Since the 1945 end of World War II, artistic leadership has been in the hands of: Erich Engel (1945-1947), Hans Schweikart (1947-1963), August Everding (1963-1973), Hans-Reinhard Müller (1973-1983), Dieter Dorn (1983-2001) and Frank Baumbauer (2001-2009).

{"id": "22727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22727", "title": "Otaku no Video", "text": "Otaku no Video\n\nThe story begins in \"Otaku no Video 1982\", where the main character is an everyman character, Ken Kubo, living with his girlfriend Yoshiko and as a member of his college's tennis team, until introduced by his former friend Tanaka to a club of enthusiasts: a female illustrator, an information geek, a martial artist, and a weapons collector. Kubo soon joins them; and when Yoshiko abandons him, makes the wish to become the supreme enthusiast, under the name of \"Otaking\".\n\nKubo's quest continues in \"More Otaku no Video 1985\", set three years later, in which he creates his model kits, opens shops, and builds a factory in China. Later, he loses his fortune when one of his rivals (now married to Yoshiko) takes control of his enterprise; but Kubo and Tanaka, with hard-working artist Misuzu, gradually take over the anime industry with a 'magical girl' show, \"Misty May\". At the peak of their ambitions, Ken and Tanaka create Otakuland in 1999: the equivalent of Disneyland for otaku (the story suggests Otakuland to be located in the same city of Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, as the original Tokyo Disneyland.)\n\nMany years later, Ken and Tanaka return to Otakuland in a post-apocalyptic submerged Japan and find its central structure, a giant robot, converted into a functional spaceship piloted by their old friends. Miraculously rejuvenated, they fly into space in search of \"The Planet of Otaku\".\n\nA controversial and humorous part of \"Otaku no Video\" was the inclusion of live-action documentary excerpts, titled \"A Portrait of an Otaku\". In these segments, the documentary crew would interview an anonymous otaku, typically ashamed at being a fan and whose face are censored with a mosaic and have their voices digitally masked. The mock documentary segments serve as a counterpoint to the anime: while the anime emphasizes the camaradrie, creativity, and dreams of mainstream acceptance of otaku, the mock interviews exaggerate its negative qualities. The subjects run the gamut of the otaku subculture: the interviews cover a cosplayer who now works as a computer programmer and outright denies his cosplay days, even when presented with photographic evidence, but keeps his Char Aznable helmet in his desk drawer, an airsoft otaku, a garage kit otaku, and a shut-in who videorecords television programs for trade, but has not actually watched anything he's recorded. The interviews also contain fans who engage in a range of illicit or unsavory activities, such as cel thieves, a pornography fan attempting to manufacture glasses to defeat the mosaic censorship common in Japanese porn videos and who is shown masturbating during the interview, and a computer gamer—famous Gainax member Hideaki Anno—obsessed with a character in a hentai computer game (Noriko from \"Gunbuster\"—one of Anno's works—who makes a cameo in Gainax's own hentai game, \"Cybernetic High School\").\n\nIt is believed that all the subjects in the Portrait of an Otaku segments were Gainax employees or connected to Gainax at the time of filming. The first otaku interviewed bore a remarkable resemblance to Toshio Okada, a principal founder in Gainax, in both background and physical appearance. The gaijin otaku, Shon Hernandez, has been confirmed to have been Craig York, who with Shon Howell and Lea Hernandez, whose names were borrowed for the character, were the main staff of General Products USA, an early western branch of Gainax's merchandising enterprise in the early 1990s. The interview with \"Shon Hernandez\" has been a point of contention with Lea Hernandez, who, in an interview with \"PULP\" magazine, noted that the interview was unscripted and that Craig York had been fairly sincere in his thoughts and had felt that Gainax insulted their American members. In the interview, the words spoken by Shon Hernandez in the background are noticeably different from what is shown on screen via subtitle (which is based on the Japanese voice-over \"translation\").\n\nAt FanimeCon 2003, Hiroshi Sato, an animator and another Gainax member, mentioned that he had been in one of the interviews in \"Otaku no Video\". In \"Otaku no Video\", the garage kit otaku was given the pseudonym \"Sato Hiroshi\" for the interview.\n\nSince \"Otaku no Video\" was partially based in the personal life of the original creators of Gainax, who started their careers as otaku during the late seventies and the beginning of the eighties, many anime titles from that period are shown as footage or referenced in the OVA (in costumes, cosplay or other related material). Among them are \"Gatchaman\", \"Uchuu Senkan Yamato\", \"Urusei Yatsura\", \"Captain Harlock\", \"Mobile Suit Gundam\", \"Dirty Pair\", \"Space Adventure Cobra\", \"Phoenix 2772\", \"Silent Möbius\", \"Magical Princess Minky Momo\", \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross\", \"\", \"Genesis Climber Mospeada\", \"The Wings of Honneamise\", \"Top o Nerae!\" and the \"Daicon III and IV Opening Animations\".\n\n\"Otaku no Video\" was released with subtitles on VHS in North America on March 17, 1993, on DVD on April 2, 2002, and on Blu-ray Disc on June 24, 2016, all by AnimEigo.\n\n\n"}

The neighborhood is generally bounded between Front Street and Seventh Street and includes Pine Street and is known for its \"bohemian\", \"punk\", and generally \"alternative\" atmosphere. It is one of Philadelphia's largest tourist attractions. \n\nIn 2014, the area's population was 27,805. The average age for the neighborhood is 34.9, with 57.44% of the population between the ages of 18 to 44 and 62.3% of the population are renters with the average income of $71,856.\n\nAccording to City Data, the area has 1,248 males and 1,196 females.\n\nThe district spans the following areas:\n\nThe neighborhood significantly overlaps with Queen Village, Washington Square West, Bella Vista, and Society Hill.\n\nOriginally the southern border of William Penn's 1682 city plan and officially named Cedar Street until 1854, eastern South Street has been the center of local Swedish, Dutch, Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrant culture as well as a vibrant African-American neighborhood beginning in the early 1800s. Because Quaker doctrine opposed live performances within the city limits, the first permanent theater in America was built on the south side of the street at Leithgow Street, giving birth to a tradition of Philadelphians seeking out entertainment on South Street that continues today.\n\nIn 1854, the same year that South Street officially became South Street, the city boundaries were redrawn to expand the area of Philadelphia to 130 square miles. Despite no longer being a literal border, South Street remained a liminal space where cultures collided. The African-American theater district of western South Street, the Jewish shops, nearby Italian businesses, and visitors from other parts of the city combined to create a place described by William Gardner Smith in his 1954 book \"South Street\" as a lively zone of contact between many different ethnicities. \nFrom the early 1960s to the 1970s, South Street was filled with clubs and bars that fostered a growing nightlife. During this time, the neighborhood also served as an artists' haven and a hub of Beat subculture and, later, 1960s counterculture, bohemianism, and the hippie movement in Philadelphia, establishing a lasting association of South Street with avant-garde and alternative subcultures. \n\nIt was not uncommon for South Philadelphians to \"bar-hop\" across the clubs, listening to live bands along the way. This community of fans helped attract recording contracts for many artists, including Kenn Kweder, the \"bard of South Street\"; George Thorogood; and Robert Hazard. From the mid to late 1970s into the 1980s, South Street's reputation as a musical, artistic, and countercultural hub was further solidified as it became the center of Philadelphia's punk scene and punk and alternative rock music communities, with venues such as JC Dobbs and stores such as Zipperhead catering to the burgeoning scene. \n\nIn 1976, Jim's Steaks of West Philadelphia expanded to 400 South Street, becoming the notable restaurant's first franchise.\n\nIn the late 1980s, South Street became one of the city's main tourist attractions anchored by the Theatre of Living Arts (TLA) which began as an arthouse theater and then was reborn as a live music venue. Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the \"neighborhood\" community aspect was gradually lost.\n\nSouth Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and twentysomethings with its assortment of bars, take-out eateries, sex shops, gift shops, and retailers catering to hip hop fashion, punk fashion, and/or urban culture. A few restaurants and independent boutiques targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various chain stores, including Johnny Rockets, two Starbucks locations, Häagen-Dazs, Rita's Italian Ice, Super Fresh, Whole Foods, CVS, and Fine Wine & Good Spirits. South Street is adjacent to Headhouse Square, a notable plaza with various shops and restaurants.\n\nArtist Isaiah Zagar has made South Street his home since the late 1960s and his mosaic work can be seen in multiple places along South Street including his large installation Philadelphia's Magic Gardens between 10th Street and 11th Street.\n\nThe Orlons, a music group from Philadelphia, released a 1963 song based on (and entitled) South Street, which begins with the line \"Where do all the hippies meet?\" Another Philadelphia-area band, The Dovells also mentioned South Street in their 1963 hit \"You Can't Sit Down\".\n\nPhiladelphia band Need New Body has a song called \"So St RX\" which is about South Street.\n\nFear's 1982 song \"I Don't Care About You\", which name-checks the neighborhoods associated with the punk movement in the United States in the early 1980s, begins with the line, \"I'm from South Street Philadelphia\" (also relevant to writer/vocalist Lee Ving who was born in the city).\n\nThe Dead Milkmen's 1988 song \"Punk Rock Girl\" makes references to Zipperhead (a punk rock/alternative clothing and accessories store) and The Philadelphia Pizza Company., Ltd, both of which were located on South Street. Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.\n\nGreen Day made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C. Dobbs on the 300 block of South Street. The band had not yet signed with Reprise and the club oversold the 125-capacity venue. Late arrivals paid to enter the second floor and watch the live video feed. During the third song of the set, a young woman had a seizure, the show was halted, and police ended the concert and cleared the venue.\n\nBoyz II Men's debut song and video \"Motownphilly\" was partially filmed on South Street and the location is referenced in the song.\n\nSinger songwriter Jake Laufer's 2009 rockabilly song, \"Center City,\" about a guy from Tennessee coming north to meet up with his Philly-based girlfriend, features several South Street landmarks, including Lorenzo's Pizza and Famous 4th Street Deli.\nThe HBO comedy special \"The Diceman Cometh\", starring comedian Andrew Dice Clay, was recorded at South Street's Theater of the Living Arts (and was mentioned in the special by Clay).\n\nThe block of South Street between 5th and 6th Street is shown in the opening credits of the FX Network show \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\".\n\nPhiladelphia native Will Smith makes mention in his song \"Getting Jiggy with it\" in the lyric \"livin' that life some consider a myth,\nrock from south street to one two fifth\".\n\nSouth Street is served by the William M. Meredith School.\n\n\n"}

A 2016 paper (which was co-authored by Naomi Oreskes, Peter Doran, William Anderegg, Bart Verheggen, Ed Maibach, J. Stuart Carlton and John Cook, and which was based on a half a dozen independent studies by the authors) concluded that “the finding of 97% consensus [that humans are causing recent global warming] in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.”\n\nIn 2014, Bart Verheggen of the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency surveyed 1,868 climate scientists. They found that, consistent with other research, the level of agreement on anthropogenic causation correlated with expertise - 90% of those surveyed with more than 10 peer-reviewed papers related to climate (just under half of survey respondents) explicitly agreed that greenhouse gases was the main cause of global warming.\n\nJames L. Powell, a former member of the National Science Board and current executive director of the National Physical Science Consortium, analyzed published research on global warming and climate change between 1991 and 2012 and found that of the 13,950 articles in peer-reviewed journals, only 24 rejected anthropogenic global warming. This was a follow-up to an analysis looking at 2,258 peer-reviewed articles published between November 2012 and December 2013 revealed that only one of the 9,136 authors rejected anthropogenic global warming.\n\nCook \"et al.\" examined 11,944 abstracts from the peer-reviewed scientific literature from 1991–2011 that matched the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. They found that, while 66.4% of them expressed no position on anthropogenic global warming (AGW), of those that did, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are contributing to global warming. They also invited authors to rate their own papers and found that, while 35.5% rated their paper as expressing no position on AGW, 97.2% of the rest endorsed the consensus. In both cases the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position was marginally increasing over time. They concluded that the number of papers actually rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.\n\nIn their discussion of the results in 2007, the authors said that the large proportion of abstracts that state no position on AGW is as expected in a consensus situation, adding that \"the fundamental science of AGW is no longer controversial among the publishing science community and the remaining debate in the field has moved on to other topics.\"\n\nIn \"Science & Education\" in August 2013 David Legates and three coauthors reviewed the corpus used by Cook \"et al.\" In their assessment, \"inspection of a claim by Cook \"et al.\" (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1% consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3% endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic.\"\n\nHowever, as the paper took issue in the definition of consensus, the definition of consensus was split into several levels: In the end, of all the abstracts that took a position on the subject, 22.97% and 72.50% were found to take an explicit but unquantified endorsement position or an implicit endorsement position, respectively. The 0.3% figure represents abstracts taking a position of \"Actually endorsing the standard definition\" of all the abstracts (1.02% of all position-taking abstracts), where the \"standard definition\" was juxtaposed with an \"unquantified definition\" drawn from the 2013 Cook \"et al.\" paper as follows:\nCriticism was also made to the \"arbitrary\" exclusion of non-position-taking abstracts as well as other issues of definitions.\nCraig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils-Axel Mörner, who question the consensus, were cited in a \"Wall Street Journal\" article by Joseph Bast and Roy Spencer disputing the 97% figure, as climate scientists who assert that Cook misrepresented their work.\n\nClimate economist Richard Tol has also been a persistent critic of the Cook \"et al.\" paper, arguing that the authors \"used an unrepresentative sample, left out much useful data, used biased observers who disagreed with the authors of the papers they were classifying nearly two-thirds of the time, and collected and analysed the data in such a way as to allow the authors to adjust their preliminary conclusions as they went along\". Cook \"et al.\" replied to Tol's criticisms, pointing out that \"the 97% consensus has passed peer-review, while Tol's criticisms have not\".\n\nA new paper by Rasmus E. Benestad, Dana Nuccitelli, Stephan Lewandowsky, Katharine Hayhoe, Hans Olav Hygen, Rob van Dorland, and John Cook examined the quality of the 3% of peer-reviewed papers discovered by this work to reject the consensus view. They discovered that \"replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases\".\n\nLefsrud and Meyer surveyed members of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA), a professional association for the petroleum industry in Alberta. The aims of the study included examining the respondents' \"legitimation of themselves as experts on 'the truth', and their attitudes towards regulatory measures.\" Writing later, the authors added, \"we surveyed engineers and geologists because their professions dominate the oil industry and their views on climate change influence the positions taken by governments, think tanks and environmental groups.\"\n\nThe authors found that 99.4% agreed that the global climate is changing but that \"the debate of the causes of climate change is particularly virulent among them.\" Analyzing their responses, the authors labelled 36% of respondents 'comply with Kyoto', as \"they express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause.\" 'Regulation activists' (10%) \"diagnose climate change as being both human- and naturally caused, posing a moderate public risk, with only slight impact on their personal life.\" Skeptical of anthropogenic warming (sum 51%) they labelled 'nature is overwhelming' (24%), 'economic responsibility' (10%), and 'fatalists' (17%). Respondents giving these responses disagreed in various ways with mainstream scientific opinion on climate change, expressing views such as that climate change is 'natural', that its causes are unknown, that it is harmless, or that regulation such as that represented by Kyoto Protocol is in itself harmful.\n\nThey found that respondents that support regulation (46%) ('comply with Kyoto' and 'regulation activists') were \"significantly more likely to be lower in the organizational hierarchy, younger, female, and working in government\", while those that oppose regulation ('nature is overwhelming' and 'economic responsibility') were \"significantly more likely to be more senior in their organizations, male, older, geoscientists, and work in the oil and gas industry\". Discussing the study in 2013, the authors ask if such political divisions distract decision-makers from confronting the risk that climate change presents to businesses and the economy.\n\nIn an October 2011 paper published in the \"International Journal of Public Opinion Research\", researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 998 scientists working in academia, government, and industry. The scientists polled were members of the American Geophysical Union or the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and listed in the 23rd edition of American Men and Women of Science (AGU), a biographical reference work on leading American scientists, and 489 returned completed questionnaires. Of those who replied, 97% agreed that global temperatures have risen over the past century. 84% agreed that \"human-induced greenhouse warming is now occurring,\" 5% disagreed, and 12% didn't know.\n\nWhen asked \"What do you think is the % probability of human-induced global warming raising global average temperatures by two degrees Celsius or more during the next 50 to 100 years?’’: 19% of respondents answered less than 50% probability, 56% said over 50%, and 26% didn't know.\n\nWhen asked what they regard as \"the likely effects of global climate change in the next 50 to 100 years,\" on a scale of 1 to 10, from Trivial to Catastrophic:\n13% of respondents replied 1 to 3 (trivial/mild), 44% replied 4 to 7 (moderate), 41% replied 8 to 10 (severe/catastrophic), and 2% didn't know.\n\n Anderegg \"et al.\", in a 2010 paper in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\" (PNAS), reviewed publication and citation data for 1,372 climate researchers, based on authorship of scientific assessment reports and membership on multisignatory statements about anthropogenic climate change. The number of climate-relevant publications authored or coauthored by each researcher was used to define their 'expertise', and the number of citations for each of the researcher's four highest-cited papers was used to define their 'prominence'. Removing researchers who had authored fewer than 20 climate publications reduced the database to 908 researchers but did not materially alter the results. The authors of the paper say that their database of researchers \"is not comprehensive nor designed to be representative of the entire climate science community,\" but say that since they drew the researchers from the most high-profile reports and public statements, it is likely that it represents the \"strongest and most credentialed\" researchers both 'convinced by the evidence' (CE) and 'unconvinced by the evidence' (UE) on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nAnderegg \"et al.\" drew the following two conclusions:\n\n(i) 97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed here support the tenets of ACC (Anthropogenic Climate Change) outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and (ii) the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers.\n\nThis paper is an abridged version of the Zimmerman 2008 MS thesis; the full methods are in the MS thesis. A web-based poll performed by Peter Doran and Maggie Kendall Zimmerman of the Earth and Environmental Sciences department, University of Illinois at Chicago received replies from 3,146 of the 10,257 polled Earth scientists. The survey was designed to take less than two minutes to complete. Results were analyzed globally and by specialization. Among all respondents, 90% agreed that temperatures had generally risen compared to pre-1800 levels, and 82% agreed that humans significantly influence the global temperature. 76 out of the 79 respondents who \"listed climate science as their area of expertise, and who also have published more than 50% of their recent peer-reviewed papers on the subject of climate change\", thought that mean global temperatures had risen compared to pre-1800s levels. Of those 79 scientists, 75 out of the 77 answered that human activity was a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures, a sample size which would result in a margin of error of 11 percentage points. The remaining two were not asked, because in question one they responded that temperatures had remained relatively constant. Economic geologists and meteorologists were among the biggest doubters, with only 47 percent and 64 percent respectively thinking that human activity was a significant contributing factor. In summary, Doran and Zimmerman wrote:\n\nDennis Bray and Hans von Storch, of the Institute for Coastal Research at the Helmholtz Research Centre in Germany, conducted an online survey in August 2008, of 2,059 climate scientists from 34 different countries, the third survey on this topic by these authors. A web link with a unique identifier was given to each respondent to eliminate multiple responses. A total of 375 responses were received giving an overall response rate of 18%. The climate change consensus results were published by Bray, and another paper has also been published based on the survey.\n\nThe survey was composed of 76 questions split into a number of sections. There were sections on the demographics of the respondents, their assessment of the state of climate science, how good the science is, climate change impacts, adaptation and mitigation, their opinion of the IPCC, and how well climate science was being communicated to the public. Most of the answers were on a scale from 1 to 7 from 'not at all' to 'very much'.\n\nIn the section on climate change impacts, questions 20 and 21 were relevant to scientific opinion on climate change.\nQuestion 20, \"How convinced are you that climate change, whether natural or anthropogenic, is occurring now?\" Answers: 67.1% very much convinced (7), 26.7% to some large extent (5–6), 6.2% said to some small extent (2–4), none said not at all.\nQuestion 21, \"How convinced are you that most of recent or near future climate change is, or will be, a result of anthropogenic causes?\" Answers: 34.6% very much convinced (7), 48.9% being convinced to a large extent (5–6), 15.1% to a small extent (2–4), and 1.35% not convinced at all (1).\n\nIn 2007, Harris Interactive surveyed 489 randomly selected members of either the American Meteorological Society or the American Geophysical Union for the Statistical Assessment Service (STATS) at George Mason University. The survey found 97% agreed that global temperatures have increased during the past 100 years; 84% say they personally believe human-induced warming is occurring, and 74% agree that \"currently available scientific evidence\" substantiates its occurrence. Only 5% believe that human activity does not contribute to greenhouse warming; 41% say they thought the effects of global warming would be near catastrophic over the next 50–100 years; 44% say said effects would be moderately dangerous; 13% saw relatively little danger; 56% say global climate change is a mature science; 39% say it is an emerging science.\n\nA 2004 article by geologist and historian of science Naomi Oreskes summarized a study of the scientific literature on climate change. The essay concluded that there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. The author analyzed 928 abstracts of papers from refereed scientific journals between 1993 and 2003, listed with the keywords \"global climate change\". Oreskes divided the abstracts into six categories: explicit endorsement of the consensus position, evaluation of impacts, mitigation proposals, methods, paleoclimate analysis, and rejection of the consensus position. 75% of the abstracts were placed in the first three categories, thus either explicitly or implicitly accepting the consensus view; 25% dealt with methods or paleoclimate, thus taking no position on current anthropogenic climate change; none of the abstracts disagreed with the consensus position, which the author found to be \"remarkable\". According to the report, \"authors evaluating impacts, developing methods, or studying paleoclimatic change might believe that current climate change is natural. However, none of these papers argued that point.\"\n\nIn 2003, Bray and von Storch conducted a survey of the perspectives of climate scientists on global climate change. The survey received 530 responses from 27 different countries. The 2003 survey has been strongly criticized on the grounds that it was performed on the web with no means to verify that the respondents were climate scientists or to prevent multiple submissions. The survey required entry of a username and password, but the username and password were circulated to a climate skeptics mailing list and elsewhere on the internet. Bray and von Storch defended their results and accused climate change skeptics of interpreting the results with bias. Bray's submission to \"Science\" on December 22, 2004 was rejected.\n\nOne of the questions asked in the survey was \"To what extent do you agree or disagree that climate change is mostly the result of anthropogenic causes?\", with a value of 1 indicating strongly agree and a value of 7 indicating strongly disagree. The results showed a mean of 3.62, with 50 responses (9.4%) indicating \"strongly agree\" and 54 responses (9.7%) indicating \"strongly disagree\". The same survey indicates a 72% to 20% endorsement of the IPCC reports as accurate, and a 15% to 80% rejection of the thesis that \"there is enough uncertainty about the phenomenon of global warming that there is no need for immediate policy decisions.\"\n\n\n"}

The object can be a molecule, crystal lattice, lattice, tiling, or in a general case any mathematical object in N-dimensions.\n\nIn statistical thermodynamics, the symmetry number corrects for any overcounting of equivalent molecular conformations in the partition function. In this sense, the symmetry number depends upon how the partition function is formulated. For example, if one writes the partition function of ethane so that the integral includes full rotation of a methyl, then the 3-fold rotational symmetry of the methyl group contributes a factor of 3 to the symmetry number; but if one writes the partition function so that the integral includes only one rotational energy well of the methyl, then the methyl rotation does not contribute to the symmetry number. \n"}

Tennessee Williams and Myrna Loy were two of the original board members.\n\nThe first full production at this off-Broadway theatre was \"The Old Glory\", a trilogy of three one-acts by the poet Robert Lowell, produced in November 1964. The play would go on to win five Obie Awards the following year, including \"Best American Play.\"\n\nIn addition to producing Robert Lowell's first play, The American Place Theatre has produced and developed the first plays of outstanding writers from other literary forms including Donald Barthelme, Robert Coover, Paul Goodman, H. L. Mencken, Joyce Carol Oates, S. J. Perelman, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, May Swenson, and Robert Penn Warren.\n\nSignificant playwrights have been nurtured and, in many cases, initially produced at The American Place, such as:\n\nAlso, major attention has been brought to unconventional, contemporary actor/writers such as Eric Bogosian, Bill Irwin, John Leguizamo, Aasif Mandvi, and Dael Orlandersmith.\n\nThe American Place Theatre played an important role in the emerging African-American theatre beginning in the early 1960s by producing the first productions of plays by Michael Bradford, Ed Bullins, Kia Corthron, James de Jongh, Joseph Edward, Lonne Elder III, Phillip Hayes Dean, Elaine Jackson, Alonzo D. Lamont Jr., Ron Milner, Matt Robinson, Charlie L. Russell, and Vincent Smith.\n\nIts American Humorists' Series has transferred from the page to live performance the work of outstanding humorous writers, among them George Ade, Robert Benchley, Roy Blount Jr., A. Whitney Brown, Jules Feiffer, Bruce Jay Friedman, Cynthia Heimel, Dorothy Parker, Roger Rosenblatt, Damon Runyon, Jean Shepherd, James Thurber, and Calvin Trillin.\n\nThe theatre later moved to 111 West 46th Street. In 1978, The Women's Project, directed by Julia Miles, was designed to encourage, develop, and produce women playwrights and directors. After nine years of producing many groundbreaking works at The American Place Theatre, the project grew into a separate entity, Women's Project Theater.\n\nActors for whom The American Place Theatre has been a launching pad include Mary Alice, Ellen Barkin, Roscoe Lee Browne, Kathleen Chalfant, Michael Douglas, Faye Dunaway, Sandy Duncan, Morgan Freeman, Aasif Mandvi, Richard Gere, Joel Grey, Dustin Hoffman, Frank Langella, Mary McDonnell, Lauren Graham, Zakes Mokae, Howard Rollins, John Spencer, Ralph Waite, Sam Waterston, and Sigourney Weaver.\n\n\nA new chapter for the American Place Theatre began with its first Literature to Life performance in 1994 of Toni Morrison's \"The Bluest Eye\". Literature to Life, the American Place Theatre's performance-based literacy program, presents professionally staged verbatim adaptations of significant American literary works. This educational program gives students a new form of access to literature by bringing to life the world of books with performances that create an atmosphere of discovery and spark the imagination.\n\nLiterature to Life has received multiple grants from the Carnegie Corporation, an organization that has supported more than 550 New York City arts and social service institutions since its inception in 2002, and which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nBooks that have been adapted for Literature to Life's theatrical performances include Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\", Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried\", Richard Wright's \"Black Boy\", Jonathan Safran Foer's \"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\", Sue Monk Kidd's \"The Secret Life of Bees\", Khaled Hosseini's \"The Kite Runner\", and Lois Lowry's \"The Giver\".\n\nProject 451, the funding initiative of Literature to Life, was starting during the 2008/2009 season to ensure that reading, writing, and the arts remain a primary component of the education of young American citizens. Spokespeople for Project 451 include Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin, Sam Waterston, and Jessica Lange.\n\nThe titles for the 2010/2011 season were Junot Díaz' \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\", adapted and directed by Elise Thoron, and Piri Thomas' \"Down These Mean Streets\" adapted and directed by Wynn Handman. Literature to Life's new adaptation for the 2009/2010 season was Greg Mortenson's best-selling book \"Three Cups of Tea\".

It is inspired by Wil Haygood's \"Washington Post\" article \"A Butler Well Served by This Election\".\n\nLoosely based on the real life of Eugene Allen who worked in the White House for decades, the film stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines, an African-American who is a witness of notable political and social events of the 20th century during his 34-year tenure serving as a White House butler. In addition to Whitaker, the film's all-star cast also features Oprah Winfrey, John Cusack, Jane Fonda, Alex Pettyfer, Cuba Gooding Jr., Terrence Howard, Lenny Kravitz, James Marsden, David Oyelowo, Vanessa Redgrave, Alan Rickman, Liev Schreiber, Robin Williams, Minka Kelly, Mariah Carey, and Clarence Williams III. It was the last film produced by Laura Ziskin, who died in 2011.\n\nThe film was theatrically released by The Weinstein Company on August 16, 2013, to mostly positive reviews from critics, grossing over $176 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million.\n\nIn 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines recounts his life story while waiting at the White House to meet the newly inaugurated president.\n\nIn 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a cotton plantation in Macon, Georgia. When the farm's owner rapes Cecil's mother, Cecil's father confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant.\n\nIn 1937, at age eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a Washington, D.C. hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie. In 1957, Cecil is hired by the White House during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. White House maître d'hôtel Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by racially integrating Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas.\n\nLouis, the elder son, becomes a university student at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, although Cecil feels that the South is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) activist James Lawson, which leads to a nonviolent sit-in at a segregated diner, where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into alcoholism.\n\nIn 1961, after John F. Kennedy's inauguration, Louis and others are attacked by members of the Ku Klux Klan while on a freedom ride to Birmingham, Alabama. Louis participates in the 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade, where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver a national address proposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After Kennedy is assassinated his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, Jackie Kennedy gives Cecil one of the former president's neckties.\n\nLouis participates in the 1965 Selma Voting Rights Movement, which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. Johnson also gives Cecil a tie bar.\n\nIn the late 1960s, after civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, Louis tells his family that he has joined the Black Panthers. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President Richard Nixon's plans to suppress the Black Panthers.\n\nCharlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the war in Vietnam. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at Arlington National Cemetery. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his master's degree in political science and eventually running for a seat in Congress, although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.\n\nCecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President Ronald Reagan's support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support economic sanctions against Apartheid South Africa, Cecil resigns.\n\nGloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against South African apartheid; they are arrested and jailed together.\n\nIn 2008, Gloria dies shortly before Barack Obama is elected as the nation's first African-American president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly inaugurated President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. Stephen W. Rochon approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson are depicted in archival footage.\n\nMelissa Leo and Orlando Eric Street were cast as First Lady Mamie Eisenhower and Barack Obama, respectively, but did not appear in the finished film.\n\nDanny Strong's screenplay is inspired by Wil Haygood's \"Washington Post\" article \"A Butler Well Served by This Election\". The project received initial backing in early 2011, when producers Laura Ziskin and Pam Williams approached Sheila Johnson for help in financing the film. After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with Cassian Elwes, with whom they were working on \"The Paperboy\". Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, Icon U.K., a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, Michael Finley, and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started Weinstein Co. picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film. David Glasser, Weinstein Co. COO, called fund raising as an independent film, \"a story that's a movie within itself.\"\n\nThe Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights for the film after Columbia Pictures put the film in turnaround.\n\nThe film's title was up for a possible rename due to a Motion Picture Association of America claim from Warner Bros., which had inherited from the defunct Lubin Company a now-lost 1916 silent short film with the same name. The case was subsequently resolved with the MPAA granting The Weinstein Company permission to add Daniels' name in front of the title, under the condition that his name was \"75% the size of \"The Butler\". On July 23, 2013, the distributor unveiled a revised poster, displaying the title as \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\".\n\nPrincipal photography started in June 2012 in New Orleans. Production was originally scheduled to wrap in early August 2012 but was delayed by the impact of Hurricane Isaac.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film debuted in first place with $24.6 million. The film topped the North American box office in its first three consecutive weeks. The film has grossed $116.6 million in Canada and the United States, it earned $51.1 million elsewhere, for a total of $167.7 million.\n\n\"The Butler\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 71% rating on the film critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 175 reviews. The site's consensus says, \"Gut-wrenching and emotionally affecting, \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" overcomes an uneven narrative thanks to strong performances from an all-star cast.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 66 based on 47 reviews, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".\n\nTodd McCarthy praised the film saying, \"Even with all contrivances and obvious point-making and familiar historical signposting, Daniels' \"The Butler\" is always engaging, often entertaining and certainly never dull.\" Richard Roeper lauded the film's casting in particular, remarking that \"Forest Whitaker gives the performance of his career\". \"Rolling Stone\" also spoke highly of Whitaker writing that his \"reflective, powerfully understated performance...fills this flawed film with potency and purpose.\" \"Variety\" wrote that \"Daniels develops a strong sense of the inner complexities and contradictions of the civil-rights landscape.\" \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars and noted that \"It's inspiring and filled with fine performances, but the insistently swelling musical score and melodramatic moments seem calculated and undercut a powerful story.\" Miles Davis of the \"New York Tribune\" gave the film a negative review, claiming the film to be \"Oscar bait\", a cliche film designed to attract Oscar nominations.\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was more negative; \"An ambitious and overdue attempt to create a Hollywood-style epic around the experience of black Americans in general and the civil rights movement in particular, it undercuts itself by hitting its points squarely on the nose with a 9-pound hammer.\" Several critics compared the film's historical anecdotes and sentimentality to \"Forrest Gump\".\n\nPresident Barack Obama said, \"I teared up thinking about not just the butlers who worked here in the White House, but an entire generation of people who were talented and skilled. But because of Jim Crow and because of discrimination, there was only so far they could go.\"\n\nRegarding historical accuracy, Eliana Dockterman wrote in \"Time\": \"Allen was born on a Virginia plantation in 1919, not in Georgia... In the movie, Cecil Gaines grows up on a cotton field in Macon, where his family comes into conflict with the white farmers for whom they work. What befalls his parents on the cotton field was added for dramatic effect... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, [Eugene Allen's son] Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie.\"\n\nParticular criticism has been directed at the film's accuracy in portraying President Ronald Reagan. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to Michael Reagan, the former president's son, \"The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there.\" Paul Kengor, one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, \"I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan.\" In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, Kengor said, \"Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a Marxist-totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6009444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6009444", "title": "The Toronto Song", "text": "The Toronto Song\n\n\"The Toronto Song\" is a comedy song by Canadian comedy group Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie. It is one of many songs (including \"The White House Burned (The War of 1812)\") the Trolls recorded that are often mistakenly attributed to The Arrogant Worms. Originally on the \"Con Troupo Comedius\" cassette tape, \"The Toronto Song\" also appears on the CD \"Skit Happens\", a greatest hits collection of Three Dead Trolls skits. Before the tape, the song had spread across Canada but most listeners didn't know the song's name. It was (and still is) often believed to be called \"Toronto Sucks\", \"The Ontario Song\", or \"Ontario Sucks\".\n\nThe song starts with the Trolls (who are from Edmonton, Alberta) saying how much they hate the city of Toronto, its people, shanty towns, and landmarks. They then realize they hate all of Ontario, and finally all of Canada (minus Alberta, but including Calgary). The criticisms of other parts of Canada range from practical (\"Prince Edward Island is too small\") to absurd (\"Manitoba's population density is 1.9 people per square kilometre. Isn't that stupid?\").\n\nThe song is primarily poking fun at the popular Canadian activity of insulting Toronto and to a lesser extent Albertan pride and the Edmonton-Calgary rivalry.\n\nThe song was recorded with only a couple guitars. Later, a remake of the song, entitled \"The Toronto Song 2001\", had a full band performing the music and included a guitar solo and different banter. It was featured in the mockumentary film \"Let's All Hate Toronto\".\n\nOne minor error in the song is a mention of \"the Ontario Zoo\", which does not exist. Toronto does have a zoo, but it is called the Toronto Zoo. This is corrected in the 2001 remake where the lyric is changed to \"Metro Zoo\" (the zoo was originally called the \"Metropolitan Toronto Zoo\").\n\n\n"}
