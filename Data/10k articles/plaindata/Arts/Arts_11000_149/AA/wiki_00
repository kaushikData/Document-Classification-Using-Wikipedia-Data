{"id": "17102646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17102646", "title": "Architectural design values", "text": "Architectural design values\n\nArchitectural design values make up an important part of what influences architects and designers when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different architectural movements. It also differs between different schools of architecture and schools of design as well as among individual architects and designers.\n\nThe differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the pluralism in design outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.\n\nDifferent design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.\n\nThe expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse aesthetic reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: Modernism, Postmodernism, Deconstructivism, Post-structuralism, Neoclassicism, New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc. All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements. Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking, but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.\n\nThese aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.\n\nA number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.\n\nAesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.\n\nIt is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing. These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like Expressionism and the Avant-garde art. Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.\n\nThis design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The Spirit of the Times denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era, which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, collective consciousness and unconsciousness. Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.\n\nStructural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc. Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “form follows function”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties, and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for. Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.\n\nThis design value is based on the idea that simple forms, i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom. This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.\n\nThis design value is based on the idea that nature (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs. Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.\n\nThis value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates. Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product. This design value is also linked to regional differences i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.\n\nThis design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place. In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area. In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.\n\nMany architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population. Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.\n\nIt should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. Social design values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.\n\nThe Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.\n\nThis design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design. This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs. Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.\n\nThis design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve stakeholders in the design process. This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:\n\nThis design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels, which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: \n\nThis is based on an eagerness to help developing countries through architecture and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the Third World). This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.\n\nThe 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies. Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.\n\nEnvironmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on environmental design has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques. In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental high-tech architecture, and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.\n\nEnvironmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce \"eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability\". This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related. However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.\n\nThe environmental design values category consists of three design values.\n\nThis value is based on a belief that a sustainable and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations. Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.\n\nThis is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates. Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.\n\nThis design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a healthy living environment. Built into this design value, are principles like: buildings should be freestanding; sites need to be distributed to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches individual structures. Similarly, there is an emphasis on health based construction and reduction of toxic emissions through selection of appropriate materials.\n\nWithin both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.\n\nThis design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as Classicism, Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.\n\nThe Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.\n\nThis relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs. Within this design value there are three main strategies:\n\nThis is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations. This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives. These are: \n\nThis value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity. The design value of Vernacular includes key concept such as: \n\nThis design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries. Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design, which are: \n\nDesigners that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment. It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.\n\nMany architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.\n\nThis is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'. This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours. Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: \n\nThe 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.\n\nIt is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.\n\nThe novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as Modernism, with is emphasis on “starting from zero”. The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges. However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.\n\nThe design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not. Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.\n\nA movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of Christopher Alexander in the 1960s, \"Notes on the synthesis of form\". Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's Space syntax and Michael Batty's work on Spatial analysis. In architecture, the four-volume work The Nature of Order by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example A Theory of Architecture is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia. This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.\n\nSocial and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of biophilia developed by E. O. Wilson plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the Biophilia hypothesis, and in by Nikos Salingaros and others in the book \"Biophilic Design\".\n\n"}
{"id": "538948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=538948", "title": "Aulos", "text": "Aulos\n\nAn aulos (, plural , \"auloi\") or tibia (Latin) was an ancient Greek wind instrument, depicted often in art and also attested by archaeology.\n\nAn aulete (, ) was the musician who performed on an \"aulos\". The ancient Roman equivalent was the tibicen (plural \"tibicines\"), from the Latin \"tibia,\" \"pipe, \"aulos\".\" The neologism aulode is sometimes used by analogy with \"rhapsode\" and \"citharode\" (citharede) to refer to an \"aulos\" player, who may also be called an aulist; however, aulode more commonly refers to a singer who sang the accompaniment to a piece played on the aulos.\n\nThere were several kinds of \"aulos\", single or double. The most common variety was a reed instrument. Archeological finds, surviving iconography and other evidence indicate that it was double-reeded, like the modern oboe, but with a larger mouthpiece, like the surviving Armenian duduk. A single pipe without a reed was called the \"monaulos\" (\"μόναυλος\", from \"μόνος\" \"single\"). A single pipe held horizontally, as the modern flute, was the \"plagiaulos\" (\"πλαγίαυλος\", from \"πλάγιος\" \"sideways\"). A pipe with a bag to allow for continuous sound, that is a bagpipe, was the \"askaulos\" (ἀσκαυλός from ἀσκός \"askos\" \"wine-skin\").\n\nThough \"aulos\" is often erroneously translated as \"flute\", it was a double-reeded instrument, and its sound — described as \"penetrating, insisting and exciting\" — was more akin to that of the bagpipes, with a chanter and (modulated) drone. Like the Great Highland Bagpipe, the \"aulos\" has been used for martial music, but it is more frequently depicted in other social settings. It was the standard accompaniment of the passionate elegiac poetry. It also accompanied physical activities such as wrestling matches, the broad jump, the discus throw and to mark the rowing cadence on triremes, as well as sacrifices and dramas. Plato associates it with the ecstatic cults of Dionysus and the Korybantes, banning it from his Republic but reintroducing it in \"Laws\".\n\nIt appears that some variants of the instrument were loud, shrill, and therefore very hard to blow. A leather strap, called a \"phorbeiá\" (\"φορβεία\") in Greek or \"capistrum\" in Latin, was worn horizontally around the head with a hole for the mouth by the \"auletai\" to help support the lips and avoid excessive strain on the cheeks due to continuous blowing. Sometimes a second strap was used over the top of the head to prevent the \"phorbeiá\" from slipping down. Aulos players are sometimes depicted with puffed cheeks. The playing technique almost certainly made use of circular breathing, very much like the Sardinian launeddas and Armenian duduk, and this would give the aulos a continuous sound.\n\nAlthough aristocrats with sufficient leisure sometimes practiced aulos-playing as they did the lyre, after the later fifth century the aulos became chiefly associated with professional musicians, often slaves. Nevertheless, such musicians could achieve fame. The Romano-Greek writer Lucian discusses aulos playing in his dialogue \"Harmonides\", in which Alexander the Great's aulete Timotheus discusses fame with his pupil Harmonides. Timotheus advises him to impress the experts within his profession rather than seek popular approval in big public venues. If leading musicians admire him, popular approval will follow. However, Lucian reports that Harmonides died from excessive blowing during practicing.\n\nIn myth, Marsyas the satyr was supposed to have invented the aulos, or else picked it up after Athena had thrown it away because it caused her cheeks to puff out and ruined her beauty. In any case, he challenged Apollo to a musical contest, where the winner would be able to \"do whatever he wanted\" to the loser—Marsyas's expectation, typical of a satyr, was that this would be sexual in nature. But Apollo and his lyre beat Marsyas and his aulos. And since the pure lord of Delphi's mind worked in different ways from Marsyas's, he celebrated his victory by stringing his opponent up from a tree and flaying him alive. King Midas was cursed with donkey's ears for judging Apollo as the lesser player. Marsyas's blood and the tears of the Muses formed the river Marsyas in Asia Minor.\n\nThis opposition is mostly an Athenian one. It might be surmised that things were different at Thebes, which was a center of aulos-playing. At Sparta – which had no Bacchic or Korybantic cults to serve as contrast – the aulos was actually associated with \"Apollo\", and accompanied the hoplites into battle.\n\nThe battle scene on the Chigi vase shows an aulos player setting a lyrical rhythm for the hoplite phalanx to advance to. This accompaniment reduced the possibility of an opening in the formation of the blockage; the aulete had a fundamental role in insuring the integrity of the phalanx. In this particular scene, the phalanx approaching from the left is unprepared and momentarily outnumbered four to five. More soldiers can be seen running up to assist them from behind. Even though the front four are lacking a fifth soldier, they have the advantage because the aulete is there to bring the formation back together.\n\nAn amphora from ca. 540-530 B.C. depicts Herakles in the process of completing his tenth labor. Auletes can be seen playing in a procession going around on the neck of the amphora. \nThe sounds of the aulos are being digitally recreated by the Ancient Instruments Sound/Timbre Reconstruction Application (ASTRA) project which uses physical modeling synthesis to simulate the aulos sounds. Due to the complexity of this process the ASTRA project uses grid computing to model sounds on hundreds of computers throughout Europe simultaneously.\n\nThe aulos is part of the Lost Sounds Orchestra, alongside other ancient instruments which ASTRA have recreated the sounds of, including the epigonion, the salpinx, the barbiton and the syrinx.\n\nThe Aulos was also featured in the movie \"Agora\", wherein a character performs a solo in an amphitheatre. It is also visible in the movie 300.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6400749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6400749", "title": "Automobile folklore", "text": "Automobile folklore\n\nThe major effects of the automobile on societies include the development of diverse customs and traditions.\nSome drivers believe that a new car is in greater danger than a used car of getting into an accident or having a collision. Some drivers will leave change under their seats. Others use one coin to scratch the car, based on the (false) belief that since the car is new and nothing has happened to it yet, the chances of something bad happening to the car is greater when compared to a used car which already has its fair share of dents and scratches. In hopes of preventing a high damaging accident, they will place a small nick or scratch on the car in an area where it will not be seen. The inside of the wheel well is one commonly scratched area.\n\nThere are also a few practices associated with graduations. In the days leading up to a graduation, some drivers (and in some cases friends of the driver) will write on the car windows with washable paint. The messages usually congratulate the driver of the car and list the driver’s school and year of graduation. After graduating from high school or college, some drivers choose to hang their tassel from the rearview mirror.\n\nSome people throw change under a bed in hopes of bringing good luck to the new home. Change is known world wide as a good luck charm.\n\nThere are also religious acts that are associated with automobiles. This can include getting the car blessed by a cleric or placing an object of religious significance inside the car.\n\nA predominately Roman Catholic practice is to place a medal of Saint Christopher, the patron saint of truck drivers and travelers in general, inside the car. Usually, the driver will have this medal blessed by a priest. An ancient legend, mentioned by Erasmus in the \"Praise of Folly\", holds that those who see an image of Saint Christopher cannot die through misadventure during that day. Not surprisingly, images of Saint Christopher became popular automobile accessories. Through the presence of the medal, the driver is asking the Saint to pray on his or her behalf for a safe and uneventful journey.\n\nA somewhat more sombre purpose originally stood behind the familiar plastic Jesus that some Christians have mounted on their dashboards. The original plastic Jesus was circulated by the Sacred Heart Auto League, founded in 1955 by Father Gregory Bezy, SCJ. This devotional society placed the traditional Roman Catholic figure of Jesus displaying his Sacred Heart on the dashboard. Father Bezy was moved to do this as a \"practical answer to what he considered the ever-increasing dangers of our overcrowded streets and highways.\" In other words, in the event of a fatal accident, Father Bezy hoped that the last thing the riders would see would be the image of Jesus, and as such face Eternity with faith and contrition.\n\nThe plastic dashboard Jesus proved popular among non-Catholic Christians as well. The figure is well known enough to have inspired a folk song \"Plastic Jesus\", originally attributed to Ed Rush and George Cromarty, which has acquired many anonymous folk variants. One frequent set of verses has it open:\n\nSome Catholics will also hang rosary beads from their rearview mirror.\n\nCatholics and other Christians may also hang crosses or crucifixes from the rearview mirror.\n\nCars are often decorated, and have wishes written on them, and various streamers or trailing objects attached, in celebrations of weddings and graduations.\n\nA frequent wedding tradition in the United States involves the decoration of the vehicle the bride and groom drive take at the conclusion of the wedding ceremony. Typically, various ribbons and streamers are attached, and words written upon the surface of the vehicle, and often tin cans are attached to its fenders or bumpers by strings to serve as noisemakers. Jan Brunvand's \"American Folklore: An Encyclopedia\" speculates that the decoration of the car and its equipment with noisemakers may perpetuate the shivaree, a custom in which newlyweds were given a noisy serenade; when honeymoon travel became a custom, it made a traditional local shivaree impractical, so the vehicle is given a noisy sendoff instead.\n\nSome cars are used chiefly for special occasions and social rituals, such as limousines.\n\nVarious professions revolving around motor vehicles acquire a folklore of their own. Truck drivers, since they tend to work in isolation, tend to develop a social network of their own. They circulate a number of tall tales that relate generally to their profession, usually involving the outwitting of state police and other traffic or tax authorities. They also create an elaborate body of customs and lore surrounding the use of citizen's band radio, with its own jargon and \"handles\", which came to national notice in the 1970s. A widespread bit of popular folklore circulated among other motorists that truck drivers knew which restaurants to patronize and which to avoid, so eateries that were obviously frequented by truck drivers were esteemed by the general public. With the arise of national restaurant chains, this bit of folklore is fading.\n\nSimilar folklore surrounds taxicab drivers, involving the tales they tell among each other, and the tales that circulate about them.\n\nThere is a practice in New Jersey and New York of tossing a few coins onto the floor of a newly purchased car as a sign of good luck. This practice originated as a practical one. Because of the area's many toll roads, many drivers would carry change in their cars. The friends and family of the new car owner would throw coins onto the floor of the new car so if the driver ever ran out of his own money, he could always reach down and find some extra money on the floor.\n"}

This was followed at 7am by the first edition of the breakfast magazine show \"\", presented by Hywel Gwynfryn with contributions from a network of local reporters in studios across Wales. The first record played on Radio Cymru was \"Ffrindiau Bore Oes\" by Hergest.\n\nThe station was the first broadcasting outlet dedicated wholly to programmes in Welsh, allowing much more airtime for such output than had previously been available on the old Radio 4 Wales (or its predecessors the Welsh Home Service and, before that, the BBC Welsh Regional Programme).\n\nAt the time of the station's launch, it was the only radio service in the UK broadcasting exclusively on FM (VHF). Initially, the service was part-time and restricted to breakfast shows, extended news bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime & early evening and a number of off-peak opt outs from a sustaining Radio 4 Wales feed.\n\nIn November 1979, Radio Cymru's programming was expanded to 65 hours a week, introducing mid-morning output on weekdays, along with a growing line-up of dramas, light entertainment and documentaries. The network continued to expand over the next two decades before achieving a continuous service of up to 20 hours a day.\n\nLater developments in the 21st century saw Radio Cymru introducing a nightly youth strand, \"C2\", and regional opt-outs for South West Wales, which were axed in 2008 but later reintroduced to provide live commentary of Swansea City A.F.C. matches.

One of its more unusual - and longest-running - programmes is \", a poetry competition in which teams must come up with poetry in specific styles on specific topics.\n\nAs of March 2018, the station had 121,000 weekly listeners and a 2.9% market share. An average Radio Cymru listener listened to the station for 12.4 hours each week. Radio Cymru has seen its weekly audience increase by 2,000 listeners since March 2017, where its weekly audience amounted to 119,000 listeners.\n\nOn Monday 19 September 2016, BBC Cymru launched a second radio service, \"Radio Cymru Mwy\" (Radio Cymru More), as a trial pop-up station broadcasting for three months in the run-up to the station's 40th anniversary. Consisting of five hours of music-led entertainment programming each weekday, Radio Cymru Mwy was available on DAB in south east Wales and online.\n\nSix months after the station closed, BBC Cymru announced it would launch a permanent second station, Radio Cymru 2. The new service airs for two hours every morning on digital and online platforms, as a music and entertainment alternative to the main network.

There are instances where the baileo serves as a mosque or church or adjacent to one. This is the case when the house serves as a repository for sacred objects and a place of traditional ceremonies in addition to its function as a place for community meetings. \n\nThe \"baileo,\" which is present in every Moluccan village, is usually a village landmark with its open architecture. It also has a large size and unique appearance when compared to other buildings in its vicinity. It is traditionally built from local materials such as planked timber, cement, stone or brick with wood shingle, and thatch or zinc roof.\n\nRecent interest in baileo emerged within the recent revival process in parts of Indonesia that seeks to reestablish traditional institutions and symbols.\n"}

The journalist disguised himself to pass as an African-American man for six weeks in 1959 in the Deep South to report on life in the segregated society from the other side of the color line. The film was directed by Carl Lerner and the screenplay was written by Carl and Gerda Lerner. The film stars James Whitmore, Sorrell Booke and Roscoe Lee Browne.\n\nThe DVD was released December 11, 2012 in North America from Video Services Corp. The DVD includes a documentary titled \"Uncommon Vision\" about John Howard Griffin, the journalist on which the main character is based.\n\nJohn Finley Horton (James Whitmore) is a white journalist who artificially darkens his skin in order to pass for a black man. He travels for several weeks in the Deep South in order to report from the other side of the color line in the segregated society. He spends time in places from New Orleans to Atlanta, and encounters racism from both white and black people.\n\n\nCritical reception for the film has been mixed. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" described the film as \"melodramatic and unsubtle\". He said it failed to place the viewer inside a Negro's skin, and to convince the audience that the protagonist \"is truly passing for black\".\n\nReviewing the film after the 2012 DVD release, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a positive 3 out of 4 stars. He said that, although some aspects of the film felt dated, the film's themes were still timely.\n\nThe film made its DVD debut on February 12, 2002 by VCI Home Video. It later was re-released by Video Service Corp on December 11, 2012.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2421056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2421056", "title": "Bronze Age sword", "text": "Bronze Age sword\n\nBronze Age swords appeared from around the 17th century BC, in the Black Sea region and the Aegean, as a further development of the dagger. They were replaced by iron swords during the early part of the 1st millennium BC.\n\nFrom an early time the swords reached lengths in excess of 100 cm. The technology to produce blades of such lengths appears to have been developed in the Aegean, using alloys of copper and tin or arsenic, around 1700 BC. Bronze Age swords were typically not longer than 80 cm; weapons significantly shorter than 60 cm are variously categorized as \"short swords\" or daggers. Before about 1400 BC swords remained mostly limited to the Aegean and southeastern Europe, but they became more widespread in the final centuries of the 2nd millennium BC, to Central Europe and Britain, to the Near East, Central Asia, Northern India and to China.\n\nBefore bronze, stone (such as flint and obsidian) was used as the primary material for edged cutting tools and weapons. Stone, however, is too brittle for long, thin implements such as swords. With the introduction of copper, and subsequently bronze, knives could be made longer, leading to the sword.\n\nThus, the development of the sword from the dagger was gradual, and in 2004 the first \"swords\" were claimed for the Early Bronze Age (c. 33rd to 31st centuries), based on finds at Arslantepe by Marcella Frangipane, professor of Prehistory and Protohistory of the Near and Middle East at Sapienza University of Rome. A cache of nine swords and daggers was found; they are made of arsenic-copper alloy. Among them, three swords were beautifully inlaid with silver.\n\nThese are the weapons of a total length of 45 to 60 cm which could be described as either short swords or long daggers. Some other similar swords have been found in Turkey, and are described by Thomas Zimmermann.\n\nThe sword remained extremely rare for another millennium, and became more widespread only with the closing of the 3rd millennium. The \"swords\" of this later period can still readily be interpreted as daggers, as with the copper specimen from Naxos (dated roughly 2800 to 2300 BC), with a length of just below 36 cm, but individual specimens of the Cycladic \"copper swords\" of the period around 2300 reach a length up to 60 cm. The first weapons that can unambiguously be classified as swords are those found in Minoan Crete, dated to about 1700 BC, which reach lengths of more than 100 cm. These are the \"type A\" swords of the Aegean Bronze Age.\n\nThe Minoan and Mycenaean (Middle to Late Aegean Bronze Age) swords are classified in types labeled A to H following Sandars (1961, 1963), the \"Sandars typology\".\nTypes A and B (\"Tab-tang\") are the earliest from about the 17th to 16th centuries, types C (\"Horned swords\") and D (\"Cross swords\") from the 15th century, types E and F (\"T-hilt swords\") from the 13th and 12th.\nThe 13th to 12th centuries also see a revival of the \"Horned\" type, classified as types G and H. Type H swords are associated with the Sea Peoples and were found in Anatolia (Pergamon) and Greece.\nContemporary with types E to H is the so-called Naue II type, imported from south-eastern Europe.\n\nOne of the most important, and longest-lasting, types of prehistoric European swords was the Naue II type, named for Julius Naue who first described them and also known as \"Griffzungenschwert\" or \"grip-tongue sword\". It first appears in c. the 13th century BC in Northern Italy (or a general Urnfield background), and survived well into the Iron Age, with a life-span of about seven centuries, until the 6th century BC. During its lifetime the basic design was maintained, although the material changed from bronze to iron. Naue II swords were exported from Europe to the Aegean, and as far afield as Ugarit, beginning about 1200 BC, i.e. just a few decades before the final collapse of the palace cultures in the Bronze Age collapse. Naue II swords could be as long as 85 cm, but most specimens fall into the 60 to 70 cm range.\n\nSwords from the Nordic Bronze Age appear from ca. the 13th century BC, often showing characteristic spiral patterns. The early Nordic swords are also comparatively short; a specimen discovered in 1912 near Bragby, Uppland, Sweden, dated to about 1800 to 1500 BC, was just over 60 cm long. This sword was, however, classified as of the Hajdúsámson-Apa type, and was presumably imported. The Vreta Kloster sword discovered in 1897 (dated 1600 to 1500 BC) has a blade length (the hilt is missing) of 46 cm.\n\nA typical variant for European swords is the leaf shaped blade, which was most common in North-West Europe at the end of the Bronze Age, on the British Isles in particular.\nThe carp's tongue sword is a type of bronze sword that was common to Western Europe during ca. the 9th to 8th centuries BC. The blade of the carp's tongue sword was wide and parallel for most of its length but the final third narrowed into a thin tip intended for thrusting. The design was probably developed in north-western France, and combined the broad blade useful for slashing with a thinner, elongated tip suitable for thrusting. Its advantages saw its adoption across Atlantic Europe. In Britain, the metalwork in the south east derived its name from this sword: the Carp's Tongue complex. Notable examples of this type were part of the Isleham Hoard.\n\nThe Bronze Age style sword and construction methods died out at the end of the early Iron Age (Hallstatt D)), around 600-500 BC, when swords are once again replaced by daggers in most of Europe. An exception is the Xiphos from Greece, the development of which continued for several more centuries.\nThe antenna sword, named for the pair of ornaments suggesting antennae on its hilt, is a type of the Late Bronze Age, continued in early iron swords of the East Hallstatt and Italy region.\n\nSword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age Shang Dynasty, from roughly 1200 BC. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the Warring States period and Qin Dynasty (221 BC – 207 BC). Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high-tin edges over softer, lower-tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade (see the sword of Gou Jian). Also unique for Chinese bronzes is the consistent use of high-tin bronze (17-21% tin), which is very hard and breaks under excess stress, whereas other cultures preferred lower tin bronze (usually 10%), which bends instead. China continued to make both iron and bronze swords longer than any other region; iron completely replaced bronze only in the early Han Dynasty.\n\nSwords have been recovered in archaeological findings of the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture throughout the Ganges-Yamuna Doab region of India, commonly made of copper, but in some instances made of bronze. Diverse specimens have been discovered in Fatehgarh, where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to periods between 1700-1400 BC, but were probably used more extensively during 1200-600 BC (Painted Grey Ware culture, Iron Age India).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12920649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12920649", "title": "Budget album", "text": "Budget album\n\nBudget albums (also known as drugstore records or, then, junk records) were low-priced vinyl LPs of popular and classical music released during the 1950s to 1970s consisting either of previously released material (usually the releases from major labels featuring older performances of well-known performers) or material recorded especially for the line (often cover versions of popular songs made famous by name artists sung or performed on these albums by usually unidentified and unknown entertainers). Prices ranged from as low as 59 U.S. cents (minor label releases of the 1950s) to $2.98 (major label repackaging of older material in the 1970s). In the UK Pickwick Records' \"Top of the Pops\" record series, which operated between 1968 and 1985, was the most successful budget album range.\n\nDiscount stores (as well as Department stores) have had records produced by them by various record producing companies since the 1910s. It was fashionable for a chain like McCrory's or Kress to have their own exclusive label. Most of these records contained songs also available on many other 'exclusive' labels. (For example from the 1920s into the 1930s, Paramount produced the 'Broadway' label for Montgomery Ward, Cameo produced the 'Romeo' label for Kress, Columbia produced the 'Diva' label for W.T. Grant, and Plaza produced the 'Oriole' label for McCrory's, among many others.)\n\nDrugstore records were called such as they were often sold in metal racks similar to the racks used for paperback books in drugstores or dimestores in the 1960s for prices from half to a quarter of regular LP albums. These records were markedly less expensive than major label recordings.\n\nThe initial \"drugstore records\" mostly comprised popular music played or sung by unknown orchestras or singers, or conversely, once famous singers or orchestras playing music or songs that were relatively unknown (popular singers' early and obscure recordings were often showcased as well). \n\nBy the LP era, in some cases (notably the least expensive of the records) the record album would have only one cover version of a famous song or tune. Many of these albums had attractive album cover artwork (often picturing beautiful starlets such as Jayne Mansfield, Kim Novak, Irish McCalla, and the then-unknown Mary Tyler Moore). The album were often filled out with music in the public domain or obscure music never recorded by anyone else. Sometimes the \"orchestras\" comprised very few musicians, were performed by background music companies, or were recorded outside the United States by orchestras credited under different names, such as \"101 Strings\".\n\nDespite major record companies lowering their prices or starting their own budget labels, the budget album companies, such as Coronet who sold their LPs for 99 cents, remained popular.\n\nDrugstore records originated with Pickwick International, founded by Cy Leslie. Leslie's first business was a prerecorded greeting card service that turned into children's record label Voco Records in 1946. In 1950 Leslie founded Pickwick Records and by 1953 Pickwick entered the LP market providing lower priced records. Another early producer of drugstore records was Enoch Light, who started Waldorf Music Hall Records under the auspices of the F.W. Woolworth dime store chain. Unlike most drugstore record producers, Light was well regarded both as a musician and for his technical recording knowledge; which he would make much use of later in establishing Command Records.\n\nProbably the best known and most prolific drugstore label was Crown Records, an offshoot of Modern Records, originally a jazz label owned by the Bihari brothers and operated from Los Angeles. From the mid-1950s to the early 80s, Crown turned out hundreds of cheaply produced LPS of country, Hawaiian, Latin, and other musical genres; often performed by pseudonymous studio groups; as well as jazz and blues material reissued from the Modern label.\n\nIn 1954 Pickwick entered into a licensing arrangement with Capitol Records giving Pickwick the rights to press and distribute Capitol's secondary and noncurrent titles on their label. Pickwick's records were mostly sold in stores other than record shops such as department stores, dimestores, drugstores, and supermarkets. Pickwick later had several subsidiaries such as Bravo, Design, International Award, Hurrah, Grand Prix, and Hallmark Records in the U.K.\n\nRCA Records introduced RCA Camden Records in 1955, a budget label for re-releasing older recordings by currently popular artists on the label or vintage material from previous decades. Occasionally, original music was produced for release on RCA Camden such as children's music and instrumentals. RCA Camden also released single albums of country music recorded especially for the budget label by many of its newer country acts of the 1960s such as Connie Smith, Liz Anderson, and Dottie West to perhaps encourage sales of the artists' full-priced product. RCA Camden was particularly successful in repackaging older Elvis Presley recordings on the Camden label, as well as previously released and also unreleased material he recorded for his motion pictures, making these albums among the select few budget albums to actually make the national best-selling charts. At one point the Camden albums were doing so well that two of Presley's major hit singles of the early 1970s - \"Burning Love\" and \"Separate Ways\" (and their respective flipsides) made their album debuts not on mainstream RCA released, but on RCA Camden. Not long before Presley's death, RCA sold the Camden label to Pickwick.\n\nThe major labels' budget album releases were seldom sold at \"drug stores\", mainly at record shops and department stores just like the full-price product although RCA Camden did on occasion market their albums in speciality \"drug store\" racks. The major label budget albums usually had eight to ten songs on them (usually nine) as opposed to full-price releases which contained ten to twelve songs.\n\nColumbia Records re-introduced the Harmony Records line around the same time for budget releases of older product repackaged. Harmony, however, seldom issued material that had not been previously released (Columbia has used the Harmony name from 1926 through 1932 and again in the late 1940's).\n\nThe budget albums' heyday was in the late 1960s and early 1970s when nearly every recording artist of note had one or more such collections on the market. Often these were recordings done for a previous record label before the star's current popularity.\n\nOther major labels of the day with their own budget lines include:\n\nOther budget record labels were Somerset Records that became Alshire Records in 1963, Stereo Fidelity, Audio Spectrum, Peter Rabbit (children's records), Azteca, Score Records, a subsidiary of Aladdin Records, Custom, and Diplomat Records, a product of the Synthetic Plastics Company who made Peter Pan Records and Ambassador Records.\n\nIn England, UK the Woolworths Group jointly owned Embassy Records with Oriole Records, later part of CBS.\n\nThe Music for Pleasure (MFP) label was set up in 1965 as a joint venture between EMI, which provided the source material, and the publisher Paul Hamlyn, which handled distribution in so-called non-traditional outlets, such as W.H. Smith, the booksellers. The MFP catalogue consisted of both original material and reissues of existing EMI recordings.\n\nNotable artists to have begun their careers recording for budget albums include Lou Reed, Jerry Cole, Sun Ra, Al Kooper and Tina Charles. Perhaps the most notable artists to emerge from a career as a \"cover artist\" for budget albums include Dolly Parton, who early in her career as a teenaged vocalist, recorded several covers of Kitty Wells hits for budget album release, and Elton John, who recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s for the \"Top of the Pops\" album series.\n\n\"See also List of record labels\n"}

{"id": "16300571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16300571", "title": "Computational creativity", "text": "Computational creativity\n\nComputational creativity (also known as artificial creativity, mechanical creativity, creative computing or creative computation) is a multidisciplinary endeavour that is located at the intersection of the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and the arts.\n\nThe goal of computational creativity is to model, simulate or replicate creativity using a computer, to achieve one of several ends:\n\n\nThe field of computational creativity concerns itself with theoretical and practical issues in the study of creativity. Theoretical work on the nature and proper definition of creativity is performed in parallel with practical work on the implementation of systems that exhibit creativity, with one strand of work informing the other.\n\nAs measured by the amount of activity in the field (e.g., publications, conferences and workshops), computational creativity is a growing area of research. But the field is still hampered by a number of fundamental problems. Creativity is very difficult, perhaps even impossible, to define in objective terms. Is it a state of mind, a talent or ability, or a process? Creativity takes many forms in human activity, some \"eminent\" (sometimes referred to as \"Creativity\" with a capital C) and some \"mundane\".\n\nThese are problems that complicate the study of creativity in general, but certain problems attach themselves specifically to \"computational\" creativity:\n\n\nIndeed, not all computer theorists would agree with the premise that computers can only do what they are programmed to do—a key point in favor of computational creativity.\n\nBecause no single perspective or definition seems to offer a complete picture of creativity, the AI researchers Newell, Shaw and Simon developed the combination of novelty and usefulness into the cornerstone of a multi-pronged view of creativity, one that uses the following four criteria to categorize a given answer or solution as creative:\n\n\nWhereas the above reflects a \"top-down\" approach to computational creativity, an alternative thread has developed among \"bottom-up\" computational psychologists involved in artificial neural network research. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, for example, such generative neural systems were driven by genetic algorithms. Experiments involving recurrent nets were successful in hybridizing simple musical melodies and predicting listener expectations.\n\nConcurrent with such research, a number of computational psychologists took the perspective, popularized by Stephen Wolfram, that system behaviors perceived as complex, including the mind's creative output, could arise from what would be considered simple algorithms. As neuro-philosophical thinking matured, it also became evident that language actually presented an obstacle to producing a scientific model of cognition, creative or not, since it carried with it so many unscientific aggrandizements that were more uplifting than accurate. Thus questions naturally arose as to how \"rich,\" \"complex,\" and \"wonderful\" creative cognition actually was.\n\nBefore 1989, artificial neural networks have been used to model certain aspects of creativity. Peter Todd (1989) first trained a neural network to reproduce musical melodies from a training set of musical pieces. Then he used a change algorithm to modify the network's input parameters. The network was able to randomly generate new music in a highly uncontrolled manner. In 1992, Todd\nextended this work, using the so-called distal teacher approach that had been developed by\nPaul Munro, Paul Werbos, D. Nguyen and Bernard Widrow, Michael I. Jordan and David Rumelhart. In the new approach there are two neural networks, one of which is supplying training patterns to another. \nIn later efforts by Todd, a composer would select a set of melodies that define the melody space, position them on a 2-d plane with a mouse-based graphic interface, and train a connectionist network to produce those melodies, and listen to the new \"interpolated\" melodies that the network generates corresponding to intermediate points in the 2-d plane.\n\nMore recently a neurodynamical model of semantic networks has been developed to study how the connectivity structure of these networks relates to the richness of the semantic constructs, or ideas, they can generate. It was demonstrated that semantic neural networks that have richer semantic dynamics than those with other connectivity structures may provide insight into the important issue of how the physical structure of the brain determines one of the most profound features of the human mind – its capacity for creative thought.\n\nSome high-level and philosophical themes recur throughout the field of computational creativity.\n\nMargaret Boden refers to creativity that is novel \"merely to the agent that produces it\" as \"P-creativity\" (or \"psychological creativity\"), and refers to creativity that is recognized as novel \"by society at large\" as \"H-creativity\" (or \"historical creativity\"). Stephen Thaler has suggested a new category he calls \"V-\" or \"Visceral creativity\" wherein significance is invented to raw sensory inputs to a Creativity Machine architecture, with the \"gateway\" nets perturbed to produce alternative interpretations, and downstream nets shifting such interpretations to fit the overarching context. An important variety of such V-creativity is consciousness itself, wherein meaning is reflexively invented to activation turnover within the brain.\n\nBoden also distinguishes between the creativity that arises from an exploration within an established conceptual space, and the creativity that arises from a deliberate transformation or transcendence of this space. She labels the former as \"exploratory creativity\" and the latter as \"transformational creativity\", seeing the latter as a form of creativity far more radical, challenging, and rarer than the former. Following the criteria from Newell and Simon elaborated above, we can see that both forms of creativity should produce results that are appreciably novel and useful (criterion 1), but exploratory creativity is more likely to arise from a thorough and persistent search of a well-understood space (criterion 3) -- while transformational creativity should involve the rejection of some of the constraints that define this space (criterion 2) or some of the assumptions that define the problem itself (criterion 4). Boden's insights have guided work in computational creativity at a very general level, providing more an inspirational touchstone for development work than a technical framework of algorithmic substance. However, Boden's insights are more recently also the subject of formalization, most notably in the work by Geraint Wiggins.\n\nThe criterion that creative products should be novel and useful means that creative computational systems are typically structured into two phases, generation and evaluation. In the first phase, novel (to the system itself, thus P-Creative) constructs are generated; unoriginal constructs that are already known to the system are filtered at this stage. This body of potentially creative constructs are then evaluated, to determine which are meaningful and useful and which are not. This two-phase structure conforms to the Geneplore model of Finke, Ward and Smith, which is a psychological model of creative generation based on empirical observation of human creativity.\n\nA great deal, perhaps all, of human creativity can be understood as a novel combination of pre-existing ideas or objects . Common strategies for combinatorial creativity include:\nThe combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. Genetic algorithms and neural networks can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs.\n\nMark Turner and Gilles Fauconnier propose a model called Conceptual Integration Networks that elaborates upon Arthur Koestler's ideas about creativity as well as more recent work by Lakoff and Johnson, by synthesizing ideas from Cognitive Linguistic research into mental spaces and conceptual metaphors. Their basic model defines an integration network as four connected spaces:\n\n\nFauconnier and Turner describe a collection of optimality principles that are claimed to guide the construction of a well-formed integration network. In essence, they see blending as a compression mechanism in which two or more input structures are compressed into a single blend structure. This compression operates on the level of conceptual relations. For example, a series of similarity relations between the input spaces can be compressed into a single identity relationship in the blend.\n\nSome computational success has been achieved with the blending model by extending pre-existing computational models of analogical mapping that are compatible by virtue of their emphasis on connected semantic structures. More recently, Francisco Câmara Pereira presented an implementation of blending theory that employs ideas both from GOFAI and genetic algorithms to realize some aspects of blending theory in a practical form; his example domains range from the linguistic to the visual, and the latter most notably includes the creation of mythical monsters by combining 3-D graphical models.\n\nLanguage provides continuous opportunity for creativity, evident in the generation of novel sentences, phrasings, puns, neologisms, rhymes, allusions, sarcasm, irony, similes, metaphors, analogies, witticisms, and jokes. Native speakers of morphologically rich languages frequently create new word-forms that are easily understood, although they will never find their way to the dictionary. The area of natural language generation has been well studied, but these creative aspects of everyday language have yet to be incorporated with any robustness or scale.\n\nSubstantial work has been conducted in this area of linguistic creation since the 1970s, with the development of James Meehan's TALE-SPIN\n\nThe company Narrative Science makes computer generated news and reports commercially available, including summarizing team sporting events based on statistical data from the game. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.\n\nExample of a metaphor: \"She was an ape.\"\n\nExample of a simile: \"Felt like a tiger-fur blanket.\"\nThe computational study of these phenomena has mainly focused on interpretation as a knowledge-based process. Computationalists such as Yorick Wilks, James Martin, Dan Fass, John Barnden, and Mark Lee have developed knowledge-based approaches to the processing of metaphors, either at a linguistic level or a logical level. Tony Veale and Yanfen Hao have developed a system, called Sardonicus, that acquires a comprehensive database of explicit similes from the web; these similes are then tagged as bona-fide (e.g., \"as hard as steel\") or ironic (e.g., \"as hairy as a bowling ball\", \"as pleasant as a root canal\"); similes of either type can be retrieved on demand for any given adjective. They use these similes as the basis of an on-line metaphor generation system called Aristotle that can suggest lexical metaphors for a given descriptive goal (e.g., to describe a supermodel as skinny, the source terms \"pencil\", \"whip\", \"whippet\", \"rope\", \"stick-insect\" and \"snake\" are suggested).\n\nThe process of analogical reasoning has been studied from both a mapping and a retrieval perspective, the latter being key to the generation of novel analogies. The dominant school of research, as advanced by Dedre Gentner, views analogy as a structure-preserving process; this view has been implemented in the structure mapping engine or SME, the MAC/FAC retrieval engine (Many Are Called, Few Are Chosen), ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine) and ARCS (Analogical Retrieval Constraint System). Other mapping-based approaches include Sapper, which situates the mapping process in a semantic-network model of memory. Analogy is a very active sub-area of creative computation and creative cognition; active figures in this sub-area include Douglas Hofstadter, Paul Thagard, and Keith Holyoak. Also worthy of note here is Peter Turney and Michael Littman's machine learning approach to the solving of SAT-style analogy problems; their approach achieves a score that compares well with average scores achieved by humans on these tests.\n\nHumour is an especially knowledge-hungry process, and the most successful joke-generation systems to date have focussed on pun-generation, as exemplified by the work of Kim Binsted and Graeme Ritchie. This work includes the JAPE system, which can generate a wide range of puns that are consistently evaluated as novel and humorous by young children. An improved version of JAPE has been developed in the guise of the STANDUP system, which has been experimentally deployed as a means of enhancing linguistic interaction with children with communication disabilities. Some limited progress has been made in generating humour that involves other aspects of natural language, such as the deliberate misunderstanding of pronominal reference (in the work of Hans Wim Tinholt and Anton Nijholt), as well as in the generation of humorous acronyms in the HAHAcronym system of Oliviero Stock and Carlo Strapparava.\n\nThe blending of multiple word forms is a dominant force for new word creation in language; these new words are commonly called \"blends\" or \"portmanteau words\" (after Lewis Carroll). Tony Veale has developed a system called ZeitGeist that harvests neological headwords from Wikipedia and interprets them relative to their local context in Wikipedia and relative to specific word senses in WordNet. ZeitGeist has been extended to generate neologisms of its own; the approach combines elements from an inventory of word parts that are harvested from WordNet, and simultaneously determines likely glosses for these new words (e.g., \"food traveller\" for \"gastronaut\" and \"time traveller\" for \"chrononaut\"). It then uses Web search to determine which glosses are meaningful and which neologisms have not been used before; this search identifies the subset of generated words that are both novel (\"H-creative\") and useful. Neurolinguistic inspirations have been used to analyze the process of novel word creation in the brain, understand neurocognitive processes responsible for intuition, insight, imagination and creativity and to create a server that invents novel names for products, based on their description. Further, the system Nehovah blends two source words into a neologism that blends the meanings of the two source words. Nehovah searches WordNet for synonyms and TheTopTens.com for pop culture hyponyms. The synonyms and hyponyms are blended together to create a set of candidate neologisms. The neologisms are then scored based on their word structure, how unique the word is, how apparent the concepts are conveyed, and if the neologism has a pop culture reference. Nehovah loosely follows conceptual blending.\n\nLike jokes, poems involve a complex interaction of different constraints, and no general-purpose poem generator adequately combines the meaning, phrasing, structure and rhyme aspects of poetry. Nonetheless, Pablo Gervás has developed a noteworthy system called ASPERA that employs a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach to generating poetic formulations of a given input text via a composition of poetic fragments that are retrieved from a case-base of existing poems. Each poem fragment in the ASPERA case-base is annotated with a prose string that expresses the meaning of the fragment, and this prose string is used as the retrieval key for each fragment. Metrical rules are then used to combine these fragments into a well-formed poetic structure. Racter is an example of such a software project.\n\nComputational creativity in the music domain has focused both on the generation of musical scores for use by human musicians, and on the generation of music for performance by computers. The domain of generation has included classical music (with software that generates music in the style of Mozart and Bach) and jazz. Most notably, David Cope has written a software system called \"Experiments in Musical Intelligence\" (or \"EMI\") that is capable of analyzing and generalizing from existing music by a human composer to generate novel musical compositions in the same style. EMI's output is convincing enough to persuade human listeners that its music is human-generated to a high level of competence.\n\nIn the field of contemporary classical music, Iamus is the first computer that composes from scratch, and produces final scores that professional interpreters can play. The London Symphony Orchestra played a piece for full orchestra, included in Iamus' debut CD, which \"New Scientist\" described as \"The first major work composed by a computer and performed by a full orchestra\". Melomics, the technology behind Iamus, is able to generate pieces in different styles of music with a similar level of quality.\n\nCreativity research in jazz has focused on the process of improvisation and the cognitive demands that this places on a musical agent: reasoning about time, remembering and conceptualizing what has already been played, and planning ahead for what might be played next. The robot Shimon, developed by Gil Weinberg of Georgia Tech, has demonstrated jazz improvisation. Virtual improvisation software based on machine learning models of musical style include OMax, SoMax and PyOracle, are used to create improvisations in real-time by re-injecting variable length sequences learned on the fly from live performer.\n\nIn 1994, a Creativity Machine architecture (see above) was able to generate 11,000 musical hooks by training a synaptically perturbed neural net on 100 melodies that had appeared on the top ten list over the last 30 years. In 1996, a self-bootstrapping Creativity Machine observed audience facial expressions through an advanced machine vision system and perfected its musical talents to generate an album entitled \"Song of the Neurons\"\n\nIn the field of musical composition, the patented works by René-Louis Baron allowed to make a robot that can create and play a multitude of orchestrated melodies so-called \"coherent\" in any musical style. All outdoor physical parameter associated with one or more specific musical parameters, can influence and develop each of these songs (in real time while listening to the song). The patented invention \"Medal-Composer\" raises problems of copyright.\n\nComputational creativity in the generation of visual art has had some notable successes in the creation of both abstract art and representational art. The most famous program in this domain is Harold Cohen's AARON, which has been continuously developed and augmented since 1973. Though formulaic, Aaron exhibits a range of outputs, generating black-and-white drawings or colour paintings that incorporate human figures (such as dancers), potted plants, rocks, and other elements of background imagery. These images are of a sufficiently high quality to be displayed in reputable galleries.\n\nOther software artists of note include the NEvAr system (for \"Neuro-Evolutionary Art\") of Penousal Machado. NEvAr uses a genetic algorithm to derive a mathematical function that is then used to generate a coloured three-dimensional surface. A human user is allowed to select the best pictures after each phase of the genetic algorithm, and these preferences are used to guide successive phases, thereby pushing NEvAr's search into pockets of the search space that are considered most appealing to the user.\n\nThe Painting Fool, developed by Simon Colton originated as a system for overpainting digital images of a given scene in a choice of different painting styles, colour palettes and brush types. Given its dependence on an input source image to work with, the earliest iterations of the Painting Fool raised questions about the extent of, or lack of, creativity in a computational art system. Nonetheless, in more recent work, The Painting Fool has been extended to create novel images, much as AARON does, from its own limited imagination. Images in this vein include cityscapes and forests, which are generated by a process of constraint satisfaction from some basic scenarios provided by the user (e.g., these scenarios allow the system to infer that objects closer to the viewing plane should be larger and more color-saturated, while those further away should be less saturated and appear smaller). Artistically, the images now created by the Painting Fool appear on a par with those created by Aaron, though the extensible mechanisms employed by the former (constraint satisfaction, etc.) may well allow it to develop into a more elaborate and sophisticated painter.\n\nThe artist Krasimira Dimtchevska and the software developer Svillen Ranev have created a computational system combining a rule-based generator of English sentences and a visual composition builder that converts sentences generated by the system into abstract art. The software generates automatically indefinite number of different images using different color, shape and size palettes. The software also allows the user to select the subject of the generated sentences or/and the one or more of the palettes used by the visual composition builder.\n\nAn emerging area of computational creativity is that of video games. ANGELINA is a system for creatively developing video games in Java by Michael Cook. One important aspect is Mechanic Miner, a system which can generate short segments of code which act as simple game mechanics. ANGELINA can evaluate these mechanics for usefulness by playing simple unsolvable game levels and testing to see if the new mechanic makes the level solvable. Sometimes Mechanic Miner discovers bugs in the code and exploits these to make new mechanics for the player to solve problems with.\n\nIn July 2015 Google released \"DeepDream\" – an open source computer vision program, created to detect faces and other patterns in images with the aim of automatically classifying images, which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dreamlike psychedelic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.\n\nIn August 2015 researchers from Tübingen, Germany created a convolutional neural network that uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images which is able to turn images into stylistic imitations of works of art by artists such as a Picasso or Van Gogh in about an hour. Their algorithm is put into use in the website DeepArt that allows users to create unique artistic images by their algorithm.\n\nIn early 2016, a global team of researchers explained how a new computational creativity approach known as the Digital Synaptic Neural Substrate (DSNS) could be used to generate original chess puzzles that were not derived from endgame databases. The DSNS is able to combine features of different objects (e.g. chess problems, paintings, music) using stochastic methods in order to derive new feature specifications which can be used to generate objects in any of the original domains. The generated chess puzzles have also been featured on YouTube.\n\nCreativity is also useful in allowing for unusual solutions in problem solving. In psychology and cognitive science, this research area is called creative problem solving. The Explicit-Implicit Interaction (EII) theory of creativity has recently been implemented using a CLARION-based computational model that allows for the simulation of incubation and insight in problem solving. The emphasis of this computational creativity project is not on performance per se (as in artificial intelligence projects) but rather on the explanation of the psychological processes leading to human creativity and the reproduction of data collected in psychology experiments. So far, this project has been successful in providing an explanation for incubation effects in simple memory experiments, insight in problem solving, and reproducing the overshadowing effect in problem solving.\n\nSome researchers feel that creativity is a complex phenomenon whose study is further complicated by the plasticity of the language we use to describe it. We can describe not just the agent of creativity as \"creative\" but also the product and the method. Consequently, it could be claimed that it is unrealistic to speak of a \"general theory of creativity\". Nonetheless, some generative principles are more general than others, leading some advocates to claim that certain computational approaches are \"general theories\". Stephen Thaler, for instance, proposes that certain modalities of neural networks are generative enough, and general enough, to manifest a high degree of creative capabilities. Likewise, the Formal Theory of Creativity is based on a simple computational principle published by Jürgen Schmidhuber in 1991. The theory postulates that creativity and curiosity and selective attention in general are by-products of a simple algorithmic principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress.\n\nTraditional computers, as mainly used in the computational creativity application, do not support creativity, as they fundamentally transform a set of discrete, limited domain of input parameters into a set of discrete, limited domain of output parameters using a limited set of computational functions . As such, a computer cannot be creative, as everything in the output must have been already present in the input data or the algorithms . For some related discussions and references to related work are captured in some recent work on philosophical foundations of simulation.\n\nMathematically, the same set of arguments against creativity has been made by Chaitin. Similar observations come from a Model Theory perspective. All this criticism emphasizes that computational creativity is useful and may look like creativity, but it is not real creativity, as nothing new is created, just transformed in well defined algorithms.\n\nThe International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC) occurs annually, organized by The Association for Computational Creativity. Events in the series include:\n\nPreviously, the community of computational creativity has held a dedicated workshop, the International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity, every year since 1999. Previous events in this series include:\n\n\nThe 1st Conference on Computer Simulation of Musical Creativity will be held\n\nDesign Computing and Cognition is one conference that addresses computational creativity. The ACM Creativity and Cognition conference is another forum for issues related to computational creativity. Journées d'Informatique Musicale 2016 keynote by Shlomo Dubnov was on Information Theoretic Creativity.\n\nA number of recent books provide either a good introduction or a good overview of the field of Computational Creativity. These include:\n\n\nIn addition to the proceedings of conferences and workshops, the computational creativity community has thus far produced these special journal issues dedicated to the topic:\n\n\nIn addition to these, a new journal has started which focuses on computational creativity within the field of music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10428943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10428943", "title": "Cromwell on his Farm", "text": "Cromwell on his Farm\n\nCromwell on his Farm (1874) is a painting by Ford Madox Brown which depicts Oliver Cromwell observing a bonfire on his farm and thinking of a passage in the Book of Psalms: \"Lord, how long wilt thou hide thyself - forever? And shall thy wrath burn like fire?\" (Psalm 89). The words are inscribed on the painting's frame along with a quotation from one of Cromwell's speeches, in which he describes his life before entering into politics: \"living neither in any considerable height, nor yet in obscurity, I did endeavour to discharge the duty of an honest man.\"\n\nThe painting depicts Cromwell as a country squire on his lands in Cambridgeshire, before he became a national figure in the power struggles which culminated in the English Civil War. Cromwell's identity as a leading revolutionary had been affirmed by Thomas Carlyle's biography \"Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations\" (1845), in which his reluctance to take up the role of leader was emphasised. Carlyle was an important influence on Brown.\n\nThe painting's central theme is that of enforced inertia. In it, Cromwell is portrayed as someone who has the capacity to become a major player on the national stage, but who is restricted to his own small world. It emphasises inertia through the portrayal of the distraction of Cromwell's horse by wayside fodder, which is also being eaten by a lamb from the farm: a reference to the concept of the Christian flock. The wandering piglets following a sow under Cromwell's horse refer to the story of the Gadarene swine. Cromwell carries an oak sapling in lieu of a whip, and a copy of the Bible.\n\nThe farm is a metaphor for the state, a place in which orderly labour is threatened continually by forces of disorder and in which the most everyday details are potentially filled with moral and eschatological significance. While the workers on the left of the composition are getting on with their labours, clearing away weeds, the servant at the right is demanding a response from Cromwell, her shout repeated by the screeching duck she carries. The pigs under the horse and the lamb all create a potential for disruption and instability. Behind the workers clearing weeds, a young farm worker barely controls the large herd of cattle streaming though the gate into Crowmell's farm, separating the latter from his wife and child, visible at the door of the house at the right. A spot of blood can be seen on Cromwell's collar, a reference to a famous description of him by Sir Philip Warwick, and emblematic of a bloodstained future.\n\n"}

In tradition of Marcel Duchamp, the \"two main roles\" of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a mirror. \nThe work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.\n\nThe concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries.\nThe wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.\n\n\"Note:\" 'deFENCE' project was created by Gregor Marković from Serbia, in January 2006.

Given a design task and a governing set of criteria (\"design specifications\"), several conceptual designs may be drafted. Each of these preliminary concepts is a potential design choice. Many never advance beyond the preliminary phase; those that are developed to the point at which they could be applied become the pool from which the final selection is made. This process stems from the principle that there is usually no uniquely right way of accomplishing any task. The final selection is often made on a financial basis; i.e., the least expensive design is chosen in a bid process. \n\nIn civil engineering, design choices usually derive from basic principles of materials science and structural design. A suspension bridge, for example, uses the fact that steel is extremely efficient in tension, while a prestressed concrete bridge takes advantage of concrete's relatively low cost by weight and its ability to sustain high compressive loading (see compression).\n"}
{"id": "4376342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4376342", "title": "Eagle, Globe, and Anchor", "text": "Eagle, Globe, and Anchor\n\nThe Eagle, Globe, and Anchor is the official emblem and insignia of the United States Marine Corps. It is commonly referred to as an EGA, although this verbiage is officially discouraged by the U.S. Marine Corps. The current emblem traces its roots in the designs and ornaments of the early Continental Marines as well as the United Kingdom's Royal Marines. The present emblem, adopted in 1955, differs from the emblem of 1868 only by a change in the eagle. Before that time many devices, ornaments, ribbons, and distinguishing marks followed one another as official badges of the corps.\n\nIn 1776, the device consisted of a fouled anchor (tangled in its rope) of silver or pewter. Changes were made in 1798, 1821, and 1824. In 1834, it was prescribed that a brass eagle be worn on the cover, the eagle to measure from wingtip to wingtip. An eagle clutching a fouled anchor with thirteen six-pointed stars above was used on uniform buttons starting in 1804. This same insignia is used today on the buttons of Marine dress and service uniforms, with the six-pointed stars changed to five-pointed stars.\n\nDuring the early years numerous distinguishing marks were prescribed, including \"black cockades\", \"scarlet plumes\", and \"yellow bands and tassels\". In 1859, the first version of the present color scheme for the officer's dress uniform insignia appeared on an elaborate device of solid white metal and yellow metal. The design included a United States shield, half wreath, a bugle, and the letter \"M.\"\n\nIn 1868, the Commandant, Brigadier General Jacob Zeilin, appointed a board \"to decide and report upon the various devices of cap ornaments of the Marine Corps.\" On November 13, 1868, the board recommended the modern insignia. It was approved by the commandant four days later, and by the Secretary of the Navy on November 19, 1868.\n\nThe emblem recommended by the 1868 board consisted of a \"globe\" (showing the continents of the Western Hemisphere) intersected by a \"fouled anchor\", and surmounted by a \"spread eagle\". On the emblem itself, there is a ribbon, clasped in the eagle's beak, bearing the Latin motto \"Semper Fidelis\" (). The uniform insignias omit the motto ribbon.\n\nThe general design of the emblem was probably derived from the Royal Marines' \"Globe and Laurel.\" The globe on the U.S. Marine emblem signifies the Corps' readiness to service in any part of the world. The eagle represents the United States. The anchor, which dates back to the founding of the corps in 1775, acknowledges the naval tradition of the Marines and their continual service within the Department of the Navy.\n\nThere are some differences between the uniform insignia for enlisted marines and that of officers: \nThe enlisted Marines' dress blue uniform insignia is die-struck from a single sheet of brass and annodized a gold color. The service uniform insignia is coated a flat black color.\n\nThe officers' insignia is assembled from four parts: a die-struck silver colored globe with eagle, and gold colored anchor with silver colored fouling rope, and gold colored continents.\n\nIn 1954, the Commandant, General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., requested the design of an official seal for the corps. \n\nThe new seal included the traditional Eagle, Globe, and Anchor emblem in gold, with the Globe and anchor rope in silver. The eagle is depicted with wings displayed, standing upon the western hemisphere of the terrestrial globe, and holding in his beak a white ribbon bearing the Marine Corps motto \"Semper Fidelis\" (Always Faithful) with the hemisphere superimposed on a fouled anchor. An American bald eagle replaced the crested eagle depicted on the 1868 emblem.\n\nThe emblem is displayed on a scarlet background encircled with a blue band bearing the phrases \"Department of the Navy\" above and \"United States Marine Corps\" below in white letters, the whole edged in a gold rope \n\nU.S. President Eisenhower approved the design on June 22, 1954. The emblem as shown on the seal was adopted in 1955 as the official Marine Corps emblem.\n\nThe emblem of the US Marine Corps became an inspiration of the marine corps insignia of Thailand and South Korea. The Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC) and Royal Thai Marine Corps (RTMC) uses an insignia patterned after the emblem of the USMC.\n\nThe emblem of ROKMC consist of a golden star superimposed into the fouled anchor. The eagle appeared similarly to that of the USMC's.\n\nWhereas, the insignia of RTMC appears almost similarly to that of the USMC, with the exception of the golden Garuda above the globe, and the silhouette map of Thailand.\n\n"}

She was accepted into royal social circles and was a popular hostess. A noted beauty, she became romantically involved with Arthur Sullivan during the 1870s and continued as his companion until his death in 1900. She was much admired as a singer and became famously associated with one of Sullivan's most popular songs, \"The Lost Chord\".\n\nMary Frances Carter was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Joseph Ballard Carter (1813–1889) and his wife, Mary (née Chamberlain) Carter (died 1898). In 1859 at age twenty, already known as a beauty with a talent for singing, she married Pierre Lorillard Ronalds (grandson of Pierre Lorillard II), a New Yorker called by \"The New York Times\", \"The Father of American Coaching\". The young Mrs. Ronalds quickly became a noted socialite and hostess. At one magnificent ball that she gave in the early 1860s, Ronalds famously appeared dressed \"as Music, in a white satin gown embroidered with bars from Verdi's \"Un ballo in maschera\"\", wearing a harp-shaped, illuminated crown. The Ronalds had four children. A contemporary account described Ronalds as follows: \"Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown – \"châtain foncé\" [deep chestnut] – and very abundant... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth.\"\n\nBy 1867, she had separated from her husband, whom she never divorced. She developed a relationship with the wealthy Leonard Jerome (Winston Churchill's grandfather), a notorious womanizer, but somehow maintained a friendship with his wife and daughters, including Jennie Churchill, who remembered Ronalds singing them to sleep. She often visited their home in Newport, Rhode Island, and when Mrs. Jerome moved to Paris with her daughters, Ronalds followed, taking her younger children. There, noted for her beauty and social talents, she joined the court circles of the pleasure-loving Empress Eugénie and Napoleon III. During a party, Napoleon rescued her after she fell into one of his ponds. She soon met Arthur Sullivan during one of his visits to Paris. According to \"The New York Times\", she became the leader of the American community in Paris. In 1868, in the French courts, Ronalds obtained a legal separation from her husband, giving her control over their children.\n\nIntroduced by Napoleon and Eugénie to British society, she quickly became one of the many \"friends\" of the skirt-chasing Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and was soon known for hosting fashionable musical entertainments and elegant soirées for artists, musicians and high society. With the faltering of the Second Empire as unrest grew in France, her opportunities there collapsed, and Ronalds moved with her children to Tunis in 1869. There she became a partner in some farm property near Sidi Thabet with the French Count de Sancy.\n\nIn early 1875, Ronalds left Tunis and moved to London. She had continued to maintain her friendship with Jennie Jerome, who became Lady Randolph Churchill in 1874. She later became friendly with Queen Victoria and Queen Alexandra.\n\nRonalds' affair with Sullivan began not long after she moved to London. Though three years his senior, she was still in her mid-thirties and beautiful, with a strong personality. Social conventions of the time compelled them to keep their relationship discreet. She was still married, but even had she been divorced, Sullivan would not have been willing to face the social stigma of marrying a divorcee. Their relationship deepened after the deaths of his brother Fred (1877) and his mother (1882). Sullivan became close with Ronalds' children and parents, especially after his brother Fred's family moved to America in 1883. In his diaries, Sullivan referred to her as \"Mrs. Ronalds\" when he saw her in a public setting, but \"L. W.\" (for \"Little Woman\") when they were alone together, often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed. It is thought that Ronalds was pregnant on at least two occasions, and she apparently procured an abortion in 1882 and again in 1884. The 1999 biographical film \"Topsy-Turvy\" depicts Sullivan and Ronalds discussing an abortion at around the time of the production of \"The Mikado\". Eleanor David portrays Ronalds in the film.\n\nSullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrel when one of his many other liaisons was discovered, but he always returned to Ronalds. She was his constant companion until his death in 1900, but by about 1889 or 1890, the sexual relationship seems to have ended. He started to refer to her in the diary as \"Auntie\" (she also was called \"auntie\" by his nephew, Herbert Sullivan), and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there, although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified and who were always referred to by their initials.\n\nRonalds was an excellent and much admired singer, using her voice for good causes since her days in New York, when she gave concerts in aid of Civil War troops; later \"in Paris she was known as the \"Patti des Salons\". Sullivan described her as \"the best amateur singer in London\". She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirees. She became particularly associated with one of his most popular songs, \"The Lost Chord\", which he composed in 1877 as he watched over his dying brother. Ronalds became its most famous interpreter, singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan himself accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests. For Ronalds, Sullivan composed the song \"St. Agnes' Eve\". Ronalds also wrote songs, including \"In Shadow\" (1881).\nIn 1899 when the Boer War broke out, Ronalds was elected treasurer of an effort to finance an American hospital ship, the \"S.S. Maine\", to be sent to South Africa. She was also active in charitable work for the Red Cross and received the Royal Red Cross among other honors. In July 1901 she was appointed an Honorary Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John.\n\nWhen Ronalds died in 1916, at the age of 76, a copy of the manuscript of \"The Lost Chord\" was buried with her, at her request. She is buried in the Brompton Cemetery in London. In an inscription to a wreath that she sent to the funeral, Princess Louise described Ronalds as \"one of the kindest and most unselfish of women\". She was survived by her children, Pierre Lorillard Ronalds, Jr., Reginald Ronalds (who became a Rough Rider) and Fannette (\"Fannie\") Ritchie.\n\n"}

With a length of , the route runs from Hanau in central Germany to Bremen in the north. Tourist attractions along the route are focused around the brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, including locations where they lived and worked at various stages in their life, as well as regions which are linked to the fairy tales found in the Grimm collection, such as The Town Musicians of Bremen. The \"Verein Deutsche Märchenstraße\" society, headquartered in the city of Kassel, is responsible for the route, which travellers can recognize with the help of road signs depicting the heart-shaped head of a pretty, fairylike creature.\n\nThe German Fairy Tale Route passes through various scenic regions, which include eight nature parks including the Hessian Spessart Nature Park, Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Park, Kellerwald-Edersee Nature Park, Meißner-Kaufungen Forest Nature Park, Habichtswald Nature Park and the Weser Uplands Nature Park.\nThe towns and cities associated with the Brothers Grimm and located along the route are Hanau, Steinau, Marburg and Kassel. The original \"Children’s and Household Tales\" (German: \"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\"), edited and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in 1812 and known today as \"Grimm’s Fairy Tales\" (German: \"Grimms Märchen\"), can be found in Kassel. In 2005, this collection was added to the UNESCO World Document Heritage List. Several places along the Fairy Tale Route are connected with the fairy tales themselves. In the town of Alsfeld, visitors can see what is known as the House of Little Red Riding Hood (\"Rotkäppchenhaus\"); the spa Bad Wildungen offers a Snow White Museum (\"Schneewittchen Museum\"); and Dorothea Viehmann, from whom the Grimms learned about many of the fairy tales found in their collection, was born in what today is the community of Baunatal. According to legend, the hill Hoher Meissner is where Mother Hulda is said to have resided; Sababurg Castle, located in Reinhardswald Park, is referred to as the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Further attractions include the town of Hamelin, of Pied Piper fame; the spa of Bad Oeynhausen, which has a museum devoted to fairy tales and local legends (\"Deutsches Märchen- und Wesersagenmuseum\"); and the city of Bremen, which is famous for the tale of the Town Musicians of Bremen.\n\nNumerous picturesque medieval towns can be found among the Route's attractions as well. In 1975, the Council of Europe awarded Alsfeld the status of a model European community for the conservation of historic buildings. The old centre of the town of Hann. Münden comprises roughly 700 half-timbered houses; the 1300-year-old town of Fritzlar is famous for its imperial cathedral; and Hamelin contains beautiful examples of Weser Renaissance architecture.\n\nThe baroque grounds of Philippsruhe Castle in Hanau, the fountain displays in the Hillside Park of Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe, as well as the Bremen Town Hall with the adjacent statue of Roland (both of which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List) are also of particular interest. The 200th anniversary of the first publication of Children's and Household Tales by the Brothers Grimm was observed in 2012-2013 with a series of events. Many other events, open-air festivals, exhibits, and performances dealing with the topic of fairy tales are held annually.\n\nThe German Fairy-Tale Route runs from south to north and passes the following places of interest:\n\nBetween Kassel and Fürstenberg, the Route offers two alternatives:\n\n\n\nTo the north of Fürstenberg, the Route’s two forks rejoin:\n\n\n Hamelin 2011. \n\nPlaces along the route:\n"}

{"id": "2452926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2452926", "title": "Guang (vessel)", "text": "Guang (vessel)\n\nA guang or gong is a particular shape used in Chinese art for vessels, originally made as Chinese ritual bronzes in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BC), and sometimes later in Chinese porcelain. They are a type of ewer which was used for pouring rice wine at ritual banquets, and often deposited as grave goods in high-status burial. Examples of the shape may be described as ewers, ritual wine vessels, wine pourers and similar terms, though all of these terms are also used of a number of other shapes, especially the smaller tripod \"jue\" and the larger \"zun\".\n\nThe \"guang\" has a single thick foot, and a thick hollow body that represents one or more stylized animals (some have a head at both ends). Guangs have a vertical handle at one end and a spout at the other, both zoomorphic, and were often highly decorated with taotie. The handle of the guang is of often in the shape of the neck and head of an animal with stylized horns, and the spout of the vessel is in the form of the head of a creature whose mouth constitutes the end of the spout. The back and animal head at the pouring end usually are a removable lid, lifted off for pouring.\n\nTheir main period of use was during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, from around 1700 to 900 BCE; thereafter the shape was sometimes used in a revivalist spirit. The Ritual wine server (\"guang\"), Indianapolis Museum of Art, 60.43 is a fine example from about 1100 BC.\n\nThe guang bronze ritual vessels of Early China were primarily used to house and serve wine during ancestor worship rituals in which the wine vapors were to be consumed by the deceased spirits and the actual physical contents to be enjoyed by the living. This use, for storage and serving, is suggested through the form of the vessel. It is typically supported by one oval-shaped foot (supported more rarely by four legs), while the bronze itself takes the form of several animals and fantastical creatures metamorphosed. Each guang also has a neck and head, which serve as the pouring channel for the wine. A lid accompanies the vessel to complete the form. According to Robert Bagley, this lid is the chief idiosyncrasy, or characteristic, of the guang, for it is where the largest relief and decoration often takes place. While this decor is significant in the meaning behind these works, the animal and fantastic creature ornamentation does not have an exact intended purpose for the bronzes, and is still left to interpretation.\n\nGuang bronze vessels were used not only in life to honor the deceased, but also at times placed with the deceased in their grave. Because of this, the ritual vessels are not only apotropaic but useful to the living as well. They are both everyday functioning items, but also objects which serve religious and spiritual purposes.\n\nThe Guang is distinguishable by its zoomorphic lid and handle, and its one-footed base. The animal figure at the front of the lid is often a tiger or dragon, while the sculpted handle ranges in decoration from fantastic creatures such as dragons to real animals such as rams, elephants, and the beaks of birds. Some guang lids also depict animals, typically birds, at the back of the vessel facing or transitioning into the handle. The animals on the lid and handle are presented \"in the round\".\n\nThe surface of the vessel is decorated in low- to mid-relief. This relief may depict the bodies belonging to creatures rendered on the lid or other complete animal figures. It is not uncommon for one animal to transition directly into another. The lower sections of the guang are also often divided into registers and quadrants by flanges. This flange can be the central divider of a taotie, a mask-like creature motif with curving horns and two dragon-like bodies stretching out to its sides.\nOther surface embellishments include geometric background shapes such as the squared-spiral, the \"lei-wen\". These were used both to fill in empty space between more representational imagery and sometimes as smaller detail in those images.\n\n\"See Also:\" Shang Dynasty\n\nThe guang, one of many types of Chinese ritual bronze vessels, is both late to come into the world of bronze vessels, and lasts a very short amount of time. The earliest account of guang vessels comes from late in the Shang dynasty, during the Anyang Period, spanning from c. 1300-1046 BCE. These vessels were distinct from other guang objects in early Chinese history because of their decoration. In the Shang Dynasty, the guang featured ornamentation which had not been fully developed. In a late twelfth century to early eleventh century guang, the decoration is lacking on the bottom register, but more innovative in design in the lid and upper registers. In the Qi Guang vessel from approximately the same time period, the decoration has been compartmentalized and unified in style, which utilizes conventional motifs of bird, dragon, and other animal imagery.\n\n\"See Also:\" Western Zhou\n\nThe Western Zhou Dynasty is the final period in which guang vessels are known to have been made, due widely to the Ritual Revolution which occurred in the late Western Zhou dynasty, ultimately reducing the number of wine vessels being made. Before this disappearance, the guang saw changes in form, such as the ovular foot being sometimes replaced with four legs. The decoration also becomes more refined, yet still using animal and fantastic imagery.\n\nEarly Chinese bronze vessels were cast using the piece-mold process. This process involved the artist forming the mold in pieces from clay, then connecting them to make one overall vessel form. With this method, the decoration on a vessel's surface had to be incised into the clay in reverse and negative. This means that images that would be raised on the surface of the metal would have to become depressions in the clay mold. The void inside the mold is then filled with molten metal, creating the positive. In contrast, the process of lost-wax casting allows an artisan to create a wax model of the desired object. The molten metal takes the place of the wax when cast. Frequently it was necessary in the casting of large vessels to cast the main portion, include it in the construction of another mold, and then cast protrusions—such as the guang's handle—onto that piece.\n\nguang (觥)vessel.\n\nFrom late Shang to early Zhou dynasty, the number of characters per inscription increased on these bronze vessels. These inscriptions recorded very important events (such as sacrifices), gifts by a king to his officials, praise accorded to ancestors, records for exchange/sale land, and political marriages to make stronger relationships.\n\nAfter the \"Ritual Revolution\", some of the wine vessels were no longer in use in Western Zhou dynasty. The Guang vessel were only popular in Late Shang to Early Western Zhou dynasty.\n\nAsian Art Museum, 1977.\n\n"}

He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and educated at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nVezin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Charles Henri Vezin, a merchant of French heritage, and his wife Emilie (née Kalinsky). His great-great-grandfather Pierre de Vezin was married to the seventeenth-century French actress Marie Charlotte de Châteauneuf. Rouget de Lisle, the composer of the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise,\" was one of his distant cousins. After studying law for several years, Vezin graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with an A.B. in 1847 and later a master's degree in 1850.\n\nDespite resistance from his family, Vezin was determined to work as an actor and departed America for the UK shortly after graduation. He made his first appearance at the York Theatre Royal in St. Leonard's Place, York, England. After playing minor roles in several provincial engagements, he began performing leading characters as Cardinal Richelieu, Sir Edward Mortimer, Claude Melnotte, and Young Norval. He made his London début in 1852 at the Princess's Theatre. On February 21, 1863, at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, he married the former child actress, English-born Jane Elizabeth Thompson who, appearing as an adult under the name Mrs. Charles Young, had made a reputation as an actress both in Australia and in England. They appeared in many plays with together until her death in 1902. Together they had a son, the silent film actor, Arthur Vezin.\n\nApart from a brief professional tour of the United States in 1857–58, the majority of Vezin's acting career took place on the English stage. Though primarily an actor, in 1866 he collaborated with the playwrights W. G. Wills and James Albery to write the vaudeville inspired play \"Doctor Davey\" based on the 1842 play \"Le Docteur Robin\" by French writer Jules de Prémaray in which he also played the title role. The following year he starred as a troubled Scottish poet James Harebell in Wills' \"Man o' Airlie\" (1867) to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Vezin followed up with other successful showings, such as \"The Turn of the Tide\" by F. C. Burnand (1869), \"Son of the Soil\" (1872); \"As You Like It\" (1875); and W. S. Gilbert's \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\", which ran for one hundred and nineteen performances at the Haymarket Theatre (1876, also a revival in 1884); He acted with Charles Fechter, Samuel Phelps, Henry Irving, and in 1878 played Dr. Primrose alongside actress Ellen Terry in Wills' \"Olivia, Vicar of Wakefield\" (1878), a highly successful adaptation of Oliver Goldsmith's novel, \"The Vicar of Wakefield\" (1766).\n\nSir J. Forbes-Robertson described Vezin in the \"London Post\" as a \"bright and dapper little man, who was both \"learned and dictatorial on the art of acting.\" The Illustrated London News review of Vezin in the title role of \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\" noted that \"Mr. Vezin is probably the most intellectual of our actors, and is the very man for creating an original part, such as that of Dan'l Druce\" and described one scene as \"an acting hit by Mr. Hermann Vezin which literally electrified the house.\" He was one of W. S. Gilbert's favourite actors. and, besides the aforementioned \"Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith\", he also starred in Gilbert's \"Randall's Thumb\", (1871), and played Mousta in an 1882 revival of \"Broken Hearts\" alongside Gilbert himself as Florian (due to an accident incapacitating Kyrle Bellew).\n\nA benefit matinee was held for Vezin at the Haymarket Theatre on March 19, 1896. For this, George Grossmith gave a sketch, and play scenes featured Gerald du Maurier, Herbert Beerbohm Tree and Cyril Maude, among others. Vezin continued to act, appearing in \"The Happy Life\" in 1897 and as Rowley in \"The School for Scandal\" opposite Herbert Beerbohm Tree in 1909.\n\nIn his declining years, Vezin appear infrequently on the stage, rather spending most of his time giving lessons to aspiring thespians, including the actors Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Baliol Holloway and Frank Benson as well as the actress Mary Mannering. He also dedicated himself to appearances at recitals and play readings. His last stage role was Old Rowley in Tree's production of playwright Richard Sheridan's The School for Scandal at His Majesty's Theatre in Scotland, in April 1909. He had been active on the British stage for nearly sixty years, and had been a resident of London, where he died at his home, 10 Lancaster Place, Strand, on June 12, 1910. His body was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes were scattered.\n\n"}

In an interactive novel, the reader chooses where to go next in the novel by clicking on a piece of hyperlinked text, such as a page number, a character, or a direction. While authors of traditional paper-and-ink novels have sometimes tried to give readers the random directionality offered by hypertexting, this approach was not completely feasible until the development of HTML. For a discussion of paper novels that use a branching structure, such as Choose Your Own Adventure novels, see the Wikipedia entry on gamebooks.\n\nBy following hyperlinked phrases within an interactive novel, readers can find new ways to understand characters. There is no wrong way to read a hypertext interactive novel. Links embedded within the pages are meant to be taken at a reader's discretion – to allow the reader a choice in the novel's world.\n\nA typical example of this genre is \"The Interactive Novel: Pick a character, pick a direction\", found on David Benson's \"No Dead Trees\" website. This fiction allows readers, who can also become writers, to explore the novel from a list of characters given at the site. The novel is intended to be read randomly, as the reader chooses to follow various directions.\n\nAnother example of an interactive novel would be Pottermore, which is J. K. Rowling's extended version of the series \"Harry Potter\", which can be found online. This offers the reader a different experience into the Harry Potter world and enables them to find out further information on the Harry Potter series. The reader can find different ways that they can discover different sections of the novels through browsing and collecting items, which allows the reader to go further through Pottermore.\n\nThe genre has prompted some less than respectful responses, including a comment by John Updike, who participated in an early effort at online fiction, that \"books haven't really been totally ousted yet\". Other critics, while conceding the hyped and trendy nature of the genre, have found real value in the immersive if sometimes disorienting nature of interactive fiction.\n\nThere are many interactive novels on the Web. Some of the older efforts have fallen into disuse, but the ease of creating such fiction, with the lack of the barriers to entry typical of traditional paper-and-ink publishing, helps to keep the genre alive with new works.\n\n\"Wovel\" is Underland Press's term for an online interactive \"web novel\". It is almost in the style of a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebook in which the reader chooses which way the action will continue. It is written by the author as people vote which way the action will continue. Because the author has no way of knowing how everyone will vote, they have to wait until voting is finished to continue writing the story. Despite its interactivity, because a Wovel is released piece-by-piece, it is a form of webserial. Also, each \"episode\" ends with a cliffhanger, but the choice and fate of the plot is up to the reader's vote, and not predetermined by the author. The first wovel was from Victoria Blake's Underland Press and features Kealan Patrick Burke's \"The Living\" (which is still ongoing). It started June 1, 2008 and immediately had over 1,000 readers and 700 votes in its first few days of being published online. It currently releases a new section of the story every Monday, and voting on it continues through Thursday. Burke writes the new section of story, and then the new post goes up on the following Monday.\n\n\n"}

In July 2015, she was appointed as the political editor of BBC News, the first woman to hold the position, in succession to Nick Robinson.\n\nShe is the daughter of Scottish businessman Nick Kuenssberg, OBE, and his wife Sally Kuenssberg, CBE.\n\nKuenssberg was born in Italy, while her father was working there for Coats Viyella. She grew up in Glasgow, with her brother and sister, and attended Laurel Park School, a private girls' school.\n\nKuenssberg studied history at the University of Edinburgh, followed by a journalism course at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she worked on an NBC News political programme.\n\nHer brother David is executive director of finance and resources at Brighton and Hove City Council. Her sister Joanna is a diplomat and was appointed as the British High Commissioner to Mozambique in 2014.\n\nAfter returning to Britain, she worked for local radio and then cable television in Glasgow, before joining BBC North East and Cumbria in March 2000. Kuenssberg won a regional Royal Television Society award for her work as home affairs correspondent, and produced segments for the social affairs editor Niall Dickson. \n\nAppointed chief political correspondent for BBC News, Kuenssberg reported for BBC One bulletins, \"Daily Politics\" and BBC News. In May 2010, her presence was so ubiquitous in the period between the general election and the formation of a coalition government under David Cameron, that journalist David Aaronovitch coined the term \"Kuenssbergovision\".\n\nIn September 2011, Kuenssberg took up the newly created role of business editor for ITV News, and was replaced at BBC News by Norman Smith from BBC Radio 4. She also contributed towards business reporting on ITV's current affairs strand, \"Tonight\". On 27 August 2013, she made her debut co-newscasting \"News at Ten\" with Alastair Stewart.\n\nOn 12 November 2013, it was announced that she would leave ITV to return to the BBC, as chief correspondent and a presenter of \"Newsnight\", replacing Gavin Esler in the latter role. She joined the \"Newsnight\" team in February 2014.\n\nIn July 2015, she was appointed as the BBC's political editor, the first woman to hold the position.\n\nIn January 2016, Kuenssberg was involved in arranging for the Labour MP Stephen Doughty to publicly announce his resignation as a shadow foreign office minister on \"Daily Politics\". The incident was the subject of an official complaint from Seumas Milne, the Labour Party's director of communications, which was rejected by Robbie Gibb, then the BBC's head of live political programmes.\n\nDuring a joint press conference with Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump, Kuenssberg recalled a number of controversial statements Trump made on the campaign trail, and asked Trump if he had anything to say to UK viewers \"worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?\" Trump jokingly responded, \"That's your choice of a question? There goes that relationship.\" \n\nIn Kuenssberg's opinion, there are questions about the government's approach to Brexit. She wrote in March 2017 of Theresa May government's negotiations with the European Union: \"There are no guarantees that the prime minister's aims are the right ones for the country. Still less certainty that they can be achieved\".\n\nFollowing the 2016 local elections, a petition was started on 38 Degrees which accused Kuenssberg of being biased against the Labour Party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn, and called for her dismissal. The petition was later withdrawn by David Babbs, executive director of 38 Degrees, who cited concern that it had become a \"focal point for sexist and hateful abuse made towards Laura Kuenssberg\" on other social media websites such as Twitter although it was acknowledged that this represented \"the actions of a small minority\".\n\nIn January 2017 the BBC Trust ruled that a report in November 2015 by Kuenssberg broke the broadcaster's impartiality and accuracy guidelines. A viewer had complained about her item, which featured an interview with Jeremy Corbyn on the \"BBC News at Six\" which was edited to give the incorrect impression that Corbyn disagreed with the use of firearms by police in incidents such as that month's terrorist attacks in Paris. His purported answer to a question as broadcast in the report was in fact his reply to a more general (unbroadcast) question, not specifically about that terrorist attack. The BBC Trust said that the inaccuracy was \"compounded\" when Kuenssberg went on to state that Corbyn's message \"couldn't be more different\" from that of the prime minister Theresa May, who was about to publish anti-terrorism proposals. The trust said that accuracy was particularly important when dealing \"with a critical question at a time of extreme national concern\".\n\nCharles Moore in \"The Spectator\" wrote in July 2017 of being told \"informally\" that Kuenssberg had received protection from a bodyguard during the 2017 general election. The BBC had believed her safety was under threat because of online abuse considered to be mainly from supporters of Jeremy Corbyn. The BBC refused to comment about the story. The Labour politician Yvette Cooper defended the BBC's political editor: \"It’s her job to ask difficult questions.

Journalist Jenni Russell, a former BBC editor herself, was quoted in \"The New York Times\" about the issue affecting Kuenssberg: “The graphic level of threats to women is quite extraordinary and it’s one of the worst things to have happened in recent British public life.” The bodyguard also accompanied her to the Conservative Party conference in Manchester in October 2017.\n\nKuenssberg said at the beginning of November 2017 at a gathering in London that the trolls were attempting to silence her.\n\nIn November 2016, Kuenssberg was awarded Broadcaster of the Year by the Political Studies Association. The prize was in recognition of her contribution to the public understanding of politics, especially surrounding the June 2016 EU Referendum and subsequent developments.\n\nAt the British Journalism Awards organised by \"Press Gazette\" in December 2016, Kuenssberg received the Journalist of the Year award. \"Kuenssberg deserves this prize for the sheer volume and scope of reporting on some of the biggest changes ever in British politics\" said the judges, pointing especially to her coverage of the EU membership referendum and its aftermath.\n\nKuenssberg is married to James Kelly, a management consultant who studied in Edinburgh and at Harvard. They live in east London.\n\n"}

Other prominent members included Ding Ling, Hu Feng, and Mei Zhi. The purpose of the League was to promote socialist realism in support of the Communist Revolution, and it eventually became very influential in Chinese cultural circles. Lu Xun delivered the opening address to the organizational meeting, but he became disillusioned when it quickly became clear that he would have little influence. Other members included leaders of the Sun Society and the Creation Society, and Zhou Yang, who became Mao Zedong's favorite literary figure and after 1949 zealously enforced political orthodoxy. The League articulated theories on the political role of literature that foreshadowed Mao's influential Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art, and engaged in running debates with the \"art for art's sake\" Crescent Moon Society.\n\nDue to the League's prominent political views, it was quickly banned by the Kuomintang government. On 7 February 1931, the government executed five members of the League: Li Weisen, Hu Yepin, Rou Shi, Yin Fu, and Feng Keng. They are known as the Five Martyrs of the League of Left-Wing Writers.\n\nThe League was disbanded voluntarily in 1936. This was mainly in order to encourage authors to unite across political boundaries and face the rapidly increasing threat from Japan.\n\n"}

Some of the actors who have appeared in more than one film are listed in the table included in this section. The individual films may be consulted for the precise casting details in specific films.\n\n\n\"Lolita\" has a scene lasting six minutes in which Quilty disguises himself as a German-accented high school psychologist named Dr. Zempf who persuades Humbert to allow Lolita more personal freedom so that she can act in the high school play (which is written by Quilty and produced with some supervision from him). This is modified from a scene in the novel in which there is a similar conversation with a genuine female school psychologist. The film version of this scene was sufficiently memorable that Edward Albee incorporated it into his stage adaptation of \"Lolita\".\n\nNumerous observers have seen similarities between Peter Sellers' performance of Quilty-as-Zempf and his subsequent role in Stanley Kubrick's next film as Doctor Strangelove. Stanley Kubrick himself in an interview with Michel Ciment described both characters as \"parodies of movie clichés of Nazis\". Commenting elsewhere on the characters, Ciment writes \"Peter Sellers prefigured his creation of Dr Strangelove, particularly in the role of Dr Zempf, the school psychologist whose thick German accent recalls that of the mad professor (note Kubrick's ambiguous feelings towards Germany, his admiration for its culture... his fear of its demonstrations of power...)\". Thomas Allen Nelson has said that in this part of his performance, \"Sellers twists his conception of Quilty toward that neo-Nazi monster, who will roll out of the cavernous shadows of Dr. Strangelove\", later noting that Zempf \"exaggerates Humbert's European pomposity through his psychobabble and German anality.\" The Kubrick interview has been commented by Geoffrey Cocks, author of a controversial book on the impact of the Holocaust on Kubrick's overall work, who notes that \"Dr. Strangelove himself... is the mechanical chimera of modern horror.\"\n\nOther observers of this similarity include Internet film critic Tim Dirks who has also noted that Sellers's smooth German-like accent and the chair-bound pose in this scene are similar to that of Dr. Strangelove. Finally, Barbara Wyllie, writing in Julian Connelly's anthology \"The Cambridge Companion to Nabokov\", speaks of \"Quilty's visit to the house in Beardsley, masquerading as Dr. Zempf, a German psychologist (a Sellers character that prefigures Dr. Strangelove in Kubrick's film of 1964).\"\n\nEd Bishop had his first film role in \"Lolita\", an uncredited appearance as the ambulance attendant who tells Humbert that Charlotte is dead. Bishop also played the shuttle pilot in \"\", making him one of the few actors to appear in two Kubrick films.\n"}

The standard-bearer holds an aquila standard, where the eagle grasps a thunderbolt in its talons. The soldiers have been identified as Praetorians due to the richness of the apparel, particularly the helmets, the ceremonial dress and oval shields. The figures are wearing calcei and not caligae, worn by ordinary soldiers. However, according to Boris Rankov, \"the Attic-style helmets are almost certainly an artistic convention\". Rankov suggests that \"early in their history the Praetorians were still using the Montefortino-style helmet normal in the legions of the Republic and early Empire\".\n\nThe relief was previously dated to the early 2nd century AD. The lower half of the left-hand figure, portions of the middle two and the heads of all three foreground figures are modern restorations. In 2006 the relief underwent restoration by N. Imbert and A. Méthivier.\n\nThe Praetorians Relief was once part of the Arch of Claudius, erected in 51 to commemorate the conquest of Britain. The relief is mentioned already in the 16th century. The head of the standard-bearer is depicted in \"Album\" by Pierre Jacques de Reims, on the page dated to 1577.

{"id": "9363085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9363085", "title": "Sydney rock engravings", "text": "Sydney rock engravings\n\nSydney rock engravings, or Sydney rock art, are a form of Australian Aboriginal rock art in the sandstone around Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, that consist of carefully drawn images of people, animals, or symbols. Many thousands of such engravings are known to exist in the Sydney region, although the locations of most are not publicised to prevent damage by vandalism, and to retain their sanctity, as they are still regarded as sacred sites by Indigenous Australians. There are two art environments in Sydney Basin, rock shelters and engraving sites. \n\nThere are 1,500 pieces of Aboriginal art in Sydney, more than half of which contain rock art, and around 1,500 caves or shelters which contain cultural deposit. They are comparable with the petroglyphs of Native Americans and the rock art found elsewhere in Australia, but have their own distinctive style which is quite unlike rock art found anywhere else in Australia. Dating to around 5,000 years, with some possibly as old as 7,000 years, Sydney rock art is predominantly found in Ku-ring-gai Council, Sydney Harbour and the Blue Mountains.\n\nThe engravings were made by the Aboriginal Australians who have lived in the Sydney region from about 30,000 years ago until the present day. Radiocarbon dating suggests human activity first started to occur in the Sydney area from around 30,735 years ago. However, numerous Aboriginal stone tools were found in Western Sydney's gravel sediments that were dated from 45,000 to 50,000 years BP, which would indicate that there was human settlement in Sydney earlier than thought.\n\nThe engravings cannot be dated straightforwardly with contemporary archaeological methods, necessitating the use of indirect dating. The Sydney engravings are of a style known as \"simple figurative\", which formulaic archaeology dates to around 3,000 BC and 4,000 BC, which is contemporaneous to the neolithic period in Eurasia. Other engravings show European sailing ships, and so those cannot be more than about 200 years old. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that the engravings were sometimes \"re-grooved\" during ceremonies.\n\nSome engravings appear to show thylacines and other mammals which have been extinct in the Sydney region for many thousands of years, and thus can be presumably that old. In support of this, it is true that rock art elsewhere (e.g. Kakadu National Park) does show extinct animals, and so must be tens of thousands of years old. However, at the moment there is no hard evidence to support these claims for Sydney rock art.\n\nExamination of the grooves shows that they were made in several stages as follows:\n\n\nThis results in a U-shaped groove which is typically about 2 centimetres deep and 2 centimetres wide. It is easily distinguished from natural grooves in the sandstone, which are usually V-shaped, modern grooves made with steel tools, which are usually narrower and deeper, or those made by bulldozers, which usually have a square section.\n\nThe grooves were often maintained by \"re-grooving\" during ceremonies, which complicates attempts at dating them.\n\nWhile their purpose is not known definitively, some educated guesses may be made by analogy with the culture of other indigenous groups who survived into modern times, as follows. Some sites may have been \"increase sites\", where a ceremony would be held to increase the availability of a food source such as kangaroos or fish. It is thought that most of the sites depicting animals are of this type.\n\nAnother group of sites may have been where initiation ceremonies were held, to celebrate and facilitate the transition of a young boy into manhood. In other parts of Australia, we know that an initiation ceremony often involves a ceremonial path from childhood into manhood, and so the lines of steps, or mundoes, may indicate initiation sites. Other sites show \"Culture Heroes\" or \"Ancestral Beings\" such as Baiame, who has a striped head-dress and often a striped body, and Daramulan who has a large club foot and may have been part-emu.\n\nSome sites also show evidence of Aboriginal Astronomy, as the rock's patterns resemble the Milky Way and this may have been purposed as an astrological guide. It should also be recognised that increase sites, initiation sites, culture-hero sites, and astronomical sites are not necessarily distinct, and one site may fall into any or all of these categories.\n\nThe aboriginal rock engraving sites usually contain images of sacred spiritual beings, mythical ancestral hero figures, various endemic animals, fish and many footprints. Surrounding the rock engravings, there are art sites, burial sites, caves, marriage areas, men’s areas, women’s areas, birthing areas, midden sites, stone arrangement sites and tool manufacturing locations. \n\nLes McLeod, a local indigenous guide in Hawkesbury stated, “A lot of Aboriginal people believe they were created from animals – there are engravings here of wallabies, fish and emus”. “Sydney sandstone is easy to engrave but easy to fade. The Guringai people would have visited a couple of times a year to re-engrave it.” In some small cave on the water’s edge, there are ochre hand stencils from a group of Guringai men (and from a smaller handprint, a minor). The stencils would have been a way of letting other members of the clan know that this cave or ledge is a safe place to dwell in. Rock paintings of a fish just above the water line signaled to others that fish could be found at this area. The majority (97%) of the etched motifs are\noutline only. The only systematically infilled engravings are culture heroes which are usually decorated with a number of pecked lines of dots.\n\nShelters with art are characterised by stencil art or charcoal. Stencil is created by mixing ochre in the mouth and then into a wet paste, where it is sprayed over the object to be stencilled onto the wall of the shelter. Other forms of artwork include ochre paintings, charcoal drawings and etchings. Rock painting illustration usually feature humans, kangaroos, emus, echidnas, grid patterns, animal tracks, boomerangs, axes, hand stencils, among others. Black is the frequent colour used in Sydney, accounting for 46.2% of the pigment art. Followed by white (34.6%), red (16.6%) and yellow (2.8%). There are also a number of grinding grooves located throughout the general Sydney area. Burial sites are present throughout the Sydney region, and many have been found over the past years in middens and within shelters. \n\nRock engravings in Sydney would usually feature fish, animals, humans, wooden artefacts, and mythological beings. Stone quarries are sites where Aboriginals accumulate types of stone for the manufacturing of tools, ceremonial and sacred items. The majority of the fine stone flakes and tools recovered in the local area would have been traded from other areas such as the north coast, Hunter Valley, and the Nepean River. Dug wells in the Sydney region were used by the local tribe to sharpen tools and also as a source of fresh drinking water.\n\nA total of 7,804 motifs were studied from the 717 engravings sites, with a salient focus on tracks, followed by a predilection for marine animals and land animals, anthropomorphic\nmodels and cultural items.\n\nThere are approximately 2,000 rock engraving sites, which are usually located on highly elevated, smooth and flat surfaces. More than half of the engraving sites (55.9%) are located on ridgelines. Hillside locations are the next most frequent (41.2%), while valley bottoms are comparatively rare (2.8%). The average distance to drinking water from any engraving site in the region is 650m and the maximum distance is approximately 3km. The minimum distance is 2m (rock wells or creeks). Rock art within Sydney is found in these locations:\n\n\n\n"}

In it he sought to revive the military ethos of the Roman empire. \n\nThe event took place on December 5, 1804, three days after his coronation. Napoleon distributed \"eagles\" based on the Roman aquila of the legions of Rome. The standards represented the regiments raised by the various Departments of France, and were intended to institute feelings of pride and loyalty among the troops who would be the backbone of Napoleon's new regime. Napoleon gave an emotional speech in which he insisted that troops should defend the standards with their lives. In early sketches of the painting David included a winged figure of Nike, the goddess of victory, floating over the troops, but Napoleon objected to such an unrealistic feature. He also insisted that his wife Josephine be removed from the composition. He was preparing to divorce her, since she had failed to produce his heir.\n\nThe final painting depicted the moment when Napoleon blessed the standards being held out towards him. Napoleon has his arm raised in imitation of ancient \"adlocutio\" scenes, which depict Classical heroes addressing troops. David's composition was heavily influenced by the friezes on Trajan's column.\n"}
{"id": "9240590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9240590", "title": "The Naked Brothers Band (TV series)", "text": "The Naked Brothers Band (TV series)\n\nThe Naked Brothers Band is an American musical comedy television series created by Polly Draper for Nickelodeon. It depicts the daily lives of Draper's sons, who lead a fictional world-renowned rock band in New York City. As a mockumentary, the storyline is an embellishment of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. The show stars Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, the lead singer-songwriter, and drummer, respectively. Nat's fictional female admirer and real life friends—including the guitarist who had no prior acquaintance with the family—feature as the other band members, with the siblings' father and Draper's husband as their inept accordion-playing dad, and Draper's niece as the group's babysitter.\n\nThe series is a spinoff of Draper's that was picked up by the network, premiering in January 2007. Draper, star of \"Thirtysomething\" and her screenwriting debut \"The Tic Code\", is the executive producer of the series, and often writer and director. Albie Hecht, former Nickelodeon chief and creator of the Spike TV network, is the executive producer, under his Worldwide Biggies tag. Draper's jazz musician husband Michael Wolff, known for leading the band on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", serves as the music supervisor and co-executive producer, with Draper's brother, Tim, as the consulting producer.\n\nThe show first aired two episodes in the United States on February 3, 2007 to an audience of roughly 3.7 million viewers. Viacom announced, it \"delivered Nickelodeon's highest-rated premiere in seven years\" and instantly became one of the most favorable for children aged 6–11. According to \"New York Times\" reporter Jacques Steinberg, the series' popularity is equivalent to \"Hannah Montana\" and \"Cory in the House\". Three seasons aired and it concluded abruptly on June 13, 2009 due to the network placing high demands on the family that would disrupt the siblings' schooling. The series earned 1 Broadcast Music, Inc. Cable Award; 2 Writers Guild Award nominations, winning one WGA; 3 Young Artist Award nominations; and was nominated for 1 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award (both in the United States and United Kingdom).\n\nThe series' title derived from an incident when the brothers were very young: they arose from the bathtub shouting, \"We're the naked brothers band!\" Although Nat revised the band's title to The Silver Boulders in preschool, Polly Draper revived it as she felt it would be more suitable for the show.\n\nMost of Nat's music, which he has been composing at the piano from the time he was 5, emboldens the scripts Draper writes for many of the episodes. She also acknowledges how the show is more \"like an adult comedy [than]...a typical kids show\" in terms of not using a laugh track.\nDraper explains the events that precede the show: \"Nat kept putting signs on his door: I want to be a child actor! I said, 'No, it's too brutal.\" She later says, in early 2007, \"Nat decided he wanted to film his own sitcom, so we did a film called \"Don’t Eat Off My Plate\"...I pretended to interview his friends and do a documentary.\" Following the home video, Draper had the idea of making a mockumentary film about the band; she decided to introduce them as music icons like The Beatles. Filmed in mid-2004, the movie was originally independent, and Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, oversaw the budget. In addition, Draper and Wolff's famous celebrity friends—such as Uma Thurman, Julianne Moore, Cyndi Lauper, Tony Shalhoub, Arsenio Hall, and the ensemble cast from the ABC television drama \"Thirtysomething\" (the latter of which included Draper herself)—are featured making cameo appearances.\n\nIn late 2005, Draper and Wolff entered the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival, where it won the audience award for a family feature film. Albie Hecht was visible in the audience; he bought the film for the network. Nickelodeon urged the family to start a television series based on the film, and a reluctant Draper agreed. Draper recalls, \"When Nickelodeon first asked us about doing a series, we said, 'How about a cartoon, so the kids could stay normal?' They said, 'No, we love your kids.\n\nDraper mentions in early 2008 during a family interview at the Times Center Stage that, prior to the series' broadcast, she advised the other cast members to not look themselves up online. Draper told them that they should not become preoccupied by the comments written by either the press or their viewers. In addition to prohibiting their boys from searching their names online, Draper and Wolff forbid them from auditioning, and the boys were not allowed to tour until shortly after the premiere of the third season. They are also enrolled in private school in New York City to keep them exposed to the real world.\n\nThe series is produced by Kidzhouse Entertainment and Worldwide Biggies, in association with Nickelodeon Television. Principal photography takes place at the former stage one division of Broadway Stages in Brooklyn, New York over the summer and early fall, so the boys are able to attend private school throughout most of the year. The enormous studio is large enough that cast members play basketball with friends in a separate room when they are finished filming episodes. Moreover, during a family interview at the Times Center Stage in January 2008, Nat mentions that the family's authentic home is not as multi-colored as in the show.\n\nBeing the showrunner—or leading executive producer, Polly Draper led the writers room and employed the cast and crew. She also served as head writer (another task of the executive producer) by writing most prolifically, editing scripts, and conveying storyline ideas for each episode. In addition to Draper, the other writers for the series were Magda Liolis, and Michael Rubiner and Bob Mittenthal. During the first season, Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi also penned the script for the two-part episode, TV movie special \"Battle of the Bands\", and by the third season, Mittenthal emerged as a senior writer, earning the title of co-executive producer.\n\nDraper and Melanie Mayron, who co-starred together in \"Thirtysomething\", were the only directors for the first season. During the second season, Jonathan Judge was added on as a third director. The last episode Mayron directed for that season, and thus the series, featured her as a fan on the radio (by providing the voice over). By the third season, Draper and Judge directed every other TV movie, with Mark Salisbury directing the initial animated episode and Rosario Roveto, Jr. directing the concluding episode.\n\nDraper managed to also keep an eye on her two boys. For example, the cast was filming an episode that featured the band recording a video; Nat, who did not want to make out in the scene due to his crush Rosalina watching, mistakenly smooches her. He then confesses to his mother that he was puzzled as to what the instructions were. The scene being filmed was that of the first season's ninth episode \"\", which was directed by Melanie Mayron. In another instance, during production for the fourth episode of the second season, as the boys play restlessly on a purple sofa, their mother (who was not directing the episode) admonishes them over the loudspeaker by saying, \"Both of you, try to smile more.\" Occasionally, family disputes occur on set; for example, in July 2008—after filming for a long period of time on the set—when Draper gives one of the boys' an instruction, one of them replies, \"I know, Mom!\"\n\nAccording to \"New York Times\" author Felicia R. Lee, the siblings act \"chatty, guileless, fun-loving,\" much as they do in their genuine lives. She also notes that, of the show's characters, \"no one over 18 has much sense.\" Draper's role as creator—the developer of the original characters—allowed her to contemplate her boys' fictional birth mother as deceased; her name is never revealed. However, in the show, the boys' father is infatuated with an estranged lady named Betty. Moreover, although portraying fictional characters, the ensemble cast—including Qaasim Middleton, as well as real life friends David Levi, Thomas Batuello, and Cooper Pillot—keep their full names on-screen. Nonetheless, Allie DiMeco plays Rosalina; the siblings' cousin Jesse Draper portrays the group's puzzled nanny named Jesse Cook; and the boys' father Michael Wolff plays the siblings' father, Sonny, the latter whom Draper notes she wrote similar to that of a child.\n\nThe Timmerman Brothers—a band no longer famous—consists of three siblings, who in real life are Polly's nephews, Nat and Alex's cousins, and thus Jesse's brothers and cousin. In addition, Jesse's real life father, Polly's brother, and thus Nat and Alex's uncle reoccurs as the school principal. Jesse's sister and cousin have been added as recurring stars during the second season. They play Jesse's sisters named Tessy and Bessy who appear as the dancing girls in Alex's new music video. In addition, Qaasim's real life mother, the actress and singer-songwriter Toni Seawright, as well as his younger brother Kahlil (also an actor and musician) appear as themselves during the second season, while Seawright reprises her role in the third season. Thomas' real life younger brother, John, also reoccurs as himself during the second season.\n\nDuring a family interview in January 2008 by \"New York Times\" reporter Jacques Steinberg, Nat notes the French bulldog E.T., who plays David Levi's dog in the show, belongs to the Draper-Wolff family in real life.\n\nCraig Cobb is the picture editor for the series; he was also the assistant editor for \"Sex and the City\".\nCobb worked with Louis Bertini, the supervising sound editor of the series, who had been the editor for \"Sex and The City\". Of the editing process, Bertini explains that editing the show was not much different from editing \"Sex and the City\"; they brought a similar \"approach and constriction to the audio elements\", although unlike \"Sex in the City\", the show had a \"larger cartoon element\". However, Cobb considered the editing to be a challenge because he felt that a certain degree of unscripted \"magic on set\" existed that required more work. Because most of the children on the series are not actors—in addition to the music that was to be added—the editing process created a situation that was somewhat \"messy\". Nonetheless, Cobb believed the combination of factors created a \"magic\" of its own \"and it's what makes this show really shine\".\n\nWhen an episode completed filming, Cobb edited on the Final Cut Pro application, which normally took four days to complete. Bertini—who spent the same amount of time editing—then converted unnecessary script and added sound effects. Cobb says, \"The SD workflow was the plan for the 2008 season, but that has changed. We're working in SD with the ProRes 422 codec, so we're cutting in a broadcast-quality format that we'll later output without having to recapture all the footage.\"\n\nAccording to Cobb, it is very difficult to coordinate the television's screen-framing:\n\nWhen reporters from the \"Associated Press\" compared the show to the Disney Channel musical comedy series \"Hannah Montana\", Michael Wolff remarked, \"The boys are natural musicians who just happen to be on TV.\" Tom Asheim, the executive vice president and general manager for Nickelodeon, also said, \"This is our version of \"The Monkees\". Nat Wolff wrote all the music, which I think distinguishes the show. Sometimes I think you get a sense from bands that they are [faking it] like Milli Vanilli. This really is by kids and for kids.\"\nNat and Alex sing, compose, and perform all of the show's songs; their father also supervises the music and produces it with Michael A. Levine. The series' music editor, John Davis coordinates the songs' musical numbers, and Amy Cervini and Russ Spiegel are the music instructors.\nOn October 9, 2007, the debut of the first season's self-titled soundtrack album released into stores. It was produced by Wolff and Levine and distributed by Nick Records and Columbia Records. All of the music on the album includes tracks composed by Nat, apart from \"Alien Clones\" and \"I Could Be\", which were composed by Alex. The day before, on October 8, the band had an autograph signing for 1,500 fans at Virgin Megastore in Times Square, New York City; they also performed their original song \"I'm Out\" to a live audience on \"Good Morning America\". Additionally, the group's first MTV music video released for their song \"If That's Not Love\".\n\nOn March 18, 2008, the single \"I Don't Want to Go to School\" was sold to Walmarts across the country. A month later, on April 15, the second season soundtrack album, \"I Don't Want to Go to School\" debuted into stores. Tracks from the album include songs all written by Nat, including \"I Don't Want to Go to School\", with the exception of \"Why\" and \"Three is Enough\" which Alex composed. Other songs on the album include bonus tracks such as \"Tall Girls, Short Girls...You\", by Nat and \"Changing\" by Alex. The producers of the album were also Wolff and Levine and was distributed by Nick Music and Columbia Records. To praise the release of their new album, they performed their song, \"I Don't Want to Go to School\" live on the NBC morning show \"Today\".\n\nTheir unreleased soundtrack, titled \"Throwbacks\", for the third season was made available free of a charge on their website as an online download in October 2013. The album artist is Nat and Alex Wolff, and it took four years to develop due to the unannounced cancellation of the series in June 2009.\n\nThe pilot episode was originally an independent film shot in mid-2004 depicting Nat and Alex Wolff when they were nine and six years old respectively and premiered as a TV movie special on January 27, 2007. They film a documentary about their world-renowned band, The Silver Boulders, as they fracture due to Nat's song about a girl named Rosalina. At the end, the band reunites as The Naked Brothers Band.\n\nFamous celebrities either acknowledge they are huge fans of the band or have appeared with other supporting roles; in real life, they have either worked or are friends with the Draper-Wolff family. In addition to the noted Thurman, Moore, Lauper, Shalhoub, Hall, and the ensemble cast of \"Thirtysomething\" (the latter including the boys' mother) making cameo appearances, the other special guests were Ricki Lake, Ann Curry, jazz singer Nancy Wilson, Cindy Blackman, David Thornton, Gretchen Egolf, James Badge Dale, Barbara eda-Young, and Brent Popolizio.\n\nSeason one debuted in February 2007 and concluded in June; however, one additional episode and television movie aired in October 2007. The first season aired 13 episodes, including a two-part episode and TV movie special titled \"Battle of the Bands\" airing on October 6, 2007.\n\nThe first season features Nat and his younger brother Alex, who are 11 and 8 years old respectively. David, Thomas, and Cooper are also 11. Qaasim is 10 and Rosalina is 14 respectively. Daniel Raymont plays the role of the music video director, and Tuffy Questall portrays Tuffy, the driver of the band's psychedelic bus. The first season also has guest appearances by radio host Matt Pinfield, rap artist Snoop Dogg, comedian George Lopez, and actor and musician Keli Price.\n\nThe first season's premise is that the group is recording their first studio album as well as starring in several music videos to promote it. In the first episode \"VMAs\", Alex is horrified by his horoscope Jesse reads to him, and the band's music video for their song \"Banana Smoothie\" wins an MTV Video Music Award at the end. In later episodes, Nat's initial attempts at stand up comedy fails before receiving advise from George Lopez. Throughout the season, Nat does not like when David and Thomas ridicule his affection for Rosalina. Although neither admits their feelings for each other, it becomes quite obvious that Nat and Rosalina do. As time goes on, Rosalina kisses Nat on the lips in his dressing room.\n\nMoreover, Alex becomes mad and runs away when Jesse dates The Timmerman Brothers. Along the way, Alex becomes friends with an orphan named Juanita at a skatepark. When the boys' father arrives back from his overnight vacation, he starts dating an estranged lady named Betty, who Cooper and Jesse initially hired to clean the mess in the Wolff family's apartment without much success. In addition to a \"Battle of The Bands\" between The Naked Brothers Band and The LA Surfers (the latter featuring lead singer Bobby Love, a manipulative con artist who tries to steal Nat's girl friend), the season ends with Nat and his band performing at a charity event they put together for Juanita and her foster family.\n\nThe second season aired 13 episodes and 2 TV specials, ending on June 6, 2008 with a three-part episode, TV movie special.\n\nIn the second season, Nat is 12 and Alex is 9. Rosalina is 15, Qaasim is 11 And Thomas, David, and Cooper are 12. Guest stars for the season include syndicated cartoonist Jules Feiffer, musician Joel Madden, skateboarder Tony Hawk, George Lopez, Matt Pinfield, and musician Phil Collins. During the first half of the season, Daniel Raymont portrays Wing with Teala Dunn and Emily Richardson returning as Juanita and Patty Scoggins, respectively. When the band goes on tour, the tour driver Tuffy (Tuffy Questall) takes on more of a lead recurring role.\n\nThe second season begins with a school masquerade party and prom. In later episodes, Nat, Alex, and Cooper have dates at a local movie theater; during a live talk show, the siblings, alongside Joel Madden and a girl, who is a quite critical news reporter, compose a song together at the piano; and Mr. Wolff's girl friend neglects him after meeting his twin brother who is a successful jazz pianist. In addition, the band starts prepping for their tour with several band rehearsals. Prior to leaving on their tour bus, the band members are conflicted with personal issues. Mr. Wolff is still coping from his break up with Betty, David is upset about leaving his dog, E.T. behind, and Rosalina is worried about the possibility of not saying \"good bye\" to her father. Nonetheless, all of their concerns work themselves out: George Lopez advises Mr. Wolff to continue his passion for playing the accordion despite his break up, Tuffy ends up allowing David to bring his dog, and Rosalina's father makes it to the stop before the bus leaves.\n\nFollowing several concert performances (including one at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, as well as a state county fair), the TV movie special \"Polar Bears\" depicts the ending of the band's tour in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they—along with their babysitter, Jesse—reunite with the siblings' father and the Wolff family's dear friends who are victims of Hurricane Katrina. On the ride down there, Jesse accidentally has Alex watch \"An Inconvenient Truth\" and, after viewing it, he becomes very concerned about the polar bears potentially becoming extinct due to global warming. During their visit, Mr. Wolff's friend's older daughter, as well as Nat, Qaasim, and Rosalina encounter misinterpretations over their romantic interests, and the band ends up donating the money raised from their performance at an elaborate-styled ballroom to a charity supporting climate change.\n\nThe third season began with the television movie \"Mystery Girl\", which premiered on October 18, 2008. It also aired three other TV movies, one animated TV special, one special webisode, and three other episodes, concluding with \"No School's Fools Day\" on June 13, 2009.\n\nIn this season, Nat, Thomas, David, and Cooper are 13 with Qaasim being 12, while Alex is 10 and Rosalina is 16. The season features an array of celebrities making cameo appearances, including actresses Miranda Cosgrove and Whoopi Goldberg, singer Natasha Bedingfield, and musicians David Desrosiers and Simon Kirke. Other celebrity appearances include musicians Tobin Esperance and Questlove, actor and musician Leon Thomas, actress Victoria Justice, and talk show host Dave Attell. Daniel Raymont, Tuffy Questall, Teala Dunn, Catherine Curtin, and Matt Pinfield all return with Andrew Keenan-Bolger portraying Christophe, the director of the new \"Magical Mystery Girl Movie\".\n\nThe new season depicts the band shooting their initial theatrical film called the \"Magical Mystery Girl Movie\". Nat stars as Daniel, Rosalina as herself, Miranda Cosgrove as Daniel's girl friend, Alex as Oliver, Juanita as the girl in Oliver's new music video, with Mr. Wolff and Jesse playing themselves and Principle Schmoke and Tuffy portraying sumo wrestlers in diapers. Christophe is the stubborn director; he is later overthrown and replaced by Cooper, the producer of the movie. Christophe appears again in \"The Premiere\", who pilfers the movie's metal film cassette.\n\nOn the other hand, Rosalina temporarily leaves the band to travel on a worldwide cruise. During her trip, the band members read the newspaper and the front cover depicts Rosalina kissing a French man. When Rosalina returns to visit, she and Nat have an internal dispute and Rosalina subsequently quits the band. Because of this, the group must find a new bass player. Cooper calls for a \"Naked Idol\" contest and the outfit selects Kristina Reyes as their new bassist. However, Nat later makes up with Rosalina and she rejoins the band while retaining Kristina as well. \"The Premiere\" TV movie ends with them watching the \"Magical Mystery Girl Movie\" in the theaters as well as the band performing Nat's new song \"Just a Girl I Know\".\n\n\n(In order of appearance):\n\nThe series featured by many celebrities making cameo appearances, most of whom played themselves.\n\n\nIn 2005, \"The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie\" won the audience award for a family feature film at the Hamptons International Film Festival. Of Hecht's attendance, he said, \"I could see there was an audience for this. They're real kids, real brothers, making real music.\"\n\nDraper received a Writers Guild Award nomination for the episode \"Nat is a Stand-Up Guy\" in the section of Children's Episodic and Specials in 2008. The following year, in 2009, the TV movie \"Polar Bears\" won Draper a WGA for Children's Script — Long Form or Special; it was the only one nominated in the category. In 2007, Nat was nominated for Best TV Actor at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in the United Kingdom. Moreover, the adult Wolff and his sons received a Broadcast Music, Inc. Cable Award for their work on the show's music. In 2008, the series' cast performed at the KCAs in United States; the following year, Nat was nominated for Favorite TV Actor.\n\nAlbie Hecht foreshadowed the success of the series after watching the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival. In an article, Hecht told \"New York Times\" reporter Felicia R. Lee: \"They're just real: real brothers, real friends; it's all the stuff kids do when they're hanging out on the playground. The idea that you're watching a documentary is so much fun. Then you put them into that fantasy of being a world-famous rock band, and that's the sauce that makes it work.\" Lee also called both the film and television series, \"an ebullient mock documentary.\"\n\nIn October 2006, online videos from their Nickelodeon website had been played over 11 million times. Moreover, before the show's debut, \"a fan recognized Nat and Alex in a Florida hotel. She sent them a note: 'Are you the Naked Brothers?' 'They were so excited,' Draper recalled. 'The show hasn't even aired yet and now walking down the streets kids are calling out their names. They can't believe it.' \"\n\nWhen the film premiered on the network, it was seen by an average of 2.7 million viewers, and placed the top 10 spot on the \"Nielsen VideoScan\" children's non-theatrical DVD charts. The movie was also broadcast four times, producing a total viewership of 14 million. The band's hit song \"Crazy Car\" sold more than 100,000 downloads online; it was placed on the top 100 \"Billboard Charts\" for seven weeks and the track was featured on the \"Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice, Vol 3\".\n\nAccording to a 2007 PRNewswire article, the show \"quickly became one of the top programs for tweens on television.\" The series is in a popular category of children's TV shows, along with Disney Channel's \"Hannah Montana\" and \"Cory in the House\". By October 2007, Nick.com's message boards had 5.3 million pages viewed, causing online madness. The show has three video games online that have been played about 24 million times. Moreover, fans have downloaded over 800 thousand podcasts.\n\nThe premiere of the series acquired the channel as favorable for children aged 6–11; \"Nielsen Media Research\" calculates—of in that age range—approximately 1.3 million people have watched the first 10 episodes of the series. For all ages, most of the first season attracted approximately 2.8 million viewers per week. It was one of the quickest starts in about three decades for the network. The evening the show debuted on the channel aired two episodes, averaging out to a total viewership of 3.7 million. The first one, \"VMA's\", drew exactly 3.5 million viewers. The next airing was \"Wolff Brother's Cry Wolff\" which garnered a sum of 3.8 million viewers; the episode gave the channel its most favorable ratings in seven years. From February 12 to 18 in 2007, repeats for the series garnered 4 million viewers; it was the sixth most watched program for the week.\n\nFor all ages, the premiere of the season one TV movie \"Battle of the Bands\" was quite successful, garnering a viewership of exactly 3.8 million. The second season TV movie \"Sidekicks\" debuted to a total of 3.6 million viewers, with the season's finale TV movie \"Polar Bears\" drawing 1.7 million viewers for children aged 6–11; the latter was the second most watched show for the week in that age group. The series flourished the most with the airing of the season three TV movie \"Mystery Girl\", producing a viewership of 4 million. A month later, the TV movie \"Operation Mojo\" was broadcast to an audience of 2.8 million viewers. When the season three TV special \"Valentine Dream Date\" aired, it was also successful; exactly 3.2 million viewers watched it.\n\nThe executive vice president of development and original programming for Nickelodeon, Marjorie Cohn explains: \"The premiere of \"The Naked Brothers Band\" series has exploded and continues to grow in popularity as a multiplatform and international property for Nickelodeon.\" She also notes, prior to broadcasting the second season, that \"Nat and Alex are bonafide rock stars who have captured the hearts of kids everywhere with their original music and we're excited to kick off a brand-new season of their hit series. This season finds the band prepping for their tour while still having the same ups and downs of kid-dom that their fans at home are experiencing. It's this authenticity that's the appeal of the show—plus the music is irresistible.\"\n\nThe family had encountered an incident in the past; they had to delist and change their phone number in Lower Manhattan because fans worldwide were calling their apartment relentlessly. Draper recalls, \"Little girls would call and say, 'Helloooo, is [Nat] there? We just love him.' The only thing that's comforting is, they're pretty harmless at that age.\" According to Nat, \"After the show came on, people began to really treat us like huge rock stars. They'd scream on the street, and we'd look behind us to see what they were screaming about, because we didn't realize it was us.\"\n\nDespite the show's prosperity—in terms of its viewership ratings, as it came close to wrap up filming for the third season, network bosses urged the family to lengthen the season from 13 episodes to 60. Nevertheless, prior agreements had already been made between Draper, her husband and the staff at Nickelodeon that shooting would not interfere with the boys' school schedule. Network executives chose no longer to conform to the family's demands, prompting Draper and Wolff to cancel the series in mid-2009. Of the cancellation, no formal announcement had been made by either the family or network until Nat disclosed the incident to the press in 2013.\n\n"}

The weapons master is specifically responsible for maintaining control of any weapon props (including firearms, knives, swords, bows, and staff weapons).\n\nThe weapons master is present whenever a scene with a weapon is to be shot. They present the actor with the weapon just prior to the scene, and they take control of the weapon when the scene is done. It is the primary function of the weapons master to ensure that the weapons under their control do not cause harm to the cast, crew or production property. Secondary functions include ensuring that the weapons can achieve the director's goals in terms of appearance and function, and that they meet the continuity requirements for the production. While some weapons masters work exclusively in film production, others are specialists outside of the media profession who are called in because of their familiarity, licensing and qualifications with the weapons in question. Some weapons masters (particularly in lower-budget productions) are also responsible for training the actors. Prior to the 1980s, weapons were frequently the responsibility of the property master or his assistant, but since then, it has become increasingly common in the industry for the property master to a hire a dedicated weapons master in order to reduce the burden on himself. However, it is still common for the property master to double as the weapons master, as a cost-saving measure, on productions where National Firearms Act-regulated firearms (such as machine guns or sawed-off shotguns) are not being used.\n\n\n"}

The title \"Ça ira\" comes from a song of the French Revolution (, translated as: \"We will win!\"). Twenty editions were published in Antwerp from April 1920 to January 1923.\n\nThe members (many of whom later achieved great fame and notoriety) included Paul Colin, Theo van Doesburg, the young artist Maurice van Essche who was the leader of the group, Abel Lurkin, Paul Neuhuys, Arthur Pétronio, Charles Plisnier, Han Ryner, while very appealing dada and expressionist woodcuts and linos were added by Floris Jespers, Paul Joostens, Frans Masereel, Jan Cockx, Jozef Cantré, Karel Maes and Jozef Peeters. One finds incidental contributions by Paul Van Ostaijen, Paul Éluard, Francis Picabia, Pound, Iwan Goll, Blaise Cendrars and Kassak.\n\n"}
