{"id": "415461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415461", "title": "Boboli Gardens", "text": "Boboli Gardens\n\nThe Boboli Gardens () is a park in Florence, Italy, that is home to a collection of sculptures dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries, with some Roman antiquities.\n\nThe Gardens, directly behind the Pitti Palace, the main seat of the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany at Florence, are some of the first and most familiar formal 16th-century Italian gardens. The mid-16th-century garden style, as it was developed here, incorporated longer axial developments, wide gravel avenues, a considerable \"built\" element of stone, the lavish employment of statuary and fountains, and a proliferation of detail, coordinated in semi-private and public spaces that were informed by classical accents: grottos, nympheums, garden temples and the like. The openness of the garden, with an expansive view of the city, was unconventional for its time. The gardens were very lavish, considering no access was allowed to anyone outside the immediate Medici family, and no entertainment or parties ever took place in the gardens.\n\nThe Boboli Gardens were laid out for Eleonora di Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici. The name is a corruption of \"Bogoli\", a family from whom land had been bought to construct the garden. The first stage was scarcely begun by Niccolò Tribolo before he died in 1550, then was continued by Bartolomeo Ammanati, with contributions in planning from Giorgio Vasari, who laid out the grottos, and in sculpture by Bernardo Buontalenti. The elaborate architecture of the grotto in the courtyard that separates the palace from its garden is by Buontalenti.\n\nThe garden lacks a natural water source. To water the plants in the garden, a conduit was built from the nearby Arno River to feed water into an elaborate irrigation system.\n\nThe primary axis, centered on the rear façade of the palace, rises on Boboli Hill from a deep amphitheater that is reminiscent in its shape of one half of a classical hippodrome or racecourse. At the center of the amphitheater and rather dwarfed by its position is the Ancient Egyptian Boboli obelisk brought from the Villa Medici at Rome. This primary axis terminates in a fountain of Neptune (known to the irreverent Florentines as the \"Fountain of the Fork\" for Neptune's trident), with the sculpture of Neptune by Stoldo Lorenzi visible against the skyline as a visitor climbs the slope.\n\nGiulio Parigi laid out the long secondary axis, the \"Viottolone\" or \"Cyprus Road\" at a right angle to the primary axis. This road led up through a series of terraces and water features, the main one being the Isolotto complex, with the bosquets on either side, and then allowed for exit from the gardens almost at Porta Romana, which was one of the main gates of the walled city. In 1617, Parigi constructed the \"Grotto of Vulcan\" (\"Grotticina di Vulcano\") along this axis.\n\nThe gardens have passed through several stages of enlargement and restructuring work. They were enlarged in the 17th century to their present extent of 45,000 meters² (111 acres). The Boboli Gardens have come to form an outdoor museum of garden sculpture that includes Roman antiquities as well as 16th and 17th century works.\n\nIn the first phase of building, the amphitheatre was excavated in the hillside behind the palace. Initially formed by clipped edges and greens, it was later formalized by rebuilding in stone decorated with statues based on Roman myths such as the Fountain of the Ocean sculpted by Giambologna, then transferred to another location within the same garden. The small Grotto of Madama, and the Large Grotto, were begun by Vasari and completed by Ammannati and Buontalenti between 1583 and 1593.\n\nEven while undergoing restoration work in 2015, the Large Grotto's statues are still on display and represent defining examples of Mannerist sculpture and architecture. Decorated internally and externally with stalactites and originally equipped with waterworks and luxuriant vegetation, the fountain is divided into three main sections. The first one was frescoed to create the illusion of a natural grotto, that is a natural refuge to allow shepherds to protect themselves from wild animals; it originally housed \"The Prisoners\" of Michelangelo (now replaced by copies), statues that were first intended for the tomb of the Pope Julius II. Other rooms in the Grotto contain Giambologna's famous \"Bathing Venus\" and an 18th-century group of \"Paris and Helen\" by Vincenzo de' Rossi.\n\nIn the hillside above the amphitheatre is a double ramp, leading to the \"Fountain of Neptune\". The main feature is a large basin with a central bronze statue of \"Neptune\" (1565-1568) by Stoldo Lorenzi. This fountain was being constructed contemporaneously with it more famous counterpart, Ammannati's \"Fountain of Neptune\" at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio at the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. The conceit here recalls the story of the competition of Athena and Neptune to be patrons of Athens. In that legend, Neptune struck the ground with his trident to spring forth water from the land. Higher up on the hillside is a statue of \"Abundance\" (\"Dovizia\").\n\nThe Isolotto is an oval-shaped island in a tree enclosed pond nearly at the end of the alternative Viottolone axis. In the centre of the island is the Fountain of the Ocean, while in the surrounding moat, there are statues of Perseus and Andromedae (school of Giambologna). The Isolotto was laid out (circa 1618) by Giulio and Alfonso Parigi.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35457863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35457863", "title": "Budapest Museum Quarter", "text": "Budapest Museum Quarter\n\nThe Budapest Museum Quarter is a proposed new cultural and tourist site to be located on Andrássy út in Budapest, Hungary, and has at its core the merger of the Hungarian National Gallery with the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts into one institution. The concept has been around since at least 2008 when the Director of the Museum of Fine Arts proposed combining the two collections. In 2010, the Fidesz political party included the idea in its election campaign. Several other Budapest museums would be affected by the plan, which faces not only economic and legal hurdles, but also criticism from both members of the public and art professionals alike.\n\nNational museums in Hungary are those institutions that are state–owned and centrally financed. Many of them were created in the late 19th century under the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy as specialized complementary institutions to the original Hungarian National Museum. Although they received state sponsorship, the museums within this system — including the Museum of Natural History, Museum of Ethnography, Museum of Applied Arts, Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery and pre–World War II, the National Library and Archives — operated autonomously with their own board and endowment. However, with the introduction of Communism into Hungary in 1949, they lost their autonomy and were governed by the state under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Culture. \nThe Hungarian National Museum is an important symbol of national identity because it played a major role in the anti-Habsburg Revolution of 1848 when the revolutionaries read their list of twelve demands, as well as a nationalistic poem on its front steps. The site is still used annually by the government to commemorate those events.\n\nAfter winning a two–thirds parliamentary majority in the 2010 elections, Fidesz or the Hungarian Civic Union party began what was called a \"hands–on cultural policy\" that included appointing a media watchdog \"that has the power to fine media outlets deemed to violate public interest, order and morals\". It was suggested by members of the Hungarian art community that the center–right government was also influencing the appointment of a new director for the Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok) when the prior, Socialist–appointed incumbent's term ran out at the end of 2010. Francesca Von Habsburg was considered a favorite of the new, conservative government and a front–runner in the selection process. However, instead of choosing a candidate from this transparent process launched in November 2010, the Secretary of State for Culture Géza Szőcs (a recent Fidesz appointee) personally approved the decision to hire Gábor Gulyás, former director of the Centre for Modern and Contemporary Arts (MODEM) in Debrecen, Hungary.\n\nIn 2011, László Harsanyi, the director of the Holocaust Memorial Center and his chief historical adviser, Judit Molnár, were both relieved of their posts after the State Secretary for the Ministry of Public Administration and Justice, András Levente Gál, objected to the museum's display of an image of Hungary’s interwar leader Miklós Horthy. Saying that \"this kind of historical inaccuracy [unjustifiably linking Hungary to the deportation of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] creates unnecessary tension,\" Gál drew the wrath of dozens of local historians and social scientists. But according to Molnár, \"we could not change the permanent exhibition to align with the new political expectations since we regard that as a falsification of history.\" A Fidesz party MP and former chairman of the parliamentary cultural and press committee László Simon was also appointed to lead the National Cultural Fund of Hungary, which until then had been independent of the government. Other early 2012 replacements included that of Győrgy Szabó, director of Trafó — a leading contemporary art center — by choreographer Yvette Bozsik, and the director of Budapest’s Új Szinház theater, István Márta by György Dörner, an actor with extreme right–wing political affiliations. According to art historian Éva Forgács, “the government wants to disrupt the fabric of Hungarian culture, by having leading cultural figures disappear and replacing them with their own.” However, Simon dismissed any controversies over his and similar appointments as being politically motivated by the opposition.\n\nIn 2012, the government decreed that the network of over two hundred county museums that had been in operation for more than a century would fall under the auspices of local city governments. However, the deputy leader of the parliamentary cultural committee Gergely Karácsony criticized the decision, arguing that it went against professional standards and that a much better choice would have been unifying the galleries and museums under the Hungarian National Museum system. This would have allowed them to be state-funded, instead of relying on already underfunded local budgets that may lead to the closing of these institutions.\n\nOn January 1, 2012, amendments created in the spring of 2011 by Fidesz to the Hungarian Constitution took effect and were not only criticized by many citizens within the country, but also by forces within the European Union and the United States. Some of these changes included \"a preamble committed to defending the intellectual and spiritual unity of the nation\", references to previously excluded social issues like the definition of marriage and modifications to the electoral process. Within days, tens of thousands of people marched in protest in Budapest. Initially, the government defended replacing the old Constitution stating that it was \"high time\" for the changes to be made. To support his May 2010 remarks that “Hungarian culture must be refreshed with works of art, prizes, celebrations”, as well as publicize the legislative changes, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán opened a special government–organized exhibit at the National Gallery highlighting the sovereign statehood and Christianity within the 1,000 years of Hungarian history. Included in the show, which runs through August 2012, are 15 large, state–commissioned works depicting important events from the country's past 150 years, including a canvas of Orbán himself.\n\nFacing increasing pressure from the EU, by mid–January 2012 the Fidesz government had agreed to change parts of the new legislation regarding constitutional changes to the independence of the central bank, the judiciary and data protection. However, they did not agree to change language regarding the cultural components of the proposal.\n\nThe concept of a separate museum district within Budapest was a Fidesz campaign platform during the 2010 elections. It included plans for the area from the Western Railway Station to the current Museum of Fine Arts, located on Heroes' Square, to house a newly built Museum of Hungarian Modern Art, as well as a House of Europe for all the countries represented on the continent. The Museum of Ethnography would also be moved to this newly planned district. The project was intended by the party to \"serve as a cultural–touristic–gastronomic centre with an exhibition and music hall and information centre\" and be realized over a period of 15 years. The proposal was unveiled by István Tarlós, who at the time was chairman of the Fidesz party and who became mayor of Budapest later that same year. Consequently, a consensus developed during a series of professional debates that a museum master plan was essential because there was a real need for: a modern 21st century institution; an emphasis to collect and exhibit 20th century Hungarian art in an international context; and the expansion of media to include architecture, design, photography and media arts. Speculation by the press as to why none of these proposals seemed to get beyond the discussion and debate stage included the observation that \"the prevailing cultural policy since the political transformation has been to continue with the old model — that is, the use of direct control instead of a structural transformation based on dialogue\".\n\nIn 2008, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, László Baán, proposed the merging of his museum with that of the National Gallery, due to the similar exhibition and collection profile of the two. Both (along with the Ludwig Museum of Contemporary Art) specialize in 20th century and contemporary fine art, much of which was created by Hungarian artists living overseas. After his request to add an €18million underground extension to the Museum of Fine Arts — which would have united collections spread across the city — was denied in February 2011, Baán presented an alternative plan to the government to build two new buildings at the cost of €150m. He envisioned the new buildings — one housing contemporary European art and the other Hungarian photography — as a \"special museum island\" that would complement the Museum of Fine Arts and the Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok) by permanently joining the two collections by 2017.\n\nIn September 2011, Secretary of State for Culture Géza Szőcs officially announced plans to build a new structure along Andrássy út close to City Park and near the existing Budapest Museum of Fine Arts and Budapest Art Hall (Műcsarnok). This building would house the collections of the current Hungarian National Gallery. This expanded plan, which would utilize the entire boulevard, is also referred to as the Andrássy Quarter. The project would also involve the addition of a tunnel to redirect existing vehicular traffic, thereby creating a pedestrian–only zone that hasn't existed on Andrássy út since the late nineteenth century. In addition to other new venues for eating and entertainment on Andrássy út, there would also be changes made to City Park. One of these would be to rename the Hungarian State Circus after Harry Houdini, whose background as a Hungarian was relatively unknown even though he was world famous. This version of the project would take eight years and cost 20 billion HUF. After submission of a detailed proposal to the cabinet (expected in summer 2012), construction could begin by 2014.\n\nThe architectural design for this \"New Gallery\" will be chosen based on an international competition.\n\nAccording to the Hungarian News Agency (MTI), on October 1, 2011 László Baán was appointed to a two–year term as the government commissioner in charge of developing the new museum quarter, in addition to his existing position as director of the Museum of Fine Arts. In his new post, Baán will report directly to the Prime Minister, but will not get additional pay. He will be responsible for “preparing the concept, execution and architectural design–tender for a building complex to house the national public collection in Budapest’s 56–ers Square, with a special focus on merging the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Hungarian National Gallery\".\n\nBaán has faced criticism before from both other institutions and interest groups, having radically transformed his museum from 2004 onward from one of relative obscurity to being an extensive contributor of loans to major international exhibits. While his process of fast modernization and innovation was supported by the government, it went against the typical standard of slow (or even non-existent) change in non–contemporary, eastern European museums.\n\nIn early December 2011, Ferenc Csák — director of the Hungarian National Gallery since 2010 and critical of the proposed merger of the gallery with the Museum of Fine Arts— called the merge process “[v]ery unprofessional, anti–democratic and short–sighted” and announced that he would resign at the end of 2011. As of March 5, 2012, a new director had not been named and the Hungarian National Gallery was being led by Deputy General Director György Szűcs.\n\nThis is not the first time that a recent Hungarian government has proposed the integration of multiple public institutions into one location. The plan is similar to that of the Government District which was to be built in generally the same area of Budapest behind the Western Railway Station in 2009 under the direction of then Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány. However, that proposal — which was touted by the government as a green initiative to save on resources — was scrapped in early 2008 due to the enormous projected costs of rebuilding the infrastructure around the area.\nThere was speculation by historian András Gerő that Fidesz's recent policy changes stem from its staunch anti–communist stance, which \"is not blindly ideological but driven by cold political calculation\".\n\nThe resignation of former National Gallery director Ferenc Csák was partly motivated by the Fidesz government's exhibition \"Heroes, Kings, Saints. Images and Documents from the History of Hungary\" which he criticized by saying, “The government shouldn’t have the power to order exhibitions with such a high political agenda. Museums shouldn’t be getting involved in politics.”\n\nMoving the collections of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the Buda Castle empty and available for other use. Although the government has made it clear that they will move out of the Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices — including that of the Prime Minister — into the Castle once it is vacant.\n\nIn November 2011, Hungary was downgraded to junk status by one of the big international rating agencies. In spite of this, several major projects are planned for Budapest within the next few years, including that of the Museum Quarter.\n\nAddressing criticism regarding the timing of such an expensive project with a weak economic situation, László Baán defended the Hungarian government's plans by saying that they are \"making use of various instruments for dealing with the critical economic situation, many of which are surprising, unusual and, for that very reason, ferociously debated.\" However, he also added that \"it fits perfectly with the logic of this government to launch a cultural mega–project of such emblematic significance right in the middle of general budget cuts: one which, besides its intrinsic value, also expresses an extremely important symbolic message\".\n\nThere is also a legal hurdle to the various construction plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the City Park is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by the government for the new museum. The zoning laws are reviewed every five or ten years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal.\n\nIn addition to opposition to the merging of the museums, the establishment of the museum quarter by forcing cars off Andrássy út also received criticism. Arguments included the fact that the scale of the massive boulevard is much too large to be restricted to only pedestrians and the wide, tree–lined sidewalks that exist are already adequate. Many of the shops along the route are also empty — a sign of the current status of the Hungarian economy — and would not make for a welcome sight to targeted tourists.\n\nArt professionals have criticized László Baán's capacity to lead an endeavor to unite two such massive museums because he is not an art historian nor a museologist, but rather an economist by training. They fear that a merge would potentially damage Hungarian cultural heritage, both literally and figuratively. Additionally, leading Hungarian art historians worry that the physical move of such a large and valuable collection as that of the National Gallery is unprofessional and irresponsible. Between December 17, 2011 and the deadline for the merge on February 29, 2012 an online petition entitled \"Protest Against the Merger of the Hungarian National Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts\" that was created by these individuals had received 2,945 signatures. On October 25, 2011 the Hungarian Section of the International Association of Art Critics (AICA) published their similar standpoint regarding the issue and also supported the on–line petition.\n\nBaán dismissed these criticisms by reminding the Hungarian members of AICA that he was hired to conduct the necessary impact studies and hold discussions with key stakeholders in the next two years in order to address their concerns. He also stressed that the National Gallery would not cease to exist, but only that its collections would be relocated to return it to its pre–1957 state and give it more prominence.\n\nDespite all of the challenges and the opposition to the planned Budapest Museum Quarter, creating unified spaces is not unheard of, as there are other major cities worldwide which have successfully created cultural and tourist centers by clustering museums and other similar attractions in one location.\n\nThe Museumplein of Amsterdam — a spacious square with a pond and park frequently used for outdoor festivals and events — lies in the heart of the museum quarter in Amsterdam surrounded by the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk and the Concertgebouw.\n\nFive institutions that are all part of the Berlin State Museums are located on the northern half of an island in the Spree River in Berlin, Germany and make up what is referred to as Museum Island.\n\nMore than a dozen museums in Frankfurt, Germany are clustered along the banks of the Main River in an area known as the Museumsufer.\n\nOpened in 2001, the Museum Quarter in Vienna is one of the world's largest complexes for modern art and culture, encompassing nine permanent museums, exhibition halls, and creativity space for the dozens of culture initiatives based in the area. It is also home to restaurants, cafés and shops, attracting about 3.8 million visitors a year. It was created in order to coordinate the work of various museums after the establishment of a federal museum law. \n\nChicago's Museum Campus, which houses the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, Adler Planetarium, and Soldier Field, came to be in 1998 when the area next to Lake Michigan was replanned and landscaped with the intention of tying the institutions together with the use of green space.\n\nThe Dallas Arts District was proposed in 1978 and the first major museum to be located in the northeast corner of downtown was the Dallas Museum of Art, opened in 1984. Since then, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, the Crow Collection of Asian Art, the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, and the AT&T Performing Arts Center have all been moved or newly built in the area. In 2012, the City Performance Hall will complete the planned additions to the district.\n\nThe Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex contains another cluster of cultural sites at the Fort Worth Cultural District. It is not only home to five museums such as the Kimbell Art Museum, National Cowgirl Museum and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History, but the overall park-like setting also contains the local performing arts centers like symphony, ballet and theater.\n\nThe pedestrian–friendly Museum District in Houston, Texas links 18 cultural institutions and attracts 8.7 million visitors each year. It is home to such facilities as the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, the Children's Museum of Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum of Houston, along with restaurants, shops and offices.\n\nExposition Park in Los Angeles contains several sporting venues, museums and recreational facilities within its 60 acres. Visitors will find the LA Coliseum and Memorial Sports Arena, as well as the Natural History Museum, California Science Center and African American Museum alongside the Expo Center.\n\nThe National Mall is a central green space in Washington, DC that is defined by the structures of the US Capitol on one end and the Jefferson Memorial on the other. Between these two points, visitors will find numerous memorials and monuments, as well as many museums belonging to the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution including the Quadrangle Museums Project, designed in 1987. It opens south from the Smithsonian Castle building and contains two small buildings which are staging areas for two underground museums, the Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, and the National Museum of African Art, and another smaller kiosk–like building which provides the entrance for the S. Dillon Ripley Center.\n\nIn addition to criticism surrounding the proposed Museum Quarter and the recent changes in leadership for key Hungarian cultural institutions, there are several other significant issues that affect the country's cultural heritage management.\n\nA new controversy has erupted over the plans to restore the Kossuth Square in front of the Parliament building. The changes would include the removal of all monuments added since 1945 and replacing them with pre–1944 sculptures. In this plan, a 1980 sculpture of one of the greatest Hungarian poets, Attila József would be replaced by a monument of one–time prime minister Gyula Andrássy. Not everyone is overly worried about the government's actions, though. For example, artist Miklós Szűts believes that \"the government might make symbolic gestures, like the paintings they commissioned, but they don’t have a major effect in reality.” However, the Socialist opposition planted a tree on Earth Day 2012 at the end of the square in protest of the government's undemocratic actions of modifying the space \"without asking the people\".\n\nIn addition to the statues of Kossuth Square being in danger, the fate of the Ethnographic Museum that is across from the Parliament building is also uncertain because the newly reinstated Hungarian Supreme Court (Kúria) has recently expressed interest in getting its former building back. According to the local newspaper Népszava, just moving the museum, as well as the Institute of Political History that also occupies the same building, would cost at least 5 billion HUF, but constructing new premises for both would take at least 15 billion HUF, if not double the amount\".\n\nIn mid–2011, the Hungarian Natural History Museum was threatened with eviction from its building (known as the Ludovika Campus), which it received after the fall of communism in 1989. The government wanted to turn the premises into a university for the military or police, similar to its function prior to 1945, and thereby relocate the 70 staff and 10 million artifacts into a yet undecided space. A few days after this news, the government's Office of Public Affairs issued a joint press release with the museum that addressed the issue. They explained that in spite of two decades of effort, the museum still operates in three separate locations. Additionally, the move of the proposed National Civil Servant University into unutilized space in the Ludovika Campus would make it possible for the museum to receive additional space elsewhere, thereby improving its current situation by reducing the number of sites where it operates. The museum would keep the current space in the Ludovika's former stables and the underground rooms that it uses. The museum's leadership would also take part in the preparatory work regarding the renovations of the Ludovika Campus. Long–term plans involve moving the Hungarian Natural History Museum to the completed Museum Quarter.\nA private collection exhibiting almost 1,000 artifacts opened on Andrássy út in September 2011 as part of the new Southeast Asian Gold Museum. One source of contention among its critics is that the Ministry of Culture approved the title of \"museum\" without the usual requirements for records of the origin of the exhibits. The collection is both complimentary to and competition of the existing Ferenc Hopp Southeast Asian Museum in Budapest, which the owner and curator of the new Gold Museum István Zelnik had been interested in acquiring since 2008. However, the leadership of the latter (which belongs under the umbrella of the Budapest Museum of Applied Arts) blocked his advances. Currently, the future of both the Hopp Museum and its sister institution the György Ráth Museum is uncertain. Due to financial constraints, they are both only open for half–days on Friday through Sunday. There are also rumors within the Hungarian press that both museums are due to close on March 31, 2012 and that their collections are to be permanently transferred to the Museum of Applied Arts as a response to the Hopp Museum's previous bids for independent status under the auspices of the National Trust for Monuments (MNG).\n\nWhile Krásna Hôrka Castle is a National Cultural Monument of the Slovak Republic, it was built and inhabited by ethnic Hungarian families and was part of the Kingdom of Hungary until 1918. However, a massive blaze on March 10, 2012 destroyed much of the building and up to 10% of its historical collections. Fidesz's commitment to the preservation of Hungary's cultural heritage may be tested based on their response to the request for aid from the Hungarian Coalition Party of Slovakia to rebuild the thirteenth-century fortress, but the initial statement of the Hungarian Prime Minister was that the nation is prepared to assist with saving this priceless cultural asset.\n\n\n"}

Charlotte Bingham (born 29 June 1942) is an English novelist who has written over 30 mainly historical romance novels and has also written for many television programmes including \"Upstairs, Downstairs\"; \"Play for Today\"; and \"Robin's Nest\". In her television work, she often worked with her husband, Terence Brady.\n\nThe Honourable Charlotte Mary Thérèse Bingham was born on 29 June 1942 in Haywards Heath, Sussex. Her father, John Bingham, 7th Baron Clanmorris, wrote detective stories and was a secret member of MI5. Her mother, Madeleine Bingham, née Madeleine Mary Ebel, was a playwright. Bingham first attended a school in London, but from the age of seven to 16, she went to the Priory of Our Lady's Good Counsel school in Haywards Heath. After she left school, Bingham went to stay in Paris with some French aristocrats with the intention of learning French. She had written since she was 10 years old and her first piece of work was a thriller called \"Death's Ticket\". Bingham wrote her humorous autobiography, called \"Coronet Among the Weeds\", when she was 19, and not long before her twentieth birthday a literary agent discovered her celebrating at the Ritz. He was a friend of her parents and he took off the finished manuscript of her autobiography. In 1963, this was published by Heinemanns and was a best seller.\n\nIn 1966, Charlotte Bingham's first novel, called \"Lucinda\", was published. This was later adapted into a TV screenplay. In 1972, \"Coronet Among the Grass\", her second autobiography, was published. This talked about the first ten years of her marriage to fellow writer Terence Brady. The couple, who have two children, later adapted \"Coronet Among the Grass\" and \"Coronet Among the Weeds\", into the TV sitcom \"No, Honestly\". Bingham and her husband collaborated on the scripts for three early episodes of \"Upstairs, Downstairs\", \"Board Wages\", \"I Dies from Love\" and \"Out of the Everywhere\". They later wrote an accompanying book called \"Rose's Story\". They also wrote the episodes of \"Take Three Girls\" featuring Victoria (Liza Goddard). In the 1970s, Brady and Bingham wrote episodes for the TV series \"Play for Today\", \"Three Comedies of Marriage\", \"Yes, Honestly\" and \"Robin's Nest\". During the 1980s and 1990s, they continued to write for the occasional TV series and adapted Jilly Cooper's novel \"Riders\" for the television film \"Riders\" (1993).\n\nSince the 1980s, Bingham has become a romantic novelist, writing novels including \"To Hear a Nightingale\", \"The Business\" and \"In Sunshine or in Shadow\". Most of her books are set in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1996, she won the Romantic Novel of the Year Award from the Romantic Novelists' Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6689441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6689441", "title": "Daly's Theatre", "text": "Daly's Theatre\n\nDaly's Theatre was a theatre in the City of Westminster. It was located at 2 Cranbourn Street, just off Leicester Square. It opened on 27 June 1893, and was demolished in 1937.\n\nThe theatre was originally built for American producer Augustin Daly by the English theatre manager George Edwardes. The architect was Spencer Chadwick, who was assisted by C. J. Phipps. The theatre was one of the first in London to be built using the cantilever system, and the Italian Renaissance and neo-classical facade was more elaborate than that of most London theatres. Likewise, the entrance hall and foyer were elaborately executed and decorated. The Victorian style to minimize colouring and design in the auditorium was abandoned, and instead bold designs and colours were used. It had a seating capacity of over 1,200 in three tiers.\n\nThe theatre opened with \"The Taming of the Shrew\", with Daly's star from his American company, Ada Rehan, playing Katharina. This was followed by Sheridan Knowles's \"The Hunchback\", with Violet Vanbrugh, and in 1894 by \"Twelfth Night\" and \"As You Like It\" and the younger Dumas's \"La Dame aux camélias\", with Eleonora Duse.\n\nIn 1894, Edwardes took over management of the theatre himself. He hired Sidney Jones as the resident composer and music director, and the theatre became well known for a string of highly successful Edwardian musical comedy productions composed mostly by Jones, many with additional songs by Lionel Monckton.\n\nThe shows represented a step forward in the evolution of musical theatre. They had coherent plots and music specifically composed for the plot of each piece. After the first few of these pieces, they became more like what musical comedy was to become at maturity than their Gaiety Theatre siblings, the more revue-like \"Girl\" musicals. The early Daly's Theatre shows, mostly with books by critic-turned-playwright Owen Hall and lyrics by Harry Greenbank and the prolific Adrian Ross, included the breakout hit, \"A Gaiety Girl\" (1894), \"An Artist's Model\" (1895), and the three most successful musical comedies of the era: \"The Geisha\" (1896), \"A Greek Slave\" (1898) and \"San Toy\" (1899). The shows starred actors such as leading lady Marie Tempest, dancer-soubrette Letty Lind, leading men C. Hayden Coffin and Scott Russell, and comics Huntley Wright and Rutland Barrington.\n\nThese were followed by \"A Country Girl\" (1902) and \"The Cingalee\" (1904), with books by James T. Tanner. Edwardes was clever at gauging the changing tastes of his audiences. For a time, he successfully presented English adaptations of continental European operettas, like \"The Little Michus\" (1905), \"The Merveilleuses\" (1906), the highly successful \"The Merry Widow\" (1907), \"The Dollar Princess\" (1909), \"The Count of Luxembourg\" (1911), Gipsy Love (1912) and \"Betty\" (1915). In this series, Percy Greenbank replaced his brother Harry, who had died at the age of 33, songwriter Paul Rubens joined the team, and new actors joined or replaced the older ones, including leading men Bertram Wallis, Courtice Pounds and Robert Evett, and leading ladies Gertie Millar, Lily Elsie, Gabrielle Ray, Isabel Jay, Louie Pounds and Evie Greene.\n\nEdwardes died in 1915, leaving his estate in considerable debt. The theatre continued to be managed by Robert Evett as part of Edwardes's estate. Evett directed and produced \"The Happy Day\" (1916) and the smash hit, \"The Maid of the Mountains\" (1917), both starring José Collins. The show ran for a record-breaking three years and saved the Edwardes estate. This was followed by \"A Southern Maid\" (1917; revived 1920) and \"Our Peg\" (later adapted into \"Our Nell\"). Evett also directed revivals of \"The Dollar Princess\".\n\nLater, other managements took over the theatre. In 1927, Noël Coward's famous flop \"Sirocco\" played at Daly's. After this failure, Daly's returned to musical comedies but found little further success. \"That's a Pretty Thing\" played in 1933, \"Charley's Aunt\" was revived in 1934, and \"Young England\" was transferred there in 1935. The theatre eventually closed in 1937 after the last performance of \"The First Legion\" and was sold to Warner Brothers who demolished the theatre and built a large theatre and cinema called the Warner Theatre designed by Thomas Somerford and E. A. Stone with a marble facade sculpted by Bainbridge Copnall, featuring a large relief panel in two corners depicting the spirits of sight and sound. This building was demolished, but the marble frontage was retained, and the site was redeveloped as the \"Warner Village cinema complex\". It changed hands again, and is now the \"Vue West End\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31555118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31555118", "title": "Ensemble librarianship", "text": "Ensemble librarianship\n\nEnsemble librarianship (or performance librarianship) is an area of music librarianship which specializes in serving the needs of musical ensembles, including symphony and chamber orchestras, opera houses, ballet companies, wind ensembles and educational institutions. Ensemble librarians acquire printed music and prepare it for performance.\n\nEnsemble or performance librarianship is a relatively new and evolving field with an oral history, so in many instances, there is no written history upon which to rely. Aside from a few surveys and recorded interviews, there are very few documents describing the history of the profession at this point in time. Many of the musicians who developed and defined the job as it exists today are still living (for example, librarian Clinton Nieweg). Historically, music librarians were only required to handle acquisitions and distribution – they did not have the requirements many librarians have today to mark individual parts for performance, correct errors, work in close consultation with the music director and/or artistic staff, and conduct scholarly research. Traditionally, many orchestra librarians were string players, since they already possessed a working knowledge of bowings (markings made in string parts). “Until 1970s, in all but the largest orchestras the librarian had a playing position in the orchestra and engaged in part time library work to supplement his or her income. In other cases the librarian had retired from playing and still wished to remain a part of the orchestra. A survey at the 1998 MOLA annual conference (conducted by Andrew S. Holmes) revealed that in some smaller orchestras..., the library position had remained part-time for the most part until the mid 1980's to early 1990's.” In some organizations, librarian duties were alternatively fulfilled by an administrative staff member (i.e. personnel manager or orchestra manager) and this is still the case with many smaller organizations today. Gradually, particularly with the larger orchestras and bands, the role of music librarian has become a job obtained on an audition basis and which requires the demonstration of extensive knowledge of not only music notation, history, and performance practice, but also specialized technique and research ability. Today, larger and more established organizations can have multiple librarians and a hierarchy has developed, where a principal librarian is often identified and compensated accordingly (much like principal string or wind/brass/percussion players in an orchestral setting). This principal librarian may then work with one or more assistant librarians and can delegate tasks.\n\nA professional ensemble librarian requires a diverse and extensive musical, research, and often administrative-oriented background. Currently, there is no formal degree program specifically for ensemble or performance librarianship offered at any academic institution. Consequently, primary forms of training include degree programs or their equivalent in Music Performance (instrumental), Music Theory, Musicology, or related fields, in conjunction with mentoring, internships, and on-the-job training. In the United States, work as an apprentice with a career librarian is a common and invaluable educational tool. Some ensemble librarians hold degrees in Library Science (LIS, MLIS). \"Most music schools and many library / information science schools have programs that offer a variety of related course work which could be applied to orchestra librarianship.” While such experience can be very helpful, this is not typically a specific requirement to work as an ensemble librarian. Ideally, “training for orchestra librarianship should include a broad and intensive education in all aspects of music and the liberal arts. This career requires a combination of formal education and extensive practical experience in a symphonic organization.\"\n\nQualifications (Quoted with permission from Russ Girsberger's \"A Manual for the Performance Library\")\nThe following list describes the qualifications that are desirable to function successfully as a performance librarian. Not every position requires all of these abilities, but professional performance librarians use these skills on a regular basis in their work.\n\n- Degree in music or equivalent musical knowledge\n- Experience as a performing musician, preferably as a member of a large ensemble\n- Comprehensive knowledge of music theory, history, orchestration, transposition, and notation conventions\n- Detailed knowledge of ensemble repertoire and repertoire resources\n- Knowledge of the music industry, publishing, licensing, and copyright legislation\n- Library research skills and familiarity with standard reference resources\n- Bibliographic knowledge of European languages\n\n- Knowledge of necessary office equipment (photocopy machine, binding machine, etc.)\n- Knowledge of computer hardware and software, to include word processing, database, spreadsheet, and Internet applications\n- Experience with computer music notation software and/or facility with hand manuscript notation\n\n- Ability to work effectively with conductors, musicians, administrators, faculty, staff, and students\n- Exceptional organizational skills and attention to detail\n- Ability to work independently and in a leadership role when necessary\n- Ability to handle multiple tasks concurrently\n- Projecting planning and time management skills\n- Excellent communication skills and ability to interact with a number of diverse constituencies\n- Self-motivated\n\nLibrary Auditions\n\nIn the U.S., some professional ensemble librarians must now endure a process similar to instrumental orchestral auditions in order to obtain their jobs. \"Marcia Farabee (Principal Librarian, National Symphony) explains that today some orchestras have adopted a similar audition process for librarians. These 'librarian auditions' involve interviews as well as written tests which ask questions to which a qualified candidate should know the answers.\" Experience, formal education, and references provided on the auditionee's résumé play an important role, but the candidate may be required to pass this live audition and interview component, as well. As noted, larger orchestras and the more prestigious summer fellowships may require a candidate to pass a written exam demonstrating knowledge of composers, important historical facts, publishers, and repertoire. Librarians wishing to pursue this career study long hours in order to prepare for these auditions and therefore, professional ensemble librarianship is becoming a competitive field in North America. In Europe, many ensemble librarians currently obtain their positions via a more standard job interview process.\n\nThe ensemble librarian is often the primary individual responsible for research, acquisition (via purchase, rental, commission, or lending), receipt of materials, and cataloging of performing materials (scores and parts) for a musical organization. The librarian consults and collaborates with the music director, other artistic or administrative staff members, and/or soloists to identify the correct edition or version of the work to be acquired and its source, then works to determine its cost, delivery time, method of delivery, and any other associated concerns. The librarian may also be responsible for locating and obtaining perusal materials (scores and/or recordings for study). An important component of the acquisition process, particularly in the case of renting works under copyright, can be obtaining permission and licensing for any recording, broadcast (radio or World Wide Web), or other types of mechanical use that may be planned.\n\nFollowing the purchase or commission of performance materials, the librarian may be obligated to create and/or maintain a catalog of the musical organization’s physical holdings of performance and reference material. This can be as simple as an itemized listing of materials owned or as complex as designing and implementing a custom-made electronic catalog for the ensemble. Many organizations utilize pre-existing database programs such as OPAS. Upon receipt of purchased or donated materials, the librarian inventories the scores and parts, stamps or otherwise marks them with the organization’s name and identifying information, and prepares them for storage. Cataloging can also extend to maintaining a record of conductor markings and dates of use, condition of materials, and performance and lending history.\n\nThe most essential task of the ensemble librarian is to provide adequately prepared parts to the players of the ensemble. Collaboration with conductors and soloists is often necessary in order to determine the specific requirements concerning the part preparation process. The goal is to ensure smooth flow of rehearsals and performances.\nMusic arriving from a publisher or rental agent is rarely ready for use as such; most parts will need adjustments to make them more suitable for the performer. This most frequently includes marking string bowings, fixing bad page turns, adding and/or coordinating rehearsal figures, clarifying illegible notation and correcting errata. Editing of tempos, dynamics, articulations, inserts, and cuts or transposition into a singer's preferred vocal range or instrumentalist's preferred key may also be required. Additional proofreading may also be necessary, due to mistakes or inconsistencies in published editions.\n\nOnce the parts have been prepared appropriately, the orchestra librarian will assemble concert folders or arrange part pick-up for the musicians. The concert folder contains all the music for the complete concert for an individual musician (e.g. Oboe I) or a single desk of musicians (such as Violin I / Desk 1). Assembling the concert folders needs to be finished well in advance of each series of performances to make sure the musicians have time to practice. In some orchestras, the librarian is responsible for delivering concert folders to the music stands on stage for all rehearsals and performances.\n\nOnce the performances are over, the librarian disassembles the concert folders, tracks down any missing parts and stores any performance materials owned by the orchestra. Hired or rented sets are returned, and archival copies of bowings are usually made for future reference.\n\nThe ensemble librarian is responsible for the care and preservation of the ensemble's music collection. In addition to the purchase cost of printed sheet music, the value of the library collection increases with information added during rehearsals and preparation work done to the parts. This value is inherent and often irreplaceable.\n\nDamage to printed music may occur due to environmental sources (sunlight, temperature, humidity, pests, dust), physical handling, and improper storage. Appropriate humidity and temperature, protection from light sources (especially ultraviolet light) and from acid materials are key factors in ensuring the long life of printed music.\n\nOne common recruitment process of musicians for professional orchestras and bands is an audition and the ensemble's librarian is often responsible for preparing the materials required for such auditions. These usually include a round consisting of excerpts from standard orchestral repertoire that the auditionee is required to perform for the audition committee. The orchestra librarian is usually in charge of preparing the audition materials for the auditionees and audition committee. Care must be taken that starts, stops, key and time signatures, tempo markings and transpositions are properly indicated. The librarian is often responsible for acquiring publishers' permissions for reproducing the audition excerpts of works still under [copyright].\n\nIn the area of research, cataloging, storage and preservation of music, music libraries share many methods in common with ensemble libraries. Many ensemble librarians use a comprehensive computerized database such as OPAS that integrates information about the composer, instrumentation, and performance history of standard orchestral works.\n\nUse of the internet has provided librarians easier access to information, especially research and reference materials. The online forum of the Major Orchestra Librarians' Association (MOLA) has greatly increased communication between professional librarians and provided excellent opportunities for networking and exchange of information.\n\nThe tools traditionally used for the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.\n\nThe part preparation process is traditionally done by hand for every single part to be used on stage. Bowings need to be marked into the string parts using pencil, since they are likely to change on stage during rehearsals, and the players need to be able to incorporate the alterations easily. The same applies to conductors' personal tempo indications and dynamic markings. Temporary musical edits (such as cuts and inserts) are done in a way which allows their easy removal afterward.\n\nIn addition to common library tools, ensemble librarians often utilize music engraving software for incorporating last-minute musical changes such as transpositions, \"concert\" endings, inserts or other musical edits to the performance material at hand.\n\nOn occasion, digital image processing software (such as Adobe Photoshop) is used for correcting errata and enhancing print quality of problematic performance materials of public domain musical works. Use of digital technology is becoming common in the task of preparing audition excerpts for the musician recruitment process.,\n\nIn addition to the artistic roles ensemble librarians play within their organizations, many also manage duties that are administrative in nature. The administrative duties of an ensemble librarian differ depending on the type of musical organization for which the librarian works. The ensemble librarian's administrative tasks can range from control of the receipt and delivery of the performance materials to managing invoices and payments and creating an annual budget for the library; support for the program planning on issues related to instrumentation (music), off-stage music, different versions or editions, correct instrumentation. . .; providing assistance and support to the conductors, musicians, singers, choir, soloists and all professionals involved in concert production; managing the lending of musical materials to other institutions; providing additional notes or information for the printed concert program; coordinating the obtaining of rights for performance, recording or broadcast.\n\nMany ensemble librarians work in the field of symphony and chamber orchestras, forming the most typical professional profile of a performance librarian. Performance librarianship in professional symphony and chamber orchestras is characterized by frequently changing programs and a large total number of works performed, reflecting in the large number of performance materials and sets of parts to be prepared. Many full-time, professional, North American symphony orchestras employ two or even three music librarians (typically, a principal librarian and one or more assistant librarians). In Europe, full-sized symphony orchestras operate with fewer resources. For example, The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, and the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra all are single-librarian orchestras.\n\nThe symphony orchestra librarian is in frequent contact with conductors and soloists to coordinate the editions and versions of works to be used, possible alterations or edits required, and their appropriate implementation. These can include cuts, inserts, supplemental rehearsal markings, transpositions and doublings. The librarian may also be involved in providing information to the orchestra administration for program planning purposes, such as information on the duration and instrumentation of the works in question, and any rental or purchase costs. This is essential information for the symphony orchestra repertoire planning process and the librarian can play an integral role.\n\nThe complexity of opera librarianship is due to the diversity and quantity of performance materials required (such as vocal scores, chorus scores, full scores, orchestral parts, off-stage parts), plus the sheer duration of operatic works makes the job a challenge. Opera productions are often subject to revision; occasionally sections of the music are skipped (\"cuts\" are made) or otherwise altered, and some excerpts may be transposed to a different key to accommodate the vocal range of the soloists. Several operas have different musical versions: different historical versions, versions sung in different languages or recent revisions made in editions of the work. Translations and transliterations may have to be inserted into the vocal scores, and most often this is organized by the librarian. In addition, as opera is a scenic art form, some musical considerations can develop due to the stage direction. Consequently, the librarian is in charge of implementing the necessary edits into the performance material provided by the opera library.\n\nMusic in ballet is often subject to extensive revision, re-ordering and adaptation by the choreographer. This creates additional and varied duties for the ballet librarian, as opposed to the symphony or opera librarian. The choreography often requires cuts and sequence changes to the music, and therefore the librarian must be able to make the cuts logical and smooth in a musical sense. Knowledge of standard ballet repertoire and major ballet choreographers is necessary, since there are often several adaptations and arrangements of these works available.\n\nThe concert band or wind ensemble librarian's duties greatly resemble those of an orchestral performance librarian, but certain variations exist. For example, bands do not include the string sections for which orchestral librarians mark bowings into individual parts. A few examples of bands that might employ librarians are military bands, wind ensembles, brass bands, marching bands, jazz bands, ensembles at educational institutions, and popular music groups. The band librarian's work is greatly dependent on the performance venues and number of performances of the band - some military bands may perform in several ceremonies each day, and often a vast body of music must be ready to go on short notice. Marching, military, or brass bands may also perform in parades. In addition, many bands perform concerts on tour.\n\nMany top-level music schools and conservatories employ either professional and/or student ensemble librarians. Professionals often hold staff positions with the institution and job titles can range from “Music Librarian” to “Band Department Administrative Assistant” or “Orchestra Manager.” In addition to performance librarian duties on par with professional organizations, educational institution positions often entail extensive administrative duties for the music department and personnel manager tasks, as well. Librarians in the university setting can oversee not only orchestras, bands, and choirs, but also wind or brass repertoire, conducting, and master classes; placement auditions; chamber music ensembles and more.\n\nThe work of an academic librarian can vary from that of a professional ensemble's librarian in many ways. For example, university ensembles tend to employ part rotation for educational purposes, whereas professional groups more often have one designated player per part or string seating position. Consequently, librarians at educational institutions must develop different types of part distribution systems than may be used at the professional level. In addition, the academic librarian may be obligated to coordinate greater circulation of materials to faculty, rotating and guest conductors, student recitals, and community organizations. This can present additional work to mark and re-mark parts each time they are to be used by the primary ensemble. Educational institutions may also provide significantly more practice parts and allow the check-out of parts much earlier by students in order to provide ample practice time, whereas professional musicians may not require this provision for as many of the scheduled works.\n\nAn alternative career or summer opportunity for the ensemble librarian is to work for a music festival, either professional or educational. Such positions are often part-time or seasonal and can afford the ensemble librarian with experience preparing different types of repertoire and working with different types of musicians. Various organizations compile and maintain listings of current classical music festivals, including professional music organizations such as The League of American Orchestras' publication “Symphony,” university music departments like The Juilliard School, and student organizations such as Sigma Alpha Iota. MOLA maintains a listing of summer festival job openings, which is available in PDF format under the “Job Openings” tab.\n\nFor various reasons (such as the limited number of professionals in a particular geographical area, the dynamic scenario of working for a performing arts organization, and the lack of a formal academic degree program in the field), cooperation among professional ensemble librarians is not only helpful, but essential. International and national organizations facilitate the collaboration among ensemble library professionals and offer further opportunities for professional development and training.\n\nThe most notable organizations for ensemble librarians are as follows:\n\nMajor Orchestra Librarians’ Association (MOLA): The Major Orchestra Librarians' Association, founded in 1983, is composed of nearly 250 professional performance organizations around the world, represented by more than 400 librarians. MOLA facilitates communication between professional performance librarians, educates and assists them in providing service to their organizations, provides support and resources to the performing arts, and works with publishers to achieve the highest standards in music performance materials for the professional musician. Today, MOLA's membership includes symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies, music academies, professional bands and other types of ensembles worldwide.\n\nInternational Association of Music Libraries (IAML): Founded in 1951, the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres has ca. 2,000 individual and institutional members in ca. 45 countries. IAML works to promote international cooperation and to support the interests of the profession. It has national branches in 22 countries, five professional branches, four subject commissions and various working groups, and is responsible for several large-scale documentation projects. For the professional ensemble librarian, the Broadcasting and Orchestra Libraries Branch is the most essential of IAML's professional branches.\n\nAn ongoing issue in discussion among ensemble or performance librarians is the adequacy of available performance materials, in comparison to today's needs and standards required for professional use. Therefore, challenges arise, such as the deterioration of materials only available on a rental basis, the need to meet the recommended requirements for editing music in terms of format, size, page turns, etc.; the problem of errata present in many editions; the delivery of materials in digital format (common in the case of direct distribution from composers to the user), from which the librarian must then create physical parts for performance; the quality of service provided by music publishers and the accessibility of the information they provide; the emergence of digital music stands and the associated changes such media may bring.\n\nIn addition to the typical concerns professional ensemble librarians face, another major issue is ensuring compliance with copyright laws. With the constant evolution of new technology, streaming performances on the Internet and other digital use of recorded music have become reality, and new forms of copyright-related questions therefore arise. For example, the performed work may be in the public domain where the orchestra originates, but may still be under copyright in some of the geographical areas where, for instance, a webcast may be accessible. The modern ensemble librarian is charged with the duty to self-educate regarding these new technological advances, in order to avoid violation of copyright law and to protect the organization for which they work.\n\nGirsberger, Russ. \"A Manual for the Performance Library.\" Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2006.\n\nNieweg, Clinton & Johnson, Jennifer. \"Errata and the Orchestra Librarian.\" 2006. \n\nSchnackenberg, Karen. \"Who Is That Orchestra Librarian?\" 2006. \n\nSchnackenberg, Karen. \"Training to Become a Performance Librarian.\" 2008. \n\nTarlow, L. and Sutherland, R. \"The Music We Perform: An overview of royalties, rentals, and rights.\" 1998/2003, rev. 2004. www.mola-inc.org/pdf/MusicWePerform.pdf\n\n"}
{"id": "2576761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2576761", "title": "Extra (acting)", "text": "Extra (acting)\n\nA background actor or extra is a performer in a film, television show, stage, musical, opera or ballet production, who appears in a nonspeaking or nonsinging (silent) capacity, usually in the background (for example, in an audience or busy street scene). War films and epic films often employ background actors in large numbers: some films have featured hundreds or even thousands of paid background actors as cast members (hence the term \"cast of thousands\"). Likewise, grand opera can involve many background actors appearing in spectacular productions.\n\nOn a film or TV set, background actors are usually referred to as \"atmosphere\", \"background talent\", \"background performers\", \"background artists\", \"background cast members\" or simply \"background\", while the term \"extra\" is rarely used. In a stage production, background actors are commonly referred to as \"supernumeraries\". In opera and ballet, they are called either \"extras\" or \"supers\".\n\nCasting criteria for background actors depend on the production. It is not entirely true that background cast members require little or no acting experience, as any type of unrealistic portrayal must include some form of imagination and acting. Punctuality, reliability and the ability to take direction also figure prominently for these cast members. Background actors are often selected on short notice, after all other preparations for the shoot have been finalized.\n\nSeveral casting agencies specialize only in background work, whilst in the UK the directory \"Contacts\" published annually by Spotlight lists all accredited agencies and productions. Some agencies charge a registration fee, and some (mostly commercial background casting) will take between 10% and 15% commission from any booked work. Artists may be required to provide a basic one-page A4 sized CV/resume, that states basic personal details and dimensions, any significant skills (e.g. stage combat), and includes two 8x10 inch photographs on the rear: one head shot; one full body shot.\n\nWhen hiring background actors, casting directors generally seek those with a specific \"look\", such as \"high school students\" or \"affluent senior citizens\", consistent with the context of the film. Casting directors may also look for background actors with a special skill for the scene, such as rollerblading, or dancing. A background actor is often expected to bring his or her own wardrobe to the set, although there are also \"fittings\" for a specific scene or period. A casting director may favor the one who already has the required costume or prop, such as a police uniform, or a musical instrument. On other occasions, where a costume has already been prepared (for example, to fit another actor who is now unavailable), a background actor may be selected as a \"costume double\" simply because they are the right size to fit it. On smaller productions or student films, background actors may be hired \"en masse\" with little formality.\n\nThe length of a background actor's employment on a production largely depends on the needs of the director and the scenes being filmed. Some background actors are needed on the set only for a day or two, while others may remain with the film for an extended period. For instance, on James Cameron's film \"Titanic\", a group of 150 \"core background actors\" was hired to play the ship's passengers, and employed throughout the filming.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the distinction between an actor and an extra is defined by agreements between the actors trade unions Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (BECTU) and Equity, and the various commercial trade and production bodies. These state that once a performer says 13 or more words in any scene, they must become a contracted actor in that production. Minimum pay rates are defined by UK Government minimum wage regulations, and both BECTU and Equity have agreed rates with each body. However, even on non-union productions an extra's pay is an agreed day-rate for ten hours of production time. All performers under agreement with BECTU/Equity are paid on-going royalties. Hence on many advertisements, which are often shown multiple times and distributed internationally, whilst the extra is paid a contracted day-rate, the largest payment is nominally due from ongoing royalties. Due to the resultant complex calculations from multiple international showings, performers under a union managed agreement are often bought-out of their advertisement royalties with a one-off payment.\n\nIn the United States, most major film and television productions used to fall under the jurisdiction of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) or AFTRA. The two unions have merged into SAG-AFTRA.\n\nSAG-signatory producers are allowed to hire non-union background actors after a certain number of SAG performers have been cast; non-union background actors are usually paid the minimum wage. On productions outside of union jurisdiction, payment for background actors is at the discretion of the producers, and ranges from union-scale rates to \"copy and credit\" (i.e., no pay). Those producers who do not pay their actors may be in violation of state and federal laws about minimum wage for a job.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1992, background actors in film and television were largely represented by the Screen Extras Guild. SEG was disbanded on 1 June 1992 and transferred its jurisdiction to SAG.\n\nThe silent film \"The Extra Girl\" (1923) portrays a small-town girl who comes to Hollywood and becomes a background actor in her attempt to achieve stardom.\n\nThe British television sitcom \"Extras\" (2005–07) follows the exploits of two professional background actors, Andy and Maggie. They spend most of their time on set looking for a speaking role and a boyfriend, respectively.\n\nIn the Hindi black comedy film \"Mithya\" (2008), the protagonist is a background actor whose facial similarity to an underworld crime boss lands him in trouble.\n\nThe Filipino comedy-drama film \"Ekstra\" (\"The Bit Player\") (2013) centers around the life of a divorcee named Loida Malabanan, whose odd job as a bit player for various acting roles enabled her to send her daughter to college. The movie is a social commentary on the exploitation and mistreatment of the marginalized sector in the television production industry in the Philippines.\n\nThe Chinese-Hong Kong film \"I Am Somebody\" (2015) is about extras working at the Hengdian World Studios.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25724950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25724950", "title": "Geodesign", "text": "Geodesign\n\nGeodesign is a set of concepts and methods to get all stakeholders and different professions involved in order to collaboratively design and realize the optimal solution for spatial challenges in the built and natural environments, utilizing all available techniques and data in an integrated process. Originally, geodesign was mainly applied during the design & planning phase. \"Geodesign is a design and planning method which tightly couples the creation of design proposals with impact simulations informed by geographic contexts.\" Now, it is also used during realization and maintenance phases and to facilitate re-use of for example buildings or industrial areas. Geodesign includes project conceptualization, analysis, design specification, stakeholder participation and collaboration, design creation, simulation, and evaluation (among other stages). \n\nGeodesign builds greatly on a long history of work in geographic information science, computer-aided design, landscape architecture, and other environmental design fields. See for instance, the work of Ian McHarg and Carl Steinitz. \n\nMembers of the various disciplines and practices relevant to geodesign have held defining discussions at a workshop on Spatial Concepts in GIS and Design in December 2008 and the GeoDesign Summit in January 2010. GeoDesign Summit 2010 Conference Videos from Day 1 and Day 2 are an important resource to learn about the many different aspects of GeoDesign. ESRI co-founder Jack Dangermond has introduced each of the GeoDesign Summit meetings. Designer and technologist Bran Ferren, was the keynote speaker for the first and fourth Summit meetings in Redlands, California. During the fourth conference he presented a provocative view of how what is needed is a 250-year plan, and how GeoDesign was a key concept in making this a reality. Carl Steinitz was a presenter at both the 2010 and 2015 Summits.\n\nThe 2013 Geodesign Summit drew a record 260 attendees from the United States and abroad (watch video coverage of the summit). That same year, a master's degree in Geodesign — the first of its kind in the nation — began at Philadelphia University. Claudia Goetz Phillips, director of Landscape Architecture and GeoDesign at Philadelphia University says \"it is very exciting to be at the forefront of this exciting and relevant paradigm shift in how we address twenty-first-century global to local design and planning issues.\"\n\nThe theory underpinning Geodesign derives from the work of Patrick Geddes in the first half of the twentieth century and Ian McHarg in its second half. They advocated a layered approach to regional planning, landscape planning and urban planning. McHarg drew the layers on translucent overlays. Through the work of Jack Dangermond, Carl Steinitz, Henk Scholten and others the layers were modeled with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The three components of this term each say something about its character. 'Geographical' implies that the layers are geographical (geology, soils, hydrology, roads, land use etc.). 'Information' implies a positivist and scientific methodology. 'System' implies the use of computer technology for the information processing.\nThe scientific aspects of Geodesign contrast with the cultural emphasis of Landscape Urbanism but the two approaches to landscape planning share a concern for layered analysis which sits comfortably with postmodern and post-postmodern theory.\n\nNascent geodesign technology extends geographic information systems so that in addition to analyzing existing environments and geodata, users can synthesize new environments and modify geodata. See, for example, CommunityViz or marinemap.\n\n\"GeoDesign brings geographic analysis into the design process, where initial design sketches are instantly vetted for suitability against myriad database layers describing a variety of physical and social factors for the spatial extent of the project. This on-the-fly suitability analysis provides a framework for design, giving land-use planners, engineers, transportation planners, and others involved with design, the tools to leverage geographic information within their design workflows.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44316773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44316773", "title": "Graffiti in Hong Kong", "text": "Graffiti in Hong Kong\n\nIn Hong Kong there are a few types of graffiti that are utilized for different reasons. The face of artist Ai WeiWei is one of the more well-known caricatures in the region. Journalist and commentators have considered the graffiti as \"street-art\", \"creative\" and the \"voice of the young\".\n\nGraffiti is often a mode of expression much like other artistic outlets. It can allow artists to vent emotions as well as their opinions on the politics or society around them. Unlike other places around the world, Graffiti in Hong Kong can be used as a way of advertisement for some companies.\n\nSimilar to other countries however, graffiti is considered defacing public property and is technically an illegal act in Hong Kong. While graffiti is not prosecuted as commonly as in the United States, fines and arrest still do occur.\n\nGraffiti is a term applied to a range of illegally created marks in which there has been an attempt to establish some sort of coherent composition that people could resonate with, or one that conveys messages. Such marks are made by an individual or individuals, who might not be professional artists, upon a wall or other surface that is usually visually accessible to the public.\n\nTsang Tsou Choi, also known as the \"King of Kowloon\", was the founder of Hong Kong calligraphy graffiti. His graffiti work is different from general spray painting; he used ink brushes to write words on walls instead of spray painting to express his ideas and thoughts towards society. The aesthetic value of his works of art stirred up much controversy over Hong Kong. Still, most Hong Kong citizens still pay respect and attention to his graffiti, even though he died in 2007.\n\nSpray painting graffiti is one of the most popular styles adopted by graffiti artists. Hong Kong graffiti artists have a unique sense on where to do graffiti to reflect different aesthetic feelings of their works. For instance, drawing on rusty surfaces like iron walls produces a vintage feeling of the work. Drawings on uneven stone walls gives a strong dimensional sense.\n\nAi WeiWei, a Chinese contemporary artist and activist, was arrested by Beijing authorities for \"economic crimes\" . Ai's portrait was later painted on walls facing streets in Hong Kong by a teenage girl, who attempted to raise awareness of human rights and reveal the dark side of the Chinese government. Ai's portrait was even projected on Wall of the People's Liberation Army Building via laser.\n\nPer basic law, modifying a public property without permission is illegal in Hong Kong. On 13 July 2009, a French graffiti artist name Zevs painted a Chanel logo on the outside wall of an Armani store in central Hong Kong. He was arrested for his illicit spray-painting and was detained in Hong Kong until August. In 2011, a painted portrait of Ai WeiWei resulted in an investigation by Hong Kong police and the Crime Investigate Detective. Invader, another famous graffiti artist, has been spreading his work in Hong Kong since 2001; he has painted at least 74 mosaic print tiles on city streets. Most of them have been removed. In 2014, a Pac-Man print in Tin Hau also produced by Invader was removed for safety reasons. Such actions have stirred up much disagreement. The public did not agree that tile mosaics on walls would cause any harm and danger to society. Some news articles and journals criticised the government for their actions towards street art. However, the government continued to take down Invader's work.\n\nThough painting on public properties without permission is illegal, Hong Kong's government promised to preserve the painted works of King of Kowloon Tsang Tsou Choi, though most have already been cleaned away. The wall of fame in Mong Kok's Argyle Street provides a canvas for Hong Kong graffiti artists. The government seems to have accepted the street as a \"graffiti community\" even though street artists are violating the law. Paintings extend over the wall for two blocks.\n\nGraffiti in Hong Kong can be divided into three aspects — as an emotional outlet, for political dissatisfaction, and as advertisement.\n\nGraffiti related to emotions can generally be seen in tunnels and under bridges, where the public might not easily notice. For instance, spray painted words like \"free\" or \"heart broken\" can be seen painted on walls. The reason for such placement is to provide artists with an outlet to express their personal emotions. Many people express their feelings through writing and talking. However, there are people who aren't good at oral or written communication. Instead, they are more comfortable with drawing and art. Graffiti is an illegal street art, and some people are attracted to the exciting and rebellious feeling of doing illegal things in an attempt to voice their opinions.\n\nGraffiti can also be used to voice opinions and dissatisfaction towards authorities. For instance, there was graffiti related to \"real universal suffrage\" being drawn in Admiralty during the Occupy Central protests in 2014. Individuals voiced their anger and depression towards both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments through graffiti work. They hoped to make common cause with Hong Kong citizens through graffiti art in order to gain more support for universal suffrage. For example, protesters not only did chalk paint graffiti, but also created a mural made from thousands of Post-It notes with citizens' wishes written on each. Couplets with citizens' petitions were also hung on a footbridge.\n\nGraffiti can also be used cheaply as a medium to advertise in Hong Kong. It is quite common to see advertisements spray-painted on public facilities, mailslots, transformer boxes, street signs, and so on. Company names and contact data might be written or drawn in an attempt for publication purposes. Such graffiti can be commonly seen in traditional districts such as Sham Shui Po and Kwun Tong. It is a style of graffiti unique to Hong Kong.\n\n"}

During his decades-long career, Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro has worked on a number of projects that never progressed beyond the pre-production stage. Some of these projects fell into development hell and are presumably canceled.\n\nAround 1995, before directing \"Mimic\", del Toro approached George R. R. Martin with the intent to make a film adaptation of his famous novelette \"Sandkings\", but the project was quickly scrapped after the novel was adapted into the first episode of the television series \"The Outer Limits\".\n\nIn the late 1990s, del Toro expressed interest in directing a of Katsuhiro Otomo's \"\". In 2002, after the success of \"Blade II\", del Toro said that he tried to make the film in the following years, but his efforts were hamstrung by international legalities. \"Goddamn it, we haven't even got the rights. We've been negotiating the rights for four years, which goes to prove Japanese lawyers are even more complex than American lawyers. The moment we have the rights I would go ahead and write it.\" \n\nIn approximately 2003, New Line Cinema was in talks with del Toro to keep him on as director for \"Blade 3\", due his directing work on \"Blade II. However, D\"el Toro turned down the offer in order to direct \"Hellboy\". \"Blade 3\" film ended up becoming the critically snubbed \"\", directed by screenwriter David S. Goyer, and released in 2004.\n\nIn 2003, del Toro reported that he was working with The Walt Disney Company on an animated film adaptation of Kenneth Grahame's novel \"The Wind in the Willows\". The film would have been animated using CGI animation, but the project was abandoned following many delays.\n\nIn 2003, del Toro was in talks to direct \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", the third installment of the \"Harry Potter\" film series based on J. K. Rowlings' novel of the same name. However, he chose instead to direct \"Hellboy\", and \"The Prisoner of Azkaban\" was directed by Alfonso Cuarón.\n\nOn September 13, 2005, Warner Bros. approached del Toro and asked him to direct the third film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend\". However, del Toro chose to direct \"\" instead. \"I Am Legend\" was finally released in 2007, directed by Francis Lawrence.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, ComingSoon.net reported that del Toro was in talks to direct a \"Tarzan\" film. Then, in September 2008, Slashfilm.com reported that Stephen Sommers had replaced del Toro as director. The film, finally released in 2016 under the title \"The Legend of Tarzan,\" was actually directed by David Yates.\n\nIn 2007, New Line Cinema bought the rights to produce an English-language remake with del Toro as producer. On remakes, the original's director J. A. Bayona noted that \"The Americans have all the money in the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money\" and \"The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits\". On August 4, 2009, Larry Fessenden was announced as the director of the American remake. Fessenden later announced that he would not be involved with directing the remake, stating \"Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore\". In January 2010, Mark Pellington replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.\n\nOn August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro stated that the remake would reflect his original vision for the film, and that it had been planned even when the first version was in production. \"Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it.\" Del Toro also praised the new film's director. \"We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his \"The Mothman Prophecies\" and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon.\" On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also stated that the current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film. Since then, there has been no further development news, leading to a possible cancelation.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, ComingSoon.net reported that del Toro was working on a spiritual sequel to \"Pan's Labyrinth\", titled \"3993\" and intended to be the third and final installment of a Spanish Civil War film trilogy. However, del Toro scrapped the project after deciding to direct \"\".\n\nIn 2008, a film based on \"\", to be called \"Death and Me\", was under production at New Line Cinema. Neil Gaiman wrote the screenplay, and would also direct, with del Toro as executive producer. Gaiman spent several days on the set of del Toro's film \"\" to get pointers on how to direct. On October 14, 2010 it was reported in an interview with Gaiman that as of June or July, DC and Warner Bros. had closed down work on the film and it was unclear if they would start it up again.\n\nAround 2008, del Toro was being considered to direct a \"Thor\" film for Marvel Studios. Because of his admiration of Jack Kirby's work, del Toro entered into negotiations to direct the film. He said that he loved the character of Loki, and wished to incorporate more original Norse mythology into the film; including a \"really dingy Valhalla, [with] Vikings and mud\". However, del Toro left the project to direct \"The Hobbit\" film adaptation. \"Thor\" was released in 2011 and directed by Kenneth Branagh.\n\nOn February 8, 2008, it was reported that del Toro was in talks to direct a film adaptation of the \"Halo\" video game series. However, he chose instead to focus on \"The Hobbit\" film adaptation.\n\nIn April 2008, it was reported that del Toro would direct a two-part film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel \"The Hobbit\". Del Toro envisioned the first film as a direct adaptation of the novel, with the second bridging the gap between \"The Hobbit\" and the \"Lord of the Rings\" films. After spending two years in New Zealand working on pre-production, del Toro left the project due to ongoing delays and was replaced by \"Lord of the Rings\" director Peter Jackson. The films were expanded to a trilogy during production, and were released as \"\" (2012), \"\" (2013), and \"\" (2014), with del Toro still credited as co-writer of all three.\n\nOn May 20, 2008, del Toro revealed that he was set to produce the film adaptation of \"Hater\" by David Moody. However, he has provided no updates after this announcement, suggesting the project's cancellation.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, del Toro expressed his interest in directing a third \"Hellboy\" film, saying that he would work on the film after finishing \"The Hobbit\". In 2010, during the production of the unmade \"At the Mountain of Madness\", del Toro mentioned that he would direct \"Hellboy III\" after his next project, even though the script was not yet written. However, on July 8, 2013, del Toro said that the film was unlikely to be released, and suggested the possibility of telling its story in comic book form. \"Hellboy\" creator Mike Mignola refused to accept the idea.\n\nIn a Reddit AMA on July 11, 2014, del Toro said:Well, you know, we don't have that movie on the horizon, but the idea for it was to have Hellboy finally come to terms with the fact that his destiny, his inevitable destiny, is to become the beast of the Apocalypse, and having him and Liz face the sort of, that part of his nature, and he has to do it, in order to be able to ironically vanquish the foe that he has to face in the 3rd film. He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time, he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous.\"\n\nOn September 26, 2016, Ron Perlman stated on Twitter that he was working on a new \"Hellboy\" film, but that del Toro was unlikely to return. On February 21, 2017, del Toro announced on Twitter that the third \"Hellboy\" movie had been scrapped. A reboot will be released in 2019 with no involvent from Del Toro.\n\nOn December 1, 2008, del Toro expressed interest in making a stop-motion film remake of Roald Dahl's novel \"The Witches\" with fellow director Alfonso Cuarón. However, there have been no updates on the project since 2008, and it seems the production has been cancelled.\n\nOn June 1, 2010, MTV News reported that del Toro was set to direct a film adaptation of \"Drood,\" a novel by Dan Simmons, for Universal Pictures. However, the project fell into development hell and del Toro abandoned it.\n\nOn June 10, 2010, del Toro stated that he was working on an untitled film about Van Helsing, but there have been no updates on the film since 2010.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, del Toro announced that he would direct a film adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's \"At the Mountains of Madness\" for Universal Pictures, with Canadian film director James Cameron as producer. The movie was originally set up as a DreamWorks project in 2004, but was later cancelled. Cameron suggested casting Tom Cruise in the lead role and releasing the film in 3-D.\n\nIn June 2010, del Toro said that the adaptation probably would not happen at all. He stated, \"It doesn't look like I can do it. It's very difficult for the studios to take the step of doing a period-set, R-rated, tentpole movie with a tough ending and no love story. Lovecraft has a readership as big as any best-seller, but it's tough to quantify because his works are in the public domain.\" Cameron and Del Toro put forward the idea to Universal, who greenlit it. Earlier that same year, del Toro had also asked S. T. Joshi if he wanted to be a consultant once the movie got into production. However, due to many delays, Cameron and del Toro left the project after del Toro realized that the film would have been very similar to Ridley Scott's 2012 film \"Prometheus\".\n\nIt was announced on July 22, 2010 at San Diego Comic-Con International that a new film based on Disney's \"The Haunted Mansion\" was in development with Guillermo del Toro writing and producing. Del Toro saw the 2003 film with his daughters; when asked about his involvement in the new project, he said, \"The thing I want to do is remake it.\" Elaborating, he commented, \"The movie I see in my head of \"Haunted Mansion\" is not, I believe, what everyone is imagining it to be. It's not just a regular world with a haunted mansion plopped in the middle. I really am thinking of a movie that has a heightened reality.\" Del Toro said that Hatbox Ghost would be the main haunting and added, \"We are not making it a comedy. We are making it scary and fun at the same time, but the scary will be scary.\" It is to be filmed in live-action 3D. To help make a respectful adaptation, del Toro has contacted Walt Disney World Imagineer Jason Surrell, author of \"The Haunted Mansion: From the Magic Kingdom to the Movies\", to act as a possible consultant for the film. Del Toro has also announced he is aiming for a PG-13 rating for \"The Haunted Mansion\". On August 7, 2012, Del Toro mentioned in an interview with Collider that he had submitted his final draft to Disney, and that \"they like the screenplay\" because \"their reaction to the draft was good\". Del Toro revealed that he will co-write the film, but will not direct it. On April 9, 2015, Variety reported that Ryan Gosling is in talks to star in the film and D.V. DeVincentis will work on the film's script.\n\nOn December 11, 2010, at the Spike Video Game Awards, del Toro reported that he was working on a video game entitled \"Insane\", planned for release in 2013. Two days later, he revealed that the game was to be the first entry of an \"Insane\" video game trilogy. On March 11, 2011, Fanboy Confidential reported that Guy Davis, who previously worked on del Toro's unmade adaptation of \"At the Mountains of Madness\", was working as key designer. However, on August 16, 2012, IGN reported that the video game was cancelled by the publisher THQ. Despite this, three months later del Toro stated that the game could still happen.\n\nOn July 18, 2011, TheFilmStage reported that del Toro was developing a live-action film of the classic fairy tale and Disney film \"Beauty and the Beast\", with Emma Watson to star as Belle and Denise Di Novi to co-produce. However, del Toro's adaptation never materialized, though Watson did play the role of Belle in The Walt Disney Company's 2017 live-action remake.\n\nOn December 21, 2011, ComingSoon.net stated that del Toro was being considered, but refused, to direct a new \"Godzilla.\" The film was finally released in 2014, directed by Gareth Edwards.\n\nOn April 27, 2012, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that del Toro was working on a biopic about serial killers The Bloody Benders. However, the project was likely abandoned due to del Toro's commitment to other projects.\n\nAround 2012, del Toro was in talks with Marvel Studios to make a TV series titled \"The Hulk\" as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The series was intended to be aired on ABC. However, after Mark Ruffalo's acclaimed performance as the Incredible Hulk in \"The Avengers\", the project was put on hold, and entered development hell.\n\nAround 2012, del Toro entered negotiations with 20th Century Fox to direct \"The Wolverine\". He met with producer Jim Gianopulos and actor Hugh Jackman to talk about the film's development. However, del Toro left the project to direct \"Pacific Rim\". The film was finally released in 2013, directed by James Mangold.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, del Toro confirmed his involvement in a live-action film adaptation of the \"Justice League Dark\" comic series. While Warner Bros. was considering greenlighting the film's production, and reviewing the script, del Toro revealed that the working title was \"Dark Universe\" and that the film would feature appearances by John Constantine, Swamp Thing, The Spectre, Deadman and others. Del Toro later expressed interest in casting Matt Ryan as John Constantine, saying that the \"Constantine\" TV series could coexist with the DC Extended Universe, because he felt that it could work well, but when the series was not renewed for a second season due to poor ratings, del Toro scrapped the idea. In December 2014, one month after Warner Bros. reviewed his script, del Toro confirmed that the film would be part of the DC Extended Universe. In October 2015, it was officially reported that del Toro had left the project.\n\nOn August 12, 2014, Hero complex reported that del Toro was working with game director Hideo Kojima on the PlayStation 4 video game \"Silent Hills\", the ninth installment in the \"Silent Hill\" video game series. However, on April 26, 2015, del Toro stated via IGN that he was no longer working with Kojima on \"Silent Hills\" and that the project had been cancelled. Then, on July 24, del Toro stated via his Twitter account that he and Kojima were still working on a new untitled project. In an interview with Shacknews, del Toro said that he would never again get involved in video games after his past experiences. I have proven to be the albatross of video games. I joined THQ, and THQ goes broke. I join Kojima, and Kojima leaves Konami, because \"\". I have decided, in order not to destroy anyone else’s life, I have decided I will never again get involved in video games. Otherwise, I’ll join someone and his house will explode, or something.\n\nOn January 7, 2016, it was revealed that del Toro is attached to direct a remake of Richard Fleischer's \"Fantastic Voyage\" for 20th Century Fox, along with the announcement that David S. Goyer and Justin Rhodes will be the writers and James Cameron will produce the film with his production company Lightstorm Entertainment. In August 2017, it was reported that del Toro had postponed working on the film to completely focus on his film \"The Shape of Water\".\n"}

The film, a melodrama, follows the life and travails of a young woman who lives through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and as such is an example of the \"scar drama\" genre that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s that detailed life during that period. The film was produced by the Shanghai Film Studio.\n\nThe film won Best Film for 1987 Golden Rooster Awards and Hundred Flowers Awards, as well as Best Actress awards for Liu Xiaoqing at both ceremonies. It was also selected as the Chinese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 60th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\nThe village in Hunan province where the film was made, was initially known as Wang Village (; pinyin: \"Wáng cūn\"). In 2007, the village was renamed Furong zhen () owing to this film.\n\n\nThe film follows Hu Yuyin (Liu Xiaoqing), a young and hardworking woman in a small Chinese town on the eve of the Cultural Revolution. She is happily married and runs a successful roadside food stall selling spicy beancurd. Yuyin is supported by Party members Li Mangeng (Zhang Guangbei), who once wanted to marry her, and Director Gu (Zheng Zaishi), a war veteran in charge of the granary. But in 1964 the Four Cleanups Movement sends a Party work-team to root out Rightists and capitalist roaders. The team is led by Li Guoxiang (Xu Songzi), a single woman, assisted by Wang Qiushe (Zhu Shibin), a former poor peasant who has lost his land because of his drinking. At a public struggle session, Yuyin is declared to be a \"new rich peasant.\" Both her home and business are taken from her and her husband, Li Guigui (Liu Linian) is executed for trying to kill Li Guoxiang.\n\nAfter the first waves of the Revolution have ended, Yuyin, now relegated to a lowly street sweeper, returns to the town. She then falls in love with Qin Shutian (Jiang Wen), who had come in the 1950s to collect local folksongs but was declared to be one of the Five Black Categories. When Yuyin becomes pregnant, however, this loving relationship attracts the outrage of Li Guoxiang and Wang Qiushe, who themselves are having a secret affair. Shutian is sent to reform through labor and it is not until Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978 that his case is reviewed and he is allowed to return and help Yuyin re-establish their food stall. At the end of the film, Li Guoxiang continues to hold a position in the bureaucracy while Wang Qiushe loses his mind.\n\nThe film was very well received domestically and was voted by Chinese film audiences as one of the three best films of 1987. It remains however quite obscure outside China.\n\nGilbert Adair of \"Time Out\" magazine gave the film his endorsement, calling it \"a potent blend of the political and personal\":\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec in Quebec City.\n\nThe picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time. It features a number of Patriote leaders, upon the stage at the right, with accurate appearance. Patriote leader Louis-Joseph Papineau is shown in a speech to the crowd. At the bottom right stand three flags. From the left, the first represents the influence the Patriotes received from the French Revolution, the second is the Patriote flag and the third embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the American Revolution. The Patriote flag remains a visual leitmotiv across the composition.\n\nThe right field profusely displays maple leaves, a symbol of the French Canadians of the time (they have now been discarded by their modern-day Québécois and Quebec nationalist successors because of their appropriation by the Canadian federation). In the same section is the Coat of arms of Quebec, leaning upon the wooden stage structure (one anachronistic detail, as this version, contemporary to the painting's execution, is the first arms of Quebec post-Confederation, granted in 1868).\n\nThe crowd, mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineau's much celebrated oratory skills, holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans. Many in attendance wear the tuques and ceintures fléchées belts characteristic of the Patriote symbology. The Colonne de la liberté stands tall in the background (the one from Henri Julien's and the contemporary replica appear much shorter). Finally, a very young girl at the immediate left-of-the-middle evocatively stares at the spectator.\n\nSmith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the Parliament of Quebec City. However, the government of Premier of Quebec Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville did not accept it, and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec collection.\n\nLocated in Room 10, it is a part of the permanent exhibition of Quebec history-related art called \"Je me souviens : Quand l’art imagine l’histoire\" (\"Je me souviens [motto of Quebec]. When Art Imagines History\"). The picture has seen restoration. Nowadays, a great number of books related to the Patriotes, or their era in Quebec, use the painting, often cropped, to illustrate their cover page.\n\nIn a similar fashion, initial plans to erect a statue in honour of Louis-Joseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the then-controversial aspect of what was seen as a revolutionary figure. A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s.\n\nThe Assembly of the Six Counties gathered Patriote leaders and approximately 4,000 followers in Saint-Charles, Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) on October 23 and October 24, 1837. Presided by Wolfred Nelson, it is the most famous of the various popular assemblies held during that year protesting the Russell Resolutions. It was a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic. Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government, but, as one part supported economic boycotts of British products, the other appealed to an armed uprising.\n\n\n\n"}

Tina's boyfriend Rod tells Nancy that he saw four \"invisible\" razors cutting her at the same time, a revelation which convinces her that the man from her dreams is connected to the murder. Nancy begins relying on caffeine to stay awake, and eventually discovers that she can pull things out of her dream after she takes the killer's hat, labelled \"Fred Krueger\". Her mother explains that Krueger was a child killer who was burned to death by vengeful parents after being freed from prison on a technicality. Nancy becomes convinced that he is exacting his revenge on the children of his killers from beyond the grave. Being tormented by Krueger every time she fall asleep causes a tremendous stress to Nancy that her hair went prematurely grey. With all of her friends dead, Nancy forms a plan to face Krueger alone and pull him into the real world, where he falls victim to a series of booby traps she has set up. Nancy finally defeats Krueger by taking back the energy she has given him and stripping away his power.\n\nAlthough Nancy does not appear in \"\", she maintains a presence when a new family moves into the house where she battled Freddy Krueger. Teenager Jesse Walsh, who inhabits Nancy's old room, and his girlfriend Lisa discover Nancy's old diary—which chronicles the events of the first film. It tells them of the murders of Nancy's friends, and also reveals Krueger's strengths and weaknesses. This helps Jesse and Lisa conquer Freddy in their own struggle with him.\n\nIn \"\", at age 22, Nancy is re-introduced as the new intern at Westin Hills Mental Institution, where she meets the last surviving children of the parents who killed Freddy Krueger. When she realizes the children are falling victim to Freddy, Nancy begs that they be prescribed Hypnocil, an experimental drug, which she has been using to suppress her dreams, in an effort to protect the teenagers from Freddy. In a therapy session, Nancy uses hypnosis to put everybody to sleep and teach them how to use their \"dream powers\" to their advantage. However, she and Dr Neil Gordon are fired when Hypnocil is blamed for a patient falling into a coma. Neil and Nancy learn that in order to defeat Freddy they must lay his bones to rest; Nancy contacts her father, Donald Thompson, to find out what the town's parents did with Freddy's remains. As Neil and Donald go to bury Freddy's bones, Nancy returns to Westin Hills and rejoins the patients in the dream world, where they use their dream powers against Freddy.

Over the course of the film, Heather learns from Wes Craven that the entity was locked in Freddy Krueger's character throughout the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" film series. With the film series being ended after \"\" the entity has been set free, and wants to cross over into the real world in the form of Freddy Krueger. It views Heather as an enemy, seeing her as Nancy, who originally defeated him. In times, like Nancy, Heather's hair also went prematurely grey under the stress by Krueger's attacks. In order to battle the entity, who has kidnapped her son Dylan, Heather enters the dream world, where she traps him in a furnace and seemingly destroys him. However, it is referred by Krueger's creator that the entity is imprisoned to the film franchise's make-believe world once more. \n\nThough she only appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in \"Freddy vs. Jason\", she maintains somewhat of a presence: her former home is now occupied by Lori Campbell.\n\nNancy appears in the documentary film \"The Nightmare\" (2015).\n\nIn the 2010 remake, Nancy's last name is changed to \"Holbrook\", portrayed by Rooney Mara. In this film, she is portrayed as a socially unavailable outcast who loves art. Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner), another high school outcast, crushes on her, and tries hard constantly to hit on her, but ends up failing. However, she does take partnership with him as they try to investigate the deaths of their three friends: Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy), and Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), all of which died in their sleep, and both claiming to see a man matching the same description: a burnt face. When they discover that both she, Quentin, Kris, Jesse, and Dean all went to preschool together when they were little, they don't understand, seeing how they didn't know each other until high school. When Nancy's mother Gwen (Connie Britton) catches the both of them, she finally admits that as children, they and all the kids in the preschool were molested by a man named Fred Krueger, the school gardener who resided in the preschool's basement. She claims that Freddy fled the area before they could turn him in, and that their dreams of Freddy are just repressed memories. However, when Quentin learns the truth through one of Freddy's dreams when he falls asleep in swim class, they both confront Quentin's father Alan (Clancy Brown) for killing Freddy when the parents had chased him down, and Alan through a fire-lit gasoline gallon into a shed where Freddy hid, despite not there being any evidence that he was molesting them. Alan admits regret for his actions, but also defends them, saying they were only trying to protect them. Quentin storms out in anger, as a guilt-stricken Alan instructs Nancy to never reveal to anyone who Freddy was. Still unable to understand, Nancy and Quentin decide to go to the preschool to find answers, and when they arrive, it is revealed that Freddy was in fact molesting the children when they discover pictures of Nancy as a child (though never shown only implied). With their memories back, they realize that Freddy isn't after them because they lied about him, but because they told the truth about him. When Nancy sees a piece of Freddy's sweater she pulled out from a dream sequence before, she realizes that Freddy needs to be pulled into the real world to be defeated. When she does, she defeats Freddy by slicing off his clawed hand with a broken paper cutter blade, and finishes the job by slicing his throat. They burn down the preschool with Freddy's corpse inside, and she and Quentin escape, with Quentin hospitalized. Nancy also reciprocates Quentin's feelings for her. Nancy returns home, and thanks her mother for trying to protect her, but Freddy appears in a mirror behind Gwen. He kills her, and drags her body into the mirror, with Nancy screaming.\n\nNancy's spirit appears in the story \"Asleep at the Wheel\" from the 1991 short stories collection \"The Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger's Seven Sweetest Dreams\", appearing in the dreams of the character Ian to warn him that Freddy is real and not just an urban legend or the result of mass hysteria.\n\nNancy returned in \"Nightmares on Elm Street\", a canonical six-issue comic book series published by Innovation Comics from 1991 to 1992. In the story, Nancy teams up with several other characters from the film series, including Neil Gordon, Jacob Johnson and Alice Johnson, to fight Freddy in his nightmare world. The events of this series were meant to fill in the time period between the \"\" and \"\" films. The series was written by Andy Mangels. The first two issues of the story explain to the readers about Nancy's life in between parts one and three. After the events of part one, Nancy had been sent to an institution by her father until she was \"rational\" again. Around the time she was in college after she was released, her father sold 1428 Elm Street to the Walsh family in \"\". In college, she studied psychology and sleep disorders, and made two friends in her roommates Cybil Houch and Priscilla Martin. After Nancy was fatally wounded by Freddy at the end of part three, Kristen had dreamed her soul into the Beautiful Dream, the good side of the dream world, where Nancy now acts as its agent as Freddy acts as an agent for the nightmare realm. In the story, Freddy begins targeting Cybil and Priscilla in an attempt to get to Nancy. He actually succeeds in killing Priscilla and Cybil's husband, James, before Nancy rescues Cybil. She is then reunited with Neil Gordon and the three of them realize that it might be impossible to fully destroy Freddy since he is pure evil, but it is possible to weaken him. Freddy is stopped and weakened by the dream-selves of unborn children, such as Cybil's unborn daughter, in a realm in the Beautiful Dream. The next four issues, titled \"Loose Ends\", deals with the characters from previous \"Nightmare\" movies teaming up to defeat Freddy again. Here, Nancy is reunited with the soul of her father, who Freddy uses to try to kill her but is unsuccessful. Nancy defeats Freddy and manages to stop his plan of using Jacob Johnson to break into the real world with help from Neil Gordon and Devonne, a psychotic former accomplice of Freddy's.\n\nNancy makes an appearance in the final issue of the crossover comic series \"\". In a battle against Freddy Krueger, Dream Master Jacob Johnson summons the spirits of Freddy's past victims, including Amanda Krueger and the Dream Warriors. Nancy also appears, reuniting with Neil Gordon to help him read the \"Necronomicon\"s' passages needed to banish Freddy. With Freddy defeated, Nancy leaves Neil and returns to the afterlife with the other spirits.\n\nIn her debut game appearance, Nancy is a playable character in the 1989 \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" video game. Released by Monarch Software and Westwood Associates, Nancy and the Dream Warriors are on a quest to stop Freddy Krueger. As each character has a dream power, Nancy has the ability to freeze enemies. Although not playable, Nancy makes a cameo appearance in Freddy's ending in \"Mortal Kombat\" (2011). Nancy is mentioned in Quentin Smith's biography in \"Dead by Daylight\": \nNancy was originally meant to be a playable survivor but the developers couldn't obtain the rights to the character.\n\nNancy Thompson is the only character featured in several \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" merchandise. Kristen Parker is only featured in Screen Grabs: A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (a diorama released by Mezco Toys in 2007). Debbie, in mid-transformation as a cockroach, is featured as a Cinema of Fear 4 action figure (released by Mezco Toys in 2009).\n\nIn 2008, Mezco Toyz Cinema of Fear Series 2 released a Nancy Thompson action figure—which recreates the famous bathtub scene in the original film. Within the same year, the Mezco Toyz Cinema of Fear Series 2 also released the diorama Screen Grabs: A Nightmare on Elm Street. The diorama recreates the bedroom scene in which Freddy creeps along the wall above a sleeping Nancy. McFarlane Pop Culture Masterworks released an \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3-D\" poster, with Nancy featured prominently as the central figure. In 2002, NECA released an A Nightmare on Elm Street Snowglobe. The female within the globe resembles Nancy, with a stalking Freddy Krueger forming the globe's outside base. However, the product information never confirms if it is actually the character. In 2004, NECA also released a lunchbox and thermos set with the poster image from A Nightmare on Elm Street.\n\nSince May 2011, there has been an online petition for manufacturers to create a Nancy Thompson doll.\n\nAlthough not considered a part of the official film canon, Nancy Thompson has appeared in various fan films:\n\nIn Wes Craven's original script for \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", Nancy Thompson was initially named Nancy Wilson. In the scene in which Tina, Nancy, and Glen are at Tina's house, Nancy describes a dream in which Freddy Krueger leered at her obscenely. Soon afterwards, when conversing with Glen, Nancy shows an earlier interest (at least when compared to the actual film) into why her and Tina dreamed of the same individual. While Nancy's character differs little than the actual film, the original script has scenes that emphasize her headstrong nature.\n\nThe biggest change was in the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\" script. Nancy was closer to her personality in the first film. She was not a dream researcher, nor did she have the mature and calm demeanor portrayed in the actual film. Instead, Nancy was brazen and street smart—at times heading straight into a potentially dangerous situation. Nancy's stubbornness was evident in that she had traveled through five states in search of her missing father, Donald Thompson (named \"John\" in the script). When first attacked by Freddy Krueger, Nancy tried to physically fend him off with her bare hands—despite being shocked from dreaming again after a five-year time period. This contrasts with the actual film, in which she used a broken mirror shard to injure Freddy. While Nancy cared about the Westin Hill patients, the age disparity between her and the teenagers was not as emphasized. In fact, some of the teenaged patients and hospital workers initially mistake Nancy for a patient. Thus, Nancy was not written as acting maternal. Instead, Nancy acts more like a big sister to the patients. There are instances in which Nancy fights back against the medical authorities, dismissing Dr. Neil Gordon's (named Neil Guinness in the original script) insistence that she has Delayed Stress Syndrome. As with the first movie, Nancy dismisses any attacks on her sanity—as she knows that Freddy Krueger is real.\n\nWith regard to \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\", Heather Langenkamp stated her viewpoints about Nancy Thompson's characterization:\n\nIn his book \"Horror films of the 1980s\", John Kenneth Muir references Nancy Thompson, stating the following:\n\nIn his book \"Horror Movie Freak\", Don Sumner (2010) also notes how Nancy was a different \"final girl\" despite following the rules of avoiding sex, drugs, and juvenile behavior. He mentions that \"the stereotypes of the victimized female screaming in terror and hiding in the closet do not apply to Nancy as she sets out to trap Freddy and attack him with all of the vigor of a killer herself. Her active role and anti-victim posture broke the mold of the horror heroine...\" In her book \"Visions of the Night: Dreams, Religion, and Psychology\", Kelly Bulkeley compares Nancy Thompson to Dorothy Gale in \"Wizard of Oz\" in that \"Nancy ultimately finds in her dreams the deep resources of personal strength to overcome an evil that the adult social world had failed to defeat.\" Nancy's death in \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors\" is even given some interpretation. In her book \"Phallic Panic: Film, Horror and the Primal Uncanny\", Barbara Creed notes that as \"Nancy embraces her father's/Freddy's body and tells him that she has always loved him she is torn apart by his finger-blades. The point is that it is dangerous for children to want the love of their parents--disappointment, even death, is the final result.\"\n\nThe documentary \"The Making of Nightmare on Elm Street\" features a segment concerning the casting of Heather Langenkamp as Nancy Thompson. According to Sara Risher, Langenkamp was chosen because Wes Craven wanted a \"young girl who was smart-looking, obviously pretty, vulnerable, but clearly had a good head on her shoulders.\" Langenkamp herself said that she identified with Nancy Thompson the most, stating that Nancy \"had a great sense that she could solve problems without anybody's help at all. I try to be like her, actually.\" In the same documentary, Langenkamp also characterizes Nancy as the \"good girl\" whereas the Tina Gray character is contrasted as giving the feeling that \"she wasn't going to make it.\"\n\nIn her documentary \"I Am Nancy\", Heather Langenkamp laments how Freddy Krueger became an iconic character while Nancy Thompson disappeared into the background. To explore why this phenomenon occurred, Langenkamp visits six horror conventions, and tries to discern why the villain became the celebrated figure. After interviewing several attendees, Langenkamp learns that while Nancy Thompson's impact on fans is subtle, she still represents strength and intelligence in the hearts and minds of many. For the advertising campaign, campaign buttons were given out that displayed \"I am Nancy\". A Facebook page allowed Nancy fans to share their artwork, photographs, and sentiments about the character. The film won a Best Editing Award at the Amsterdam Film Festival. In addition to interviewing Nancy fans, the documentary also features interviews with Wes Craven, Robert Englund and Jessica Craven (Wes Craven's daughter). Langenkamp learned from Craven that:\n\nWhen developing her documentary, Langenkamp also learned that Nancy Thompson is considered a gay icon. Although Nancy Thompson is heterosexual, Langenkamp shared her theories of why gay and lesbian audience members would be drawn to the character:\n\n"}

{"id": "12126172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12126172", "title": "Palatability", "text": "Palatability\n\nPalatability is the hedonic reward (i.e., pleasure) provided by foods or fluids that are agreeable to the \"palate\", which often varies relative to the homeostatic satisfaction of nutritional, water, or energy needs. The palatability of a food or fluid, unlike its flavor or taste, varies with the state of an individual: it is lower after consumption and higher when deprived. It has increasingly been appreciated that this can create a hunger that is independent of homeostatic needs.\n\nThe palatability of a substance is determined by opioid receptor-related processes in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. The opioid processes involve mu opioid receptors and are present in the rostromedial shell part of the nucleus accumbens on its spiny neurons. This area has been called the \"opioid eating site\".\n\nThe rewardfulness of consumption associated with palatability is dissociable from desire or incentive value which is the motivation to seek out a specific commodity. Desire or incentive value is processed by opioid receptor-related processes in the basolateral amygdala. Unlike the liking palatability for food, the incentive salience wanting is not downregulated by the physiological consequences of food consumption and may be largely independent of homoeostatic processes influencing food intake.\n\nThough the wanting of incentive salience may be informed by palatability it is independent and not necessarily reduced to it. It has been suggested that a third system exists that links opioid processes in the two parts of the brain: \"Logically this raises the possibility that a third system, with which the accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, and basolateral amygdala are associated, distributes the affective signals elicited by specific commodities across distinct functional systems to control reward seeking... At present we do not have any direct evidence for a system of this kind, but indirect evidence suggests it may reside within the motivationally rich circuits linking hypothalamic and brainstem viscerogenic structures such as the parabrachial nucleus.\n\nIt has also been suggested that \"hedonic hunger\" can be driven both in regard to “wanting” and “liking” and that a palatability subtype of neuron may also exist in the basolateral amygdala.\n\nAppetite is controlled by a direct loop and an indirect one. In both the direct and indirect loops there are two feedback mechanisms. First a positive feedback involving its stimulation by palatability food cues, and second, a negative feedback due to satiation and satiety cues following ingestion. In the indirect loop these cues are learnt by association such as meal plate size and work by modulating the potency of the cues of the direct loop. The influence of these processes can exist without subjective awareness. \n\nThe cessation of a desire to eat after a meal \"satiation\" is likely to be due to different processes and cues. More palatable foods reduce the effects of such cues upon satiation causing a larger food intake. In contrast, unpalatability of certain foods can serve as a deterrent from feeding on those foods in the future. For example, the Variable Checkerspot butterfly contains iridoid compounds that are unpalatable to avian predators, thus reducing the risk of predation.\n\n\n"}

It is also known as the Latin series as it formed one half of Migne's Patrologiae Cursus Completus, the other part being the \"Patrologia Graeco-Latina\" of patristic and medieval Greek works with their (sometimes non-matching) medieval Latin translations.\n\nAlthough consisting of reprints of old editions, which often contain mistakes and do not comply with modern standards of scholarship, the series, due to its availability (it is present in many academic libraries) and the fact that it incorporates many texts of which no modern critical edition is available, is still widely used by scholars of the Middle Ages and is in this respect comparable to the \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\".\n\nThe \"Patrologia Latina\" includes Latin works spanning a millennium, from Tertullian (d. 230) to Pope Innocent III (d. 1216), edited in roughly chronological order in 217 volumes; \nvolumes 1 to 73, from Tertullian to Gregory of Tours, were published from 1841 to 1849, and volumes 74 to 217, from Pope Gregory I to Innocent III, from 1849 to 1855. \nAlthough the collection ends with Innocent III,\nMigne originally wanted to include documents all the way up to the Reformation; this task proved too great, but some later commentaries or documents associated with earlier works were included.\n\nMost of the works are ecclesiastic in nature, but there are also documents of literary, historical or linguistic (such as the Gothic bible in vol. 18) interest.\n\nThe printing plates for the \"Patrologia\" were destroyed by fire in 1868, but with help from the Garnier printing house they were restored and new editions were printed, beginning in the 1880s. These reprints did not always correspond exactly with the original series either in quality or internal arrangement, and caution should be exercised when referencing to the \"PL\" in general.\n\nThe \"Patrologia Latina\" contains authors of the 2nd to 13th centuries, in roughly chronological order, in 217 volumes:\n2nd–4th c.: 1–19;\n4th–5th c.: 20–63;\n5th–6th c.: 64–72;\n6th–7th c.: 74–88;\n7th–8th c.: 89–96;\n8th–9th c.: 97–130;\n9th/10th c.: 131–136;\n10th/11th c.: 137–149;\n11th/12th c.: 151–174;\n12th c.: 175–205;\n12th/13th c.: 206–217.\n\n\n\n"}

An important feature of the rah stereotype is the enjoyment of an affluent/party lifestyle with excessive financial assistance from their parents.\n\nThe term is possibly an onomatopoeic reference to how those fitting the stereotype are perceived to talk, with the word 'rah' being associated with upper-middle class affluence since at least the early 1980s.\n\nRahs stereotypically study at prestigious institutions such as Russell Group universities, having previously attended a private boarding or day school, or sometimes a grammar school or faith school in an affluent area.

She soon switched to writing feature films and is best known for her work on the films \"Don't Change Your Husband\" and \"Why Change Your Wife?\". Cowan worked closely with director Cecil B. DeMille throughout her career.\n\nSada Louise Cowan was born on September 8, 1882 in Boston, Massachusetts. She attended a private boarding school in the Boston area. However, as a teenager Cowan moved to Germany to study music. After finding that writing music was not fulfilling enough for her she switched to writing plays. In Frankfurt, Germany she wrote her first hit play from start to finish in two hours titled, \"Sintram of Skagerrak\". Cowan's inspiration for writing this play was hearing Frederick Lamond’s piano recital of Chopin. She started to write plays that got her name on the map. These were titled \"The State Forbids\", \"In the Morgue\", \"Playing the Game\", \"The Moonlit Way\", \"The Wonder of the Age\", \"The Honor of America\" and \"Pomp,\" respectively.\n\nAfter success writing plays, Cowan switched over to writing full length silent films. In 1919, at thirty-six years old, her first film, “The Woman Under Cover”, starring Fritzi Brunette, was completed. The film was described by the \"Exhibitors Herald\" as heavily dramatic but with frequent and smartly placed bits of humor dispersed within it. This successful film led to Cowan’s writing of numerous others, in which she worked with directors such as Harry Garson and Cecil B. DeMille. Some of Cowan’s most popular films include \"The Reckless Lady\" and \"The Charmer\".\n\n\"Why Change Your Wife?\", directed by Cecil B. DeMille, was one of Cowan’s most successful films. This film blazed a trail of “light and merry” films to follow it and included the wealth, clothing, and romance for which the 1920s are remembered. The film starred Gloria Swanson and Bebe Daniels and depicted the story of a man’s marriage trials and tribulations between his first and second wives. The film cost $130,000 to produce and made $1,000,000. This was Cowan’s first film that she wrote under director Cecil B. Demille. At the time she was making only $25 a week, which was eventually raised to $60 per week. At first, DeMille dismissed her as a “failed writer” and believed her to be not capable of success. However after the success of this film, and the many others she worked on with DeMille, she became one of his top writers and highest-paid staff members.\n\nThe majority of Cowan’s films revolve around the themes of marriage, divorce, love and infidelity. Cowan was a pioneer for women’s writers in film. She was joined in her time by two other prominent women writers in the industry, Frances Marion and June Mathis. Cowan was one of the first American writers to travel abroad to Europe and work with foreign directors. She has written and received writing credit on numerous famous films from the 1920s and '30s.\n\nCowan was married two times, with both marriages resulting in divorce. Her first marriage was to Frederick James Pitt. In 1929, Cowan remarried to Dr. Ernest L. Commons. After her second marriage, Cowan’s whereabouts were relatively unknown, with many speculating she was traveling around Europe or the Orient. However, in 1932 that she came back into the picture of American writers.\n\nCowan died on July 31, 1943, at the age of 60, in Los Angeles. The final film that she wrote, titled \"Samson and Delilah\" was released in 1950, seven years after her passing.\n"}

{"id": "10357796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10357796", "title": "Star lore", "text": "Star lore\n\nStar lore or starlore is the creating and cherishing of mythical stories about the stars and star patterns (constellations and asterisms); that is, folklore based upon the stars and star patterns. Using the stars to explain religious doctrines or actual events in history is also defined as star lore. Star lore has a very long history; it has been practiced by nearly every culture recorded in history, dating as far back as 5,500 years ago. It was practiced by prehistoric cultures of the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods as well.\n\nOne example of star lore is the inventing of the story of Orion the Hunter and the Scorpius the Scorpion by the ancient Greeks. This ancient culture saw a very startling pattern of bright stars in the winter sky that, from their point of view, resembled a mighty hunter, which they named Orion. During the summer, they saw another startling pattern of bright stars that resembled a scorpion. They noticed that the constellations of Orion and the scorpion were positioned at opposite ends of the sky and were never seen in the sky simultaneously. As one constellation rose above the eastern horizon, the other was setting below the western horizon, and when either one was high in the sky, the other was completely absent. The ancient Greeks felt compelled to explain this phenomenon by composing a story or myth based on the two constellations.\n\nThe story was that Orion was a mighty and proud hunter who was stung by a scorpion. Orion died of the scorpion's sting and was placed among the stars by the gods. Although the scorpion was destroyed by the gods in vengeance for killing Orion, it was also placed among the stars. In order to prevent Orion and the scorpion from quarreling and fighting with each other in the sky, the gods placed Orion and the scorpion at opposite ends of the sky, and in opposite seasons, so that both of them can never be seen in the sky at the same time.\n\nAnother example of star lore is the story behind the constellation Andromeda, also known at \"the chained woman\". Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Ethiopia, King Cepheus and Cassiopeia. The story goes that because Cassiopeia bragged so much of Andromeda's beauty to the Nereids, daughters of Poseidon, that they complained to their father, who sent a sea monster to destroy the coast of Ethiopia. Cepheus consulted an oracle for assistance and learned that the only way to save his lands was to sacrifice his daughter to Poseidon's monster.\n\nAndromeda was chained to a rock and left for the sea monster. Perseus, the hero of the story who had just killed the Gorgon Medusa found Andromeda in her distress and immediately, the two fell in love. Perseus asked for her name and refused to leave until he knew it, talking to her until she gave in. Andromeda told him her name, her country, and the reason for her imprisonment on the rock. He then consulted with Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and they decided that if Perseus rescued Andromeda from the sea monster, he could marry her. The story of how he then defeats the monster varies. Ovid describes his killing of the monster as a drawn out bloody battle. Other sources say that Perseus killed the sea monster with the aid of Medusa's head, turning the monster to stone. Andromeda and Perseus were married soon after, despite already being promise to her uncle, Phineus. At the wedding, Phineus and Perseus got into an altercation, and Perseus turned Phineus to stone using Medusa's head.\n\nThe constellation is said to have astrological influences as well. It is said that any man born at the same time Andromeda is said to rise from the sea will be one without mercy; he will be emotionally unmoved even in the presence of grieving parents. The constellation also influences the birth of the executioner, a man who will kill swiftly for money and kill willingly. Sources describe men born with the rise of Andromeda as one who would feel nothing if faced with Andromeda chained to her rock, just as Perseus did and fell in love with the girl.\n\nThe Draco is another example of star lore. In Roman mythology, the constellation is representative of Ladon, the dragon that guarded the golden apples inside the garden, Hesperides. The tree was a wedding gift to Hera when she and Zeus were married, and she planted it on Mount Atlas. Hera tasked the Hesperides to guard the tree and put Ladon around the tree as well to ensure that the Hesperides would not steal the apples. In some sources, Ladon is called the child of Typhon and Echidna, who was half woman and half viper, and had hundreds of heads. In other versions of Ladon's story, the number of heads he had is not at all mentioned and he is described as the offspring of Ceto and Phorcys, two sea deities.\n\nContrastingly, in Roman mythology, Draco was one of the Titans who waged war on the Olympic gods for ten years. He was killed by Minerva in the battle and thrown into the sky.\n\n\n"}

The symmetrical composition depicts Homer being crowned by a winged figure personifying Victory or the Universe. Forty-four additional figures pay homage to the poet in a kind of classical confession of faith. \n\nA state commission to decorate a ceiling of the musée Charles X at the Louvre (now the ancient Egyptian galleries), it formed part of a renovation project commissioned by Charles X to have himself remembered in the grand tradition of Bourbon building works at the Louvre. A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time. Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly—it was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition. The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he can be seen making the composition and the details more and more precise. Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of Nicolas Poussin, which is directly copied from Poussin's now in the Louvre. \n\nThe composition is a symmetrical grouping centred in a classical way in front of an ancient Greek temple. The painting's catalogue entry at the time of its first exhibition describes it as \"Homer receiving homage from all the great men of Greece, Rome and modern times. The Universe crowns him, Herodotus burns incense. The Iliad and Odyssey sit at his feet.\"\nThe final painting's colours are very fresh and clear, giving the impression of fresco. Ingres wished to compete with Raphael through this painting (it is strongly inspired by the Italian artist's \"Parnassus\") and Raphael is to be seen top left (in black and white Renaissance dress), being led by Apelles (in a blue cloak). Other figures shown include Dante who is shown being led by Virgil as in the former's \"Divine Comedy\" (extreme left, behind Poussin) and Molière (right, by the feet of the personification of the \"Odyssey\").\n\nThe art historian Robert Rosenblum said \"The Apotheosis of Homer\" represents \"Ingres' most doctrinaire statement of his belief in a hierarchy of timeless values that are based on classical precedent.\" It is highly successful in its genre, though leaves an impression of coldness, an impression which was reinforced at the time of its production by the exhibition of Delacroix's \"The Death of Sardanapalus\" at the same year's Paris Salon. Ingres had been considered revolutionary early in his career, but this contrast now faced off a Romantic renewal under Delacroix against the purest classical tradition as shown by Ingres. \"The Apotheosis of Homer\" was taken down from its initial site in 1855 and replaced later that year with a copy by Paul and Raymond Balze (in collaboration with Michel Dumas).\n\nSurrounding Homer are poets, artists, and philosophers both ancient and modern—the modern personages are mostly confined to the lower register of the composition, although Ingres deemed Raphael and Michelangelo worthy of elevation to stand alongside the ancients. The figures are:\n\nIngres revisited the subject in several later works, including an undated watercolour (Lille, Musée des Beaux-Arts) and paintings such as \"Homer and His Guide\" (1861; Brussels, Royal Collection) and \"The Odyssey\" (Lyon, Musée des Beaux-Arts). In 1854 be began work on a drawing of the composition to be used as a model for the engraver Calamatta. This drawing, in which Ingres announced his intention to \"amplify and complete\" his conception, was not completed until 1865, as the artist deliberated at length in choosing the appropriate historical personages to be included. He ultimately added dozens of new figures, including Ictinus, Giulio Romano, John Flaxman, Jacques-Louis David, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Cosimo de Medici, Louis XIV, and Pope Leo X. Ingres also refined his selection by excluding Shakespeare, Tasso, and Camões from the 1865 drawing, as he had come to believe that they were too closely related to the Romantic tendency epitomized by his rival Delacroix.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5660497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5660497", "title": "The Brave Little Tailor", "text": "The Brave Little Tailor\n\n\"The Brave Little Tailor\" or \"The Valiant Little Tailor\" or \"The Gallant Tailor\" (German: \"Das tapfere Schneiderlein\") is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale number 20. Joseph Jacobs collected another variant \"A Dozen at One Blow\" in \"European Folk and Fairy Tales\". Andrew Lang included it in \"The Blue Fairy Book\". Another of many versions of the tale appears in \"A Book of Giants\" by Ruth Manning-Sanders.\n\nIn the Aarne–Thompson–Uther system of classifying folktales, it is type 1640, with elements of several other story types.\n\nA tailor is preparing to eat some jam, but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading \"Seven at One Blow\". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a giant who assumes that \"Seven at One Blow\" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a \"rock\" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.\n\nImpressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.\n\nThe tailor enters the royal service, but the other soldiers are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the king that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabbed the heart of the giants.\n\nThe king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a unicorn, another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a wild boar, but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.\n\nDuly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the kings servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says \"Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!\" Terrified, the kings servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right.\n\n\nIn the Aarne–Thompson–Uther system of folktale classification, the core of the story is motif type 1640, named The Brave Tailor for this story. It also include episodes of type 1060, Squeezing Water from a Stone; type 1062, A Contest in Throwing Stones; type 1052, A Contest in Carrying a Tree; type 1051, Springing with a Bent Tree; and type 1115, Attempting to Kill the Hero in His Bed.\n\nThe story features several more general themes common to numerous folktales and more formal literature:\n\n\"The Brave Little Tailor\" has close similarities to other folktales collected around Europe, including \"The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll\" (Norway) and \"Stan Bolovan\" (Romania). It also shares many elements with \"Jack the Giant Killer\" (Cornwall and England, with ties to \"Bluebeard\" folktales of Brittany, and earlier Arthurian stories of Wales), though the protagonist in that story uses his guile to actually kill giants. Both the Scandinavian and British variants feature a recurring stock character fairy-tale hero, respectively: Jack (also associated with other giant-related stories, such as \"Jack and the Beanstalk\"), and Askeladden, also known as Boots. It is also similar to the Greek myth of Hercules in which Hercules is promised the ability to become a god if he slays the monsters, much like the main character in \"The Brave Little Tailor\" is promised the ability to become king through marrying the king's daughter if he kills the beasts in the story.\n\nThe technique of tricking the later giants into fighting each other is identical to the technique used by Cadmus, in Greek mythology and a related surviving Greek folktale, to deal with the warriors who sprang up where he sowed dragon's teeth into the soil. In the 20th-century fantasy novel \"The Hobbit\", a similar strategy is also employed by the wizard Gandalf to keep three trolls fighting amongst themselves, until the rising sun turns them to stone.\n\n\n"}

Directed by filmmaker Sini Anderson and produced by Anderson and Tamra Davis, the film's title is taken from the Julie Ruin song \"The Punk Singer\", from Hanna's 1998 solo effort.\n\nUsing a combination of interviews and archival footage including live band performances, the film traces the life and career of Hanna from her troubled upbringing and her start in spoken word performance poetry, through her riot grrrl zines, her prominent punk and dance-punk bands, her coining of the phrase \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" for Kurt Cobain, her solo career as Julie Ruin, her feminist activism, her marriage to Beastie Boys member Adam Horovitz, and ending with Hanna's 2010 diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease and the severe treatments she endures to combat it.\n\nAnderson filmed Hanna off and on for a year starting in July 2010. Hanna had already amassed a collection of archival footage and ephemera; these and further finds were worked into the documentary. Horovitz appears as a strong, steadying supporter of his wife, and he filmed one of the more troubling scenes himself. Co-producer Davis, the wife of Beastie Boy Mike D, came to the project near the end to help finish it. Anderson funded the film through various ways, initially with a benefit concert including Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon performing at the Knitting Factory and then through a Kickstarter campaign which raised $46,000. The film, Anderson's first feature-length documentary, premiered in March 2013 at SXSW (South by Southwest) in Austin, Texas, where it was positively reviewed. The film was picked up for distribution in North America by Sundance Selects. On November 29, 2013, its general theatrical release was initiated in New York and Los Angeles, as well as a digital release on iTunes.\n\nThe film was the first public announcement of Hanna's battle with Lyme disease. Since 2005, Hanna had been struggling with symptoms of the disease without knowing the cause; this resulted in her telling her Le Tigre bandmates that she was finished as a singer/songwriter, that she had written all she ever intended to write. In the film Hanna says that this explanation was not true, that instead she was suffering nervous system troubles and that she did not want to admit she was unable to perform on stage. The film was also the first public revelation of certain details of Hanna's childhood and her marriage.\n\nThe film interviews many people who observed Hanna's career including:\n\nHanna determined that the number of men interviewed should be minimal. She told Anderson not to feature Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Ian MacKaye of Fugazi, or Calvin Johnson of Beat Happening, even though she liked them and respected their opinions. She said, \"I want women to be the experts. I don't want these male experts to come in to make it legitimate.\" Hanna wanted Tobi Vail, zine writer and bandmember of Bikini Kill to be interviewed in the film, but Vail chose to keep her privacy. In the film, Vail appears in archival footage to talk about Hanna and the punk scene.\n\n"}

{"id": "1354657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1354657", "title": "Émile Bernard", "text": "Émile Bernard\n\nÉmile Henri Bernard (28 April 1868 – 16 April 1941) was a French Post-Impressionist painter and writer, who had artistic friendships with Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and Eugène Boch, and at a later time, Paul Cézanne. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with Cloisonnism and Synthetism, two late 19th-century art movements. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of modern art to which Bernard had contributed.\n\nÉmile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, Émile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where Émile attended the \"Collège Sainte-Barbe.\"\n\nHe began his studies at the École des Arts Décoratifs. In 1884, joined the Atelier Cormon where he experimented with impressionism and pointillism and befriended fellow artists Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. After being suspended from the École des Beaux-Arts for \"showing expressive tendencies in his paintings\", he toured Brittany on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.\n\nIn August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in Pont-Aven. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that \"my own talent was already fully developed.\" He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.\n\nBernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted \"La Grandmère\", a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended Académie Julian, met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.\n\nOne year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had \"a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively...\" Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.\n\n1888 was a seminal year in the history of Modern art. From 23 October until 23 December Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh worked together in Arles. Gauguin had brought his new style from Pont-Aven exemplified in \"Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel\", a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.\n\nHe also brought along Bernard's \"Le Pardon de Pont-Aven\" which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.\nsee in: (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style Émile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a watercolor copy of the \"Pardon\" (December 1888) which he sent to his brother, to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of Émile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):\"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy.\"\n\nBernard's style was effective and coherent (see:woman at haystacks,) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two \"portraits\" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of Émile Bernard's drawings from the August batch (\"...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers\" – Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard – Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the Allée des Alyscamps in Arles.\n\nIn 1891 he joined a group of Symbolist painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler. In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more eclectic. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the École des Beaux-Arts before he died in 1941.\n\nBernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as cloisonnism. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of Paul Cézanne, and he collaborated with Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.\n\nMany say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this \"closisonisme\" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin \"turned against Neo-Impressionism.\" It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of Cézanne. But Bernard says \"When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by \"everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan.\" \n\n\"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.\nAnd the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority.\"\n\nSymbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.\nBernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it \"It is the invisible express by the visible,\" and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like Georges-Pierre Seurat, but simplifying the actual symbol.\n\nHis concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.\n\nIt was always Émile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 The Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South that put Émile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)\n\nOne of Émile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter Ivan Aguéli.\n\n\nHis correspondence with other artists is of great art historical interest. Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard traded ideas and art. Many letters sent from van Gogh and Gauguin to Bernard give historians a better idea of the artists lives and connection to their artwork.\n\n\n\n"}
