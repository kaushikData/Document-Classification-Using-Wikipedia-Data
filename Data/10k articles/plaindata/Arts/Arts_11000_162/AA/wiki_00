The video shows Roberts walking through various neighborhoods of New York City, wearing jeans and a black crewneck T-shirt, with a hidden camera recording her from the front. The two-minute video includes selected footage from ten hours, showcasing what has been described by some as \"catcalls\" and street harassment of Roberts by men, reporting there were 108 such instances. The behaviors included people saying \"hello\" or \"good morning\", comments on Roberts' appearance, attempts to initiate conversation, angry remarks, and men following her for several minutes. As of February 2018, the video has received over 45 million views on YouTube.\n\nRoberts said that she got involved with the video by responding to a Craigslist posting by Rob Bliss a few months prior, and that although Rob Bliss told her that this was potentially a viral video, she was skeptical but was open to giving it a try. Rob Bliss himself shot the video by walking a few feet in front of Roberts with a GoPro camera in his backpack. Bliss and Emily May (executive director and co-founder of Hollaback!, for whom the video was made) clarified in comments to the \"Washington Post\" that Roberts' dress choice (jeans and a T-shirt) was made so as to debunk the misconception that women only get harassed if they wear revealing clothing. Roberts also said that she experienced similar harassment every day on the streets of New York City as was shown in the video.\n\nThe video was hailed for providing visual proof of what many considered an important problem relating to the treatment of women in city streets.\n\nSeveral commentators disputed the implicit characterization of many incidents in the video, such as people casually greeting Roberts, as harassment. Others responded that, even though the words themselves may not seem like harassment, the social context, including that they were directed only at Roberts rather than at male passersby, made them harassment.\n\nAnother criticism was that the video was racially biased because it depicted black men harassing Roberts, a white woman, even though the video creator said that she was catcalled by people of all races. Hollaback! responded to the criticism by noting that this video was only the first in a series of many videos that would document different forms of street harassment, and said it regretted any racial bias in the video. An analysis of the video documented that most of the scenes shown in the video were taken in neighborhoods with predominantly black and Hispanic populations, raising the question of whether the video was shot mostly in these locations, or whether harassment was more prevalent in these locations than in others.\n\nSome critics combined both angles of criticism, claiming that the comments that Roberts considered street harassment were so perceived by her (and by her audience) because of race and class differences between her and the men making the comments. Others disputed the characterization of the video as racist.\n\nRoberts, the woman featured in the video, reported receiving death threats within days of the video being released, and said that she no longer felt safe. Roberts later filed a lawsuit against the video's producers. However, the lawsuit was dismissed before going to trial. \n\nIn 2015, Roberts was named as one of \"The Forward\" 50.\n\n"}

Despite early evidence of his imaginative talent as a carver of stone, Metallinos was prevented by poverty from artistic training. He did not begin his work as a self-taught sculptor until 1973, when at the age of 67 until his death in 1987, he fulfilled a long-held intention of using hammer and chisel 'to bear witness to human nature and its weaknesses' . The Scops owl Metallinos carved on a stone plaque fixed to the front of his house, displaying his initials, and holding a builder's trowel and a sculptor's hammer, is dated the year he made the transition from builder to sculptor, depicting in stone and marble a unique record of a fast changing pastoral economy, emphasising the primacy of the family, village institutions and traditional customs, yet mingling with this account of Greek folklore, works that are erotic, ribald and subversively political.\n\nHis work of over 250 pieces, nearly all completed in the last 12 years of his life, is kept together in a family museum in Ano Korakiana - a museum he built himself, intending it as a gift to the village.\n\nMetallinos' first wife, Eleni, died childless. He was married again, late in life, to Angeliki, who bore him two children, Andreas and Maria. He died at the age of 79 on 19 May 1987. Andreas died in October 2016. His wife Anna continues to live in Ano Korakiana in the museum that houses a unique collection of work largely unknown outside the village in which it was created.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30746819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30746819", "title": "Art of Urartu", "text": "Art of Urartu\n\nThe art of Urartu refers to a historical and regional type of art from Urartu (Ararat), the ancient state of Western Asia which existed in the period from the 13th to the 6th centuries BC in the Armenian Highland. The art of Urartu was strongly influenced by nearby Assyria, the most prominent state of that period in the region. It peaked around the 8th century BC but was mostly looted, scattered and destroyed with the fall of Urartu about a century later.\nUrartian art was heavily influenced by neighboring Assyria, and despite the obvious stylistic differences was long considered a branch of Assyrian art. Urartian art is characterized by 1) a style following its canon more rigorously than in other cultures of the Ancient East, 2) preference for ornaments rather than representational scenes of life, and 3) the practice of copying old examples instead of improving them. As a result, the style of Urartian craftsmen remained unchanged for several centuries and was gradually simplified. Urartian art was relatively poorly characterized until the 1950s, when major archeological work was started at the ancient Urartian cities Teishebaini and Erebuni and many Urartian cuneiform tables were deciphered.\n\nAlthough Urartian masters were capable of producing large bronze statue, not even fragments of any have been found so far. Literature mentions that Assyrians, while looting the city of Musasir, removed a bronze statue of King Argishti I weighing 60 talents (about 1,8 tons). Small bronze objects of art were exclusively made for the king's palace and are divided into three groups: throne decorations, ornaments on copper cauldrons and, rarely, statuettes of Urartian gods.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1885, local treasure hunters sold a few small bronze fragments to several European museums. These fragments later turned out to be parts of one and the same Urartian king's throne. They were cast in bronze into a mold and then gilded by wrapping in thin gold sheets. The fragments are currently preserved in the British Museum, Hermitage, Louvre, Metropolitan Museum of Art and in private collections in Paris and Brussels.\n\nCauldron decorations are the best-preserved objects of Urartian bronze and therefore were used in the early 20th century to identify the Urartian style in art. The decorated copper cauldrons were apparently used for ritual ceremonies. For example, the annals of the Assyrian king Sargon II mention a bronze vessel filled with wine being part of the sacrifice to the god Ḫaldi.\n\nThe bronze statuettes were cast separately and then attached to the cauldron. They include bull heads and winged deities, possibly the god Shivini and his wife Tushpuea. The technique of casting bronze ornaments spread from Urartu to the neighboring countries, in particular to Phrygia, and then to Europe. Urartian cauldron ornaments have been found in Rhodes, Athens, Boeotia, Delphi, Olympia and in Etruscan tombs. Some Urartian bronze figures were removed from the boilers and re-used by other nations to decorate new vessels.\n\nOnly three bronze statuettes depicting Urartian deities have been preserved. One, possibly of the god Ḫaldi, is stored in the British Museum, and two others are in the National Museum of the History of Armenia (copy in the Erebuni Museum, Yerevan, see image).\n\nNumerous Urartian helmets have been recovered, more than 20 alone during the excavations of Teishebaini. Royal ceremonial helmets did not differ in shape from simple combat helmets but contained engraved images.\n\nA few decorative bronze Urartian shields have been found near Van (they are stored in the British Museum and Berlin museums) and 14 were excavated at Karmir Blur. They have diameters ranging between 70 and 100 cm and were not made for combat, as judged from the thinness of the metal and the character of the handles. All these shields contain concentric circles of lions and bulls which were designed so that no figure would appear upside down. The images were first stamped and then engraved with various instruments. The Assyrian king Sargon II described six golden Urartian shields, which were looted in Musasir, weighing 6.5 kg each. They have not been recovered thus far.\n\nOnly three royal Urartian quivers are known, all found during the excavations of Teishebaini. They are made of bronze and contain images of Urartian warriors.\n\nPoorly preserved remains of Urartian mail of Argishti I were excavated at Teishebaini. Entire (or parts of) wide bronze belts were found in Turkey (Altyn-Tepe), Iran (Lake Urmia) and Armenia (Karmir Blur). The belts were about 1 meter long and 12 cm wide and were designed to protect archers.\n\nJewelry of Urartu had two gradations: ornaments made of precious metals and stones for the king and his family, and their simplified bronze versions used by the rich. Many jewelry items were also used as amulets. Annals of the Assyrian king Sargon II mention vast amounts of Urartian jewelry items made of silver and gold which were taken from Musasir in 714 BC. They are not preserved and some may have been melted by treasure hunters. The two largest recovered jewelry items are shown below. They are the pectoral decoration excavated at the late Urartian capital Rusahinili and the cover of the cauldron found at Teishebaini. Smaller items include golden pins, earrings, a bracelet and a few medallions. Jewelry was worn in Urartu by both men and women. Women's jewelry usually portrayed the Urartian goddess Arubani, wife of Ḫaldi – the supreme god of Urartu. Also common are Mesopotamian motifs such as tree of life and winged sun. More accessible jewelry included bronze bracelets and earrings and carnelian beads.\n\nContrary to expectations, very few stone reliefs and sculptures were found during excavations, although the reliefs of the Assyrian king Sargon II depicting the Urartian city of Musasir clearly show large statues. Only a few minor remnants of stone reliefs were discovered in Turkey: the rest were likely destroyed after the fall of Urartu. However, pottery items were found in large numbers.\n\nA few art items made of bone were found, mostly broken to parts, such as the bone combs excavated near Teishebaini. The only preserved example of wooden art of Urartu is the horse which was attached to some larger wooden item.\n\nColored frescoes in rather good condition were found in the ruins of the Urartian fortress of Erebuni. Unlike many other Urartian cities, Erebuni was not burnt but left without a fight and then abandoned; this helped preserve its murals.\n\nUrartu used cylinder seals similar to those from other ancient states of the Ancient Middle East. They depicted the moon, stars, religious images and sometimes hunting scenes.\n\nMany features of Urartian art were preserved in the neighboring countries after the fall of Urartu in the 6th century BC. Observations by Boris Piotrovsky suggest that decoration and production techniques of Scythian belts and scabbards were borrowed from Urartu. The Urartian way of decorating cauldrons spread over the ancient world, and it is believed that Armenian art and that of southern Georgia were partly based on the Urartian traditions.\n\n"}

Cibola White Ware shares its basic style (black designs painted on a white or light gray background) with a number of other regional wares, all produced by prehistoric Puebloan peoples. The various wares often shared stylistic ideas, and archaeologists make the various fine distinctions primarily to aid them in dating archaeological deposits and in tracing out prehistoric trade.\n\nMost Cibola White Ware is distinguished from most other black-on-white wares by the use of crushed sherd temper in the preparation of clay for firing, along with the use of mineral-based black paint. If sherd temper is combined with black plant-based paint, the pottery is instead classified as Little Colorado White Ware (produced in the Little Colorado River drainage), with one exception, Chaco-McElmo Black-on-white. Also, some early Cibola White Ware vessels have mixed sand and sherd temper or all sand temper.

It is credited to L. Ron Hubbard who died four years earlier, and is largely a compilation of material he wrote in the 1960s. It is one of the canonical texts of Scientology and mainly deals with the Purification Rundown (\"Purif\"). Scientologists believe this \"detoxification\" program, created by Hubbard, has unique medical and spiritual benefits, but has been criticized by medical professionals as \"dangerous\", \"quackery,\" and \"in some cases lethal\".\n\nThe Purif consists of a \"combination of exercise, vitamins, nutrition and sauna use,\" which purportedly \"dislodges drug residues and other toxins from the fatty tissues so that these substances can then be eliminated from the body.\" Scientologists are expected to take the Purif as part of their spiritual progress, and it is also promoted in secular contexts via Scientology-related groups including Narconon, Criminon and Second Chance. It is promoted as a cure for conditions including cancer, AIDS, heart problems, kidney failure, liver disease and obesity. The procedure is viewed as dangerous by many medical professionals, as it calls for saunas and vitamins far in excess of safe levels. Side effects listed by Scientology include dehydration, electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia (low sodium level) & hypokalemia (low potassium level), and heat-related illnesses. Some families have sued the Church of Scientology, claiming that the Purif was responsible for the death of a relative.\n\n\"Clear Body, Clear Mind\" includes a disclaimer to the effect that the Purification Rundown is not a medical treatment and that it should not be read as making medical claims. However, in their Introduction to the book, David Root M.D. and James Barnes write: \nL. Ron Hubbard's Purification program remains the only proven and safe method for reducing or eliminating chemical residues from the body. It has been used to alleviate the symptoms and concerns of people exposed to radiation. With each year, the importance of this discovery to every man, woman and child on this planet becomes more evident.\n\nHubbard claims to have been the discoverer of the \"acid flashback\" phenomenon, in which LSD is said to lodge itself in tissues and re-enter the bloodstream years later. He claims to have made this discovery \"In the 1970s, working with cases of individuals who had been drug users\". (pg. 23, 1990 hardcover edition)\n\nScientology's official website says of the book: \n\nThe claim of \"Over 250,000\" successes drew censure from the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. The figure was a count of everyone who had completed the program, including people whose \"drug\" exposure was infrequent use of alcoholic drinks or prescription drugs.\n\nA 1995 review of the book at a medical conference described the mega-doses of niacin as inappropriate, especially since they cause the release of histamine, which is counterproductive when dealing with chemical sensitivity.\n\nIn \"All About Radiation\", Hubbard (1957) sets out his idiosyncratic theories of radiation, including the idea that large doses of vitamins could both alleviate and prevent radiation sickness.\n\n\"Purification: An Illustrated Answer To Drugs\" (New Era Publications, 1984. ) is an earlier, illustrated explanation of the Purification Rundown. Another illustrated book, \"Narconon New Life Detoxification Program: the effective purification program by L. Ron Hubbard.\" (Bridge Publications, 1991. ) is listed as based on \"Clear Body, Clear Mind\".\n\n\n\n"}

It premiered on March 6, 2012 on MTV. The documentary depicts her reflecting on her road to recovery, addressing several of her emotional and physical issues, celebrating Thanksgiving with her family in 2011 and returning for the very first time to the treatment facility she retreated to back in 2010.\n\nSeveral years later in her YouTube documentary about her life and career, \"Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated\" (2017), Lovato admitted to being dishonest about the outcome of her initial treatment in \"Demi Lovato: Stay Strong\", and also revealed that she was in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about her sobriety for the documentary film. \n\nLovato had suffered from depression, an eating disorder, self-harm and being bullied before she went into rehab at the age of 18. On November 1, 2010, she left the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert World Tour, entering a treatment facility for \"physical and emotional issues\". She decided to enter treatment after punching female dancer Alex Welch; her management and family confronted her in a formal intervention after this incident to convince her she needed help. Lovato agreed to seek help and took \"full responsibility\" for the incident.\n\nOn January 28, 2011, Lovato completed inpatient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. She acknowledged that she had suffered from anorexia and bulimia, had harmed herself, and had been \"self-medicating\" with drugs and alcohol \"like a lot of teens do to numb their pain\". In addition, Lovato said that she \"basically had a nervous breakdown\" and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder during her treatment. Lovato later added that she had used cocaine several times a day and smuggled cocaine onto airplanes. After finishing her treatment, Lovato returned to work on her third album in February 2011. In April 2011, Lovato announced she was leaving \"Sonny with a Chance\", where she portrayed the main character Sonny Munroe, because she wanted to focus on her music career rather than acting.\n\nLovato's third album, \"Unbroken\", was released on September 20, 2011 and was met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics. It debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was eventually certified Gold. The R&B-infused album was preceded by Lovato's critically acclaimed top ten single \"Skyscraper\" and spawned the triple-platinum certified hit single \"Give Your Heart a Break\". On February 21, 2012, Lovato announced on Twitter that a television special she had worked on with MTV would premiere on March 6, 2012, while she also revealed its title \"#StayStrong\" and the promotional poster for the documentary, showing Lovato's \"Stay Strong\" wrist tattoos as well as her scars. An official trailer was released by MTV on the same day.\n\n\"Demi Lovato: Stay Strong\" commences with fans shouting Lovato's first name, while waiting for her to arrive at the Fox Theatre in Detroit where she is about to perform on November 16, 2011. The tour date marks the opening night of the Unbroken Tour and her first tour date since the sold-out \"An Evening with Demi Lovato\" two-date promotional tour that took place in September 2011. Lovato starts reflecting on the rough road that led her to self-harm and addiction, while scenes of Lovato getting ready for her performance in the dressing room are interwoven featuring a short cameo appearance from her manager Phil McIntyre. She says she \"had so many issues underneath that needed to be taken care of and that \"it literally ended up driving [her] insane\". Shortly after, Lovato's home in Los Angeles is shown where she is seen hugging her mother Dianna Lee Hart, whereas Lovato's half-sister Madison De La Garza is also featured.\n\nAs soon as Lovato's makeup and hair is done, she is ready to go on stage and a huge audience is seen cheering for her. Lovato confesses, \"I cannot tell you that I have not thrown up since treatment. I cannot tell you I’ve not cut myself since treatment. I’m not perfect. This is a daily battle that I will face for the rest of my life.\" She's then seen performing the track \"All Night Long\". Lovato reveals that her new, bigger purpose in life is to \"inspire people,\" and \"get people through their days and their problems\". Some interviewed fans express what they think about Lovato's recovery and how she is an inspiration to them, while praising her strength.\n\nThe cameras follow her home where she spends her first Thanksgiving out of treatment and Lovato explains how her eating disorder had developed. \"This year I am definitely not taking any holiday for granted,\" she says about spending Thanksgiving with her family. After Thanksgiving, Lovato keeps thinking about what she ate on the holiday, cries about it and feels uncomfortable before going on stage. She feels sick, but still decides to perform. A small part of her performance of the song \"Fix a Heart\" is shown, as well as Lovato taking pictures with fans at her meet-and-greet.\n\nOne of her fans, a cancer survivor, tells Lovato inspired her to go to the meet-and-greet without her wig. Sitting in front of the piano on stage, Lovato expresses how thankful she is to be there, \"because not long ago I was in a treatment facility\" and she \"was so scared and was so alone but I had you guys [the fans] by my side\". She mentions the \"beautiful, beautiful girl that I met\", tells the audience why the girl went to the concert without her wig and states, \"That's why I continue to do this [performing] every single day of my life no matter how hard it gets.\" The singer adds, \"It's the people sitting in this audience and the strength that you guys possess, so just keep inspiring people 'cause you're inspiring me to stay so strong til this day. So, thank you.\" and starts singing her song \"Together\" while letting the \"special\" girl join her on stage to perform a duet.\n\nThe singer revisits Timberline Knolls, the treatment facility in Lemont, Illinois she entered back in 2010, for the very first time since she was released in mid-January 2011. Lovato recalls on her way to Timberline Knolls, \"The first time that I walked into Timberline Knolls, I sat there to eat my first meal, and it was chicken, rice, vegetables and milk, and I took like two or three bites of the chicken and was like 'OK, I'm done'.\" adding, \"That’s when I realized maybe I do belong here because I can’t finish a meal.\" She confesses about the room she stayed in during her treatment, \"I got so completely vulnerable and so raw, when I even step into this room I feel naked.\" Showing her wrist tattoos, she reveals how meaningful they are to her and she didn't get them just to cover up the scars she had, but also because her fans kept encouraging her to stay strong while in rehab.\n\n\"I wish that every single person here could just live in freedom,\" Lovato tells the patients at Timberline Knolls while delivering a speech. It was at Timberline Knolls where she was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She admits that she didn't realise that she was ill before her treatment and used to assume that \"writing seven songs in one night was normal\". Bringing her guitarist and friend Mike Manning with her, Lovato gives an intimate acoustic performance of her empowering hit song \"Skyscraper\" after her speech and gets emotional, saying \"Utilize your time here, 'cause this place will change your life, 'cause it changed mine.\"\n\nLovato opens up about how she realized that she could use what she was for in the treatment center \"for the better\". Instead of keeping her struggles and demons to herself, she decided to share her story with the world \"because some people need to hear it\". She wanted to inspire others with her story and prove that no matter what people are going through at the moment, they will get through it. The acoustic \"Skyscraper\" rendition at Timberline Knolls flows into a piano-driven performance of the song at a concert venue and Lovato is seen going into the crowd. The singer and her crew dance to \"B.M.F.\" by Rick Ross in her tour bus after the concert while she acknowledges that \"recovery doesn't have a day off\".\n\nOn the morning of March 6, 2012, Lovato made an appearance on \"The Today Show\" to promote the documentary which would premiere on MTV that night. She performed her single \"Give Your Heart a Break\". \"I've decided to tell my story because there are a lot of young teens, girls and boys, that are dealing with the same issues that I've been through. If I'm able to use my voice to do good in the world then I definitely want to do that,\" she told \"Today\" anchor Ann Curry.\n\nAfter the documentary film was premiered, Lovato immediately appeared on \"Demi Lovato: Stay Strong — The After Show\" in order to react to her documentary and do a special question-and-answer session. The show, hosted by MTV's SuChin Pak, was broadcast live from the MTV Studios in Times Square. Fans could participate in the conversation on Twitter by tweeting the hashtag \"#StayStrong\" and ask Lovato questions by using the hashtag #AskDemi. \"It feels really awesome. Doing the documentary was so interesting,\" she shared when talking about how she felt after releasing the documentary. She added, \"I felt really vulnerable, and I still kind of do tonight. I wouldn't change it. I'm doing awesome right now. I'm living a really healthy lifestyle. It's not easy. I struggle. But each day gets easier.\" Lovato announced during the post-show that she would have an upcoming appearance in \"Punk'd\".\n\nThe after show also featured some unaired extra footage. In the extra footage the singer explains every story behind her tattoos, including the reason why she got the signature heart from the \"Here We Go Again\" cover art tattooed on her wrist. She states that she sees it as a unique connection with her fans who \"would draw it on their wrists every day\" until she left treatment. Several fans featured in cameos raise their voices praising Lovato for being an anti-bullying advocate. Lovato says that people can make a difference by speaking up when they experience or witness bullying and admits that she was bullied herself, but expresses that she does not care about what haters think about her.\n\n"}

Like \"Vahine no te vi (Woman of the Mango)\" (W 449) painted at the same time, it is an example of the relatively few straightforward genre scenes that Gauguin painted immediately after setting up his studio in a native bamboo hut at Mataiea, Papeari. Nevertheless, as Nancy Mowll Mathews, Gauguin's biographer, points out, neither represents what he actually \"saw\"; the paintings transforming the mundane and ordinary into an exoticized view of the island's life. A pendant painting \"Arearea no varua ino (The Amusement of the Evil Spirit)\" (W 514), executed shortly after Gauguin had returned to Paris, appears to share the same setting and demonstrates how he moved on from simple genre painting, introducing symbolist elements. The same tree, dividing the painting into two distinct zones, can be seen in \"Parau na te Varua ino (Words of the Devil)\" (W 458).\n\nThe painting depicts two Tahitian women, seen from behind, jumping into the sea. There is a fisherman in the background, fishing with a spear. The painting epitomizes the romantic view of Tahitians made famous by Pierre Loti's \"Le Mariage de Loti\". In that novel, Loti described his Tahitian bride's pursuits as extremely simple, \"reverie, bathing, above all bathing\". The women in the painting bathe naked, removing their \"pareos\", apparently unbothered by the presence of the fisherman nearby. This is an image of the uninhibited tropical paradise Gauguin had hoped to find, although the reality was that Polynesian culture had been transformed by western missionaries and colonialism as they imposed their own values and religion on the people living in the islands. \n\nThe theme of nymphs frolicking in the waves was a tradition of the Golden Age repeatedly represented by artists such as Titian and Courbet through to Gauguin's own contemporary Degas. Gauguin was fascinated by the theme, first taking it up in 1885 with his \"Women Bathing\" (W 167). He returned to it with his 1889 \"Ondine\" (W 336), his signature painting at the Volpini Exhibition.\n\nGauguin uses intense tropical colors to convey sensual delight. For example, he uses pinks and purples for the sand, although in reality the beaches were a drab volcanic brown. The technique employed here of applying pure (unmixed) color in bold and flat shapes delineated by dark counters is one he developed in Brittany, dubbed \"cloisonnism\". Eisenman remarks that in this and similar paintings, Gauguin placed jigsaw puzzles shapes of complementary and adjacent shades side by side as binaries to suggest a coloristic liminal intermediary, reflecting Gauguin's spiritual belief that binaries such as the moral and physical universe were reconcilable. To heighten the luminosity and enhance their jewellike effect, Gauguin applied a thin layer of clear wax to the surface of his early Tahitian paintings.\n\nThe painting was previously owned by Chester Dale, who left his collection to the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. in 1962.\n\nLooking for a society more elemental and simple than that in France, Gauguin auctioned thirty of his paintings and used the money to travel to Tahiti. This first visit lasted from 1891 to 1893. His book ' was written in the style of a travel journal and was originally meant to provide a context for his 1893 Paris exhibition. Gauguin first used the words \"Noa Noa\" reporting the words the Tahitians themselves used for the scent of Tahitian women: \"Téiné merahi noa noa \" meaning \"(now) very fragrant\"'\". The substantive \"Fenua\" (\"land\" or \"island\") is understood in the title of his book, so the correct translation is \"The Fragrant Isle\". Also implied is the Tahitian term for \"Paradise\" - \"Rohutu noanoa\". In the event his book remained unpublished until 1901, although extracts were published in \"La Revue Blanche\" in 1897. The first European exhibition of Gauguin's work took place in March 1893 in Copenhagen, when he was able to take up the offer of a visiting sea captain and send out eight selected paintings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12221", "title": "Film genre", "text": "Film genre\n\nA film genre is a motion-picture category based (for example) on similarities either in the narrative elements or in the emotional response to the film (namely: serious, comic, etc.). Most theories of film genre are borrowed from literary-genre criticism. Each film genre is associated with \"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors\". \nStandard genre characters vary according to the film genre; for film noir, standard characters are the femme fatale and the \"hardboiled\" detective; a Western film may portray the schoolmarm and the gunfighter. Some actors acquire a reputation linked to a single genre, such as John Wayne (the Western) or Fred Astaire (the musical). A film's genre will influence the use of filmmaking styles and techniques, such as the use of flashbacks and low-key lighting in film noir, tight framing in horror films, fonts that look like rough-hewn logs for the titles of Western films, or the \"scrawled\" title-font and credits of \"Se7en\" (1995), a film about a serial killer. As well, genres have associated film-scoring conventions, such as lush string orchestras for romantic melodramas or electronic music for science-fiction films.\n\nThe basic genres include fiction and documentary, from which subgenres have emerged, such as docufiction and docudrama. Other examples of subgenres include the courtroom- and trial-focused drama known as the legal drama, which is a subtype of drama. Types of fiction which may seem unrelated can also be combined to form hybrid subgenres, such as the melding of horror and comedy in the \"Evil Dead\" films. Other popular combinations include the romantic comedy and the action comedy film. Alan Williams distinguishes three main genre categories: narrative, avant-garde and documentary.\nGenre movies are \"commercial feature films which, through repetition and variation, tell familiar stories with familiar characters and familiar situations\". Genre affects how films are broadcast on television, advertised, and organized in video rental stores.\n\nFilms can also be classified by the setting, theme, topic, mood, format, target audience or budget. The setting is the environment where the story and action take place (e.g., a war film, a Western film, or a space-opera film). The theme or topic refers to the issues or concepts that the film revolves around (e.g., science-fiction film, sports film, or crime film). The mood is the emotional tone of the film (e.g., comedy film, horror film, or tearjerker film). Format refers to the way the film was shot (e.g., 35 mm, 16 mm or 8 mm) or the manner of presentation (e.g.: anamorphic widescreen). Additional ways of categorizing film genres may involve the target audience (e.g., children's film, teen film or women's film) or by type of production (e.g., B movie, big-budget blockbuster or low-budget film). \"Genre\" does not just refer to the type of film or its category; spectator expectations about a film, and institutional discourses that create generic structures also play a key role.\nGenres are not fixed; they change and evolve over time, and some genres may largely disappear (for example, the melodrama).\n\nThe term \"genre\" was used to organize films according to type since the earliest days of cinema. By the 1950s, André Bazin was discussing the concept of \"genre\" by using the Western film as an example; during this era, there was a debate over auteur theory versus genre. In the late 1960s, the concept of genre became a significant part of film theory.\n\nFilm genres draw on genres from other forms; Western novels existed before the Western film, and musical theatre existed before film musicals were made. The perceived genre of a film can change over time; for example, \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903) is seen in the 2010s as a key early Western film, but when it was released, it was seen as related to the \"then-popular genres of the chase film, the railroad film and the crime film\". A key reason that the early Hollywood industrial system from the 1920s to the 1950s favoured genre films is that in \"Hollywood's industrial mode of production, genre movies are dependable products\" to market to audiences, they are easy to produce and it is easy for audiences to understand a genre film. In the 1920s to 1950s, genre films had clear conventions and iconography, such as the heavy coats worn by gangsters in films like \"Little Caesar\" (1931). The conventions in genre films enable filmmakers to create them in an industrial, assembly line fashion, an approach which can be seen in the James Bond spy films, which all use a formula of \"lots of action, fancy gadgets, beautiful woman and colourful villains\", even though the actors, directors and screenwriters changed. \n\nFilms are rarely purely from one genre, which is in keeping with the cinema's diverse and derivative origins, it being a blend of \"vaudeville, music-hall, theatre, photography\" and novels. American film historian Janet Staiger states that the genre of a film can be defined in four ways. The \"idealist method\" judges films by predetermined standards. The \"empirical method\" identifies the genre of a film by comparing it to a list of films already deemed to fall within a certain genre. The apriori method uses common generic elements which are identified in advance. The \"social conventions\" method of identifying the genre of a film is based on the accepted cultural consensus within society. Martin Loop contends that Hollywood films are not pure genres because most Hollywood movies blend the love-oriented plot of the romance genre with other genres. Jim Colins claims that since the 1980s, Hollywood films have been influenced by the trend towards \"ironic hybridization\", in which directors combine elements from different genres, as with the Western/science fiction mix in \"Back to the Future Part III\".\n\nMany films cross into multiple genres. Susan Hayward states that spy films often cross genre boundaries with thriller films. Some genre films take genre elements from one genre and place them into the conventions of a second genre, such as with \"The Band Wagon\" (1953), which adds film noir and detective film elements into \"The Girl Hunt\" ballet. In the 1970s New Hollywood era, there was so much parodying of genres that it can be hard to assign genres to some films from this era, such as Mel Brooks' comedy-Western \"Blazing Saddles\" (1974) or the private eye parody \"The Long Goodbye\" (1973). Other films from this era bend genres so much that it is challenging to put them in a genre category, such as Roman Polanski's \"Chinatown\" (1974) and William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\" (1971). \n\nFilm theorist Robert Stam challenged whether genres really exist, or whether they are merely made up by critics. Stam has questioned whether \"genres [are] really 'out there' in the world or are they really the construction of analysts?\". As well, he has asked whether there is a \"... finite taxonomy of genres or are they in principle infinite?\" and whether genres are \"...timeless essences ephemeral, time-bound entities? Are genres culture-bound or trans-cultural?\" Stam has also asked whether genre analysis should aim at being descriptive or prescriptive. While some genres are based on story content (the war film), other are borrowed from literature (comedy, melodrama) or from other media (the musical). Some are performer-based (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films) or budget-based (blockbusters, low budget film), while others are based on artistic status (the art film), racial identity (Race films), location (the Western), or sexual orientation (Queer cinema).\n\nMany genres have built-in audiences and corresponding publications that support them, such as magazines and websites. For example, horror films have a well-established fanbase that reads horror magazines such as \"Fangoria\". Films that are difficult to categorize into a genre are often less successful. As such, film genres are also useful in the areas of marketing, film criticism and the analysis of consumption. Hollywood story consultant John Truby states that \"...you have to know how to transcend the forms [genres] so you can give the audience a sense of originality and surprise.\" \n\nSome screenwriters use genre as a means of determining what kind of plot or content to put into a screenplay. They may study films of specific genres to find examples. This is a way that some screenwriters are able to copy elements of successful movies and pass them off in a new screenplay. It is likely that such screenplays fall short in originality. As Truby says, \"Writers know enough to write a genre script but they haven’t twisted the story beats of that genre in such a way that it gives an original face to it\".\n\nCinema technologies are associated with genres. Huge widescreens helped Western films to create an expansive setting of the open plains and desert. Science fiction and fantasy films are associated with special effects, notably computer generated imagery (e.g., the Harry Potter films).\n\nThere are other methods of dividing films into groups besides genre. For example, auteur critics group films according to their auteur-directors. Production attributes, such as the low-budget film, can also be considered a grouping. Some groupings may be casually described as genres although the definition is questionable. For example, while independent films are sometimes discussed as if they are a genre in-and-of themselves, independent productions can belong to any genre. Similarly, while art films are referred to as a genre by film scholar David Bordwell, who states that \"art cinema itself is a [film] genre, with its own distinct conventions\", an art film can be in a number of genres (e.g., drama, experimental film, black comedy, etc.).\n\nBecause genres are easier to recognize than to define, academics agree they cannot be identified in a rigid way. Furthermore, different countries and cultures define genres in different ways. A typical example are war movies. In US, they are mostly related to the two World Wars whereas, in other countries, movies related to wars in other historical periods are considered \"war movies\".\n\nFilm genres may appear to be readily categorizable from the setting of the film. Nevertheless, films with the same settings can be very different, due to the use of different themes or moods. For example, while both \"The Battle of Midway\" and \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" are set in a wartime context and might be classified as belonging to the war film genre, the first examines the themes of honor, sacrifice, and valour, and the second is an anti-war film which emphasizes the pain and horror of war. While there is an argument that film noir movies could be deemed to be set in an urban setting, in cheap hotels and underworld bars, many classic noirs take place mainly in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road.\n\nThe editors of filmsite.org argue that animation, pornographic film, documentary film, silent film and so on are non-genre-based film categories.\n\nLinda Williams argues that horror, melodrama, and pornography all fall into the category of \"body genres\" since they are each designed to elicit physical reactions on the part of viewers. Horror is designed to elicit spine-chilling, white-knuckled, eye-bulging terror; melodramas are designed to make viewers cry after seeing the misfortunes of the onscreen characters; and pornography is designed to elicit sexual arousal. This approach can be extended: comedies make people laugh, tear-jerkers make people cry, feel-good films lift people's spirits and inspiration films provide hope for viewers.\n\nA genre movie is a film that follows some or all of the conventions of a particular genre, whether or not it was intentional when the movie was produced.\n\nIn order to understand the creation and context of each film genre, we must look at its popularity in the context of its place in history. For example, the 1970s Blaxploitation films have been called an attempt to \"undermine the rise of Afro-American's Black consciousness movement\" of that era. In William Park's analysis of film noir, he states that we must view and interpret film for its message with the context of history within our minds; he states that this is how film can truly be understood by its audience. Film genres such as film noir and Western film reflect values of the time period. While film noir combines German expressionist filming strategies with post World War II ideals; Western films focused on the ideal of the early 20th century. Films such as the musical were created as a form of entertainment during the Great Depression allowing its viewers an escape during tough times. So when watching and analyzing film genres we must remember to remember its true intentions aside from its entertainment value.\n\nOver time, a genre can change through stages: the classic genre era; the parody of the classics; the period where filmmakers deny that their films are part of a certain genre; and finally a critique of the entire genre. This pattern can be seen with the Western film. In the earliest, classic Westerns, there was a clear hero who protected society from lawless villains who lived in the wilderness and came into civilization to commit crimes. However, in revisionist Westerns of the 1970s, the protagonist becomes an anti-hero who lives in the wilderness to get away from a civilization that is depicted as corrupt, with the villains now integrated into society. Another example of a genre changing over time is the popularity of the neo-noir films in the early 2000s (\"Mulholland Drive\" (2001), \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" (2001) and \"Far From Heaven\" (2002); are these film noir parodies, a repetition of noir genre tropes, or a re-examination of the noir genre? \n\nThis is also important to remember when looking at films in the future. As viewers watch a film they are conscious of societal influence with the film itself. In order to understand it's true intentions, we must identify its intended audience and what narrative of our current society, as well as it comments to the past in relation with today's society. This enables viewers to understand the evolution of film genres as time and history morphs or views and ideals of the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His current endeavor is creating spiritually uplifting piano arrangements of popular LDS Hymns. He resides in Oceanside, California and is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints there.\n\nGarth was born in Brigham City, Utah, the son of a senior executive chemical engineer working at Thiokol, G. Ray and JoAnne (Petty) Smith. After taking a short break to serve a mission to the Navajo people of Northern Arizona, Garth completed a college degree in Design Engineering Technology from Brigham Young University, graduating in the class of 1988. Afterwards, Garth accepted a position at Intergraph Corporation in Huntsville, Alabama. Later he moved to Carlsbad, California to accept a design position with Callaway Golf.\n\nGarth began his classical musical training on the piano at the age of 5. As a missionary and college student he would entertain many with his piano skills, including a special performance of a Beethoven sonata to over 15,000 people in the BYU Marriott Center at his college graduation.\n\nHe has been a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and the Nashville Songwriters Association International. In 1999 he was the recipient of the California Country Music Association (CCMA) \"Song of the Year\" award for the song \"Last Call.\" He has also performed as a keyboardist in jazz, rock, and country bands.\n\nWhile living in Alabama, Garth was introduced \"Writers in the Round\" at the famous Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, Tennessee, a club famous for intimate, acoustic music performed by its composers. Soon, Garth was active participant there, performing his own original compositions.\n\nGarth also participated as both a rehearsal and performance pianist in the local community theaters of Huntsville. He also joined in various local bands touring throughout Northern Alabama and Southern Tennessee.

His work is available through Deseret Books.\nRecently Garth has turned his attention to recording original arrangements of popular LDS Hymns, releasing this first album in 2014 titled \"Sacred Hymns Arranged and Performed on the Piano\". This has received great acclaim and wide national distribution within the LDS music genre.\n\nFor his second full-length album, \"How Beautiful Thy Temples, Sacred Hymns, Vol. II\" (released in 2015), Garth brings his masterful, reverent signature style to bear on hymns and sacred songs that focus on the beauty and eternal significance of temples. This has been his most successful release yet, having charted nationally at #21 on the iTunes Gospel new music chart.\n\nCrawford Gates, famous LDS composer, has called \"How Beautiful Thy Temples\" a \"fabulous recording.\" Smith's arrangement of Gates' beloved Easter hymn \"He is Not Here\" (from \"The Choirbook\") is included as track 8 on the album.\n\nFrom \"An Angel From on High,\" an arrangement inspired by the statue of the Angel Moroni that sits atop many temples, to the children's songbook classic \"I Love To See the Temple\".

The theater teaches and hosts performances of improvisational comedy. It was founded in 1981 by Del Close and Charna Halpern. The theater has many notable alumni, including Amy Poehler and Stephen Colbert.\n\niO concentrates on \"long-form\" improvisational structures, in contrast to the \"short-form\" or \"improv game\" format of Theatresports, ComedySportz or the television show \"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\" The iO's signature piece is the \"Harold\", and the theater features other forms of improvisation, as well as sketch comedy and stand-up comedy.\n\nThe building has four performance spaces:\n\niO has one other active franchise: iO West, located in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe ImprovOlympic was created in 1981, putting competing teams of comedic improvisers on stage in front of audiences. This was the brainchild of David Shepherd, who used early Viola Spolin theater games as a way for teams to compete. The first ImprovOlympic classes and shows took place at The Players Workshop in Chicago, where Charna Halpern was an improv student. Charna Halpern became David Shepherd's assistant, and eventually the producer of the competitions. There were also competitions at a network of local bars and clubs. In 1982, The ImprovOlympic moved from The Players Workshop to its own space. Teams began to form out of every major improv troupe in Chicago. Shows began shifting to a long-form approach by 1983. \n\nIn 1995, The ImprovOlympic moved to its location on Clark St. in Chicago. An additional theater, iO West was opened by Paul Vaillancourt in Los Angeles, California in 1997. Today it is managed by Colleen Doyle and Zach Huddleston. In 2001, The International Olympic Committee legally threatened the theater over its use of the name \"ImprovOlympic\" and the name was subsequently changed to \"iO.\" On September 2, 2005, iO held its 25th anniversary show at the Chicago Theater in downtown Chicago. The wireless microphones went dead shortly into the show, but the improvisers rallied and played using wired mics for the rest of the performance. Celebrity veterans of the iO program who returned to play included Mike Myers, Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, and Ike Barinholtz. The opening to the Harold piece performed was conducted by the most veteran iO house team \"The Reckoning.\" \n\nIn August 2014, after almost 20 years in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood, Charna Halpern bought a building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and moved the iO Theater to its new home at 1501 N.

It aims to enhance the field of conservation-restoration and raise awareness to the importance and fragility of cultural heritage.\n\nThe creation of the Centre took place as a result of a proposal at the UNESCO General Conference held in New Delhi, in 1956. Three years later, the Centre was established in Rome, Italy, where its headquarters remain to this day.\n\nICCROM responds to the needs of its Member States, which are currently at 136.\n\nICCROM’s mission is defined by a set of statutes that were drafted shortly before its establishment (and revised on 25 November 2009).\n\nICCROM's mission is fulfilled through five areas of activity: training, information, research, cooperation and advocacy.\n\nICCROM contributes to capacity building through the development of educational materials, training activities worldwide, internships and fellows. Since 1965, ICCROM has offered courses to mid-career professionals on a wide range of topics that include archaeological site conservation, architectural records and inventories, built heritage conservation, conservation decision making, cultural heritage management, preventive conservation in museums and risk management to endangered collections. Other courses are focused on specific materials such as stone, wood, or sound and image collections, and others still focus on the conservation of heritage in specific regional areas, such as the Arab region or Southeast Asia.\n\nThe ICCROM library is one of the world’s leading sources of information on the conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. It contains more than 115,000 registered references and 1,800 specialized journals in more than 60 languages. In addition, the archive contains institutional records that date back to ICCROM’s creation, as well as over 200,000 images of cultural heritage worldwide in relation to ICCROM’s scientific and educational activities. The website is a portal to comprehensive information about courses, activities, international events, and employment and training opportunities in the conservation field.\n\nICCROM facilitates a vast network of conservation professionals and institutions through which it organizes and coordinates meetings to devise common approaches and methodologies. It also promotes the definition of internationally agreed ethics, criteria and technical standards for conservation practice. The in-house laboratory is also a reference point and resource for professionals, course participants, interns and fellows of the organization.\n\nICCROM carries out all of its activities in collaboration with a vast number of institutional and professional partners. Additionally, it serves its Member States in the form of collaborative projects, training, and technical advice. \n\nICCROM disseminates teaching materials and organizes workshops and conferences to raise public awareness and support for conservation.\n\nThe end of the Second World War came with the need to repair monuments and other forms of cultural heritage that had been either damaged or destroyed. At the same time, other countries were emerging from colonization and were eager to industrialize, reclaim and redefine their cultural identity, and train personnel to preserve their heritage.\n\nOn an international level, there was a lack of cohesive training and authoritative bodies to guide countries in rebuilding and protecting their heritage. Thus, during the Sixth Session of the UNESCO General Conference (1951), the Swiss government introduced a resolution that proposed the establishment of an international centre to encourage the study and awareness of methods of conservation on a global scale. This was adopted and a committee of experts were put together to decide upon the role and functions of this institution. In the Centre’s ten-year anniversary commemorative booklet (\"The First Decade 1959-1969\", pp. 12-13), Hiroshi Daifuku of the Section for the Development of the Cultural Heritage (UNESCO) explained,\n\nThese functions would become the template for the Centre’s statutes.\n\nIn 1956 the resolution was adopted at the Ninth Session of the UNESCO General Conference in New Delhi and in 1957, an agreement was signed between the Government of the Italian Republic and UNESCO to establish this Centre in Rome.\n\nThe adhesion of five Member States by 1958 allowed the Statutes to come into force, making the Centre a legal entity. Collaboration was established with other European conservation institutions, namely the Central Institute of Restoration of Italy (ICR, now ISCR) and the Royal Institute for Restoration of Works of Art (IRPA) in Belgium. A provisional council nominated by UNESCO was created to govern the Centre and in 1959, it opened in Rome with Harold J. Plenderleith, renowned Keeper at the British Museum, as its Director. The Belgian art historian, Paul Philippot was appointed Deputy Director and the first General Assembly took place in 1960 during which the first regular Council Members were elected.\n\nBelow is a timeline of key events in the Centre’s development:\n\n\nICCROM’s governance consists of the General Assembly, the Council and the Secretariat.\n\nThe General Assembly is composed of delegates from all of the ICCROM Member States who convene in Rome every two years to dictate the organization’s policies, approve the programme of activities and budget, and elect the Council and Director-General.\n\nThe General Assembly also approves reports on Council and Secretariat activities, determine Member State contribution, and adopt and revise ICCROM’s Statutes and regulations, when necessary.\n\nMembers of ICCROM’s Council are elected from among the most qualified experts in the conservation-restoration field worldwide. In choosing members of Council, equitable representations from all of the cultural regions of the world, as well as relevant fields of specialization are taken into account.\n\nThe Council meets annually at the ICCROM headquarters in Rome.\n\nThe Secretariat of ICCROM consists of the Director-General and staff. The Director-General is responsible for the execution of the approved programme of activities. Staff are distributed between sectors dealing with immovable heritage (monuments, archaeological sites, historic cities, etc.), movable heritage (such as museum collections), Knowledge and Communication (the Library and Archives, publications, the web site), the didactic Laboratory, and Finance and Administration.\n\n\n\nSince 1979, the ICCROM Award has been granted to individuals who have given a significant contribution to the development of the institution, and who have special merit in the field of conservation, protection and restoration of cultural heritage. This award is given each biennium to one or two nominees who have been chosen by the Council. Below is the list of previous ICCROM Award recipients (in alphabetical order).\n\n\n"}

Along with Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\", \"Le bonheur de vivre\" is regarded as one of the pillars of early modernism. The monumental canvas was first exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial distortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage.\n\nIn the central background of the piece is a group of figures that is similar to the group depicted in his painting \"The Dance\" (1909–10). In the picture, there are several nude bodies of women and men in a landscape drenched with vivid color.\n\n\"The work is known to have invigorated fellow artists, especially Pablo Picasso, who, in an effort to outdo Matisse in terms of shock value, immediately began work on his watershed \"Les Demoiselles D’Avignon\"\", writes Martha Lucy, associate curator at the Barnes Foundation.\n\nJames B. Cuno and Thomas Puttfarken suggest that the inspiration for the work was Agostino Carracci's engraving of after the by the 16th-century Flemish painter Paolo Fiammingo. Based on the many similarities with the engraving, in particular its theme of pastoral fantasy and its composition with the circle of dancers in the background, Cuno came to the conclusion that Carracci's engraving had a decisive influence on the final composition of \"Le Bonheur de Vivre\".\n\nAccording to Hilton Kramer \"Le bonheur de vivre\", owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the Barnes Foundation which never permitted its reproduction in color, is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the Salon d'Automne of 1905, a response that entrenched his art even more deeply in the esthetic principles that had governed his Fauvist paintings which had caused a furor and which did so on a far grander scale, too.\" (The \"sequestration\" Kramer referred to relates to the very limited hours of the museum, when its collection was located in suburban Merion, Pennsylvania; in 2012, the collection was moved to a new, more accessible facility in downtown Philadelphia.)\n\n\"Le bonheur de vivre\" features a large amount of cadmium sulfide-based yellow. Portions of the painting containing cadmium sulfide are turning white or brown, degrading the work. University of Delaware Prof. Robert L. Opila, in collaboration with Barbara Buckley, head of conservation at the Barnes, and Jennifer Mass, a senior scientist and head of the Scientific Research and Analysis Laboratory at Winterthur, studied the paint’s material microstructure in an attempt to determine why the cadmium sulfide is changing color.\n\n“It is a very disheartening phenomenon, considering the painting’s position in history,” says Opila, professor of materials science at UD.\n\nPreliminary tests carried out by UD doctoral student Jonathan Church at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, show that carbon dioxide is reacting with the cadmium sulfide, causing the formation of cadmium carbonate, which is white. Also, the presence of chloride in the paint appears to be acting as a catalyst for the deterioration.

Made of wood and originally intended to be used as a circus, the theatre was managed by the parents of the music hall comedian Dan Leno in 1883, who regularly performed there in the early stages of his career. Leno's lease came to an end in 1884 and the theatre burnt down in 1893. This was replaced by City Theatre but this was demolished six years later to make way for what is now the Lyceum.\n\nBuilt to a traditional proscenium arch design, the Lyceum is the only surviving theatre outside London designed by the theatre architect W.G.R. Sprague and the last example of an Edwardian auditorium in Sheffield. The statue on top of the Lyceum Theatre is Mercury, son of Zeus and Maia.\n\nBy the late 1950s, the Lyceum was experiencing financial difficulties and by 1966 bingo callers were keeping the rumoured threat of demolition at bay. The theatre closed in 1969 and, despite being granted Grade II listed status in 1972, planning permission was sought for its demolition in 1975. The building was saved in part due to campaigning by the Hallamshire Historic Buildings Society.\n\nOver the years the building changed ownership many times, being used variously as a bingo hall and a rock concert venue. By the 1980s, the interior was in a state of disrepair. The theatre was bought by two Sheffield businessmen in 1985, with financial support from Sheffield City Council, and it was reclassified to Grade II* listed status. Between 1988 and 1990 the Lyceum was completely restored at a cost of £12 million.\n\nThe theatre reopened in 1990 and now serves as a venue for touring West End productions, as well as locally produced shows. It is part of the Sheffield Theatres complex with the neighbouring Crucible Theatre and the Crucible Studio.\n\nThe Lyceum presents one of Sheffield's annual Christmas pantomimes. For many years the pantomime attracted prominent actors and variety turns and visiting producers in the months between Christmas Eve and Easter. In the 1940s, the Lyceum began to produce its own pantomime and was soon bringing in stars of radio such as Morecambe and Wise, Harry Secombe and Frankie Howerd.\n\nHowever, closure of the Lyceum meant that after the final pantomime performance in March 1969, Sheffield's pantomimes took place in the neighbouring Crucible. The pantomime returned to the Lyceum in 1990s, as touring production companies were now using the venue.\n\nIn 2007, Sheffield Theatres replaced the touring companies by starting co-production with Evolution Pantomimes. Their first show \"Cinderella\" was followed by \"Aladdin\" in 2008 and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her starring roles as the titular characters in the sitcoms \"Clarissa Explains It All\" (1991–1994), \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" (1996–2003), and \"Melissa & Joey\" (2010–2015). Hart has been married to musician Mark Wilkerson since July 19, 2003; together, they have three sons.\n\nHart was born in Smithtown, New York, the first child of Paula, a producer and talent manager, and William Hart, a carpenter, shellfish purveyor, oyster hatchery worker, and entrepreneur. Her maternal grandfather, Stanley John Voje, was a Navy veteran and Catholic. Hart grew up in Sayville, New York.\n\nHart's parents had four other children after Melissa: Trisha, Elizabeth, Brian, and Emily, who are all in acting. Her parents were divorced in the early 1990s, and she moved with her mother and siblings to New York City. In 1994, her mother married television executive Leslie Gilliams. Hart has three half-sisters: Alexandra, Samantha, and Mackenzie.\n\nHart was named after the Allman Brothers song \"Melissa\", while her middle name, Joan, came from her maternal grandmother. She chose Catherine as her confirmation name when she was in the eighth grade, but does not use it professionally.\n\nHart's career began at age four when she made a television commercial for a bathtub doll called Splashy. From then on, she appeared regularly in commercials, making 25 of them before the age of five. Other early television work included a small role in the miniseries \"Kane & Abel\" in 1985, a guest-starring role in an episode of \"The Equalizer\" in 1986, and a starring role alongside Katherine Helmond in the Emmy Award-winning TV movie \"Christmas Snow\", also in 1986. She made a cameo guest appearance on the April 22, 1986 episode of the NBC daytime soap opera \"Another World\". She also auditioned for the lead role Jamie Lloyd in \"\", losing the role to Danielle Harris.\n\nIn 1989, she became an understudy in a Broadway production of \"The Crucible\" starring Martin Sheen.\n\nIn 1991 Hart landed the starring role on the Nickelodeon series \"Clarissa Explains It All\", a comedy about a teen girl in everyday situations, which was successful during its four-year run. The show brought her four consecutive Young Artist Award nominations, winning three. Her role in the series also led to her starring in the FMV video game Nickelodeon's Director's Lab as a tour guide who takes the player around a movie studio.\n\nInitially, after first being recognized on the streets, Hart felt embarrassed to perform on a children's show while being a teenager. Nevertheless, she was enthusiastic about the role, and \"all [she] hoped for that [she] would get to do it for a while.\"\n\nHart also recorded two albums as Clarissa: \"This Is What 'Na Na' Means\" and a recording of \"Peter and the Wolf\".\n\nIn 1995, a year after the end of \"Clarissa Explains It All\", Hart filmed a pilot episode for a spin-off show featuring a college-aged Clarissa explaining it all about her foray into the professional world as an intern at a newspaper. As its musical theme, the show featured a slow, jazz version of its predecessor's theme song, and also starred Robert Klein as her boss.\n\nHart appeared on Nickelodeon's anthology show \"Are You Afraid of the Dark?\" Season 2 episode \"The Tale of the Frozen Ghost\" in 1991.\n\nAfter the television series ended, Hart attended New York University. However, she did not complete her degree, because she earned the title role for the 1996 TV movie \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\", which was followed by the television series of the same name which lasted seven seasons on ABC and The WB. She later collaborated on an that featured Hart voicing the two aunts Hilda and Zelda, and Hart's younger sister Emily Hart starring in the title role. In between times, she also guest-starred on the series \"Touched by an Angel\" and starred in several TV movies.\n\nIn 1998, Hart had a small role in the film \"Can't Hardly Wait\"; shortly afterwards Hart began working on a theatrical film project titled \"Next to You\", in which she acted alongside Adrian Grenier. Britney Spears released a remix of her song \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" to promote the movie's soundtrack. To capitalize off its success as a top-ten hit, the name of the movie was changed to \"Drive Me Crazy\". To promote the film, both Hart and Grenier appeared in the song's music video. Around the same time, Spears made a guest appearance as herself on \"Sabrina\", in the season four episode \"No Place Like Home\".\n\nCoinciding with the release of \"Drive Me Crazy\", Hart appeared wearing lingerie on the cover of Maxim magazine's October 1999 issue, as well as in a series of photographs and an accompanying article. Hart continued her acting career in the 2000s, starring in the film \"Rent Control\", which aired in 2005 on the ABC Family cable network. Hart also continued to star on \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\" until 2003. Hart was also a primary voice-actress on \"\", which ran for 65 episodes from 1999 through 2000 on ABC and UPN.\n\nIn 1999, Hart made her directorial debut in an episode of Disney Channel's \"So Weird\" called \"Snapshot\" which guest-starred her sister Emily. Hart directed an episode of Nickelodeon's \"Taina\" in 2001. In 2001 and 2002, she directed six episodes of \"Sabrina\".\n\nAfter the end of \"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch\", Hart directed her first movie, a 15-minute live-action short film called \"Mute\" (2005), starring her sister Emily.\nHart guest-starred on an episode of \"\" that aired on October 9, 2007 titled \"Impulsive\" as a teacher accused of statutory rape. In late 2007, she directed the \"Anger Cage\" video for her husband Mark Wilkerson's band Course of Nature. She also starred in the ABC Family Original Movie \"Holiday in Handcuffs\", opposite Mario Lopez. The movie premiered on December 9, 2007, and was the highest rated program in the history of the network, with 6.7 million viewers. Hart followed this with another ABC movie with a similar premise, \"My Fake Fiancé\", in 2009.\n\nIt was announced on August 17, 2009 that she would compete in season nine of \"Dancing with the Stars\". Hart was paired up with two-time reigning champion, Mark Ballas. She was eliminated from the competition in week six out of a possible ten. Then in 2010, Hart starred as Kelley in a horror thriller film entitled \"Nine Dead\".\n\nIn 2010, Hart returned to a new weekly television series, starring with Joey Lawrence in the ABC Family sitcom \"Melissa & Joey\". In the series Hart plays a woman who hires Lawrence as a nanny to help care for her incarcerated sister's children. In the second season, she occupied the director's chair for an episode, for the first time since \"Sabrina\".\nHart joined the cast of an off-Broadway production of \"Love, Loss, and What I Wore\" for a four-week run that started in March 2010 and ended April 25, 2010.\n\nIn March 2010, Hart took part in an ad campaign for Gain detergent with \"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch\" co-star and friend Soleil Moon Frye.\n\nOn November 22, 2010, Hart participated as a presenter in the International Emmy Awards.\n\nIn June 2012, St. Martin's Press announced that it had made a deal with Hart to publish her memoir \"Melissa Explains It All: Tales from My Abnormally Normal Life\" in the fall of 2013. In the memoir, Hart wrote about growing up, being a child actor and her rise to fame, her rebellious teen years, and her efforts to balance a career as an adult with motherhood and family life.\n\nIn 2013, Hart attempted to use crowdfunding (via Kickstarter) to fund a romantic comedy movie to be entitled \"Darci's Walk of Shame\", but was only able to garner $51,605, or just 2.6% of the expected $2 million goal. Ultimately, the idea was scrapped.\n\n\"Melissa & Joey\" concluded in August 2015 after 4 seasons and 104 episodes.\n\nIn 2016, Hart starred as the lead, Grace Wesley, in the film \"God's Not Dead 2\".\n\nIn May 2009, Hart opened a candy shop called SweetHarts in Sherman Oaks, California. Hart commented that it had been her \"childhood dream\" to own a candy shop. SweetHarts closed in December 2011 due to a lawsuit by a former employee alleging wrongful termination and racial discrimination, as well as other issues, and afterwards reopened under the same name with new owners. In 2015 it closed permanently.\n\nIn 2015, Hart and her husband started their own fashion line called King of Harts.\n\nOn July 19, 2003, Hart married musician Mark Wilkerson. The preparations for the ceremony, which took place in Florence, Italy, were documented in a TV miniseries titled \"Tying the Knot\", produced by Hart's production company, Hartbreak Films. Hart and Wilkerson have three sons: Mason Walter Wilkerson (born January 2006), Braydon Hart Wilkerson (born March 2008), and Tucker McFadden Wilkerson (born September 2012). They live in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nHart and Wilkerson were featured in \"People\" magazine's April 7, 2008 issue, introducing Braydon to the world. Hart wrote a diary, including video entries, to document potty training her son, Mason, for Huggies Pull-Ups brand diapers.\n\nHart and her family are Christian. In an interview, she stated that they attend church every Sunday and pray every night and before every meal.\n\nHart has expressed her support for the Republican Party. On November 5, 2012, the day before that year's Election Day, she tweeted that she was endorsing Mitt Romney for president, which spurred backlash. Her endorsement of Romney became a trending topic. She has expressed support for increased gun regulation, marching in a Moms Demand Action demonstration in Brooklyn in May 2016. On August 16, 2016, in the run-up to that year's presidential election, she announced via Twitter that she had donated to Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson's campaign. On August 28, 2016, she announced that she had joined Johnson's campaign as the Connecticut chairperson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18935551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935551", "title": "Public domain", "text": "Public domain\n\nThe public domain consists of all the creative works to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. Those rights may have expired, been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable.\n\nThe works of William Shakespeare and Beethoven, and most early silent films, are in the public domain either by virtue of their having been created before copyright existed, or by their copyright term having expired. Some works are not covered by copyright, and are therefore in the public domain—among them the formulae of Newtonian physics, cooking recipes, and all computer software created prior to 1974. Other works are actively dedicated by their authors to the public domain (see waiver); some examples include reference implementations of cryptographic algorithms, the image-processing software ImageJ, created by the National Institutes of Health, and the CIA's \"World Factbook\". The term \"public domain\" is not normally applied to situations where the creator of a work retains residual rights, in which case use of the work is referred to as \"under license\" or \"with permission\".\n\nAs rights vary by country and jurisdiction, a work may be subject to rights in one country and be in the public domain in another. Some rights depend on registrations on a country-by-country basis, and the absence of registration in a particular country, if required, gives rise to public-domain status for a work in that country. The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the \"public sphere\" or \"commons\", including concepts such as the \"commons of the mind\", the \"intellectual commons\", and the \"information commons\".\n\nAlthough the term \"domain\" did not come into use until the mid-18th century, the concept \"can be traced back to the ancient Roman Law, as a preset system included in the property right system.\" The Romans had a large proprietary rights system where they defined \"many things that cannot be privately owned\" as \"res nullius\", \"res communes\", \"res publicae\" and \"res universitatis\". The term \"res nullius\" was defined as things not yet appropriated. The term \"res communes\" was defined as \"things that could be commonly enjoyed by mankind, such as air, sunlight and ocean.\" The term \"res publicae\" referred to things that were shared by all citizens, and the term \"res universitatis\" meant things that were owned by the municipalities of Rome. When looking at it from a historical perspective, one could say the construction of the idea of \"public domain\" sprouted from the concepts of \"res communes\", \"res publicae\", and \"res universitatis\" in early Roman law.\n\nWhen the first early copyright law was first established in Britain with the Statute of Anne in 1710, public domain did not appear. However, similar concepts were developed by British and French jurists in the 18th century. Instead of \"public domain\", they used terms such as \"publici juris\" or \"propriété publique\" to describe works that were not covered by copyright law.\n\nThe phrase \"fall in the public domain\" can be traced to mid-19th century France to describe the end of copyright term. The French poet Alfred de Vigny equated the expiration of copyright with a work falling \"into the sink hole of public domain\" and if the public domain receives any attention from intellectual property lawyers it is still treated as little more than that which is left when intellectual property rights, such as copyright, patents, and, expire or are abandoned. In this historical context Paul Torremans describes copyright as a, \"little coral reef of private right jutting up from the ocean of the public domain.\" Copyright law differs by country, and the American legal scholar Pamela Samuelson has described the public domain as being \"different sizes at different times in different countries\".\n\nDefinitions of the boundaries of the public domain in relation to copyright, or intellectual property more generally, regard the public domain as a negative space; that is, it consists of works that are no longer in copyright term or were never protected by copyright law. According to James Boyle this definition underlines common usage of the term \"public domain\" and equates the public domain to public property and works in copyright to private property. However, the usage of the term \"public domain\" can be more granular, including for example uses of works in copyright permitted by copyright exceptions. Such a definition regards work in copyright as private property subject to fair-use rights and limitation on ownership. A conceptual definition comes from Lange, who focused on what the public domain should be: \"it should be a place of sanctuary for individual creative expression, a sanctuary conferring affirmative protection against the forces of private appropriation that threatened such expression\". Patterson and Lindberg described the public domain not as a \"territory\", but rather as a concept: \"[T]here are certain materials – the air we breathe, sunlight, rain, space, life, creations, thoughts, feelings, ideas, words, numbers – not subject to private ownership. The materials that compose our cultural heritage must be free for all living to use no less than matter necessary for biological survival.\" The term public domain may also be interchangeably used with other imprecise or undefined terms such as the \"public sphere\" or \"commons\", including concepts such as the \"commons of the mind\", the \"intellectual commons\", and the \"information commons\".\n\nA public-domain book is a book with no copyright, a book that was created without a license, or a book where its copyrights expired or have been forfeited. \n\nIn most countries the term of protection of copyright lasts until January first, 70 years after the death of the latest living author. The longest copyright term is in Mexico, which has life plus 100 years for all deaths since July 1928.\n\nA notable exception is the United States, where every book and tale written prior to 1923 is in the public domain; American copyrights last for 95 years for books written between 1923 and 1978.\n\nFor example: the works of Jane Austen, Lewis Carroll, and Edgar Allan Poe are in the public domain worldwide as they all died over one hundred years ago.\n\nProject Gutenberg makes tens of thousands of public domain books available online as ebooks.\n\nPeople have been creating music for millennia. The first musical notation system, the Music of Mesopotamia system, was created 4000 years ago. Guido of Arezzo introduced Latin musical notation in the 10th century. This laid the foundation for the preservation of global music in the public domain, a distinction formalized alongside copyright systems in the 17th Century. Musicians copyrighted their publications of musical notation as literary writings, but performing copyrighted pieces and creating derivative works were not restricted by early copyright laws. Copying was widespread, in compliance with the law, but expansions of those laws intended to benefit literary works and responding to commercial music recording technology's reproducability have lead to stricter rules. Relatively recently, a normative view that copying in music is not desirable and lazy has become popular among professional musicians.\n\nU.S. copyright laws distinguish between musical compositions and sound recordings, the former of which refers to melody, notation and/or lyrics created by a composer and/or lyricist, including sheet music, and the latter referring to a recording performed by an artist, including a CD, LP, or digital sound file. Musical compositions fall under the same general rules as other works, and anything published prior to 1922 is considered public domain. Sound recordings, on the other hand, are subject to different rules and are not eligible for public domain status until 2049-2067, depending on the date and location of publishing.\n\nThe Musopen project records music in the public domain for the purposes of making the music available to the general public in a high-quality audio format. Online musical archives preserve collections of classical music recorded by Musopen and offer them for download/distribution as a public service. \n\nA public-domain film is a film that was released to public domain by its author or because its copyright has expired. In 2016 there are more than 2,000 films on public domain in every genre, from musicals to romance, horror to animated movies and noir to western movies.\n\nPamela Samuelson has identified eight \"values\" that can arise from information and works in the public domain.\n\nPossible values include:\n\nDerivative works include translations, musical arrangements, and dramatizations of a work, as well as other forms of transformation or adaptation. Copyrighted works may not be used for derivative works without permission from the copyright owner, while public domain works can be freely used for derivative works without permission. Artworks that are public domain may also be reproduced photographically or artistically or used as the basis of new, interpretive works. Works derived from public domain works can be copyrighted.\n\nOnce works enter into the public domain, derivative works such as adaptations in book and film may increase noticeably, as happened with Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel \"The Secret Garden\", which became public domain in 1987. By 1999, the plays of Shakespeare, all public domain, had been used in more than 420 feature-length films. In addition to straightforward adaptation, they have been used as the launching point for transformative retellings such as Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" and Troma Entertainment's \"Romeo and Juliet\". Marcel Duchamp's \"L.H.O.O.Q.\" is a derivative of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\", one of thousands of derivative works based on the public domain painting.\n\nSome works may never fully lapse into the public domain. A perpetual crown copyright is held for the Authorized King James Version of the Bible in the UK.\n\nWhile the copyright has expired for the Peter Pan works by J. M. Barrie (the play \"Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\" and the novel \"Peter and Wendy\") in the United Kingdom, it was granted a special exception under the Copyright, Designs, and Patents Act 1988 (Schedule 6) that requires royalties to be paid for commercial performances, publications and broadcasts of the story of Peter Pan within the UK, as long as Great Ormond Street Hospital (to whom Barrie gave the copyright) continues to exist.\n\nIn a paying public domain regime, works that have entered the public domain after their copyright has expired, or traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions that have never been subject to copyright, are still subject to royalties payable to the state or to an authors' association. The user does not have to seek permission to copy, present or perform the work, but does have to pay the fee. Typically the royalties are directed to support of living artists.\n\nThe Creative Commons proposed in 2010 the \"Public Domain Mark\" (PDM) as symbol to indicate that a work is free of known copyright restrictions and therefore in the public domain. The public domain mark is analogous to the copyright symbol, which acts as copyright notice. The Europeana databases use it, and for instance on the Wikimedia Commons in February 2016 2.9 million works (~10% of all works) are listed as \"PDM\".\n\nThe underlying idea that is expressed or manifested in the creation of a work generally cannot be the subject of copyright law (see idea–expression divide). Mathematical formulae will therefore generally form part of the public domain, to the extent that their expression in the form of software is not covered by copyright.\n\nWorks created before the existence of copyright and patent laws also form part of the public domain. For example, the Bible and the inventions of Archimedes are in the public domain. However, translations or new formulations of these works may be copyrighted in themselves.\n\nDetermination of whether a copyright has expired depends on an examination of the copyright in its source country.\n\nIn the United States, determining whether a work has entered the public domain or is still under copyright can be quite complex, primarily because copyright terms have been extended multiple times and in different ways—shifting over the course of the 20th century from a fixed-term based on first publication, with a possible renewal term, to a term extending to 50, then 70, years after the death of the author. The claim that \"pre-1923 works are in the public domain\" is correct only for published works; unpublished works are under federal copyright for at least the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nIn most other countries that are signatories to the Berne Convention, copyright term is based on the life of the author, and extends to 50 or 70 years beyond the death of the author. (See List of countries' copyright lengths.)\n\nLegal traditions differ on whether a work in the public domain can have its copyright restored. In the European Union, the Copyright Duration Directive was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain. Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based formalities requirements. Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of compliance with formalities, while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.\n\nWorks of the United States Government and various other governments are excluded from copyright law and may therefore be considered to be in the public domain in their respective countries. They may also be in the public domain in other countries as well. The legal scholar Melville Nimmer has written that \"it is axiomatic that material in the public domain is not protected by copyright, even when incorporated into a copyrighted work\".\n\nBefore 1988 in the US, works could be easily given into the public domain by just releasing it without an explicit Copyright notice. With the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (and the earlier Copyright Act of 1976, which went into effect in 1978), all works were by default copyright protected and needed to be actively given into public domain by a waiver statement/anti-copyright can call notice. Not all legal systems have processes for reliably donating works to the public domain, e.g. civil law of continental Europe. This may even \"effectively prohibit any attempt by copyright owners to surrender rights automatically conferred by law, particularly moral rights\".\n\nAn alternative is for copyright holders to issue a licence which irrevocably grants as many rights as possible to the general public. Real public domain makes licenses unnecessary, as no owner/author is required to grant permission (\"Permission culture\"). There are multiple licenses which aim to release works into the public domain. In 2000 the WTFPL was released as a public domain like software license. In 2009 the Creative commons released the CC0, which was created for compatibility with law domains which have no concept of \"dedicating into public domain\". This is achieved by a public domain waiver statement and a fall-back all-permissive license, in case the waiver is not possible. The Unlicense, published around 2010, has a focus on an Anti-copyright message. The Unlicense offers a public domain waiver text with a fall-back public domain-like license inspired by permissive licenses but without attribution.\n\nIn October 2014 the Open Knowledge Foundation recommends the Creative Commons CC0 license to dedicate content to the public domain, and the \"Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)\" for data.\n\nIn most countries, the term of rights for patents is 20 years, after which the invention becomes part of the public domain. In the United States, the contents of patents are considered valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of filing within the United States or 20 years from the earliest date of filing if under 35 USC 120, 121, or 365(c). However, the \"text\" and any \"illustration\" within a patent, provided the illustrations are essentially line drawings and do not in any substantive way reflect the \"personality\" of the person drawing them, are not subject to copyright protection. This is separate from the \"patent\" rights just mentioned.\n\nA trademark registration may remain in force indefinitely, or expire without specific regard to its age. For a trademark registration to remain valid, the owner must continue to use it. In some circumstances, such as disuse, failure to assert trademark rights, or common usage by the public without regard for its intended use, it could become generic, and therefore part of the public domain.\n\nBecause trademarks are registered with governments, some countries or trademark registries may recognize a mark, while others may have determined that it is generic and not allowable as a trademark in that registry. For example, the drug \"acetylsalicylic acid\" (2-acetoxybenzoic acid) is better known as \"aspirin\" in the United States—a generic term. In Canada, however, \"Aspirin\", with an uppercase A, is still a trademark of the German company Bayer, while aspirin, with a lowercase \"a\", is not. Bayer lost the trademark in the United States, the UK and France after World War I, as part of the Treaty of Versailles. So many copycat products entered the marketplace during the war that it was deemed generic just three years later.\n\nBayer also lost the trademark in the same jurisdictions for \"Heroin\" which it trademarked a year before it trademarked Aspirin.\n\nAlthough Hormel resigned itself to genericide, it has fought attempts by other companies to register \"spam\" as a trademark in relation to computer products.\n\nPublic Domain Day is an observance of when copyrights expire and works enter into the public domain. This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual copyright laws of each country.\n\nThe observance of a \"Public Domain Day\" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist), with support for the idea echoed by Lawrence Lessig. a Public Domain Day website lists the authors whose works are entering the public domain. There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day.\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1914 by Antoni Puig i Castelló in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The company is still managed by the Puig family.\n\nPuig markets its products in 150 countries and is directly present in 22 of them, employing 4,472 people worldwide. In 2017, it reached €1.935 billion in net revenues and €228 million in net income.\n\nBoth in the fashion and fragrances sector, Puig operates under the Nina Ricci, Carolina Herrera, and Paco Rabanne brands. In the fashion industry, it is also the majority shareholder of Jean Paul Gaultier. In perfumes, it also operates under the license of the brands Comme des Garçons, Prada, Penhaligon's, L'Artisan Parfumeur and Valentino, amongst others.\n\nThe company's origins date back to 1914 when Antonio Puig Castelló founded the company. Initially the company took the name of its founder, being called Antonio Puig SA. From the beginning, the company oriented its business towards the cosmetic and fragrance sectors.\n\nIn 1922, the company marketed \"Milady\", the first lipstick made in Spain.\n\nIn the 1940s the company started marketing the fragrance Agua Lavanda Puig, which became one of the flagship products of the company. During those same years, the founder Antonio Puig decided to move the factory and offices to a building located in Travessera de Gràcia street, in the Gràcia district in Barcelona, where the headquarters of the company still remain today.\n\nIn the following years, the four sons of the founder joined the company. Although the transition took place gradually, Antonio Puig eventually delegated its decision-making to his sons: Antonio and Mariano would focus on the perfume area, Jose Maria on the diversification department, and Enrique on the institutional relationships.\n\nThe international expansion of the company began in 1959 with the building of a new factory in the industrial estate Besòs, in Barcelona, and also with the creation of the first branch office outside Spain, in the United States. The US branch office was boosted by a letter written by a Spanish student in the University of Iowa, who lamented the impossibility of buying Agua Lavanda Puig in the US, as it was confirmed years later by company sources.\n\nIn 1968, Puig opened a branch office in Paris, at the same time that the company incorporated the Spanish designer brand Paco Rabanne. In 1969, as a result of this collaboration the fragrance \"Calandre\" began to be marketed. In 1976, the company built a perfumery factory in Chartres, France. In 1987 Puig acquired Paco Rabanne's Fashion House.\n\nOne of the key milestones in the international expansion was the agreement reached in the 1980s with the Venezuelan designer Carolina Herrera in New York City to create and market all her fragrances. Years later, in 1995, Carolina Herrara fashion business area also joined Puig.\n\nIn January 2015, Puig acquired fragrance brands Penhaligons and L'Artisan Parfumeur.\n\nIn 1997, Puig reached an agreement with Antonio Banderas for the creation and subsequent commercialization of the brand \" Antonio Banderas Fragrances\". The following year the company acquired the brand Nina Ricci, keeping up with the policy of acquiring prestigious brands. Due to business growth, in 1999 the Puig family refounded the company, renaming it Puig Beauty & Fashion Group, but maintaining the same structure and the three business lines: fashion, fragrances and cosmetics.\n\nIn line with its expansion policy, Puig acquired Spanish companies Perfumes Gal and Myrurgia. These operations strengthened\nPuig leadership in the Spanish market. Also as the result of these procurements the brands Adolfo Dominguez, Massimo Dutti and Heno de Pravia, among others, were assimilated into Puig.\n\nIn 2002, the Japanese fashion firm Comme des Garçons joined the company and only a year later it was the turn of the Italian Prada. Both companies became part of Puig’s catalogue of fragrances.\n\nIn the 2000s, there were changes in the company’s managing team, with Marc Puig, member of the third generation of the family, becoming the new General Director and eventually CEO in 2007, leaving Manuel Puig as vice president. In 2008 the new management reached an agreement with the Colombian singer Shakira for the development of her fragrances.\n\nIn 2009 Puig Beauty & Fashion Group changed its trade name for the second time, becoming known simply as Puig.\n\nThe latest brands to be incorporated into the Puig structure are the ones from the Italian designer Valentino (in 2010) and French Jean Paul Gaultier. For this last one, Puig also became the majority shareholder, buying the 45% of the shares Jean Paul Gaultier Fashion House from the French group Hermès and 10% of Jean Paul Gaultier himself, who nevertheless retained the artistic direction of the brand that bears his name. During 2013, Puig moved its headquarters in France to the well known Champs-Élysées in Paris.\n\nIn 2014, the company celebrated the centenary of its establishment with the inauguration of the new headquarters, located in Plaza de Europa of Hospitalet de Llobregat, called Torre Puig. This tower is a work of architect Rafael Moneo, laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize, and GCA Arquitectos. The building was inaugurated by the Prince of Asturias. The Tower got the Leed Gold certificate, in recognition for the building's environmental quality. At the entrance of the building there is a statue from Joan Miró, ceded for 2 years by Fundació Joan Miró.\n\nPuig currently has five production plants, four of them located in Europe and another in Mexico, producing 331 million units of perfume each year. With that production, in 2010 Puig reached a worldwide share of 7.6% of the fragrance business, whereas five years earlier its global share was 3.5%. This means that Puig obtained 35% of the worldwide growth within this five-year period.\n\nPuig commercializes its products in 150 countries and is directly present in 22 of them, employing 4,472 people worldwide. In 2015, turnover reached 1935 million euros in net revenues and 228 million euros in net income.\n\nThe Puig family has always been strongly linked to the sailing world, especially in the figure of the late Enrique Puig, director of the company, president of the Salón Náutico and the Royal Barcelona Yacht Club. The company was the sponsor of the Copa del Rey de Vela from 1984 to 2006.\n\nPuig was the shipowner and sponsor of the sailing «Azur de Puig». This boat participated in the most important sailing events worldwide. One of the usual crew of the sailboat was the Infanta Cristina, youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos I.\n\nSince 2008, in collaboration with the Royal Barcelona Yacht Club, the company boosts and sponsors the \"Puig Vela Clàssica\" race, which is held in Barcelona waters in July every year. The main feature of this race is that it is reserved for traditional and classical boats only. This regatta is one of the main classical sailboats races of all those celebrated worldwide.\n"}

It consists of carving and polishing tree roots into various artistic creations.\n\nUsing roots to make necessities has been practiced since primitive society. Like other artistic crafts, art of roots produced from primitive labor. The earliest root carvings are “辟邪” and “角形器” showing up in the Warring States period.\n\nIn the Sui and Tang dynasties, root carving works not only prevailed in folk, but they were also cherished by the governing class. In the Tang dynasty, people laid emphasis on the natural forms of roots, cleverly taking advantage of the effect of corrosion and moth-eaten.\n\nIn the Song and Yuan dynasties, art of root carving not only developed in the court and folk, but also appeared in grottoes and temples. Roots were used to carve the statues of the Buddha, always comparing favorably with the clay.\n\nRoot carving preserves natural beauty. Ancient artists created lifelike and vivid works by a special technique using expression based on the roots' natural forms. This kind of creation is not completely artificial, but created by both human beings and nature.\n\nRoot carving is different from engraving. It combines peculiarity with ingeniousness. Although its aesthetic principals share common ground with engraving, at the same time they are applied uniquely. The common ground is that they share expressive techniques of wood carving, sculpture, stone carving and so on, overcoming weaknesses by acquiring others strong points. The difference lies in the natural shape of roots. During the creative process, root carving mostly maintains the natural form of the root, adding some artificial polishing. In other words, root carving is guided by the inherent qualities of the root, rather than by shaping images merely through carving.\n\nCreative effect achieved from the same material can vary from artist to artist. Within the field three factors are considered of major importance.\n\n\n\n"}

The center is spread over an undulating terrain of about 70 acres of land, surrounded by the Aravali mountains. Shilpgram is an ethnographic museum that depicts the lifestyles of the folk and tribal people of the region. With an objective of increasing awareness and knowledge about the rural arts and crafts, the Shilpgram provides opportunity to rural and urban artists to come together and interact through the process of camps and workshops.\n\nThe Complex has an open air Amphitheatre with a seating capacity of approximately 8000, used for the major theatre festivals held here, and the traditional folk performing arts. Each member state of the West Zone has traditional huts built within the Shilpgram, derivative of certain basic occupations fundamental to the way of life of the people of the area and also central to the culture of the country. In these traditional huts, household articles of everyday use, like terracotta, textile, wooden and metal items, decorative objects and implements are featured with appropriate signage and explanatory details with the objective to give a realistic glimpse of the people and their belongings.\n\nThe huts are constructed around an interlocking occupational theme. In this integrated pattern are five huts from Rajasthan, representing the weavers' community from Marwar, pottery from the hilly areas of Mewar and the tribal farmer communities of the Bhil and the Sehariyas .Apart from the state's own representation, there are seven representative huts from the state of Gujarat, five from the state of Maharashtra and five featuring the arts and crafts of Goa.\n\nThe Shilpgram Festival is organised every year from 21 December to 31 December. The Shilpgram Fair (\"Shilpgram Mela\"), a part of the festive celebrations, serves as a destination for hand woven clothes, embroideries, mirror works and handicrafts.The Mela aids in encouraging the urban potters, visual artists and designers and the cottage industry of Rajasthan. The Festival provides opportunities for learning the craft skills through various workshops. Cultural programmes during the evening and the local food stalls attract many visitors and locals.\n\nShilpdarshan is a continuing activity at Shilpgram in which traditional performing artists and craftsmen are used to draw from the interior villages of the member states. They are regularly invited to exhibit their skill and to demonstrate their crafts, and sell their works in order to have direct access to the buyers. This programme has been initiated with an aim to encourage rural craftsmen and performers.\n\n"}

Such rhymes have been recorded in all cultures where skipping is played. Examples of English-language rhymes have been found going back to at least the 17th century. Like most folklore, skipping rhymes tend to be found in many different variations. The article includes those chants used by English speaking children.\n\nExplorers reported seeing aborigines jumping with vines in the 16th century. European boys started jumping rope in the early 17th century. The activity was considered indecent for girls because they might show their ankles. There were no associated chants. This changed in the early 18th century. Girls began to jump rope. They added the chants, owned the rope, controlled the game, and decided who participated.\n\nIn the United States, domination of the activity by girls occurred when their families moved into the cities in the late 19th century. There, they found sidewalks and other smooth surfaces conducive to jumping rope, along with a host of contemporaries.\n\nAnother source suggests that, prior to 1833, the invention of pantalettes, enabled girls to jump rope without displaying ankles.\n\nChants are intended to structure the game and are secondary, explaining the nonsense or irrational lyrics. These chants are unusual inasmuch as they were transmitted from child to child usually without an underlying reason, as opposed to nursery rhymes which were transmitted from adult to child and often contained a moral. Chants may contain girlish references to boyfriends or marriage.\n\nTwo girls with a long rope stood about apart and turned the rope as other children took turns jumping. If one were not a good jumper, one would be an 'Ever-Laster,' that is, one would perpetually turn the rope. When it was a child's turn to jump, she would enter as the rope turned, and jump to the rhyme until she missed. Then she would become a rope-turner, and the next child in line would take her place.\n\nFor a line of potential jumpers, the jumpers were restricted on time by the length of the chant/ They jumped in at the beginning, jumped out at the end and the next jumper took their turn.\n\nIn another version, the teacher is \"Benjamin Franklin.\"\nIn the Charlie Chaplin rhyme, the child jumping had to follow directions as the rope was turning: touching the heel of one foot on the ground; touching the toe of the same foot on the ground; doing a (short) split of the feet, turning around, saluting, bowing, and jumping out from the turning rope on the last line. This rhyme, c. 1942, reflects children's awareness of World War II (The Queen to whom we bowed was the mother of the present Queen of England).\n\nAn Australian version of the Charlie Chaplin Skipping Song, as sung at Salisbury Primary School in Brisbane, Australia in the mid 1950s, is as follows:\n\nThere's also \"Betty Grable went to France,/To teach the soldiers how to dance.\" (The rest is the same.)\n\nAnother variation:\n\nIn Dublin, Ireland, the visits of inspectors known as \"Glimmer men\" to private houses to enforce regulations to prevent the use of coal gas in restricted hours during the Emergency gave rise to: \n\nMost rhymes are intended to count the number of jumps the skipper takes without stumbling. These were essentially restricted to times when there were relatively few jumpers and time was abundant. These rhymes can take very simple forms.\n\nThis chant was collected in London in the 1950s:\n\nand\n\nalternately, \"Salt, vinegar, mustard, pepper. How many legs does a spider have? 1,2,3, etc.\"\n\nAnother rendition substitutes, \"teddy bear\" for \"butterfly. This can be dated no earlier than the early 20th century, to the term of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nIn another skipping rhyme, once the alphabet finishes, participants continue with numbers until skipper catches rope. It is natural for participants to use the letter that the skipper lost on and to use it to find someone's name following the rule of either best friend or boyfriend, depending on what is chosen in the beginning.\nor\n\nor\n\nor\n\nAnother counting rhyme:\nThe counting continues as long as the jumper avoids faulting. If they do then the counting starts again.:\n\n\nChinese jump rope patterns are often accompanied by chants. The diamonds pattern is accompanied by the letters which spell \"diamond\" (\"D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S.\"), while the Americans pattern, as are many patterns, is accompanied by the names of the moves made while carrying out the pattern (\"right, left, right, left, in, out/open, in, on.\").\n\nSome rhymes are intended to test the agility of the jumper by turning the rope more rapidly. The key word to start turning fast is often \"pepper\" to indicate speed, such as:\n\n\n\"Pretty Little Dutch Girl\" was a lengthy song, much too long for a simple chant, but often excerpted for jumping rope. \"My husband's name is Fatty. He comes from Cincinnati.\" Or alphabetical, \"My husband's name is Alfred, He comes from Atlanta, He works in the attic..\" All made up on the spur of the moment. The jumper may be obliged to jump out upon finishing a letter, or be allowed to continue until either failing to invent new lyrics, or faulting.\n\nOther rhymes are highly topical, and sometimes survive long after the events that inspired them have disappeared from the headlines. Perhaps the most notorious rhyme of this type is one that began circulating during the 1892 trial of Lizzie Borden. Despite Lizzie's desire to stay out of the public eye, children would follow her around and chant the rhyme. It later started being used as a rhyme used when skipping-rope:\n\n\nThis one from Prohibition:\n\nChildren were often the first to notice differences between people and comment on them. Various chants reflect the lack of association with other cultures up until the 1960s or so; such as:\n\n\n\n"}

Despite his homosexuality, in 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer Freya Stark. The marriage was dissolved in 1952.\n\nBorn in Hallow, Worcestershire, into a distinguished ecclesiastical family, Stewart Perowne was the grandson of John Perowne, the Bishop of Worcester, and the son of Helena Frances (née Oldnall-Russell) (1869–1922) and Arthur William Thomson Perowne, who was the first Bishop of Bradford and subsequently also Bishop of Worcester. His older brother was Francis Edward Perowne (1898–1988). His younger brother, Leslie Arthur Perowne (1906–1997), was Head of Music at the BBC and was responsible for bringing Albert Ketèlbey out of retirement to conduct a huge BBC Ketèlbey Concert at the Royal Albert Hall prior to World War II.\n\nPerowne was educated at Haileybury College, where he was a champion sprinter, and at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied Classical Archaeology and Architecture He then studied at Harvard where he gained a graduate degree in Classics. He went to Palestine in 1927 under the British Mandate, as Head of Education in the Palestine Government Education Service, teaching at the Anglican St George's School in Jerusalem. He became fluent in spoken and written Arabic. In 1930 Perowne transferred to the administrative branch of the Palestine Government, working for a time as Assistant District Commissioner for Galilee. In 1931 he was appointed an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John.\n\nHe later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel. He was awarded the Coronation Medal in 1937. In 1938 Perowne worked for the BBC, preparing talks and features for transmission by the overseas Arabic service. In the same year he deposited a collection of potsherds with the British Museum, most of which are of Bronze Age type and probably derive from the ancient site of Subr. In 1939 he was appointed Public Information Officer in Aden, where he developed a passion for archaeology, and where he discovered the seventh century BC sites of Imadiya and Beihan. In 1941 Perowne was appointed Public Relations Officer to the British embassy in Baghdad. In 1944 he succeeded the scholar Vyvyan Holt as oriental counsellor.\n\nDuring his diplomatic postings he designed stamps for Malta (1936), the Aden Protectorate (1938), Barbados (1949), Libya (1951), and currency notes for the West Indies Federation (1949) and Libya (1951).\n\nBecause of his career as a diplomat it was expected that Perowne should marry. As a homosexual he decided to embark on a mariage blanc, and on 7 October 1947 he married the explorer and travel writer Freya Stark at St Margaret's church in Westminster. She was his senior by eight years and had been his assistant in Yemen when he was Information Officer. Stark's biographer has argued that she may not have known of Perowne's homosexuality, and of his taste for men in uniform. \"In 1947 people's sexual proclivities were still part of their private lives and … no one among Freya's friends seemed able to warn her of the pitfalls of marriage to a homosexual.\" Confused as to why Perowne would not sleep with her, she wrote to him, \"I think you have left something lying between us, untold. Whatever it is, it will not make me think less of you or care less for you.\" Eventually, after skirting around the subject, he wrote to her:\nIt is difficult to say what \"normal\" is – my friend a counsellor of St. George's Hospital always refuses to use the word and in both men and women, you have a wide and graded range from ultra-male to ultra-female with naturally most people in the middle ranges ... Now for myself, I put myself in the middle group. I have ordinary male abilities. I like male sports some of them, and I love the company of women. In fact, I find it hard to exist without it. At the same time, I am occasionally attracted by members of my own sex – generally. For some even pleasurable reason – by wearers of uniform.\nDespite their similar interests the marriage could not survive and they divorced in 1952. There were no children.\n\nIn 1947 Perowne was appointed Colonial Secretary to Barbados where he was a member of the island's Legislative Council before becoming political adviser in Cyrenaica from 1950 to 1951. Here he discovered the ancient city-site of Aziris. Taking early retirement in 1951, after his divorce in 1952 he returned to Palestine, now the State of Israel, where he assisted Weston Henry Stewart, the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem in designing and organising model villages for Palestinian Arabs who had been made refugees as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He was an Adviser to the UK delegation to the UN Assembly in Paris in November 1951. During this period he also began to write, his first book being \"Jerusalem, The One Remains\" (1954). Later books included \"The Life and Times of Herod the Great\" (1958), \"The Later Herods\" (1958), \"Hadrian\" (1960), \"Caesars and Saints\" (1962), \"The End of the Roman World\" (1966), and \"The Death of the Roman Republic\" (1969). Other books among the 18 he wrote include guides to Athens, Jerusalem, Rome and Malta. In addition, he was a frequent contributor to various edited works, encyclopaedias and academic journals, including \"Antiquity\". Perowne was appointed OBE in 1944 and a Knight of the Venerable Order of Saint John (KStJ) in 1955. In 1957 he was named Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA). He was a Member of the Church of England Foreign Relations Council.\n\nPerowne died in 1989 at Charing Cross Hospital in London aged 87 years old. He was survived by his former wife, Freya Stark.\n\n\n\n"}

It stood in Blackfriars Road, near the junction with Westminster Bridge Road, in the London Borough of Southwark.\n\nThe \"Royal Circus\" was opened on 4 November 1782 by the composer and song writer, Charles Dibdin (who coined the word \"circus\"), aided by Charles Hughes, a well-known equestrian performer. The entertainments were at first performed by children with the goal of its being a nursery for young actors. Delphini, a celebrated buffo, became manager in 1788 and produced a spectacle including a real stag-hunt. Other animal acts followed, including the popular dog act \"Gelert and Victor\", lecture pieces, pantomimes and local spectacles. The popular comedian John Palmer then managed the theatre until 1789, when he was committed to Horsemonger Lane Gaol as \"a rogue and a vagabond\".\n\nIt continued in use until 1810, although it had a troubled existence, being burnt down in 1799 and again on 12 August 1805. Rebuilt in 1806 by the German architect of the Old Vic, Rudolph Cabanel, it was converted into a theatre by Robert Elliston. He renamed it the Surrey Theatre, being determined to perform Shakespeare and other plays. He reopened on Easter Monday and to avoid trouble with the law, which did not allow dialogue to be spoken without musical accompaniment except at the two patent theatres, he put a ballet into every such production, including \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\", and Farquhar's \"The Beaux' Stratagem\". Contemporary reviewers noted that the Lambeth streets teemed with prostitutes.\nElliston left in 1814, and the Surrey became a circus again until Thomas Dibdin reopened it as a theatre in 1816. The arena where the equestrian exercises had been displayed was converted into a large pit for spectators, and the stables became saloons. Fanny Fitzwilliam and Sally Brook starred in melodramas, but the theatre had little success overall. John Baldwin Buckstone made his first London appearance at the theatre, on 30 January 1823, as Ramsay in \"The Fortunes of Nigel\". George Holland also appeared at the theatre, in 1826.\n\nWhen Elliston returned in 1827, the theatre's fortunes changed. In 1829, Douglas Jerrold's melodrama \"Black-Eyed Susan\", with T. P. Cooke as \"William\", the nautical hero, ran for over 300 nights, which was extraordinarily successful for the time. Elliston made his last appearance at this theatre on 24 June 1831, twelve days before he died. Osbaldiston then took over and, among other plays, produced Edward Fitzball's \"Jonathan Bradford; or, the Murder at the Roadside Inn\", which ran for 260 nights. Productions of Dickens dramas, among others, followed. Ira Aldridge, the first successful black actor, appeared here in the 1840s. C. Z. Barnett's adaptation, \"A Christmas Carol; or, The Miser's Warning\" played in 1844. Richard Shepherd, who succeeded Alfred Bunn in 1848, remained at the theatre until 1869 and established its reputation for 'rough-and-tumble' transpontine melodrama.\n\nOn 29 January 1865, during the last scene of the pantomime \"Richard Coeur de Lion\", a fire began above the chandelier. The audience evacuated safely, but before the cast could leave the entire theatre was plunged into darkness, as the gas supervisor cut the gas supply to prevent an explosion. Panic ensued backstage, but the cast were led to safety through the burning scenery by the efforts of Green (acting manager), Rowella (the 'clown'), Evans (the 'pantaloon'), Vivian (the 'sprite') and others. The cast, still in their flimsy stage clothes, were conveyed to their lodgings in a fleet of cabs, provided by the police. In less than ten minutes the interior was ablaze, and the theatre was burnt down shortly after midnight.\n\nA new theatre, designed by John Ellis, seating 2,161 people in four tiers, opened on 26 December 1865. Little of note took place until 1881, when George Conquest took over, staging melodramas, many of them written by himself, and pantomimes.\n\nThe Surrey flourished until his death in 1901. The theatre was remodelled by Kirk and Kirk, as a music hall, but did not prosper, becoming a cinema in 1920. It finally closed in 1924, and the building was demolished in 1934. The site is now occupied by modern flats.\n\n\n"}

The artist enrolled at Columbia University, Barnard College, New York, in 1988. After graduating in 1991 (B.A., scenography / theatre) she attended the Bartlett School of Architecture and Planning in London to study light and lighting design (M.Sc.,1992).\nRottenbacher creates spacious installations assembled from individual sculptural elements best to be described as light-colour corpuses. They are made of perspex constructs equipped on their inside with LED lights and painted on their outside with dynamic stripe-patterns. Suspended from the ceiling by strands of wire, the sculptures seem to be floating in space. Others are placed on the ground, either free standing or simply laid down. Truncated forms seem to merge into the architecture, apparently progressing into walls and floors. All such elements may be presented individually or pooled to form larger ensembles that function as site-specific intenventions.\nIn Rottenbacher's sculptures, the coloured light firstly correlates with the stripe-painting and the form of the perspex corpus. It then als interacts vividly with the specific light dynamic of the surrounding space creating a form of a continuous dialogue. Given a strong surrounding light, colour and form seem to be very much focussed on the sculpture´s specific form. With decreasing daylight, the work increasingly radiates into the space in an occupying manner. Changing daylight allows for a spectacle of great poetic power to occur, showcasing the sculpture as its bright and shining \"hero\".\nAlthough she creates massive sculptural bodies and spacious installations, Rottenbacher's sculptures are generally characterized by particular lightness and transparency. Often enough these playfully enter into an exciting and ironic tribute playing dialogue with the works of some of the most prolific sculptors of the 20th century. (text: Rafael von Uslar)\n\n\n"}

It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1979 by Gollancz and won the Cheltenham Festival Literary Prize. The stories share a theme of being closely based upon fairytales or folk tales. However, Carter has stated:\n\nThe anthology contains ten stories: \"The Bloody Chamber\", \"The Courtship of Mr Lyon\", \"The Tiger's Bride\", \"Puss-in-Boots\", \"The Erl-King\", \"The Snow Child\", \"The Lady of the House of Love\", \"The Werewolf\", \"The Company of Wolves\" and \"Wolf-Alice\".\n\nThe tales vary greatly in length, with the novelette \"The Bloody Chamber\" being \"more than twice the length of any of the other stories, and more than thirty times the length of the shortest [the vignette \"The Snow Child\"].\"\n\nThe anthology's contents are also reprinted in Carter's \"Burning Your Boats\".\n\nThe stories within \"The Bloody Chamber\" are explicitly based on fairy tales. Carter was no doubt inspired by the works of author and fairytale collector Charles Perrault, whose fairy tales she had translated shortly beforehand.\n\nThe narrator, a beautiful teenage girl, marries an older, wealthy French Marquis, whom she does not love. When he takes her to his castle, she discovers his collection of pornographic images and takes pleasure in her embarrassment. She is a talented pianist, and a young man, a blind piano tuner from the local town, hears her music, he falls in love with her. The narrator's husband tells her that he must leave on a business trip to New York and provides her with a chain of keys. However, he forbids her to enter one particular room while he is away. When he leaves she feels melancholy and telephones her mother. Afterwards, she starts going through the Marquis's things in order to learn more about him. She enters the forbidden room in his absence and realizes the full extent of his perverse and murderous tendencies when she discovers the bodies of his previous wives. She confides the newly discovered secret to the piano tuner when suddenly the Marquis returns home for his business trip was canceled. He discovers that she has entered the room and proceeds to try to add her to his collection of corpses through beheading. The brave piano tuner is willing to stay with her even though he knows he will not be able to save her. She is saved at the last moment at the end of the story by her mother, who bursts into the mansion and shoots the Marquis just as he is about to murder the girl. The girl, her mother and the piano tuner go on to live together and the young widow opens a little music school on the outskirts of Paris. Most of the money she inherited is given away to various charities and the castle is turned into a school for the blind.\n\nBeauty's father, after experiencing car trouble, takes advantage of a stranger's hospitality. However, his benefactor – the Beast – takes umbrage when he steals a miraculous white rose for his beloved daughter. Beauty becomes the guest of the leonine Beast, and the Beast aids her father in getting his fortune back. Beauty later joins her father in London, where she almost forgets the Beast, causing him to wither away from heartache. When Beauty learns that he is dying, she returns, saving him. Beauty and the Beast disclose their love for one another and the Beast's humanity is revealed. They live happily ever after.\n\nA woman moves in with a mysterious, masked \"Milord\", the Beast, after her father loses her to him in a game of cards. Milord is eventually revealed to be a tiger. In a reversal of the ending of \"The Courtship of Mr Lyon\", the heroine transforms at the end into a glorious tiger who is the proper mate to the Beast, who will from now on be true to his own nature and not disguise himself as a human.\n\nFigaro, a cat, moves in with a rakish young man who lives a happily debauched life. They live a carefree existence, with the cat helping him to make money by cheating at cards, until the young man actually falls in love (to the cat's disgust) with a young woman kept in a tower by a miserly, older husband who treats her only as property. The cat, hoping his friend will tire of the woman if he has her, helps the young man into the bed of his sweetheart by playing tricks on the old husband and the young woman's keeper. Figaro himself finds love with the young woman's cat, and the two cats arrange the fortunes of both themselves and the young man and woman by arranging to trip the old man so that he will fall to his death.\n\nAngela Carter had described Puss in Boots as “the Cat as Con Man... a masterpiece of cynicism... a Figaroesque valet – a servant so much the master already”.\n\nA maiden wanders into the woods and is seduced by the sinister Erl-King, a seeming personification of the forest itself. However, she eventually realises that he plans to imprison her by turning her into a bird, which he has done with other girls. Realising the Erl-King's plan, she kills him by strangling him with his own hair, thus keeping her freedom.\n\nA Count and Countess go riding in midwinter. The Count sees snow on the ground and wishes for a child \"as white as snow\". Similar wishes are made when the Count sees a hole in the snow containing a pool of blood, and a raven. As soon as he made his final wish a young woman of the exact description appears at the side of the road. The Count pays immediate attention to her, much to the chagrin of the Countess. At the Countess' command, the girl picks a rose but is pricked by a thorn and dies, after which the Count rapes her corpse. After this, her cadaver melts into the snow, leaving nothing but a bloodstain on the snow, a black feather and the rose that she had picked.\n\nA virginal English soldier, travelling through Romania by bicycle, finds himself in a deserted village. He comes across a mansion inhabited by a vampire who survives by enticing young men into her bedroom and feeding on them. She intends to feed on the young soldier but his purity and virginity have a curious effect on her. When they enter her bedroom she accidentally cuts herself and the soldier kisses it better. He wakes up to find her dead. He leaves to return to his battalion and is assumed to be killed in World War I.\n\nA girl goes to visit her grandmother, but encounters a werewolf on the way, whose paw she cuts off with a knife. When she reaches her grandmother's house, the paw has turned into a hand with the grandmother's ring on it, and the grandmother is both delirious and missing her hand. This reveals the girl's grandmother as the werewolf, and she is stoned to death. The girl then inherits all of her grandmother's possessions.\n\nA closer look into the story might suggest that in fact the girl had set up her grandmother through a set of convenient lies, in order to gain her inheritance. For example, the snow covering any evidence of a struggle with the wolf.\n\n\"Those are the voices of my brothers, darling; I love the company of wolves.\"\n\nIn the beginning of the piece, the wolf is described as an evil thing. One mini story in the beginning is about a witch who turned a whole wedding ceremony into wolves. She likes them coming to her cabin and howling their misery for it soothes her. In another mini story a young lady and a man are about to have sex on their wedding night. As they get ready the husband says he needs to stop and relieve himself in the forest. The wife waits and he never returns. Off in the distance a wolf can be heard howling. She then figures her husband will never return and marries a new man. With her new husband she bears children. Her first husband comes back and sees his wife. The first husband then becomes furious and bites the leg off the eldest child. Her second husband kills the wolf, who dies and looks exactly the same as he had when he disappeared; this makes her cry and her husband beats her. Later we meet a girl walking in the woods. She was loved by everyone and feared nothing. She meets a handsome hunter who makes a deal with her; whoever can get to the grandmother's house first wins, and if the hunter wins she owes him a kiss. She lets the hunter win because she wants to kiss him. The hunter arrives at the grandmother's house tricking her. She is frail and sick. She holds a Bible in her hand for protection. He eats the grandmother, then waits for the girl. When she arrives, she notices her grandmother's hair in the fire and knows the wolf has killed her. He threatens to kill and eat her too, but she laughs in his face and proceeds to seduce him, stripping off their clothes and throwing them into the fire. The last lines are \"See! sweet and sound she sleeps in granny's bed, between the paws of the tender wolf.\"\n\nA feral child, whom some nuns have attempted to \"civilize\" by trying to teach her standard social graces, is left in the house of a monstrous, vampiric Duke when she cannot conform. She gradually comes to realise her own identity as a young woman and human being, and even develops compassion for the Duke, going far beyond the nuns' stunted views of life.\n\n\"The Bloody Chamber\" was first published in 1979, though many of the stories within the collection are reprints from other sources, such as magazines, radio and other collections. Only two are completely original to this collection, though many were revised or changed slightly from their previously published versions for this collection.\n\nThe stories' various origins are listed below\n\n\nAngela Carter's short stories challenge the way women are represented in fairy tales, yet retain an air of tradition and convention through her voluptuously descriptive prose. For example, in the opening tale \"The Bloody Chamber\" which is a retelling of Bluebeard, Carter plays with the conventions of canonical fairy tales; instead of the heroine being rescued by the stereotypical male hero, she is rescued by her mother.\n\nCarter effectively draws out the theme of feminism by contrasting traditional elements of Gothic fiction – which usually depicted female characters as weak and helpless – with strong female protagonists. By contrasting the barren and horrific atmosphere found typically within the Gothic to the strong heroines of her story, Carter is able to create sexually liberated female characters that are set against the more traditional backdrop of the fairy tale. In doing so, Carter reinvents the outdated conventions of fairy tales and offers insight on the archetypes and stereotypes of women in these well-known and celebrated stories. It is notable that the conventions Carter analyzes and reimagines are of a patriarchal nature. Many of the original fairy tales that she draws inspiration from illustrate female characters in a vulnerable, damsel-in-distress position. It is clear that in giving her female characters more agency, Carter is directly responding to and critiquing these traditional patriarchal tropes. \n\nThe stories deal with themes of women's roles in relationships and marriage, their sexuality, coming of age and corruption. Stories such as \"The Bloody Chamber\" and \"The Company of Wolves\" explicitly deal with the horrific or corrupting aspects of marriage and/or sex and the balance of power within such relationships. Themes of female identity are explored in the \"Beauty and the Beast\" stories such as \"The Tiger's Bride\". In one instance, Beauty: the story's heroine, is described as removing the petals from a white rose as her father gambles her away, a seeming representation of the stripping away of the false layers of her personality to find her true identity; an image that finds a mirror in the story's fantastical conclusion.\n\nAs a whole, \"The Bloody Chamber\" can be treated as a collection of short stories that speak to a bigger narrative that deals with issues of feminism and metamorphosis instead of a set of individual tales. Although each particular narrative deals with a different set of characters, the 'oppressed female seeking liberation' is a common theme and concept that is explored throughout the collection. The characters seem to blend into each other and become indistinguishable from one another when recognising this theme in the text.\n\nThe time periods of the stories remain vague. For example, in \"The Bloody Chamber\" the existence of a transatlantic telephone implies a date of 1930 or later. On the other hand, the mention of painters such as Gustave Moreau and Odilon Redon, and of fashion designer Paul Poiret (who designs one of the heroine's gowns) all suggest a date before 1945. \"The Lady of the House of Love\" is clearly set on the eve of the First World War, and the young man's bicycle on which he arrives at the tradition-bound vampire's house is a symbol of the encroaching modernity which fundamentally altered European society after 1914.\n\n\"The Bloody Chamber\" won the Cheltenham Festival Literary Prize in 1979.\n\n\"The Bloody Chamber\" has received heavy praise and attention from numerous critics such as Jack Zipes (who called it a \"remarkable collection\") and Marina Warner (who, on its inspirational nature, said it \"turned the key for [her] as a writer\").\n\nSeveral critical works have been published that focus on Carter's use of fairy tales in \"The Bloody Chamber\" and her other works and the anthology is also frequently taught and studied in University literature courses.\n\nIt has been used as part of the AQA English Literature, the OCR English Literature and Edexcel English Language/Literature syllabus for A-Levels in some schools in the United Kingdom.\n\nNeil Gaiman cited the book as one of his inspirations.\n\nThe critic \"Patricia Duncker\", however, was more reserved in her praise, criticising it for not breaking enough taboos. She said 'Carter could never have imagined Cinderella in bed with the fairy God-mother.'\n\nCarter later adapted \"The Company of Wolves\" and \"Puss-in-Boots\" into radio plays which were broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 1980 and 1982 respectively. The 1982 adaptation of \"Puss in Boots\" (as it was retitled) starred Andrew Sachs in the title role. The scripts for both of these plays were published in Carter's \"Come Unto These Yellow Sands\" and later the posthumous collection \"The Curious Room\", which also included production notes.\n\nThe 1984 film \"The Company of Wolves\" by Neil Jordan was based upon the werewolf stories in this collection, in particular the Little Red Riding Hood analogue \"The Company of Wolves\". Carter also directly contributed to the screenplay of this film, which bears close resemblance to her 1980 radio play adaptation of \"The Company of Wolves.\" Carter's original screenplay for this film is published in \"The Curious Room\". Jordan and Carter also discussed producing a film adaptation of \"Vampirella\", the radio drama that became \"The Lady of the House of Love\", but this project was never released.\n\nPunk band Daisy Chainsaw adapted the story of \"The Lady of the House of Love\" for their 1992 music video for \"Hope Your Dreams Come True\" (from the EP of the same name and also later the album \"Eleventeen\").\n\nThe stories within \"The Bloody Chamber\" are a popular subject for theatrical adaptation. The story \"The Bloody Chamber\" has been adapted for the theatre more than once, including a performance by the \"Zoo District\" which was accompanied by an amateur film adaptation of \"Wolf-Alice\". \"The Company of Wolves\" is also a popular subject for adaptation by amateur/student theatre groups (e.g. by a Welsh drama college).\n\nNeil Murray directed a haunting and erotic theatre production of Carter's story 'The Tiger's Bride' in 2001 at the Gulbenkian Studio, Newcastle Playhouse. Murray comments on his interest in Carter's work and refers to her discussion of fairy tales as 'an important medium.'\n\nRead more: https://metro.co.uk/2008/09/22/neil-murray-on-his-adaptation-of-the-bloody-chamber-524305/?ito=cbshare\n\nIn August 2013, Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre presented a stage adaptation of The Bloody Chamber by writer Van Badham, directed by Matthew Lutton, with composers David Chisholm (scoring for three live harps) and Jethro Woodward (live and replayed electronic soundscore). Set and costumedesign were by Anna Cordingley with lighting designer Paul Jackson. Save for a relatively brief appearance by Shelly Lauman, the piece was in essence performed by Alison Whyte. The three harpists were Jacinta Dennett, Jess Fotinos, and Yinuo Mu.\n\nThe band The Parlour Trick featured a song called \"The Lady of the House of Love\" on their 2012 album \"A Blessed Unrest\". Angela Carter is listed as an inspiration in the album notes.\nWolf Alice is a band which named themselves after the story in the anthology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18565798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18565798", "title": "The Most Incredible Thing", "text": "The Most Incredible Thing\n\n“The Most Incredible Thing\" () is a literary fairy tale by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875). The story is about a contest to find the most incredible thing and the wondrous consequences when the winner is chosen. The tale was first published in an English translation by Horace Scudder, an American correspondent of Andersen's, in the United States in September 1870 before being published in the original Danish in Denmark in October 1870. \"The Most Incredible Thing\" was the first of Andersen's tales to be published in Denmark during World War II. Andersen considered the tale one of his best.\n\nWhen the tale begins, a contest has been proclaimed in which half the kingdom and the hand of the princess in marriage will be the rewards of he who can produce the most incredible thing. A poor young man creates a magnificent clock with different lifelike figures — Moses, Adam and Eve, the Four Seasons, the Five Senses, and others — which appear at the stroke of the hour. All agree the clock is the most incredible thing and its creator is named the winner. Suddenly, another man smashes the clock and all then agree that this act is even more incredible than the creation of the beautiful clock. The destroyer is to wed the princess, but at the wedding, the figures of the clock magically reappear, defeat him, and then vanish. All agree that this is the most incredible thing, and the princess and the young creator of the clock marry.\n\nEach hour on the clock is represented by a figure from the Bible, mythology, folklore or common knowledge.\n\n\nThe tale has no counterpart in traditional folk and fairy lore but is entirely original with Andersen. Its inspiration is ascribed to Andersen’s distress over the Franco-Prussian War and the wars between Denmark and Prussia in the 1860s. Andersen had been warmly received in Germany and the poet loved German high culture but he was completely shocked by the nation‘s descent into militarism. He was heartbroken with the realization that it would be necessary for him to sever ties with his German friends.\n\nThe tale was first published as “The Most Extraordinary Thing” in an English translation by Horace Scudder in the United States in \"The Riverside Magazine for Young People\" in September 1870. The Danish original appeared in Denmark in the journal \"Nyt Dansk Maanedsskrift\" a month later in October 1870. The tale was reprinted in Denmark on 30 March 1872 and again on 20 December 1874 in collections of Andersen‘s tales.\n\nAndersen enjoyed performing before an audience and promoted many of his tales by reading them aloud at social gatherings. In the 1840s, the composer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was present at such a reading in Germany and reported he was so elated and excited by the performance that he couldn't wait to thank Andersen but \"jubilantly flew\" at the poet exclaiming: \"But you are a marvelous reader; no one reads fairy tales like you!\" Many years later in the 1870s, the English author and critic Edmund Gosse had a similar perception and noted, \"As soon as he spoke, yes, if he merely smiled, he genius was evident ... And as he read, everything I was looking at—the dazzling sails, the sea, the coast of Sweden, the bright sky—was set ablaze as the sun went down. It was as if nature itself were blushing with delight at the sound of Hans Christian Andersen's voice.\"\n\nAndersen managed to read aloud \"The Most Incredible Thing\" at least seven times within a matter of days. The readings began before a circle of admirers at the home of the Koch family on the day the tale was finished. Over the next several days, he visited the homes of several others including the Hartmanns, the Collins, the Thieles, and the Melchiors. Andersen used such readings to gauge the success of his compositions: the louder and longer the audience's applause, the fewer corrections he would make to the tale and the sooner the manuscript reached the publisher's office.\n\nFor fairy tale and folk lore researcher Maria Tatar, the tale summarizes Andersen’s views on the \"essence of art\" with the clock representing both temporality and transcendence. It keeps time but it is also a work of art that cannot be destroyed. She notes that the clock houses both \"the biblical and the mythical, the seasons and the senses, the visual and the acoustical, the carnal and the spiritual\" and thus brings together everything Andersen wanted in art. The wondrous clock \"mingles the secular with the sacred and the pagan with the Christian\". The beauty of the clock and its figurines defy and transcend destruction and continue to live in a way that humans cannot.\n\n\"The Most Incredible Thing\" was the first Andersen story published during the Nazi occupation of Denmark during World War II. The introduction to the July 1940 edition suggested Andersen had written the tale in profound anxiety and doubt over the future that \"was superseded with an even more profound faith.\" In 1942, the tale was published in a volume of stories organized by scholars who would later become leaders of the Danish Resistance Movement. In the tale’s final illustration to the 1942 edition, the night watchman is a bearded rabbi who strikes down the brawny semi-naked Aryan destroyer of the clock while a crowd of Danes in contemporary 1940s dress stands by and watches.\n\nIn 2011 British pop act Pet Shop Boys wrote the music for a ballet based on the story that opened in March 2011 at Sadler's Wells in London. The story was adapted by Matthew Dunster and featured choreography by Javier de Frutos. It starred former Royal Ballet principal Ivan Putrov and animated film created by Tal Rosner. The ballet won an Evening Standard Theatre Award and returned to Sadlers Wells for a second season in 2012.\n\nIn 2016 the New York City Ballet premiered a one-act ballet based on the same story, choreographed by Justin Peck.\n\nIn 2018 the Charlotte Ballet produced and presented the American premiere of the ballet created at Sadler's Wells. \n\n\n"}

They pulled over a 1946 Ford coupe containing two suspicious-looking men at the corner of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood. The two men, Gregory Ulas Powell (age 30) and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a. \"Jimmy Youngblood\", age 32), had recently committed a string of robberies, and \"each had a pistol tucked into his trousers.\" Powell, the driver, pulled a gun on Campbell, who \"calmly told his partner, 'He has a gun in my back. Give him your gun.'\" The two officers were then forced into Powell's car and, within 30 seconds after the traffic stop began, were driven north from Los Angeles on Route 99, to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Campbell was fatally shot. Hettinger was able to escape, running nearly four miles to reach a farmhouse.\n\nThe killing occurred primarily because Powell assumed that the kidnapping of the officers alone already constituted a capital crime under the state's Little Lindbergh Law. However, Powell's interpretation was incorrect. Under the Little Lindbergh Law kidnapping became a capital crime only if the victim were harmed or if a ransom were demanded. (Today, kidnapping in California, where there is bodily harm short of death, is punishable either by imprisonment for 25 years to life, or by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole).\n\nIn April 1982, following the release from prison of Powell's accomplice, Jimmy Lee Smith, Valerie Campbell, daughter of the slain Officer Ian Campbell, contacted John Mancino, founder of Citizens for Truth, an organization that had recently led a successful petition effort to rescind the parole date of convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, killer of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nMancino drafted a petition to have Powell's scheduled release rescinded and with Valerie Campbell's help collected 31,500 signatures in three-and-a-half weeks, which were submitted to the California Board of Prison Terms, along with several thousand letters. The parole board then held a hearing and eventually rescinded Powell's release date.\n\nFollowing this, Powell's attorney was successful in convincing Solano County Superior Court Judge, Ellis Randall, to order Powell's release from prison in ten days, ruling that Citizens for Truth's public outcry was the sole reason Powell's release was rescinded, which at the time was legally improper. Valerie Campbell then joined Citizens for Truth's representatives, John Mancino and Dr. Howard Garber, along with the group's attorneys, in filing a legal brief in the First District Court of Appeals in San Francisco, demanding that Powell remain in prison.\n\nThe group prevailed both at the appeals court and the California Supreme Court, thereby leading to Powell's spending the rest of his life in prison, where he died in 2012.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, the intersection of Carlos Avenue and Gower Street in Hollywood, the site of the officers' abduction, was named \"Ian Campbell Square\" in honor of the slain officer. Additionally, a section of the Hollywood Freeway (California State Route 101) in Hollywood, from Hollywood Boulevard to Highland Avenue, was designated the \"Ian J. Campbell Memorial Freeway.\"\n\nThough Hettinger was able to escape, he felt scorned by his fellow officers and officials at the Los Angeles Police Department and suffered severe emotional trauma for both the initial incident and the following treatment. Eventually a police training video was made using his experience as an example of what to do when stopping and approaching a vehicle.\n\nHettinger was forced to resign from the LAPD in 1966, after being accused of shoplifting. Years later, Hettinger was elected to serve as a Supervisor for Kern County, California, where he served multiple consecutive terms. He died of liver disease in 1994, at the age of 59.\n\nPowell was arrested on the night of the murder, after being spotted driving a stolen vehicle by California Highway Patrol officers. The following day, Smith was apprehended as well. The lead LAPD investigator on the case was Sergeant Pierce Brooks. Both suspects were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Ultimately, they received life sentences. For each, the lower court sentence followed a second trial and several appeals. Their death sentences were vacated when the California Supreme Court ruled in \"California v. Anderson\" (1972) that California's death penalty was cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAt a parole board hearing on January 27, 2010, Powell was denied parole. In a January 21, 2010 letter to state corrections officials, Los Angeles Police Union President Paul Weber urged the board to deny parole, calling Powell a \"vicious murderer who has not yet paid his debt to society\".\n\nOn October 18, 2011, the California State Parole Board denied compassionate release for Powell, who had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. The board stated that Powell did not wish to be released from prison and was likely to be uncooperative if paroled.\nPowell died on August 12, 2012, at the California Medical Facility in Vacaville. He was 79 years old.\n\nSmith was initially released in 1982 but returned to prison several additional times on drug-related parole violations. In December 2006, he failed to report to his parole officer, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. In February 2007, a man matching Smith's description was detained by police in Los Angeles' Skid Row area and eventually identified as Smith. He was arrested, charged with violating his parole, and sent to the Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic, California. On April 7, 2007, while in that facility, he died of an apparent heart attack at age 76.\n\nThe book was adapted into an 1979 film of the same name directed by Harold Becker. It starred John Savage as Karl Hettinger, James Woods as Gregory Powell, Franklyn Seales as Jimmy Smith, and Ted Danson (in his film debut) as Ian Campbell.\n\nTNT's \"Southland\" season 5 episode 9 titled \"Chaos\" (original airdate April 10, 2013) portrayed a reimagined version of the events that took place in \"The Onion Field\".\n\nThe \"Adam-12\" episode \"Killing Ground\" was based on this incident. Officers Pete Malloy and Jim Reed are kidnapped by two armed robbers on the run. The only difference is Malloy and Reed are able to escape and turn the tables on their captors.\n\n"}

The film centres on Drag the Red, a volunteer group in Manitoba who search the Red River for the bodies of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.\n\nSmith has stated that it was Vermette's \"North End Love Songs\" which helped draw her attention to the perspectives of indigenous youth from the North End and the experience of having missing family members.\n\nPrincipal photography took place August 8 to 16, 2016, with an all-woman crew documenting the work of Drag the Red volunteer Kyle Kematch. The crew spent much of that time filming from a small fleet of donated boats. The director of photographer was Iris Ng, with Anita Lubosh recording sound. \n\nThe film received the 2016 Coup de coeur du jury award at Montreal's Terres en vues/Land InSights First Peoples' Festival and had its public premiere in Vermette's hometown of Winnipeg on October 5 at the Winnipeg Art Gallery. At the 5th Canadian Screen Awards in 2017, the film won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Short Documentary Film.\n\nVermette and producer Alicia Smith also created a related Instagram work, \"What Brings Us Here\", which offers portraits of volunteers behind the community-run Winnipeg search teams the Bear Clan and Drag the Red.\n\n\"What Brings Us Here\" features photos by Winnipeg photographers Janine Kropla, Mark Reimer and Karen Asher. The online work combines images of searchers with their statements about why they are continuing to look for loved ones—and answers.\n\n"}
