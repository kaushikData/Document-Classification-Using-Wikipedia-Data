These two trends contributed to a sweeping revival of letters with a lasting influence on the development of literature in the following centuries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was written as a tribute to the die-hard Beatles fans known as Apple scruffs, who would wait in certain London locations where the band members were likely to appear, even long after the group's break-up in April 1970.\n\nThe recording has been noted for its Bob Dylan influence, featuring Harrison on acoustic guitar and harmonica, and is recognised as a departure from the big sound synonymous with \"All Things Must Pass\". \"Apple Scruffs\" was also released as the B-side to \"What Is Life\", gaining further popularity through airplay on US radio, and became the preferred side of the single in some countries.\n\nThe name \"Apple scruffs\" was first coined by George Harrison during the late 1960s. Although well known for his aversion to fan worship, particularly to the Beatlemania phenomenon, Harrison had formed a bond with a number of the scruffs; he acknowledged in an April 1969 interview with \"Disc\" magazine: \"their part in the play is equally as important as ours\". His song \"Apple Scruffs\" was written as a tribute to the fans who had kept vigil outside the various recording studios he had been working in since late May 1970, during the sessions for his \"All Things Must Pass\" triple album, as well as the Apple headquarters on Savile Row. Although Harrison makes no mention of the song in his 1980 autobiography, Derek Taylor, in his role as editor, describes the Apple scruffs as the \"central core\" of fans, long after Beatlemania had subsided, adding that \"We were all very fond of them\".\n\n\"New York Post\" writer Al Aronowitz was present during much of the \"All Things Must Pass\" sessions. He later wrote: \"Outside the studio door, whether it rained or not, there was always a handful of Apple Scruffs, one of them a girl all the way from Texas. Sometimes George would record from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. and there they would be, waiting through the night, beggars for a sign of recognition on his way in and out.\"\n\nHarrison recorded \"Apple Scruffs\" late in the proceedings, during the overdubbing and mixing phase of \"All Things Must Pass\". Uniquely among the tracks on \"All Things Must Pass\", \"Apple Scruffs\" was performed solo by Harrison – except for a percussive, tapping sound provided by Beatles assistant Mal Evans. Harrison recorded the song live on acoustic guitar and harmonica, in the style of his friend Bob Dylan. Due to his heavy beard and moustache, Harrison struggled while attempting to play the harmonica; sessions tapes also reveal he needed to coach himself on the sucking and blowing technique required for the part.\n\nUsing take 18 of his performances that day, the released recording was edited together from the full take, lasting around two-and-a-half minutes, with the section comprising the song's chorus and the following instrumental passage repeated, thereby extending the track length to 3:04. Earlier in the year, co-producer Phil Spector had similarly extended Harrison's song \"I Me Mine\" when preparing the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" album for release. Harrison overdubbed backing vocals, credited on the album to \"the George O'Hara-Smith Singers\", and two slide-guitar parts onto the basic track.\n\nHarrison invited the Apple scruffs into Abbey Road Studios to hear the results. A teenager at the time, Gill Pritchard later recalled that Harrison told them: \"Well, you had your own magazine, your own office on the [studio] steps, so why not your own song?\"<ref name=\"Jones/Mojo\">Cliff Jones, \"We're Waiting for the Beatles\", \"Mojo\", October 1996, p. 71.</ref>\n\nApple Records released \"All Things Must Pass\" on 27 November 1970, with \"Apple Scruffs\" appearing as the second track on side three, in the triple LP format. In the wake of the Beatles' break-up seven months before, author Peter Doggett writes, \"Apple Scruffs\" and tracks such as \"Run of the Mill\" and \"Wah-Wah\" presented the band's fans with \"a teasing glimpse into an intimate world that had previously been off-limits to the public\".\n\nThe song was afforded further exposure when issued as the B-side to \"What Is Life\", released internationally (though not in Britain) in February 1971 as a second single off the album. Its inclusion on the single marked the first in a short-lived tradition of what author Simon Leng has called Harrison's \"upmarket busking\" acoustic B-sides, other examples being \"Miss O'Dell\" and \"I Don't Care Anymore\". The US picture sleeve gave both sides of the single equal billing, the song titles printed above a Barry Feinstein photo of the top of a tower at Harrison's new home, Friar Park.\n\nA popular track on radio, \"Apple Scruffs\" received as much airplay as the A-side in America, while in some European markets and Australia, its popularity led to the song being favoured as the lead side over \"What Is Life\". In Australia, \"Apple Scruffs\" and \"What Is Life\" were listed as a double A-side when the single topped the \"Go-Set\" National Top 60 in May 1971. The two sides were also listed together on the US chart compiled by \"Record World\", where the single peaked at number 10.\n\nOn release, reviewers were quick to point out the Dylan influence on \"Apple Scruffs\"; Alan Smith of the \"NME\" described it as \"a Dylanesque, pacy piece with harmonica and a girlie chorus\".<ref name=\"Smith/NME\">Alan Smith, \"George Harrison: \"All Things Must Pass\" (Apple)\", \"NME\", 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).</ref> \"Rolling Stone\"s Ben Gerson considered \"Apple Scruffs\" to be \"One of the most wonderful cuts on the album\" and added: \"it sounds as if it was recorded while co-producer Phil Spector was out for coffee.\"\n\nIn his combined review of all the former Beatles' 1970 solo releases, Geoffrey Cannon of \"The Guardian\" described \"All Things Must Pass\" as \"relaxed, well resolved, and, as ever with George, magnanimous\" and said he especially admired the sentiments in \"Apple Scruffs\", despite it being \"one of the slighter songs\". \"Billboard\" magazine's reviewer wrote of \"What Is Life\" and \"Apple Scruffs\" as \"intriguing rhythm follows-ups\" to Harrison's international hit \"My Sweet Lord\", and songs that were \"sure to repeat that success\" and \"prove big juke box items\".\n\nMore recently, Beatles author Bruce Spizer has written of the song: \"Sandwiched in the middle of an album full of elaborate wall-of-sound productions, \"Apple Scruffs\" breaks through like a breath of fresh air.\" Simon Leng praises the track's bottleneck parts, and particularly the backing vocals, which he describes as \"the best on the album\". The same passage, towards the end of the song, has been referred to by Tom Moon in his book \"1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die\" as \"an explosive peak-experience refrain that comes direct from heaven's songbook\".\n\nIn a 2001 review for the 30th anniversary reissue of \"All Things Must Pass\", James Hunter of \"Rolling Stone\" highlighted \"Apple Scruffs\" among other tracks on an album that \"helped define the decade it ushered in\", advising listeners to \"proceed to music that exults in breezy rhythms\", which included \"the colorful revolutions of 'What Is Life' … bluesy and intricate on Harrison and Dylan's 'I'd Have You Anytime,' fizzy on 'Apple Scruffs,' grooving on 'Let It Down,' and spookily proto-disco on 'Art of Dying'\".\n\nAccording to Simon Leng and Chip Madinger and Mark Easter:\n\n"}

Woman is a 1993 television film, it is a remake of the 1958 film of the same name. Directed by Christopher Guest and starring Daryl Hannah and Daniel Baldwin, the film premiered on HBO on December 11, 1993, and was later theatrically released in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\nThe film begins by following a tour group at a memorial museum dedicated to Nancy Archer. The patrons are shown a film with Dr. Loeb, who explains that the events surrounding Nancy Archer were true. Nancy was an heiress to her mother's fortune. Her father, Hamilton Cobb, hopes to use the money to gain control over the town they live in. Nancy sees her psychiatrist, Dr. Cushing, about her low self-esteem and bad marriage to Harry. Her husband frequently spends time with a beautiful mistress, Honey Parker, the town beautician, together with whom he discusses his plans to steal the family's business away from Nancy's father. Despite her attempts to confront Harry, Nancy cannot express her anger in a healthy manner, allowing both her husband and father to take advantage of her.\n\nWhile driving one night out in the desert, she sees a UFO, which shines a bright light at her. Even though she knows she will be the town's laughing stock, she also knows what she saw was real. She finally convinces Harry to accompany her on another night time drive in the desert, but the UFO is nowhere in sight. Suddenly, the ship descends from the sky. Getting out of the car for a closer look, Nancy is trapped by a bright light and disappears along with the UFO. Harry quietly returns to town and does not even report the kidnapping to the local authorities, Sheriff Denby and deputy Charlie.\n\nA dazed Nancy is later found atop Honey's salon and is brought home. Her father is suspicious that Harry left her out in the desert while Harry denies any wrongdoing. Harry accuses Hamilton of neglecting his own wife after she was locked away at a sanitarium. As the two men argue, Nancy loses her temper, shouting that she can speak for herself and her mother. Suddenly, to everyone's surprise, she begins to grow; her clothes tear and rip as her head goes smashing through the ceiling into the attic.\n\nThe next morning Nancy is relocated to a large stable. There she is introduced to Dr Loeb. He observed a hormonal surge that occurred during Nancy's growth. Scared, Nancy asks that he find a cure, while keeping it a secret. Unable to convince her to move to a \"controlled, therapeutic environment\", Dr Loeb explains to Harry that Nancy's condition is unique and precarious. The strain of her heart to sustain her new size would make any stress too dangerous for her. This gives Harry an idea to get rid of her.\n\nAs she grows, Nancy becomes more self-confident and strong-willed, empowered by her new strength over everyone else. Eventually, she invites Harry to dinner and discuss her physical, mental and emotional growth. She thinks it will make their marriage stronger and she has a number of other ideas. However, Harry speculates that more stress will overload her heart and blood pressure and that she will die, leaving the family business and its money to him.\n\nHarry, pretending to be unhinged by Nancy's suggestions (but carrying out his plan to overload her heart so that she dies), deliberately insults and angers her so much that she faints from the stress, crashing into the stable. Escaping to Honey's salon, he celebrates Nancy's apparent death by offering her Nancy's diamond necklace. Nancy wakes up and searches through the town for Harry. As she approaches a drive-through theater, a quick reference to the original 1958 film can be seen on the screen.\n\nFinding Honey and Harry, Harry hides under the desk in pure fear. He crawls away, feeling more scared then he has ever felt; Nancy is back for revenge. Trying not to scream or cry, he runs to his car. Nancy follows him and dumps him in her hand. Capturing Harry, she flees into the desert with National Guard helicopters pursuing her. Stopped by some high voltage power lines and confronted by her father and the authorities, she asserts herself and announces her father's ambitions to buy out the town using her money.\n\nDue to a miscommunication from the sheriff (\"No one does anything 'til I say \"Fire\"!\"), a sniper on the helicopter shoots Nancy. Taking a direct hit, she falls onto the power lines, but is rescued and taken away (with Harry still in her grip) by the UFO, proving her claims were real.\n\nThe crowds disperse, with Honey making a business agreement with Hamilton. Dr Cushing explains to the press that wherever Nancy is, she now has Harry all to herself. Inside the UFO, Harry is forced to undergo therapy with two other men under a tiny dome, watched over by Nancy and two other giantesses, and the spaceship flies away into the night.\n\n\nBrian Gusse of Rovi writes, \"This made-for-cable remake of the cult favorite 1958 film of the same name is updated with an even more feminist slant and has a more thoughtful (and clever) script\".\n\n"}

The Batik industry in Sri Lanka is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and creativity. Its economic benefit is profit from dealing with foreign customers. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along Hikkaduwa's Galle Road strip. Mahawewa, on the other hand, is famous for its batik factories.\n\nBatiks incorporate many motifs and colours, some traditional, others highly contemporary and individual. Many display a vigorousness of design related to their origin. The material created by the batik-makers is used to produce distinctive dresses, shirts, sarongs and beachwear well-suited for tropical climes. Many tourists at seaside resorts such as Hikkaduwa wear batik clothes throughout their holiday. Apart from clothes, tablecloths, wall pictures, beach clothes, pure cotton and silk, men's and ladies' wear and bed covers are popular as a reminder of a visit to Sri Lanka.\n\nBatiks originated many centuries ago with the villagers and tribesmen of what are now the countries of Indonesia and Malaysia and has been brought to Sri Lanka by the Dutch. The promotion of the village arts is a way of keeping alive an important part of a vibrant and beautiful culture. Many of Sri Lanka's batik paintings are imported directly from Javanese village artists. They use 100-percent cotton cloth and all dyes used are colour-fast.\n\nThe batik art panels provide quilters, craft and home sewers, and interior designers with an opportunity to combine an ancient art form with a contemporary use. Since each batik piece is individually handmade, the colours and designs may vary. Originally, when batik-making was a cottage industry, one artist created the entire batik from start to finish.\n"}

It is her best known early work and depicts Steele \"present[ing] her naked body to the unblinking gaze of the camera\".\n\nThe tape itself is characterized by common practices of early video art, unedited with a static shot. Steele turns the camera on, walks to the end of the room/set and removes her clothing. She approaches the camera and begins to examine the various scars she's accumulated over her life up to that point. The work represents what critic Dot Tuer indicates is \"an offering to the technological gaze [which] downplays the representation of the body as a gendered subject,\" and as film historian Catherine Russell points out, the work is a \"counter-image to the emergent critique of the female body in narrative cinema.\" Steele's description of the work: \"On the occasion of my 27th birthday I decided to do a tape that chronicled my passage through time. I have always been clumsy, tripping, dropping, falling with alarming regularity. This tape accepts the extent of the consequences.\"\n\n\"Birthday Suit – with scars and defects\" was selected by Toronto International Film Festival as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy.\n\nLisa Steele was born in Kansas City, Missouri in 1947 and immigrated to Canada in 1968. An important pioneer of video art in Canada since the early 1970s, Steele has shown internationally at the Venice Biennale (1980), the Kunsthalle (Basel), the Museum of Modern Art (NYC), the National Gallery of Canada, the Institute of Contemporary Art (Boston), 49th Parallel Videoseries, the Vancouver Art Gallery and the Long Beach Museum. Her videos are in collections worldwide, including The National Gallery of Canada, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Houston, Texas), Ingrid Oppenheim, Concordia University (Montreal), Newcastle Polytechnic (England), Paulo Cardazzo (Milan), the Canadian Embassy (Tokyo) and the Akademie der Kunst (Berlin). She is a founding director of Vtape in Toronto, a national information and distribution service for independent video and a founding publisher and editor of \"FUSE Magazine\".\n\nSteele has collaborated exclusively with her partner Kim Tomczak since the early 1980s.\n\nSteele's earliest works are part of a key moment in video art history, not only setting the tone for her later work but in particular, pioneering a language for a medium becoming crucial in 1970s Canadian art. Early video art in Canada made by women was a direct critique of mass media with an \"awareness\" of \"media's manipulation\" of the viewer. \"Birthday Suit – with scars and defects\" is a crucial early work that \"has entered the canon of Western art history as one of the best examples of early feminist video art from Canada.\" Like much early video art, the work is performance-based, with a static camera and one angle. The entire twelve minutes is unedited and\n\nthe soundtrack consists entirely of the sounds and voice of the take. Notwithstanding the private and unspectacular setting, the strict form of \"Birthday Suit. With Scars and Defects\" – its seemingly rehearsed choreography, the chronological ordering of memory, and the unvarying repetition of gestures – unsettles the viewer’s spontaneous impression of an unedited sequence. Directly addressing the viewer as \"you\", moreover, contrasts with the otherwise private setting. Such gaze alignment, which the fixed camera position epitomizes, opens up the scene toward a literally \"exhibitionist\" affirmation of self.\n\nIn \"Birthday Suit with scars and defects\" Steele disrobes and examines the scars on her naked body, accumulated over her lifetime, on the day of her 27th birthday in order to channel the scars' \"origin stories through the touch of her fingers, all in an effort to chart the marks endured in her twenty-seven years of life.\" Like much of her work in the 1970s, \"Birthday Suit\" addresses the video medium as \"a gendered tool of power [as a] means of surveillance and social control, or of confession and self-examination.\"\n\nBy the 1970s artists, seeking more control over their work but also the display and distribution, turned to mass media, new technology and communication technologies. Video, photography and audio became the media of choice for artists with a feminist practice. In particular, women artists utilized performance and technology to both engage the viewer but also as a form of direct documentation, often utilizing the artist's body. \"Birthday Suit – with scars and defects\" is an important early example of feminist video art. Steele's approach to identity is both matter-of-fact but also fictionalized, employing irony and as an extension of conceptual art, practices of directness and banal bluntness.\n\nEarly video art employs approaches first found in performance and body art in the 1960s. Addressing voyeurism (both from the mass media and modernist impulses) and using documentary tropes, in particular direct cinema, the first generation of video art's concerns with sexuality and sexual politics aligned it with feminist discourse of the era. Feminist art in the early 1970s operated in the \"ideological\" and \"linguistic\" space of the body. Steele's \"Birthday Suit\" engages with \"nudity, pain and memory\", reinventing the \"adult female body\" through memory. A form of \"critical embodiment\" Steele's video self-portrait \"counters normative 'pedagogical spectacles' of women's bodies\" by emphasizing the \"unhealthy... body in ways that forcefully enact embodied agency.\"\n\nFor the 2017 Canadian sesquicentennial, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) selected a list of the 150 essential moving-image productions made in Canada, determined \"through a national poll of over 200 members of the film, television, advertising and music industry along with journalists, critics, scholars, and filmmakers.\" \"Birthday Suit – with scars and defects\" was selected as an essential part of Canada's cultural legacy.\n\nDescribed as a canonical work of video art and body art, \"Birthday Suit – with scars and defects\" is also an important influence on later artists. An aspect of online video sharing, on platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion, is the aesthetic of the amateur where \"non-professionals, art students, or amateurists comprise the vast majority of videos.\" Often taking as their inspiration autobiographical video artworks of the 1970s, focusing on the physical body in front of the stationary camera, with minimal editing, the uploaders \"physically or conceptually substitute the artist’s body and narrative for their own. In other words, uploaders employ the artist as a productive template for their recorded performances.\" Steele is one of the most widely appropriated artists on video-sharing websites. Online videos employ Steele's performance of body narrative, often emphasizing the unhealthy, scarred or marked. Like Steele's direct engagement with an absent viewer, these online homages forge complex relationships with viewers, albeit anonymously and not as art.\n\n\n"}

Ananse is the Ashanti word for spider, and the trickster Anancy (also known as Ananci, Ananse, Anansi, Ananci Krokoko, and Brer Nancy), with his quick-witted intelligence and his knack for surviving the odds, often through trickery, is the most popular of this genre of African-Caribbean folk-tale characters, although there are other West African influences, in folk story characters, including the hare (chief character in the Yoruba folktales) and the tortoise, which features in the stories of the Ibo people.\n\nIn addition to these stories, African religious figures also comprise a significant part of Caribbean folklore, many of the supernatural folklore figures possessing characteristics which are identical with those of African deities, and include:\n\n\"Papa Bois\", who appears in many different forms, sometimes as a deer, or in old ragged clothes, sometimes hairy and though very old, extremely strong and muscular, with cloven hoofs and leaves growing out of his beard. As the guardian of the animals and the custodian of the trees, he is known to sound a cow's horn to warn his friends of the approach of hunters. He doesn't tolerate killing for killing's sake, and the wanton destruction of the forest.\n\n\"La Diablesse\", the devil woman, is sometimes personified as an old crone, who steps forth with her cloven hoof from behind a tree on a lonely road, the sound of chains mingling with the rustle of her petticoat. Sometimes she takes the form of a beautiful woman, to lure some unsuspecting passerby to his death or perhaps to madness. Although she may appear young, she will be dressed in the ancient costume of these islands: a brilliant madras turban, chemise with half sleeves and much embroidery and lace, \"zepingue tremblant\" (\"trembling pins of gold\"), and all the finery of the by-gone days. Even when she appears beautiful, there is something that betrays her - she often has one hoof and a normal human foot or two hooves which she uses her long, flowing gown to hide.\n\n\"Mama Dlo\" or \"Mama Dglo\" (known in West Africa today as Mammy Wata) whose name is derived from the French \"maman de l'eau\" which means \"mother of the water\" is akin to the mermaid figure of European folklore and represents West African water spirits and there is a spirit called a cocoya who feasts on children then eats them up - they also can change into different shapes.\n\nThe \"Soucouyant\", whose French-derived names comes from the word \"to suck\", is personified by a woman, often old, who sheds her skin at night and flies through the skies, sometimes as a ball of flame, to suck blood from her victims.\n\nThe \"Ligahoo\" or \"Loup Garou\" is a shape changer, a man who has power over nature and the capacity to change form to that of an animal.

Rodríguez.\nManuel Suárez y Suárez, an Asturian entrepreneur, was the building contractor.\nThe Casino de la Selva was inaugurated in 1931 near the train station.\n\nThe layout was relatively simple.\nThere was a large fountain at the entrance, then a main driveway between two blocks of rooms, one on each side.\nThe drive led to the main hall, used as the gaming room.\nThere was also an Olympic swimming pool, a pediment and some other facilities.\nThe grounds contained bungalows set within the surrounding Amanalco Forest.\nHundreds of the trees were at least 100 years old.\nTwo of them were estimated to be over 1,000 years old.\nThe site held springs and a wide variety of plant species. \nThere was evidence of pre-Hispanic culture that could have dated to over 1500 years ago.\nThe pre-Columbian site was first excavated in the 1940s.\n\nThe Casino de la Selva was briefly the most luxurious watering spot in the Americas until the Garci-Crespo Hotel opened in Tehuacán in 1934.\nHowever, the owners were unable to pay their debts to the state or to the builders.\nManuel Suárez was the main creditor and acquired the property in 1934.\nThat year the new president Lázaro Cárdenas took office. \nOne of his first decrees banned gambling in Mexico since he saw casinos as centers of vice.\nSuárez retained the property but ran it purely as a hotel.\nSuárez and the Valencian architect Jesús Martí Martín founded the company Vías y Obras, which built facilities in the ports of Veracruz, Acapulco and other cities. \nSuárez built the Hotel Mocambo in Veracruz, and was involved in other industries, including sugar mills.\n\nIn 1938 Malcolm Lowry moved to Cuernavaca to work on his novel \"Under the Volcano\", and described the hotel in the first chapter,\nIn 1946 the Casino de la Selva was closed so that Vías y Obras could undertake various enlargements under the direction of Martí.\nThe two blocks of rooms were each given a second floor, and a French-style garden was laid out in the area between them.\nNew rooms were added to the main building.\nOther additions included a large convention hall, a bowling alley and cafeteria, a walkway around the Olympic pool, two more pools and sandy areas to give a beach-like atmosphere.\nThe effect was much like the Hotel Mocambo.\nFélix Candela came to Mexico to escape the Franco regime in Spain and worked for Vías y Obras from 1942 to 1947.\nHe helped the architect Martí in his renovation of the Casino de la Selva.\n\nCandela is best known for his reinforced concrete shells, which he introduced to Mexico.\nThese are based on hyperbolic paraboloids, in which straight beams can be used to build a saddle roof, and can cover large spans with minimal thickness.\nAt the end of the 1950s the construction company of the brothers Félix, Antonio and Julia Candela built a dining room attached to an auditorium, and a non-denominational chapel in place of the fountain at the entrance, all with shell roofs.\nCandela's pupil, the architect Juan Antonio Tonda, designed the shells and about 30 bungalows in the south of the site and oversaw construction.\nLater the chapel was converted to a nightclub, the Club Jano, and then the Discoteca Mambo.\nThe dining room, the \"Salón de los Relojes\" (Salon of the Clocks), had a roof formed of five paraboloid sections with a large clock hanging from the central point where the arcs intersected showing the times of places around the world.\nThe auditorium, reached via the \"Salón de los Relojes\", had a single hyperbolic paraboloid roof and contained the mural \"La farándula\" (Showbiz) by the Mexican artist Francisco Icaza, a tribute to the German playwright Bertolt Brecht.\nAfter 1965 Suárez started various unfinished projects such as a monorail below the pools and a forum to hold large murals by David Alfaro Siqueiros.\nLater this project was transferred to Mexico City where it became the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros, leaving the building at the Casina de la Selva unfinished.\nThe result of these later works was increasing diversity of architectural styles and growing maintenance costs.\nLilia Suárez, daughter of the owner, assumed management of the Casino de la Selva in 1966.\n\nFrom the 1970s until his death Suárez put most of his energy into the Hotel de México (now the World Trade Center) in the Federal District, a project that grew out of control. The Casino de la Selva was neglected and used only by foreign tourists.\nSuárez died in 1987.\nAfter this the hotel was used as a spa, and was sometimes rented for events such as wedding celebrations and graduations.\nCuernavaca continued to expand, but most development happened outside the city center, which had expanded to include the hotel.\nA bus station was built beside the hotel and in 1991 the Plaza Cuernavaca shopping center opened to its east.\nIn 1994 Suárez's heirs sold the property to the Grupo Situr-Sidek, a hotel company.\nThe deed of sale does not seem to have included any stipulation that the murals were to be preserved.\nIn 1996 the group defaulted on $63.7 million of taxes it owed to the Mexican government, and the Ministry of Finance seized the property.\n\nThe Hotel Casino de la Selva was abandoned for several years and deteriorated quickly.\nThe heritage authorities chose not to evaluate the property.\nOwnership was transferred to the Fondo Bancario de Protección al Ahorro (Fobaproa: Bank Fund for the Protection of Savings).\nBy 2001 the buildings had deteriorated badly, with murals crumbling from neglect, bat guano on interior walls, and litter and human excrement covering the floor of the main salon that held some of the finest murals.\nThe buildings and over of green land were sold in 2001 for 10 million pesos, well below market value.\nThe cultural wealth contained in the property was not declared.\n\nSuárez wanted the hotel to be a gathering place for intellectuals and artists, and commissioned various works of art for the walls and gardens.\nHe hired Mexican and Spanish artists such as José Reyes Meza and Josep Renau to decorate the walls with murals showing Mexican history from the pre-Columbian period to the modern age.\nThe murals would cover an area of .\nThe hotel became the center of cultural activity in Cuernavaca and was visited by artists, writers and political activists.\n\nThe former gaming room in the main hall came to be called the Salón de los Murales.\nThe Spanish Republican artist Josep Renau painted a mural there of \"La Hispanidad\" a history of the Iberian Peninsula from the time of the Phoenicians to the conquest of America.\nThe other side of the room held a 1965 mural by José Reyes Meza that depicted indigenous culture in the Valley of Mexico.\nThe hall also had a mural of \"The Apocalypse\" by Jorge Flores, a disciple of David Alfaro Siqueiros.\nRenau's \"Mural de la conformacion hispanica\", painted with his wife Manuela Ballester, depicted the conquest and colonization of America by the Spanish and covered more than .\nThe walls of the rooms and corridors also held the work of David Alfaro Siqueiros, Dr. Atl, Benito Messeguer, Jorge González Camarena, Francisco Icaza, Victor Moscoso and others.\n\nSculptures in the gardens included pre-Hispanic allegories by Federico Canessi and works by Antonio Ballester.\nA large equestrian statue of Hernán Cortés by the Spanish sculptor Florentino Aparicio was installed late in 1962.\nSuárez provided the hotel with a pottery workshop directed by Aparicio, where several noted potters learned their art.\nIn 1980 the ceramicist Gustavo Pérez Mirada was able to rent the workshop for a nominal sum with the help of his friend Ida Rodríguez Prampolini.\n\nIn 1969 the mother of Lilia Rossbach was director of the hotel.\nShe offered the author Carlos Monsiváis an old bungalow as a quiet space where he could write a book, his \"Días de guardar\", published in 1971.\nRafael Buñuel, son of the filmmaker Luis Buñuel, spent six months living at the casino in 1971–72 developing avante-garde theatrical works, which were staged over the next four years.\nCarmen Montejo and Sergio Jiménez came to give classes to the performers.\nThe pianist Alfonso Morquecho performed at the hotel.\n\nThe Mexican painter and muralist Gerardo Murillo, better known as Dr. Atl, was among the best known guests. \nDr. Atl would hold marathon conversations from three to four in the afternoon in the dining room with other visitors such as Mario Orozco Rivera and Benito Messeguer.\nA fragment of Dr. Atl's mural, \"Architectural view of the City of Puebla\", is preserved in the Chapultepec Castle.\nLeonora Carrington lived in the casino while they built her house in Cuernavaca.\nJules Dassin visited with Joseph Losey and Richard Burton, planning to film \"Under the Volcano\", but the project fell through due to funding problems.\n\nThe property was sold at auction in 2001 to a joint venture of the American Costco discounter and the Mexican Comercial Mexicana supermarket chain.\nThe partner companies quickly began to clear the site for construction of two giant stores, uprooting trees and tearing down many of the buildings.\nCostco said they would invest over $30 million in the Club de Precios (Price Club) store, which would generate 1,500 temporary and 500 permanent jobs.\nWhen the plans became public the Civic Front for the Defense of the Casino de la Selva was formed by local environmentalists, preservationists and small business owners, asking the city to maintain the hotel and turn the land around it into a park.\nThe issue quickly gained national and international media attention.\nThe painter José Reyes Meza was refused access to inspect the state of the murals.\nOn 14 July 2001 it was reported that the Josep Renau Foundation of Valencia, Spain, had sent a communiqué to Kōichirō Matsuura of UNESCO asking him to exert pressure on the Mexican government to hold responsible those causing this \"damage to the universal cultural heritage\".\nThe Civic Front organization filed lawsuits, organized a boycott of Costco's other Mexican stores, and held public demonstrations outside the construction site entrance.\n\nA group of Morelos state deputies drafted a proposal to urge the Federal Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) and Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (INBA) to conserve the historical and archaeological cultural heritage on the site.\nThey described the damage to the murals due to demolition of part of the shell of the Casino de la Selva building as an act of aggression against the cultural heritage of humanity.\nThey called on the City of Cuernavaca to take into consideration the opinion of the citizens, suspend the work and prepare a comprehensive plan for conservation and use of the cultural, historial and ecological resources.\n\nIn August 2002 demonstrators held a lengthy sit-in, calling for access to the site so they could count the remaining trees.\nOn 21 August 2001 protestors blocked access to the property for eight hours before being evicted by the authorities.\n31 of the demonstrators were arrested and accused of riot, sabotage, assault, blocking public roads and incitement to crime.\nOn 23 August 2002 the state authorities transferred 31 opponents of the shopping centre project who had refused to pay bail to Atlacholoaya prison and deployed 360 troops around the entrance to the site to prevent the arrival of a group of supporters from San Salvador Atenco, México.\nSix days later 15,000 people marched in protest through downtown Cuernavaca.\nEventually the company agreed to save the murals and part of the surrounding forest.\nThe hotel was demolished in the fall of 2002.\nDuring the excavation figurines and prehispanic ceramics were found.\nThe INAH tried to intervene but was too late to stop the work.\n\nWithin a year the new Costco outlet and the new mega supermarket opened in two huge concrete blocks surrounded by a sea of asphalt.\nIn 2003 the UN High Commission on Human Rights in Mexico condemned the project and criticized the local authorities for using excessive force in removing the protesters from the site.\nOne of the organizers of the protests, Flor Guerrero, described the failure to protect the Casino de la Selva as symbolic of Mexico's acceptance of the U.S. free-trade gospel. \nAnother local resident gave a different view, saying \"They said we were all against those stores, but the stores may bring more benefits than harm. New jobs and investment were created, and there's a greater variety of products to choose from in those stores. Besides, the Casino de la Selva hotel never belonged to the people.\"\n\nCostco opened an art museum named the Museo Muros to hold the Renau and Reyes Meza murals that had been salvaged as well as the Gelman collection of Mexican art.\nA reinforced concrete shell was built next to the museum in imitation of the Salón de los Relojes.\nThe shell was poorly executed and does not achieve the feeling of lightness that was characteristic of Candela's work.\nThe museum was boycotted by the activists of the Frente Ciudadano Pro-Casino de la Selva and received very few visitors.\nIn 2008 the Gelman collection was withdrawn and in November 2008 the museum became a branch of the Papalote Museo del Niño.\n\n"}

They stretched from Aquincum (within modern Budapest) eastwards along the line of the northern Carpathian mountains to the vicinity of Debrecen, and then southwards to Viminacium (near modern Stari Kostolac).\n\nThey were probably designed to protect the Iazyges, a Sarmatian tribe that inhabited the Tisza plain and had been reduced to tributary status by Constantine, from incursions by the surrounding Goths and Gepids.\n\nSome elements of the fortifications, however, date from the 2nd century AD, and probably constituted an earlier defensive line constructed under emperor Marcus Aurelius (ruled 161–80) at the time of the Marcomannic Wars, the previous occasion that the Tisza plain was occupied by the Romans.\n\nThe \"Limes Sarmatiae\" was intended to expand the Roman Limes, and was built at the same time as the Constantine Wall in Wallachia (connected to the Limes Moesiae). It was, however, destroyed after a few years, at the end of the 4th century.\n\nIndeed, in 374 AD, the Quadi, a Germanic tribe in what is now Moravia and Slovakia, resenting the erection of Roman forts of the \"Limes Sarmatiae\" to the north and east of the Danube in what they considered to be their own territory, and further exasperated by the treacherous murder of their king, Gabinius, crossed the river and laid waste the province of Pannonia.\n\nThe emperor Valentinian I in 375 Ad entered Pannonia with a powerful army and reinforced the fortifications of the \"Limes Sarmatiae\". But during an audience to an embassy from the Quadi (who were quickly defeated by the Roman legions) at Brigetio on the Danube (in Slovakia), Valentinian I suffered a burst blood vessel in the skull while angrily yelling at the people gathered. This injury resulted in his death on November of that year.\n\nSoon after his death, and following a lack of ruling power inside the Roman Empire, the \"Limes Sarmatiae\" was destroyed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39537836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39537836", "title": "Donald Brook", "text": "Donald Brook\n\nDonald Brook (born 8 January 1927) is an Australian artist, art critic and theorist whose research and publications centre on the philosophy of art, non-verbal representation and cultural evolution. He initiated the Experimental Art Foundation in Adelaide and is Emeritus Professor of Visual Arts in the Flinders University, Bedford Park, South Australia.\n\nBrook was born in Leeds, Yorkshire and educated on scholarships at Woodhouse Grove School and at the University of Leeds, where he read Electrical Engineering. He left before graduating with the intention of becoming an artist and was conscripted in the army toward the end of WWII. He received a Further Education and Training grant in 1949 to study sculpture at the King Edward VII School of Art in the University of Durham.\nAfter graduating (B.A. Fine arts) with first class honours in 1953 Henry Moore and William Coldstream were his external examiners, he spent a further year on a Chancellor’s postgraduate award researching Archaic and Cycladic sculpture in Greece. Thereafter he established a practice as a sculptor, exhibiting at the Woodstock Gallery in London and executing commissions, and was awarded a studio and residence at the Digswell Arts Trust at Welwyn in Hertfordshire, His interest in unresolved theoretical questions about the visual arts led him to accept a further postgraduate scholarship in the Department of Philosophy in the Australian National University in Canberra in 1962. His PhD thesis (1965), examined by Professors E. H. Gombrich and David Armstrong, applied analytic-philosophical theories of perception to questions of pictorial representation and art-critical appraisal.\n\nElecting to remain in Australia, Brook continued to work as a sculptor and as art critic of the Canberra Times under John Pringle’s editorship. Later (from 1968) he became art critic of the Sydney Morning Herald when he was appointed as one of the three first academics in the new Power Institute of Fine Arts in the University of Sydney. During this period (1968-1973) he was an energetic initiator of the so-called ‘Tin Sheds’ workshops, where his promotion of what he then called ‘post-object art’–more generally referred to at the time as ‘conceptual art,’ —was found liberating by many of the younger artists. His 1969 John Power Memorial Lecture ‘Flight from the Object’ proposed a radical alternative to the ideas that animated Clement Greenberg’s 1968 Power Lecture ‘Avant-garde Attitudes.’ Australian painters had generally taken their options to be restricted to the choice of international mainstream modernism or the purposeful construction of a distinctively Australian style.\n\nIn 1973 he was appointed to the inaugural chair of Fine Arts at the Flinders University, where he contentiously changed the departmental name from ‘Fine Arts’ to ‘Visual Arts.’ He initiated theoretical studies in the psychology and philosophy of visual perception and introduced a study of Aboriginal visual culture in a context where European Art History had previously dominated. At that time no practical studio courses were offered in any Australian University. From 1974 he therefore initiated the Experimental Art Foundation in the city of Adelaide. This was partly designed to enrol practising artists, along with academics and theorists, to bridge what he called ‘the gap between town and gown.’ He also introduced postgraduate academic programs for practising artists.\n\nBrook abandoned art criticism after leaving Sydney, and published extensively thereafter in journals of informed opinion and more popular media as well as in the academic literature. He retired from Flinders at the end of 1989 and lived in Cyprus from 1990–92, returning temporarily to a part-time role at the University of Western Australia before settling again in Adelaide.\n\nAlthough they are wide-ranging, Brook’s philosophical interests have centred on two principal regions of speculation: to understand the nature and place of perception and non-verbal representation in the visual arts, and to elucidate the relationship between art, the histories of works of art and the dynamics of cultural evolution. His early work on perception was first publicly aired in ‘Perception and the appraisal of sculpture’, in which the important distinction he later draws between matching and simulating non-verbal representational practices is introduced as a difference between what he calls the ‘object accounts’ and the ‘picture accounts’ that we spontaneously give of visually perceived things; notably of three-dimensional works of art. Crucial to his thinking is the idea that non-verbal representation is not a quasi-linguistic form of communication. It relies on the de facto socially efficacious substitutability of one thing for another thing even in cases where relevant properties are not shared. He argues that this perceptually mediated substitutive felicity must have been available to pre-linguistic organisms or language itself could not possibly have evolved.\n\nBrook’s elucidation of the concept of art, as what he at first called ‘experimental modelling of actual and possible worlds,’ is first comprehensively spelled out in his paper ‘A new theory of art’. This rather complex theoretical structure underwent continuous modification in numerous publications as his memetic account of cultural evolution developed. He embraced Dawkins’ concept of the meme as the potent factor in cultural evolution, analogous to the function of the gene in biological evolution. However, he differed significantly from Dawkins and other meme-theorists in his way of understanding and exemplifying the meme. Instead of offering such examples as the popular song or catchphrase he insisted that these things are items of a cultural kind analogous to the items of biological kinds such as a horse, or a cabbage. Just as a horse is the product of appropriately activated genes, he argues that a popular song or a catchphrase is not itself a meme. It is an item of a predictable cultural kind that is generated by exercising memes. Memes are purposefully directed actions that can be exercised in concerted ways, as contrasted with mere behaviours. This is first unambiguously elucidated in his paper ‘Art history?’.\n\nBrook’s account of art as the essentially unexpected recognition of the viability of new memes is spelled out in his book The awful truth about what art is (2008). It is succeeded by his semi-autobiographical book Get A life (2014) in which an anthology of his papers on perception, representation, art, evolution and history is strung together along a string of text that is intended to place them in the context of his personal history and experience.\n"}

Many feminists, particularly radical feminists, are highly critical of what they see as sexual objectification and sexual exploitation in the media and society. Radical feminists are often opposed to the sex industry, including opposition to prostitution and pornography. Other feminists define themselves as sex-positive feminists and believe that a wide variety of expressions of female sexuality can be empowering to women when they are freely chosen. Some feminists support efforts to reform the sex industry to become less sexist, such as the feminist pornography movement.\n\nThe feminist sex wars and lesbian sex wars, or simply the sex wars or porn wars, were acrimonious debates amongst feminists in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The sides were characterized by anti-porn and pro-sex groups with disagreements regarding sexuality, sexual representation, pornography, sadomasochism, the role of trans women in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The debate pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and the feminist movement was deeply divided as a result. The feminist sex wars are sometimes viewed as part of the division that led to the end of the second-wave feminist era and the beginning of third-wave feminism.\n\nThe two sides included anti-pornography feminists and sex-positive feminists. One of the more significant clashes between the pro-sex and anti-pornography feminists occurred at the 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality. Anti-pornography feminists were excluded from the events' planning committee, so they staged rallies outside the conference to show their disdain.\n\nMany feminists denounce industries such as the sex industry as examples of misogynistic exploitation. Important anti-sex industry feminists included Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon. The pair wanted civil laws restricting pornography. They viewed male sexual dominance as the root of all female oppression, and thus condemned pornography, prostitution, and other manifestations of male sexual power. The anti-pornography movement gained ground with the creation of Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media. During the time of the sex wars, it organized marches against the creators and distributors of pornography in San Francisco and led to Women Against Pornography, Feminists Fighting Pornography, and similarly-oriented organizations and efforts across the United States.\n\nThe response by \"sex-positive feminists\" was one that promoted sex as an avenue of pleasure for women. Gayle Rubin and Patrick Califia were influential in this part of the movement. Other feminists who identify as \"sex-positive\" include Ellen Willis, Kathy Acker, Susie Bright, Carol Queen, Annie Sprinkle, Avedon Carol, Tristan Taormino, Rachel Kramer Bussel, Nina Hartley, and Betty Dodson.\n\nFeminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of violence against women, to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression. Feminist debate on this issue reflects larger concerns surrounding feminist views on sexuality, and is closely related to feminist debates on prostitution, BDSM, and other issues. Pornography has been one of the most divisive issues in feminism, particularly among feminists in Anglophone countries.\n\nRadical feminist opponents of pornography—such as Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, Robin Morgan, Diana Russell, Alice Schwarzer, Gail Dines, and Robert Jensen—argue that pornography is harmful to women, and constitutes strong causality or facilitation of violence against women. Anti-pornography feminists, notably MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are being presented as enjoying themselves. It is also argued that much of what is shown in pornography is abusive by its very nature. Gail Dines holds that pornography, exemplified by gonzo pornography, is becoming increasingly violent and that women who perform in pornography are brutalized in the process of its production.\n\nAnti-pornography feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to sexism, arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men's pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner. On-face ejaculation and anal rape are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn. MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as \"the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words\".\n\nPornography is seen as being a medium for women's sexual expression in this view. Sex-positive feminists view many radical feminist views on sexuality, including views on pornography, as being as oppressive as those of patriarchal religions and ideologies, and argue that anti-pornography feminist discourse ignores and trivializes women's sexual agency. Ellen Willis (who coined the term \"pro-sex feminism\") states \"As we saw it, the claim that 'pornography is violence against women' was code for the neo-Victorian idea that men want sex and women endure it.\"\n\nSex-positive feminists take a variety of views towards existing pornography. Many sex-positive feminists see pornography as subverting many traditional ideas about women that they oppose, such as ideas that women do not like sex generally, only enjoy sex in a relational context, or that women only enjoy vanilla sex. They also argue that pornography sometimes shows women in sexually dominant roles and presents women with a greater variety of body types than are typical of mainstream entertainment and fashion.\n\nMany feminists regardless of their views on pornography are opposed on principle to censorship. Even many feminists who see pornography as a sexist institution, also see censorship (including MacKinnon's civil law approach) as an evil. In its mission statement, Feminists for Free Expression argues that censorship has never reduced violence, but historically been used to silence women and stifle efforts for social change. They point to the birth control literature of Margaret Sanger, the feminist plays of Holly Hughes, and works like \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" and \"The Well of Loneliness\" as examples of feminist sexual speech which has been the target of censorship. FFE further argues that the attempt to fix social problems through censorship, \"divert[s] attention from the substantive causes of social ills and offer a cosmetic, dangerous 'quick fix.'\" They argue that instead a free and vigorous marketplace of ideas is the best assurance for achieving feminist goals in a democratic society.\n\nAdditionally, some feminists such as Wendy Kaminer, while opposed to pornography are also opposed to legal efforts to censor or ban pornography. In the late 1970s, Kaminer worked with Women Against Pornography, where she advocated in favor of private consciousness raising efforts and against legal efforts to censor pornography. She contributed a chapter to the anti-pornography anthology, \"Take Back the Night\", wherein she defended First Amendment freedoms and explained the dangers of seeking legal solutions to the perceived problem of pornography. She opposed efforts by Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin to define pornography as a civil rights violation, and she critiqued the pro-censorship movement in a 1992 article in \"The Atlantic\" entitled \"Feminists Against the First Amendment.\"\n\nFeminist pornography is pornography that is produced by and with feminist women. It is a small but growing segment of the pornography industry. According to Tristan Taormino, \"Feminist porn both responds to dominant images with alternative ones and creates its own iconography.\"\n\nSome pornographic actresses such as Nina Hartley, Ovidie, Madison Young, and Sasha Grey are also self-described sex-positive feminists, and state that they do not see themselves as victims of sexism. They defend their decision to perform in pornography as freely chosen, and argue that much of what they do on camera is an expression of their sexuality. It has also been pointed out that in pornography, women generally earn more than their male counterparts. Some porn performers such as Nina Hartley are active in the sex workers' rights movement.\n\nThe Swedish director and feminist Suzanne Osten voiced scepticism that \"feminist pornography\" actually exists, referring to her belief that pornography is inherently objectifying and that feminist pornography would therefore constitute an oxymoron. The American radical feminist periodical off our backs has denounced feminist pornography as \"pseudo-feminist\" and \"so-called 'feminist' pornography\".\n\nAs with many issues within the feminist movement, there exists a diversity of opinions regarding prostitution. Many of these positions can be loosely arranged into an overarching standpoint that is generally either critical or supportive of prostitution and sex work. Anti-prostitution feminists hold that prostitution is a form of exploitation of women and male dominance over women, and a practice which is the result of the existing patriarchal societal order. These feminists argue that prostitution has a very negative effect, both on the prostitutes themselves and on society as a whole, as it reinforces stereotypical views about women, who are seen as sex objects which can be used and abused by men. Other feminists hold that prostitution and other forms of sex work can be valid choices for women and men who choose to engage in it. In this view, prostitution must be differentiated from forced prostitution, and feminists should support sex worker activism against abuses by both the sex industry and the legal system. The disagreement between these two feminist stances has proven particularly contentious, and may be comparable to the feminist sex wars of the late twentieth century.\n\nA proportion of feminists are strongly opposed to prostitution, as they see the practice as a form of violence against women, which should not be tolerated by society. Feminists who hold such views on prostitution include Kathleen Barry, Melissa Farley,Julie Bindel, Sheila Jeffreys, Catharine MacKinnon and Laura Lederer.\n\nThese feminists argue that, in most cases, prostitution is not a conscious and calculated choice. They say that most women who become prostitutes do so because they were forced or coerced by a pimp or by human trafficking, or, when it is an independent decision, it is generally the result of extreme poverty and lack of opportunity, or of serious underlying problems, such as drug addiction, past trauma (such as child sexual abuse) and other unfortunate circumstances. These feminists point out that women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are overrepresented in prostitution all over the world. \"If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?\" (MacKinnon, 1993). A large percentage of prostitutes polled in one study of 475 people involved in prostitution reported that they were in a difficult period of their lives and most wanted to leave the occupation.\nCatharine MacKinnon argues that \"In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape.\" \n\nSome anti-prostitution scholars hold that true consent in prostitution is not possible. Barbara Sullivan says, \"\"In the academic literature on prostitution there are very few authors who argue that valid consent to prostitution is possible. Most suggest that consent to prostitution is impossible or at least unlikely\".\". \"(...) most authors suggest that consent to prostitution is deeply problematic if not impossible (...) most authors have argued that consent to prostitution is impossible. For radical feminists this is because prostitution is always a coercive sexual practice. Others simply suggest that economic coercion makes the sexual consent of sex workers highly problematic if not impossible...\". Finally, abolitionists believe no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no people should have the right to consent to the oppression of others. In the words of Kathleen Barry, consent is not a \"good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression. Oppression cannot effectively be gauged according to the degree of \"consent,\" since even in slavery there was some consent, if consent is defined as inability to see, or feel any alternative.\" \n\nUnlike those feminists critical of prostitution, pro-sex work perspectives do not concede that prostitution sexual acts have an inherent element of coercion, exploitation, and domination. As such, pro-sex feminists instead assert that sex-work can be a positive experience for women who have employed their autonomy to make an informed decision to engage in prostitution.\n\nMany feminists, particularly those associated with the sex workers' rights movement or sex-positive feminism, argue that the act of selling sex need not inherently be exploitative; but that attempts to abolish prostitution, and the attitudes that lead to such attempts, lead to an abusive climate for sex workers that must be changed. In this view, prostitution, along with other forms of sex work, can be valid choices for the women and men who engage in it. This perspective has led to the rise since the 1970s of an international sex workers' rights movement, comprising organizations such as COYOTE, the International Prostitutes Collective, the Sex Workers Outreach Project, and other .\n\nAn important argument advanced by pro-sex work feminists such as Carol Queen highlights that all too often feminists who are critical of prostitution have failed to adequately consider the viewpoints of women who are themselves engaged in sex work, choosing instead to base their arguments in theory and outdated experiences. Feminists who do not support the radical anti-prostitution view, argue that there are serious problems with the anti-prostitution position, one of which is that, according to Sarah Bromberg, \"it evolves from a political theory that is over-verbalized, generalized, and too often uses stereotypical notions of what a prostitute is. The radical [anti-prostitution] feminist views are ... not always delineated sufficiently to support a credible theory that prostitution degrades all women\".\n\nPro-sex work feminists say that the sex industry is not a \"monolith\", that it is large and varied, that people are sex workers for many different reasons, and that it is unproductive to target prostitution as an institution. Instead, they believe things should be done to improve the lives of the people within the industry.\n\nMany feminists consider strip clubs to be insulting to women's human rights and dignity. Feminists and women's rights activists in Iceland succeeded in outlawing strip clubs in March 2010. The law officially took effect on July 31, 2010. The Icelandic feminist Siv Friðleifsdóttir was the first presenter of the bill. Johanna Sigurðardottir, Iceland's prime minister, said: \"The Nordic countries are leading the way on women's equality, recognizing women as equal citizens rather than commodities for sale.\" The politician behind the bill, Kolbrún Halldórsdóttir, said: \"It is not acceptable that women or people in general are a product to be sold.\" The vote of the Althing was praised by British radical feminist Julie Bindel, who declared Iceland to be \"the world's most feminist country.\"\n\nOthers feminists believe that stripping can be sexually empowering and feminist. The Lusty Lady is a peep show establishment in North Beach, San Francisco, that was established by a group of strippers who wanted to create a feminist, worker owned strip club. Additionally, some feminists believe that Pole dancing can be a feminist act. In 2009, a self-identified \"feminist pole dancer\" named Zahra Stardust was the Australian Sex Party's candidate in the Bradfield by-election. The concept of \"feminist pole dancing\" has been ridiculed and denounced by feminists and non-feminists alike as \"just plain daft\" and symptomatic of \"the end of feminism.\"\n\nFeminist Views on BDSM vary widely from rejection to acceptance and all points in between. As an example, the two polarizing frameworks are being compared here. The history between feminists and BDSM practitioners has been controversial. The two most extreme positions are those who believe that feminism and BDSM are mutually exclusive beliefs, and those who believe that BDSM practices are an expression of sexual freedom.\n\nA number of radical feminists, such as Andrea Dworkin and Susan Griffin, regard BDSM as a form of woman-hating violence,\n\nThe book \"\" includes essays and interviews from numerous feminists who criticize sadomasochism, including Alice Walker, Robin Morgan, Kathleen Barry, Diana E. H. Russell, Susan Star, Ti-Grace Atkinson, John Stoltenberg, Sarah Hoagland, Susan Griffin, Cerridwen Fallingstar, Audre Lorde, and Judith Butler. Feminist organizations that publicly opposed S/M/ include Lavender Menace, the New York Radical Feminists (NYRF), Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media. In 1982, a leaflet was produced by the \"Coalition for a Feminist Sexuality and Against Sadomasochism\", an ad-hoc coalition put together by Women Against Pornography to protest the Barnard Conference. The NYRF's NYRF was listed among the signatories to the leaflet.\n\nWhile many radical feminists are opposed to BDSM, other feminists view S/M as an ideal feminist expression of sexual freedom while other feminists say that BDSM, and more particularly SM, reinforce patriarchy and that these practices are contradictory to feminism. Additionally, some feminists are open about practicing BDSM. Many sex-positive feminists see BDSM as a valid form of expression of female sexuality. Some lesbian feminists practice BDSM and regard it as part of their sexual identity. Jessica Wakeman wrote of her own experience with SM activities in a follow-up interview after her article First Time For Everything: Getting Spanked was published in 2009. At the time of the interview in October, 2010, Wakeman had been writing about feminist issues, including feminism and media criticism, feminism and politics, and feminism and sex for about eight years and considered herself to be a rather active feminist. Wakeman discussed how she is able to enjoy spanking play and being dominated and still be a feminist. Like other feminist BDSM practitioners, Wakeman rejects the argument that women are taught what they enjoy and led to be submissive by a dominant sexist power structure.\n\nThere are several BDSM organizations that cater to lesbian and feminist women, including the Lesbian Sex Mafia and the group Samois that was founded by Patrick Califia and Gayle Rubin.\n\nThe feminist group Cell 16, founded in 1968 by Roxanne Dunbar, was known for its program of celibacy and separation from men, among other things. Considered too extreme by many mainstream feminists, the organization acted as a sort of hard left vanguard. It has been cited as the first organization to advance the concept of separatist feminism. In \"No More Fun and Games\", the organization's radical feminist periodical, Cell Members Roxanne Dunbar and Lisa Leghorn advised women to \"separate from men who are not consciously working for female liberation\", but advised periods of celibacy, rather than lesbian relationships, which they considered to be \"nothing more than a personal solution.\" The periodical also published Dana Densmore's article \"On Celibacy\" (October 1968), which stated in part, \"One hangup to liberation is a supposed 'need' for sex. It is something that must be refuted, coped with, demythified, or the cause of female liberation is doomed. Already we see girls, thoroughly liberated in their own heads, understanding their oppression with terrible clarity trying, deliberately and a trace hysterically, to make themselves attractive to men, men for whom they have no respect, men they may even hate, because of 'a basic sexual-emotional need.' Sex is not essential to life, as eating is. Some people go through their whole lives without engaging in it at all, including fine, warm, happy people. It is a myth that this makes one bitter, shriveled up, twisted. The big stigma of life-long virginity is on women anyway, created by men because woman's purpose in life is biological and if she doesn't fulfill that she's warped and unnatural and 'must be all cobwebs inside.'\" \n\nThe Feminists, also known as Feminists—A Political Organization to Annihilate Sex Roles, was a radical feminist group active in New York City from 1968 to 1973; it at first advocated that women practice celibacy, and later came to advocate political lesbianism. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a choice, and advocates lesbianism as a positive alternative to heterosexuality for women. Sheila Jeffreys helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group a pamphlet titled \"Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\", which stated, \"We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women.\" Thus, some political lesbians chose to be celibate or identified as asexual.\n\nIn April 1987 the manifesto of the Southern Women's Writing Collective, titled \"Sex resistance in heterosexual arrangements: Manifesto of the Southern Women's Writing Collective\" was read in New York City at a conference called \"The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism\".<ref name=\"Sisyphe http://sisyphe.org\"></ref> This manifesto stated in part, \"In contrast to the pro-sex movement, we are calling ourselves Women Against Sex (WAS)...The sex resister understands her act as a political one: her goal is not only personal integrity for herself but political freedom for all women. She resists on three fronts: she resists all male-constructed sexual needs, she resists the misnaming of her act as prudery and she especially resists the patriarchy's attempt to make its work of subordinating women easier by consensually constructing her desire in its own oppressive image.\" \nIn 1991 feminist activist Sonia Johnson wrote in her book \"The Ship That Sailed into the Living Room: Sex and Intimacy Reconsidered\", \"Nearly four years after I began my rebellion against relation/sex/slave Ships, experience and my Wise Old Woman are telling me that sex as we know it is a patriarchal construct and \"has\" no rightful, natural place in our lives, no authentic function or ways. Synonymous with hierarchy/control, sex is engineered as part of the siege against our wholeness and power.\" \n\nFeminist approaches to the issue of sexual orientation widely vary. Feminist views on sexual orientation are often influenced by the personal experiences of feminists, as expressed in the feminist slogan \"the personal is political.\" Because of this, many feminists view sexual orientation is a political issue and not merely a matter of individual sexual choice or preference.\n\nA 1977 paper titled \"Asexual and Autoerotic Women: Two Invisible Groups\", by Myra T. Johnson, may be the first paper explicitly devoted to asexuality in humans. In it Johnson portrays asexual women as invisible, \"oppressed by a consensus that they are nonexistent,\" and left behind by both the sexual revolution and the feminist movement.\n\nA 2010 paper written by Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled \"New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice\", states that society has deemed \"[LGBT and] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro-sex feminism [in which it is] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities.\"\n\nSome political lesbians identify as asexual. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a choice, and advocates lesbianism as a positive alternative to heterosexuality for women. Sheila Jeffreys helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group a pamphlet titled \"Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\" which stated, \"We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women.\"\n\nThe lesbian quarterly \"Common Lives/Lesbian Lives\" had a policy that all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the University of Iowa Human Rights Commission by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.\n\nA number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian-feminist activism have since come out as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was anti-feminist, that bisexuality was a form of false consciousness, and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were \"deluded and desperate.\" However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.\n\nNevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a \"fashionable trend\" being promoted due to \"sexual hedonism\" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers.\n\nFor further reading on feminism and bisexuality, please see \"Closer to Home: Bisexuality & Feminism\" (1992), an anthology edited by Elizabeth Reba Weise. Also please see \"Bisexuality: The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Lesbian Feminism?\", by Beth Elliot, \"The Fine Art of Labeling: The Convergence of Anarchism, Feminism, and Bisexuality\", by Lucy Friedland and Liz Highleyman, \"Bisexual Feminist Man\", by Dave Matteson, and \"Bi-Lovable Japanese Feminist\", by Kei Uwano, in the anthology \"\" (1991).\n\nIn her 2003 book \"Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective\", Australian radical lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys advances the position that lesbian culture has been negatively affected by emulating the sexist influence of the gay male subculture of dominant/submissive sexuality. While she stresses that many gay men who were members of the gay liberation movement repudiated sadomasochism, she writes that the dominant gay male perspective has promoted sadomasochistic sexuality to the detriment of lesbians and feminist women.\n\nHowever, some gay men such as Andrea Dworkin's husband John Stoltenberg are also critical of sadomasochism and pornography and agree with the radical feminist and lesbian feminist criticisms of these practices. Stoltenberg wrote that sadomasochism eroticizes both violence and powerlessness. The gay pro-feminist author Christopher N. Kendall wrote the book \"Gay Male Pornography: An Issue Of Sex Discrimination\", advancing the idea that gay male pornography involved sex discrimination and should be banned under Canada's equality laws. He uses radical feminist theory to make the case that gay male pornography reinforces misogyny and homophobia.\n\nSome heterosexual feminists believe that they have been unfairly excluded from lesbian feminist organizations. The lesbian quarterly \"Common Lives/Lesbian Lives\" had a policy that all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the University of Iowa Human Rights Commission by a heterosexual woman who believed she was discriminated against when not hired to be an intern. A complaint was also lodged with the collective by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.\n\nLesbians have been active in the mainstream American feminist movement. The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the National Organization for Women came in 1969, when Ivy Bottini, an open lesbian who was then president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, held a public forum titled \"Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?\". However, National Organization for Women president Betty Friedan was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969 she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a \"lavender menace\" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor Rita Mae Brown, and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including Ivy Bottini, from NOW's New York chapter. In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read \"Lavender Menace\" came to the front of the room and faced the audience. One of the women then read their group's paper \"The Woman-Identified Woman\", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement. The group, who later named themselves \"Radicalesbians\", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms. In 1971 NOW passed a resolution declaring \"that a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle,\" as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust. That year NOW also committed to offering legal and moral support in a test case involving child custody rights of lesbian mothers. In 1973 the NOW Task Force on Sexuality and Lesbianism was established. In November 1977 the National Women's Conference issued the National Plan of Action, which stated in part, \"Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding, and the military. State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation.\" \n\nDel Martin was the first open lesbian elected to NOW, and Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon were the first lesbian couple to join NOW.\n\nLesbian feminism is a cultural movement and political perspective, most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s (primarily in North America and Western Europe), that encourages women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and often advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. Some key thinkers and activists are Charlotte Bunch, Rita Mae Brown, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Marilyn Frye, Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys and Monique Wittig (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of queer theory). Lesbian feminism came together in the early 1970s out of dissatisfaction with second-wave feminism and the gay liberation movement.\n\nIn the words of radical lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, \"Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the WLM [Women's Liberation Movement] began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian politics, and lesbians in the GLF (Gay Liberation Front) left to join up with their sisters\".\n\nAccording to Judy Rebick, a leading Canadian journalist and political activist for feminism, lesbians were and always have been at the heart of the women's movement, while their issues were invisible in the same movement.\n\nLesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy, and as a lifelong practice but mostly the latter.\n\nLesbian separatism became popular in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether mainstream society or even the LGBT movement had anything to offer them.\n\nPolitical lesbianism is a phenomenon within lesbian feminism and radical feminism, primarily second-wave feminism. Political lesbianism embraces the theory that sexual orientation is a choice, and advocates lesbianism as a positive alternative to heterosexuality for women.\n\nLesbian women who have identified themselves as \"political lesbians\" include Ti-Grace Atkinson, Julie Bindel, Charlotte Bunch, Yvonne Rainer, Sheila Jeffreys. Jeffreys helped develop the concept by co-writing with other members of the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group a pamphlet titled \"Love Your Enemy?: The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\" which argued that women should abandon heterosexuality and choose to become lesbians as a feminist act. The pamphlet stated, \"We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women.\" Thus, some political lesbians choose to be celibate or identify as asexual.\n\nCommon lesbian-feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was anti-feminist, that bisexuality was a form of false consciousness, and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were \"deluded and desperate.\" However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community. Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as Julie Bindel are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a \"fashionable trend\" being promoted due to \"sexual hedonism\" and broached the question of whether bisexuality even exists. She has also made tongue-in-cheek comparisons of bisexuals to cat fanciers and devil worshippers.\n\nLesbian feminists initially faced discrimination in the National Organization for Women. Some heterosexual feminists such as Betty Friedan downplayed lesbian issues as not being central to feminist activism. In 1969 Friedan referred to growing lesbian visibility as a \"lavender menace\" and fired openly lesbian newsletter editor Rita Mae Brown, and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including Ivy Bottini, from NOW's New York chapter. In reaction, at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, on the first evening when all four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium, twenty women wearing T-shirts that read \"Lavender Menace\" came to the front of the room and faced the audience. One of the women then read their group's paper \"The Woman-Identified Woman\", which was the first major lesbian feminist statement.

State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation.\" \n\nFriedan eventually admitted that \"the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy.\" and acknowledged that she had been very square and was uncomfortable about lesbianism. \"The women's movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs and all the rest of it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn't be the main issue ...\" She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women initially and objected to what she saw as demands for equal time. \"'Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women's movement is all about.'\" While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband or self-identify as a lesbian (although heterosexual) as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care. In 1977, at the National Women's Conference, she seconded the lesbian rights resolution \"which everyone thought I would oppose\" in order to \"preempt any debate\" and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe American radical feminist group Redstockings were strongly opposed to lesbian separatism, seeing interpersonal relationships with men as an important arena of feminist struggle, and hence seeing separatism as escapist. Like many radical feminists of the time, Redstockings saw lesbianism primarily as a political identity rather than a fundamental part of personal identity, and therefore analyzed it primarily in political terms. Redstockings were also opposed to male homosexuality, which they saw as a deeply misogynistic rejection of women. Redstockings' line on gay men and lesbians is often criticized as homophobic.\n\nQueer theory' is a field of post-structuralist critical theory that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of queer studies and women's studies. Queer theory has been heavily influenced by the work of feminists such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Judith Butler. Queer theory builds both upon feminist challenges to the idea that gender is part of the essential self and upon gay/lesbian studies' close examination of the socially constructed nature of sexual acts and identities.\n\nQueer theory has been greatly influenced by feminist theory and women's studies. Many works have been written on the intersection of feminism and queer theory and how both feminist persepectives can enrich LGBTQ theory and studies and how queer perspectives can enrich feminism. Books such as \"Feminism is Queer: The Intimate Connection Between Queer and Feminist Theory\" detail the intersections between queer and feminist theory and argue that feminism itself could be construed as a \"queer\" movement.\n\nMany feminists have critiqued queer theory as either a diversion from feminism issues or as a male-dominated backlash to feminism. Lesbian feminists and radical feminists have been the most prominent critics of queer theory and queer politics. Sheila Jeffreys' \"Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective\" harshly criticizes queer theory as the product of \"a powerful gay male culture\" which \"celebrated masculine privilege\" and \"enshrined a cult of masculinity.\" She repudiates queer theory as anti-lesbian, anti-feminist, and anti-women.\n\nFeminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of sexology that focuses on the intersectionality of sex and gender in relation to the sexual lives of women. Feminist sexology shares many principles with the overarching field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or \"normality\" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. It is a young field, but one that is growing rapidly. Notable feminist sexologists include Anne Fausto-Sterling and Gayle Rubin.\n\nA notable radical feminist work on women's sexuality is Anne Koedt's The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm, which advances the claim that vaginal orgasm is a patriarchal myth.\n\nRape culture is a culture in which rape and sexual violence are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media normalize, excuse, tolerate, or even condone sexual violence. Examples of behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include victim blaming, slut-shaming, sexual objectification, and trivializing rape. Rape culture has been used to model behaviour within social groups, including prison systems where prison rape is common and conflict areas where war rape is used as psychological warfare. Entire countries have also been alleged to be rape cultures.\n\nAlthough the concept of rape culture is a generally accepted theory in feminist academia, disagreement still exists over what defines a rape culture and to what degree a given society meets the criteria to be considered a rape culture.\n\nRape culture has been observed to correlate with other social factors and behaviours. Research identifies correlation between rape myths, victim blaming and trivialisation of rape with increased incidence of racism, homophobia, ageism, classism, religious intolerance and other forms of discrimination.\n\nFeminists have been crucial to the development of the notion of sexual harassment and the codification of laws against sexual harassment. Catharine MacKinnon was among the first to write on the topic of sexual harassment. MacKinnon's book \"Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination\" is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by Fred Shapiro in January 2000.\n\nSome liberal feminists and individualist feminists have criticized the notion of sexual harassment. Camille Paglia says that young girls can end up acting in such ways as to make sexual harassment easier, such that for example, by acting \"nice\" they can become a target. Paglia commented in an interview with Playboy, \"Realize the degree to which your niceness may invoke people to say lewd and pornographic things to you—sometimes to violate your niceness. The more you blush, the more people want to do it.\" Jane Gallop believes that sexual harassment laws have been abused by what she calls \"victim feminists\", as opposed to \"power feminists\" as she calls herself.\n\nThe concept of sexual objectification and, in particular, the objectification of women, is an important idea in feminist theory and psychological theories derived from feminism. Many feminists regard sexual objectification as objectionable and as playing an important role in gender inequality. Some social commentators, however, argue that some modern women objectify themselves as an expression of their empowerment over men, while others argue that increased sexual freedom for women, gay, and bisexual men has led to an increase of the objectification of men.\n\nThe \"male gaze\" is feminist theory that was first developed by Laura Mulvey in 1975. The male gaze occurs when the audience, or viewer, is put into the perspective of a heterosexual male. Mulvey stressed that the dominant male gaze in mainstream Hollywood films reflects and satisfies the male unconscious: most filmmakers are male, thus the voyeuristic gaze of the camera is male; male characters in the film's narratives make women the objects of their gaze; and inevitably, the spectator's gaze reflects the voyeuristic male gazes of the camera and the male actors. When feminism characterizes the \"male gaze\" certain themes appear such as, voyeurism, objectification, fetishism, scopophilia, and women as the object of male pleasure. Mary Anne Doane gives an example of how voyeurism can be seen in the male gaze. \"The early silent cinema, through its insistent inscription of scenarios of voyeurism, conceives of its spectator's viewing pleasure in terms of the peeping tom, behind the screen, reduplicating the spectator's position in relation to the woman on the screen.\"\n\n"}

The book has 72 short discourses.\n\nAccording to J. M. Sadeghi the title \"Fihi ma fihi\" has appeared on a copy dated 1316. Another copy of the book dated 1350 has the title Asrar al-jalalieh.

The title Maghalat-e Mowlana of copies of the book published in Iran follows this.\n\nNot much is known about the publication time and the writer of the book. According to B. Forouzanfar, the editor of the most reliable copy of the book, it is likely that the book was written by Sultanwalad, the eldest son of Rumi, based on manuscripts and notes taken by himself or others from the lectures of his father on \"Masnavi-i Ma'navi\".\n\nIn the \"Essence of Rumi\", John Baldock states that Fihi Mafihi was one of Rumi's discourses written towards the end of his life. Rumi lived from 1207 to 1273 so \"Fihi Mafihi\" was likely written some time between 1260 and 1273 by Rumi himself.\n\nThis book is one of the first Persian prose books after the so-called Persian literature revolution (enghelāb-e adabi). Moreover, the book has become an introduction to the \"Masnavi\". Also many concepts in Sufism are described in this book in simple terms.\n\nThe book has been (freely) translated into English under the title Discourses of Rumi by A. J. Arberry in 1961 and consists of 71 discourses. An authoritative translation by Dr. Bankey Behari was published in 1998 under the title Fiha Ma Fiha, Table Talk of Maulani Rumi (DK Publishers, New Delhi), .\n\n\n"}

Built in 1900, it was designed by Kansas City architect Louis S. Curtiss. The theater was associated with the adjoining Edward Hotel (known later as the Hotel Missouri), which was also designed by Curtiss; the hotel was demolished in 1965. \n\nThe Standard Theatre opened with 2,400 seats on September 23, 1900, featuring burlesque and vaudeville. It was built by Colonel Edward Butler of St. Louis, Missouri, at a cost of $250,000, for his son to present shows on the Empire vaudeville circuit. In 1901, a fire at the nearby Coates Opera House caused opera and comic opera performances to be moved to the Standard, featuring such performers as Sarah Bernhardt, Richard Mansfield, and Maude Adams. The theater's name changed to the \"Century\" in 1902. The Century featured acts from the Empire burlesque circuit, including Al Jolson, Fannie Brice, and Eddie Foy. In addition to theater acts, the Century featured prizefighting and wrestling, with appearances by Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey. Johnson stayed in the manager's apartment, as hotels refused to rent him a room.\n\nThe Shubert brothers bought the Century in 1923 and renamed it \"Shubert's Missouri\" after extensive renovations by Shubert architect Herbert J. Krapp. The Shuberts booked dramatic productions including Shakespeare and O'Neill plays. The Marx Brothers performed \"I'll Say She Is\" for three weeks in 1923-24, the long run convincing the Shuberts to continue operating the theater. After 1928, business began falling off and the theater was used for touring shows on an intermittent basis until it closed in 1932. After a tax sale it eventually reopened in 1941 as \"The Folly\", featuring striptease. Performers included Gypsy Rose Lee and Tempest Storm, and before the Folly closed in January 1974, Chesty Gabor. The theater began showing \"adult\" movies in 1969, apparently prompting an unknown person to plant a dynamite stick in a drainpipe on December 29, 1969.\n\nIn 1974 the theater's then owners, Annbar Associates and Elk Realty of New York announced that if a new buyer could not be identified by the end of the year, the theater would be demolished to make way for a parking lot. A group of local historic preservation activists, including Joan Dillon and William N. Deramus III, formed a nonprofit, the Performing Arts Foundation, to raise the money to purchase and restore the theater. The theater was offered for sale for $950,000. Performing Arts Foundation raised $350,000 in contributions and through negotiation convinced Annbar Associates to offer the remaining $600,000 of the purchase price as a donation. Following the Folly's listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, a \"Strip the Folly\" fundraiser was held featuring Sally Rand, who had performed at the Folly. After seven years a full renovation was completed in 1981, including the construction of an annex on the site of the former Edward Hotel.\n\nIn the Folly's centennial year of 2000, a new lobby, restrooms, and second-floor Shareholders' Room were added. In 2005, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Folly's reopening, the auditorium's original color scheme was restored. Plans are now under way, and approval has been granted by the Kansas City Landmarks Commission, to install a marquee sign that closely mimics the original Folly signage.\n\nThe Performing Arts Foundation of Kansas City, d.b.a. The Folly Theater, is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit corporation whose mission is \"to preserve Kansas City's oldest historic theater as a premier performance venue by presenting, producing, and hosting a wide range of quality events for the community\". The Folly produces a Jazz Series, a Kids Series, and \"Cyprus Avenue Live!\" performances by artists ranging from blues to rock and country. It hosts the Harriman-Jewell Series of classical performers, the Friends of Chamber Music series, and the Heartland Men's Chorus.\n\nThe Neo-Palladian facade uses Carthage limestone and red pressed brick, with an adapted Palladian window centered in the facade. Rather than a fully glazed infill within the limestone Palladian framework, the lower portion of the unit uses three arched windows with an entablature over the center window dividing it from the lunette under the principal arch. The street level is heavily rusticated limestone with three arched entrances and wrapping a short way around the right (east) side to form an additional arch. The east wall contains small limestone-framed ventilation openings near the top, as well as emergency exits and a high opening for stage scenery. The building is deep, wide and high.\n\nThe interior structure mixes steel and wood construction. There is a basement under the stage, housing mechanical systems and backstage service spaces. The main floor is entered through a lobby and a box office area. The house contains three sections of seats facing a highly decorated proscenium arch. The house is flanked by balcony-level boxes, with the main balcony to the rear. The stage is provided with a fly loft, fly balconies, a scenery workshop, and ten dressing rooms. Interior decoration is predominantly red and gold.\n\nThe exterior is largely unaltered, but the interior has been substantially renovated. In 1923, the lobby was reduced in size, moving the box office and eliminating a secondary box office for the balcony, while the balcony itself and a gallery level were replaced by a single larger balcony, reducing seating capacity. Plasterwork in the upper levels was replaced at this time, and a manager's apartment was removed.\n\nCurrent seating capacity is 1,078 seats.\n\n"}

{"id": "24642474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24642474", "title": "Hardy Amies (fashion house)", "text": "Hardy Amies (fashion house)\n\nHardy Amies London Limited is a British-based fashion house specialising in modern luxury menswear. Amies was a pioneer of ready-to-wear menswear market in the 1950s, and starting in the 1960s Amies was commissioned to create high-profile specialized clothing for customers including British World cup and Olympic teams, Stanley Kubrick for \"\", and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe fashion house has changed ownership several times over the course of its history, and is currently the property of Fung Capital.\n\nSir Hardy Amies, KCVO (17 July 1909 – 5 March 2003), was born Edwin Amies in Maida Vale, London. His father was an architect for the London County Council, his mother a saleswoman for Madame Gray at Machinka & May, London. In his teens, he adopted his mother's maiden name, Hardy – and always cited her as the inspiration for his chosen professional path.\n\nAmies was educated at Brentwood School, Essex, leaving in 1927. Although his father wanted him to attend Cambridge University, it was his ambition to become a journalist. His father relented and arranged for a meeting between his son and R. D. Blumenfeld, the editor of the Daily Express. His father was mortified when Blumenfeld suggested his son travel around Europe to gain some worldly experience. After spending three years in France and Germany; learning the languages, working for a customs agent and then as an English tutor in Antibes and later Bendorf, Germany – Amies returned to England, where in 1930 he became a sales assistant in a ceramic wall-tile factory, after which he secured a trainee position as a weight machine salesman with W & T Avery Ltd. in Birmingham.\n\nIt was Amies' mother’s contacts in the fashion world, and his flair for writing, that secured him his first job in fashion. It was his vivid description of a dress, written in a letter to a retired French seamstress, which brought Hardy to the attention of the owner of the Mayfair couture house Lachasse on Farm Street, Berkeley Square, as the wearer of the dress was the owner's wife. He became managing director at the age of 25, in 1934. In 1937, he scored his first success with a Linton tweed suit in sage green with a cerise overcheck called ‘Panic’. ‘Panic’ was to be his debut into the fashion bible Vogue and was photographed by Cecil Beaton. By the late 1930s, Hardy was designing the entire Lachasse collection. His second celebration creation was ‘Made in England’, a biscuit-coloured checked suit for the Hollywood ingénue Mildred Shay. He left Lachasse in 1939 and joined the House of Worth in 1941.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, he had been recruited into military intelligence because of his fluent German and French. He listed among his accomplishments on his application mountaineering, shooting, boxing and sketching. Amies saw service in the Special Operations Executive or SOE. Posted to SOE Headquarters in Baker Street in London, Amies was put in charge of the Belgium section and worked with the various Belgian resistance groups organising sabotage assignments. Amies rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. SOE's commander Major General Colin Gubbins did not regard a dressmaker as suitable military material, but his training report stated:\n\n\"This officer is far tougher both physically and mentally than his rather precious appearance would suggest. He possesses a keen brain and an abundance of shrewd sense. His only handicap is his precious appearance and manner, and these are tending to decrease.\"\nOn 12 November 1945; Virginia, the Countess of Jersey (erstwhile Hollywood film star and the first Mrs. Cary Grant), who had been a former client during Hardy’s days at Laschasse, financed Hardy Amies move to Savile Row. The following January, Amies established his own couture fashion house business: Hardy Amies Ltd. Although Savile Row is the home of English bespoke tailoring, the Hardy Amies brand developed to become known for its classic and beautifully tailored clothes for both men and women. Hardy’s business quickly took off in the postwar years when customers, who had been deprived of couture for the preceding years, snapped up his elegant, traditional designs. Hardy was quoted at the times as saying, “A woman's day clothes must look equally good at Salisbury Station as the Ritz bar”. Amies was vice-chairman of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers from 1954 to 56, and chairman from 1959 to 60.\n\nHardy Amies is located at 14 Savile Row besides Cad & the Dandy.\n\nAmies was successful in business by being able to commercially extract value from his designs, while not replicating his brand to the point of exploitation. Amies was one of the first European designers to venture into the ready-to-wear market when he teamed up with Hepworths in 1959 to design a range of menswear. In 1961, Amies made fashion history by staging the first men's ready-to-wear catwalk shows, at the Savoy Hotel in London. The runway show was a first on many levels as it was both the first time music was played and for the designer to accompany models on the catwalk.\n\nAmies also undertook design for in-house work wear, which developed from designing special clothes for the England 1966 World Cup team, the 1972 British Olympic squad; and groups such as the Oxford University Boat Club and London Stock Exchange. During the mid-1970s, he ventured into interior design, including designs for Crown Wallpaper. In 1974, Amies was entered into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1967, Amies was commissioned by director Stanley Kubrick to design the costumes for his film \"\". The collection allowed Amies to design totally futuristic fashions. In \"2001\", the standard attire was a business-as-usual approach to the corporate fashion. There were no neck-ties as they were in zero gravity. The Russian women scientists wore dark conservative clothing, reflecting their own conservative values. Although Kubrick's \"2001\" wardrobe was practical, it still reflected the mid-1960s slender look. The military and spacecraft uniforms were as common as they are now, with no dramatic changes. American women in \"2001\" retained roles they held in the 1960s as Hotel receptionists and air stewardesses. The women wore space-age travelling hats while carrying hand bags. According to 'Setting the Scene' by Robert S. Sennett (Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, 1994), many design elements of the film seem to reflect swinging London c. 1968, rather than the imagined future. The stewardesses' uniforms, designed by Hardy Amies, look like the uncomfortable unisex pant suits that were being promoted in the late 1960s. An epic science fiction film, it demonstrated the immense range of Amies' design ability, and was nominated for four Academy Awards – receiving one for visual effects. The film was an inductee of the 1991 National Film Registry list.\n\nAmies' work was seen in a handful of other films of the 1960s: he dressed Albert Finney in \"Two for the Road\", Tony Randall in \"The Alphabet Murders\", Joan Greenwood in \"The Amorous Prawn\" and Deborah Kerr in \"The Grass is Greener\".\n\nAmies is best known to the British public for his work for Queen Elizabeth II. The association began in 1950, when Amies made several outfits for the then Princess Elizabeth's royal tour to Canada. Although the couture side of the Hardy Amies business was traditionally less financially successful, the award of a Royal Warrant as official dressmaker in 1955 gave his house respectability and publicity. One of his best known creations is the gown he designed in 1977 for Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee portrait, which he said was \"immortalised on a thousand biscuit tins.\" An estimated 500 million people watched the day of events on television. Knighted in 1989, Amies held the Warrant until his death in 2003. He gave up visiting The Queen himself in 1990 so that his Design Director Ken Fleetwood could create for the Queen until 1996. The House of Hardy Amies was still designing for her under Design Director Jon Moore until 2002.\n\nHaving written a regular column for \"Esquire\" magazine on men's fashion, in 1964 Amies published the book \"ABC of Men's Fashion.\" Amies's strict male dress code – with commandments on everything from socks to the summer wardrobe – made compelling reading: When in July 2009, the Hardy Amies designer archive was opened on Savile Row, the Victoria & Albert Museum reissued the book.\n\nIn May 1973, Hardy Amies Ltd. was sold to Debenhams, which had already purchased Hepworths who distributed the Hardy Amies line. Amies purchased the business back in 1981. In May 2001, Amies sold his business to the Luxury Brands Group. He retired at the end of the year, when Moroccan-born designer Jacques Azagury became head of couture. In November 2008, after going bankrupt, the Hardy Amies brand was acquired by Fung Capital. Hardy Amies is now owned by No.14 Savile Row, which in turn is owned by Fung Capital which is the private investment holding company of the Fung family who are separately the controlling shareholders of publicly listed Li & Fung Limited and Trinity Limited.\n\n"}

The volumes, published in 2008 and 2009, contain watercolours painted by invited leading botanical artists from around the world. The colour plates are reproduced in their original size from watercolour drawings. The publication is a limited edition of 175 sets, each signed by the Prince and all the royalties from the Highgrove Florilegium are donated to The Prince's Charities Foundation. The text is by Christopher Humphries and Frederick J. Rumsey and the preface is by HRH The Prince of Wales. The publisher is Addison Publications. Each set is accompanied by a handmade green felt book cover with maroon ties.\n\nThe book contains original sketches of motifs from the garden at Highgrove decorate the text and the end papers. The decorative motifs include plants in the garden, the Princes' tree house, the dove cote and the flock of Indian Runner Ducks.\n\nThe printing of both the text and the image pages used stochastic lithography in order to create outstanding quality prints from the original watercolours. Stochastic lithography is an advancement in printing technology that can give a better print quality, cleaner more dynamic and accurate colour images, and reduce running waste. Whereas conventional lithography uses half-tone dots of various sizes and spaces these dots at the same distance from each other, stochastic lithography uses microdots of a common size of various spacing according to tonal value. Stochastic screening uses smaller printing dots to create a higher image detail. Tonal ranges and colour contrasts are also improved because the variation in dot distribution increases ink densities. The images were printed on 245 gsm American Cotton paper for the colour plates and on 175 gsm Somerset Bookwove text paper. The text is set in Fairbank and Bembo book types.\n\nThe books are half-bound in red goatskin with marbled paper boards and sprinkled edges. The pages were collated and sewn by hand. That is, after the text and plate pages were soft folded, holes were punched into them for the sewing needle. Then the pages were sewn and the boards of the book cover were laced on. The collated and sewn books are hand finished with embossed hand tooled leather motifs and gold leaf tooling on the spine.\n\nEach sheet of paper was hand marbled separately using the traditional technique of sprinkling the colours onto a viscous fluid prepared from Carragheen moss and manipulating a pattern in the paint using a stylus. The paper is carefully lowered onto the floating pattern and then lifted, rinsed and hung out to dry. Each pattern on each piece of paper must be controlled to check they are the same.\n\nEach plate is signed by the artist and blind embossed to record the copyright of A.G.

It is also known as \"Los Toriles\" and contains the only vestiges of the western cultures in Nayarit.\n\nThe presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of petroglyphs are registered in five areas, the most important are \"El Terrero\", \"Sayulapa\" and \"El Veladero\", which depict sgraffiti lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.\n\nOf the traditional Shaft Tombs, five large concentration areas are identified, containing human bone remains; domestic pottery ollas, comales and cantaros (pitchers)]; as well as sculpture type remains (human and animal figures).\n\nIn remote times in which early American settlers crossed the Behring Strait, several sedentary groups migrated south. The territory of present-day Nayarit State has manifestations of those settlers, chronologically and consecutively located in three cultural periods: Los Concheros, the shaft tomb tradition and the Aztatlán tradition.\n\nLos concheros (\"concha\" = shell), is a name given to groups dedicated to the sea exploitation of the ocean shores, and in the process developed the first settlements, with sea shells. According to archaeologist Gabriela Zepeda, the Matanchén and San Blas coves, it was in the Nayarit shores where history commenced in these lands. From about 2000 BCE up to 1500 CE, an amazing occupation persisted by a culture that perceived the sea as merciful and stormy God. It was also the origin of artistic ceramic modeling and cooking.\n\nOn the traditional shaft tomb tradition, five major areas of concentration were identified, containing bones; ceramics for domestic use (pots, comales and pitchers); and remains of sculptural type (human and animal figures).\n\nThe Shaft Tomb Tradition (500 BCE - 500 CE) constitutes a peculiar feature of mesoamerican prehispanic development in México, although there are analog burials forms elsewhere in the continent. Shaft Tombs thus far discovered in the Nayarit territory, were found and excavated outside of the settlement sites of that epoch, in vertical shafts (Wells), with one or two chambers where their dead were placed together with human and animal sculptures, also with large vessels that contained funerary offerings, these reflect the development achieved by this tradition, with the particular regional characteristics found.\n\nThe Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition or shaft tomb culture refers to a set of interlocked cultural traits found in the western Mexican states of Jalisco, Nayarit, and, to a lesser extent, Colima to the south, roughly dating to the period between 300 BCE and 400 CE, although there are disagreements on this end-date. Nearly all of the artifacts associated with this shaft tomb tradition have been discovered by looters and are without provenance, making dating problematic. The first major undisturbed shaft tomb associated with the tradition was not discovered but until 1993, at Huitzilapa, Jalisco.\n\nThe shaft tomb tradition is thought to have developed around 300 BCE. Some shaft tombs predate the tradition by more than 1000 years, for example, the shaft tomb at El Opeño in Michoacán has been dated to 1500 BCE but it is linked to central, rather than western Mexico. Like much else concerning the tradition, its origins are not well understood, although the valleys around Tequila, Jalisco, which include the archaeological sites of Huitzilapa and Teuchitlan, constitute its \"undisputed core\". The tradition lasted until at least 300 CE although, as noted above, there is disagreement on the end date.\n\nThe archaeological ruins of \"Los Toriles\" are related to the Aztatlán tradition. Its buildings contain temples with stairs and worship places made of round stones jointed with clay, stone slabs and in some cases, with motif carved stones including spirals and a snake.\n\nThe Aztatlán tradition is chronologically located on a period from 700 BCE throughout 1520 CE, it is considered a western mesoamerican cultural event that shares cultural traits with the Toltec and received cultural influences from central highlands.\n\nThis rich tradition is manifested in their varied and beautiful complex ceramic and polished stone, obsidian, and jade, such as: arrowheads; human instruments, gods and animals. Metal work impacted the agricultural activity and environmental exploitation, manufactured utilitarian artifacts as well as ornamental and sumptuary objects.\n\nArchitecture reached its peak when ballgame courts appeared, their construction prompted the organizing of large well designed platforms, patios and squares with pyramids of certain elevations, walkways and paved roads, stairways, worship stone carvings, columns as roof support, roofs, posts, palm and grass, utilization of adobe walls and floors. The burial was common in large pots where skeletons lie in sitting or extended position, accompanied by offerings primarily made of pottery.\n\nThe \" Aztatlán Tradition \" flourished in the south of the State with the cultural development of Ixtlán de Río, on a period from around 750 BCE to 1110 CE, recognized as the Mid-Ixtlán period. Its early phase corresponds to the period that goes from 300 BCE to 600 CE.\n\nFrom the \"Aztatlán Tradition\" the Shaft Tombs are highlighted, and it is noted that the discovery of Smoking pipes vestiges in Amapa imply that tobacco was farmed, there are also samples that demonstrate the use of metals, form manufacturing needles and fish hooks, also bricks for construction evidence was found.\n\nIn more recent times, within the \"Aztatlán tradition\", the now called Sentispac town, formerly known as Tzenticpac or Centicpac, was the seat of the lordship of the same name, which extended to Omitlán, Itzcuintla, Cillan and Atecomatlán and was occupied by Totorames native groups, who dominated and receiving tributes from Coras and Zayahuecos settled in the same coastal region.\n\nThe word \"Ixtlán\" is of Nahuatl origin, composed by the words \"Itz-ittztell\" that means obsidian, and \"Tlán\", that means place with abundance, that is, \"Place where obsidian is abundant\".\n\nAccording to the Mexican Municipalities Encyclopedia, Ixtlán, means place dedicated to Ehécatl, Wind God .\n\nThis important site was very possibly occupied from 300 BCE through 600 CE. During the first stage a cultural complex was developed known as the Shaft Tomb tradition in which offerings were placed inside of funeral chambers. Between 500 and 600 CE the Shaft Tomb tradition is abandoned and its development is registered within an ample cultural region known as Aztatlán, with an apogee towards 750 and 1,100 CE.\n\nWith the \"Tradición Aztatlán\" develops a new way of life and it begins towards 750 – 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as mid-Ixtlán period (750 - 1110) that represents the apogee of the city, dedicated to Ehécatl (Wind God); and late Ixtlán (1110–1525CE) identified by red smooth ceramic for domestic use as well as cajetes and tripod molcajetess decorated with white designs over red.\n\nThe city was founded in the 12th century, by Nahuatlaca tribes en route towards the Valley of Mexico, forming the Ahuacatlán Lordship, known by its building construction and trading of obsidian goods.\n\nIt is then that the urban settlement grows considerable with the construction of large terraces, palaces, temples and altars, acquiring a certain regional importance as manufacturing and commercial trade center. Although more than 85 mounds and structures have been located in the site, that remain still unexplored, at the moment it is only possible to visit fifteen structures, among them the building called Quetzalcoatl Temple that displays a circular shape with a parapet surrounding it and with peculiar perforations in cross shape.\n\nThe temple has two altars on top of the Mexico Central Plateau style. Other important buildings are structures called \"Reliefs Palace\", \"Columns Palace\", the \"Four Column Palace\" complex and the \"Square Palace\".\n\nIxtlán is the most studied archaeological zone in Nayarit. Its influence zone extended to the present day municipalities of Ixtlán del Rio, Ahuacatlán, Jala and Santa Maria del Oro. Their main towns were Cacalután, Tepuzhuacán, Mexpan, Zoatlán, Xala, Jomulco, Tequepexpan, Camotlán, Tetitlán, Acuitapilco and Zapotán.\n\nIn Santiago Ixcuintla, INAH has registered the existence of petroglyphs from the \"Los Concheros\" epoch, in the Las Parejas, Emérita, Yago, El Caballo and Acatán de las Piñas sites, with a total of 13 engravings, including the \"Piedra Galana\".\n\nThe presence of prehispanic vestiges in the form of Petroglyphs are registered in five areas, the most important are \"El Terrero\", \"Sayulapa\" and \"El Veladero\", which depict sgraffiti lines and representations of abstract figures, such as spirals with rays.\n\nThis stage of prehispanic development distinguishes and identifies western Mexico from other mesoamerican cultural expressions, during the late formative period and early classical. The Nayarit shaft tomb complexes are identified within the early Ixtlán period (300 BCE to 300 CE), and three distinctive clay modeling styles have been defined: Chimisco, Ixtlán and San Sebastian.\n\nThe pottery of this tradition shows abundance of colors, predominating red, orange, yellow beige and the \"negative\" form. Common themes are human beings as warriors, musicians, women, sick people and couples.\n\nThe Ixtlán del Río site is known as \"Los Toriles\", it was a constantly growing city and its inhabitants place huge importance to its buildings. They had urbanism knowledge, applied to an organized arrangement, with stairs, restricted accesses, open spaces, altars, sidewalks, drains, causeways, neighborhoods and palaces throughout the extensive city that flourished from 700 to 1200 CE.\n\nIt had its heyday as a city during the \"Aztatlán Tradition\" period, in an area extended over eighty hectares. In the late phase, that corresponds to the period from 1110 to 1525 CE, had artistic red smooth ceramic expressions for home use, vessels and molcajetes tripods with white decor on red. This same period developed the metallurgy used to produce ornamental, ritual objects and obsidian bifacial instruments. On slopes they built extensive terraces, palaces, worship spaces, people’s homes, farmland areas and obsidian carving workshops.\n\nIt is clear that it is still unknown what was their original culture, it is only known that they were predecessors of the Coras and Huichol or Wixáritari peoples, they believed in life after death. \nAccordingly, what their name was is not known, these were communities a little older than 2,200 years, and are known as belonging to the Shaft Tomb Tradition, constructed in vertical wells, round or square, representing the maternal uterus.\n\nAnthropologist Marina Anguiano concludes that at the Spaniards arrival to these lands, ethnic-linguistic groups existed of the Yuto-Aztec or Yuto-Nahuatl family, which had a socio-political structure divided into lordships, ruled by groups, possibly of noble rank, and a number of local lords.\n\nThis archaeological site is considered related to the Aztatlán tradition, of which Corinca was the last governor. Its constructions contain temples with stairways and altars made from round stones jointed with clay, slab stones and, in some cases, with carved stones with spirals and a serpent.\n\nThe site was founded, in the 12th century, by Nahuatlacas tribes while on their way to the Valley of Mexico, and formed part of the Ahuacatlán kingdom, known by its constructions and obsidian objects which they traded.\n\nThe site has an unusual pyramid for Mesoamerica; it is a round construction 24 meters diameter by four meters high. It has five stairways harmonically distributed around its perimeter. A wall that ends on top has small cruciform windows. Probably this was a ceremonial center dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, central image of the Toltec culture. The shaft tombs are the most representative funeral constructions of the area, although there are other modalities such as \"shaft tombs\" or earth graves where dead people were barely buried near the surface. Ceramics are constituted by spherical glasses with vertical walls tall neck and triple bell support. The most frequent ornamental motifs are flowers and streamlined butterflies, deer and tiger heads. There are many ceramic vessels decorated with white over red color rhombuses and segments.\n\nDue to its special characteristics, ceramics and sculptures from this region are known as \"Ixtlán style\".\n\nThe small 30 to 40 centimeters high sculptures distinguish themselves by ornaments consisting of earrings and nose perforations, where they placed one or more hoops.\n\nFrom the rich Ixtlán ceramics, scale models with excellent finishing are featured, from them we can intuit their forms of life, the social organization and the economic life characteristic of these towns. There are scale models that represent houses, groups in some activity and ballgame courts. These are always constructions with life and movement. Also, worth mentioning, are sculptures representing soldiers, identifiable from a spiked helmet; the chest is armor protected and in their hands a cane resembling a mallet. The lower part generally is naked.\n\nIxtlán del Río archaeological site has a plaza, with an altar with four small stairways and to the sides buildings that appear to be small rectangular rooms.\n\nThese temples/rooms are built on platforms with adobe pilasters, as well as sidewalks and stairways.\n\nOne of these temples has a road paved with stone slabs, which leads to the round monument, discovered in 1948 by Prof. José Corona Núñez and eloquently describes his discovery, stating: \"the round monument has 30 meters in diameter by 4 meters high;\" sloped walls crowned by a perforated parapet with crosses, as if skylights, four access stairs, limited by alfardas die finished, some of them still have cross shaped handrails.\n\nAbove, within the round patio, limiting the parapets are pyramid bases, one to the north and another at the south, with stairs geared toward the center. The North has a smooth vertical panel and the south has a beveled cornice. According to the remains found, these bases maintained small altars with column portals, ceilings and stone altered battlements: one shaped as arrowheads, others composed of a disk with two circles engraved, this monument is called \"Quetzalcoatl Temple\" and is believed to belong to the Toltec horizon by the Toltec cultural traits observed in its architecture.\n\nIn earlier times, between 300 BCE and 600 CE., flourished a cultural complex known as shaft tombs tradition characterized by underground architecture and offerings deposited inside the funeral chambers. Its origins are ancient and have been found in the neighboring States of Colima, Zacatecas, Jalisco and Michoacán.\n\nAround 500 to 600 CE.,the shaft tomb traditoion disappears and a new way of perceiving life starts from 750 to 900 CE. This cultural development is identified as the Aztatlán tradition and is known in the mid-Ixtlán period (750 to 1110) which represents the apogee of this city dedicated to the God of the wind; and late Ixtlán (1110 to 1525) identified by red smooth ceramics household items and cajetes and tripod molcajetes with white decor on Red.\n\nOne of the temples has a stone slab paved road, which leads to the round building of section A.\n\nCorresponds to the initial explorations of the site, composed of four structures; two of which are restored with rectangular shape with columns to the front, that limit spaces between the rooms, these two structures are part of the plaza with pyramidal foundation with central altar and other unexplored structures (mounds to the north and east of the plaza). The highlight of this complex is the circular pyramid, discovered in 1948 by Prof. Jose Corona Nuñez, it is the most important structure of the archaeological site that, from its design and finishing, constitutes one of the most beautiful works of the prehispanic architecture in western Mexico. \"The monument is of round base 24 meters in diameter and 4 meters high, originally was a cylinder with vertical walls (compact drum) crowned with a perforated parapet with small cruciform windows that give the construction the aspect of a large brazier, with five stairs harmonically distributed in its contour\"; in the superior part there are two rectangular altars, and it is known as a Quetzalcoatl or Ehécatl temple, due to its architectonic characteristics and elements.\n\nIt is composed by two plazas bordered by structures that correspond to buildings foundations and small pyramidal shape altars. Both plazas have nine monuments each, rectangular form, explored and restored; in center is a small foundation, similar to the ceremonial altar; dimensions and height varies and is in relation to the site topography and the plaza needs. The buildings stairways face the plaza, which has three closed spaces with one in front open and roof supporting pillars. Also there are remains of dirt floors, evidence of prehispanic occupation; constructive systems base in retaining walls with relief carved stone walls, with symbols religious and animal motifs.\n\nIt is the entrance to the archaeological zone; the south part has three explored and recovered structures that form part of a larger complex of plaza and buildings with a central altar. From the explored constructions one is outstanding, with two rectangular bodies and a single story whose stairways face towards the plaza. Also there are large columns that were used for support the roof of two large halls; the one to the east has a room and stairway integrated to the wall behind the structure.\n\nIs a two bodied pyramidal shape structure with stairways in all four sides; an \"alfarda\", ended on a dice shaped element in the top. Two bodied Pyramidal foundation. Is located in the center of Plaza C; its stairway faces west and is limited by two unexplored mounds, that are part of the plaza. The structure, just as other monuments, has stone retaining walls that were stucco covered.\n\nDuring prehispanic times, western cultures buried to their dead in shaft tombs, these are vertical wells 1.5 to 16 meters deep, where diverse sculptures were placed as offering for the deceased; these were of various types of polychrome ceramic figures; animal forms, anthropomorphous and small and medium size scale models, which measured from five to 80 centimeters.\n\nThe ceramic figures date back to the late Preclassical period (400 BCE to 200 CE) and to the Classical period (200 to 650 CE), these were discovered by archaeologists since 1945 until recent years in areas included in the Nayarit, Colima and Jalisco States, where this funeral activity was practiced.\n\nIn the case of the Ixtlán del Rio Archaeological Zone, the figures represent funeral processions, villages, people lying down or in beds, the flier and ballgame rituals, were modeled in reddish clay and decoration painted with black, red, orange, yellow and beige colors.\n\nAccording to art historian Lizeth Barreto Saucedo, these sculptures were modeled with reddish clay, dried and cooked in open fire.\n\nThe funeral processions scale models are square or round, the carved figures depict many people; musicians, moving towards a house, while carrying the dead person for burial; they carry food plates and practice the cheek perforation ritual practice.\n\nThe pieces representing the flier ritual, represents an individual dressed as a bird, on top of a pole on a flying simulation pose, can be leaning face down on the post or standing up looking upwards, houses are seen below and many people watching the ritual, some dance or play.\n\nSimilarly, there are ball game sculptures, similar to the Mesoamerican \"I\" shaped structure, the difference here is that there are houses in the ends of the representation, and some spectators.\n\nThe dancers and musicians figures not only appear in the processions scale models, there are also exclusive pieces of people groups in circular dances or playing instruments, such as drums, snails and flutes.\n\nThe largest sculptures (20 to 80 centimeters) are anthropomorphous figures decorated with facial painting and different types from clothes, some are standing up and other are seated. Women carry vessels or children, and men carry balls or instruments, some are soldiers with shields. Figures of both genders carry jewels, earflaps and cut shell collars. The facial painting is naturalist and streamlined.\n\nAlso sculptures with human figures representations are known with cheek perforations, in which three to four people are displayed (men and women) interconnected by an instrument that crosses their cheeks.\n\nThe individuals lying down or in beds are similar to those from Veracruz, emphasizing that are figures tied to a bed, which would seem to indicate that are women dead from childbirth or convalescent.\n\nFive types of scale models have been classified, representing houses, measuring approximately 18 centimeters high by 20 wide and are distinguished by its shed roof with the corners raised in triangles form.\n\nThe type 1 house lacks walls, only shows the roof and people inside. House type 2 has an ample room with walls. Type 3, the building half walls are leaned. Type 4, has two levels, with a room on each level and stairs. And type 5 is similar to Type 4, except that the house is full of people.\nAmong the scale models, there are also villages with a circular construction in the center, very similar to the pyramid of the Guachimontones Archaeological site in Jalisco, surrounded by houses as previously mentioned.\n\nShaft tombs are vertical wells, whose surface can be circular or square, and have a depth of between 1.5 and 16 meters, and a width of between 0.80 and one meter; there are two types: familiar burials underneath the rooms, or cemeteries.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53986408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53986408", "title": "Joint authorship", "text": "Joint authorship\n\nJoint authorship of a copyrightable work is when two or more persons contribute enough to the work to be the author of that work. In the case of joint authorship, the authors share the copyright in the work with each other.\n\nArticle 7bis of the Berne Convention states the term of protection for works of joint authorship and extends the general terms of protection provided under Article 7 to works of joint authorship, under the condition that the term of copyright protection must be measured from the death of the last surviving author. But the Berne Convention doesn’t define what works of joint authorship are, because various national legislations have a lot of variations while defining the same, and have a different approach to the topic.\n\nThis problem relating to joint authorship is not specifically dealt with by other international agreements as well, like the UCC, TRIPS, and the WIPO Copyright Treaty 1996.\n\nA joint work is defined in Section 101 of the U.S. Copyright Act as \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\". Section 201(a) gives the status of co-ownership in the copyrighted work to such authors of a joint work.\n\nUnder the US copyright law, a person has to prove the following two things for claiming joint authorship in a work:\n\nThe individual contributions made by authors to a joint work need not necessarily be equal in quality or quantity. Nevertheless, the author has to show that his contribution to the joint work is copyrightable by itself. A contribution of mere ideas is not sufficient. In order to be a joint author, one must contribute expression. For the expression to be copyrightable it has to be original – that is independently created and possess at least a minimal degree of creativity.\n\nHowever, in \"Gaiman v. McFarlane\", where the issue of joint authorship was on the creation of new characters for an existing comic series, the court held that there will be joint-authorship even though the author's contribution was not independently copyrightable. The reasoning given behind this was that if more than one person laboured to create a single copyrightable work, then it would be paradoxical if no one was able to claim copyright because the individual contributions were not themselves copyrightable. While in this case, recent decisions holding that individual contribution must be independently copyrightable were not explicitly overruled, they were distinguished on facts. It was also observed that the lower standard for joint authorship only applies to mixed media works.\n\nThe core of joint authorship is joint labouring by two or more persons in order to complete a pre-concerted common design. In the absence of a pre-concerted common design, the completed work will not be regarded as a joint work. However, it is not required of the several authors that they must necessarily work in physical propinquity or in concert. In \"Edward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Jerry Vogel Music Co\", the court held that while producing a musical composition jointly, two men will be coauthors and owners of the copyright even if they labour at different times, without consulting each other, and remain strangers to each other. It is a work of joint authorship if a person creates lyrics or music with the intention that his work shall be combined with the work of another person who shall create the music or write the lyrics, as the case may be, so as to make the composition complete.\n\nThe touchstone here is the intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit, although the parts themselves may be either \"inseparable\" (as the case of a novel or painting) or \"interdependent\" (as in the case of a motion picture, opera, or the words and music of a song). Hence, joint authors must have the intention of combining their respective works at the time of creating the work, and not at some later date.\n\nHowever, they are not required to have an express collaboration agreement creating a joint-author relationship.\n\nThere have also been situations wherein the parties shared a pre-concerted intent that their works be merged into one, and yet the court did not grant joint authorship. This was since all the participants in a work did not consider themselves or others to be joint authors.\n\nIn \"Childress v. Taylor\", actress Clarice Taylor asked playwright Alice Childress to write a play about legendary comedienne Jackie \"Moms\" Mabley. While writing, Childress accepted Taylor's assistance. Taylor mainly contributed ideas regarding the portrayal of characters in the play and also provided research on the life of \"Moms\" Mabley. On finalization of the draft, Childress rejected that it was owned equally by her and Taylor and registered the same in her name. Later, Taylor took a copy of the play and produced it at another theatre without Childress' permission. As a response to a suit for infringement by Childress, Taylor claimed that she was a joint author of the script and hence had equal rights in it. The Court while determining this issue, looked at whether the both the participants intended to combine their works into a unitary whole. Additionally, the court checked whether the parties \"intended to be joint authors\" in the work. The court held that Taylor was not a joint author of the script due to lack of contribution of sufficient expression. It observed that no evidence was shown to establish Taylor's role as anything more than giving advice and ideas.\n\nIn another case wherein both the participants had contributed expression, the court denied joint authorship status due to lack of requisite intent. \"Thomson v. Larson\" revolved around the claims to co-authorship of the musical \"Rent\" made by a dramaturge. In this particular case, Jonathan Larson, the author, had written the original play and was having it produced by the New York Theatre Workshop (\"NYTW\"). Lynn Thomson, who was a literature professor at New York University, was hired to help shape and form the plot. The NYTW and Thomson entered into an agreement the terms of which stated that Thomson was to be listed as 'dramaturge' for billing purposes as an independent contractor.\n\nHowever, not long after the dress rehearsal, Larson passed away and Thomson filled in her shoes and concluded the book to be used for the musical. At this stage, Thomson was yet to sign a waiver which would entail her handing over any copyright interest in the concluded work. Notwithstanding the fact that Thomson had a significant contribution in portions that could be copyrighted to the end result, the court held that \"Rent\" was not the product of joint work and as such Thomson could not claim the status of co-author. The argument furthered in this regard was that there was a lack of expression of an indication on behalf of Larson which would indicate that it was ever his intention for Thomson to be a joint author. Instead, his intention as expressed characterized her capacity as an editor of his original work. The court reiterated the precedent established by \"Childress\", rejecting Thompson's argument that the requirement of intention needs to be met with only in a situation where an author's contributions are minimal.\n\nThe court held that in order to be characterized as a joint author, an individual must show two things: first, that he or she produced independent copyright material within the context of the creative process and second, that both individual authors exhibited mutual intent to create the joint work. However, the court argued that, despite Thomson's significant contribution to the development of \"Rent,\" Thomson's claim was without a clear demonstration that Larson knowingly intended to share the playwright credit with her and hence Thomson would not qualify as a joint author.\n\nIn the case of a collective work, defined in Section 101, separate and independent works are assembled into a collection, and while the independent works may have a copyright protection, the nature of copyright protection of the collection is different from that of the independent works. The collective work exists as a distinct entity, other than the individual works that form the collection. Therefore, the key characteristics are assemblage or collection of \"separate and independent works into a collective whole\".\n\nUnlike a work of joint authorship, a collective work such as periodicals lacks the elements of unity and merger.\n\nThe definition of \"joint works\" has led to some concern that when a previously written work such as a play, novel or music is incorporated in a future work such as a motion picture, the authors of such previous works could claim to be the coauthors of the motion picture. It is usually true that a motion picture would be a joint work and not a collective work with respect to the authors actually working on the film, but the usual status of \"employees for hire\" given to them would not let the question of co-ownership come up. Although an author such as a songwriter or novelist may write a work hoping and expecting that his work will be used in a motion picture, it will still be a work of independent authorship because the author did not write the work with the intention of it being used in the motion picture. In such a case, the motion picture will be a derivative work, and Section 103 makes it amply clear that copyright in a derivative work is independent of, and does not affect the extent of any rights in any pre-existing works incorporated in the said derivative work.\n\nIn the case of joint authorship, each author is the owner of not only the part he or she created but of the whole work. Every author can freely use the work and license it out for others to use it. A co-owner of a work of joint authorship does not require other authors' permission to use the work himself, and the other authors can't object to such a use.\n\nIf the license has been granted by one of the joint authors unilaterally, then the license fee collected, if any, must be shared appropriately with other joint authors. In the absence of an agreement determining how the license fee is to be shared, every joint author must receive an equal share irrespective of the amount of their individual contribution to the joint work. A joint author can sign a written statement in compliance with Section 204(a) to alter his ownership shares he is initially vested with.\n\nA joint author may also sue any third party for copyright infringement without asking other co-owners to join the litigation.\n\nMoreover, a joint author does not require other joint authors' consent to transfer his exclusive proportional interest in the work. However, a joint author cannot transfer all interest in the work without obtaining authorization from other co-owners, since that would result in \"an involuntary transfer of the other joint owners' undivided interest in the whole\".\n\nThe interest of a joint author in a work of joint authorship is passed on to his heirs after his death, and not the other joint authors. Hence, in this regard, joint authorship in copyright law is similar to tenancy in common in property law and not a joint tenancy.\n\nIndian copyright law defines 'work of joint authorship' in Section 2(z) of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 as \"a work produced by the collaboration of two or more authors in which the contribution of one author is not distinct from the contribution of the other author or authors\". The term of copyright protection in case of joint authorship is calculated from the death of the last author, which is sixty years post the death of the last author.\n\nThe leading case of joint authorship in India is \"Najma Heptulla v. Orient Longman Ltd. and Ors\". In this case, the plaintiff is the legal heir of the author of the book \"India Wins Freedom\". The defendant is the publisher of said book. The defendant entered into an agreement with one Prof. Humayun Kabir to make contents of the book known to the public. The plaintiff obtained an injunction restraining defendants from breaking seals of covers of the complete book \"India Wins Freedom\" and from making its contents known to the public. According to the preface to the said book written by Kabir, Maulana Azad used to describe his experiences in Urdu, on the basis of which a draft in English would be prepared by Kabir. The court held that active and close intellectual collaboration and cooperation between Maulana Azad implied that Kabir is a joint author of the book with Maulana Azad. Hence, the defendants were allowed to break the seals of the covers of the complete book \"India Wins Freedom\" and make its contents known to the public.\n\n\n"}

The company is located in two former commercial buildings in the city's downtown area.\n\nKRT was formed as Horse Cave Theatre in 1976, and was a novelty for its time: a professional theater company located in a small rural town, producing a series of plays in a repertory cycle. The theater's proximity to the Mammoth Cave National Park tourist area was hoped to help attract theatergoers, and that has been proven to be the case over the years, though the theater enjoys substantial support from the town's residents as well, as well as those in neighboring Cave City, Glasgow, Munfordville and other surrounding cities.\n\nThe primary season for KRT was originally in the summer, when tourism business in the area is at its peak. In recent times, the company shifted its season to a period between autumn and Christmas, while continuing to present a single production in the summer to attract tourists. Over the years, KRT productions have run the gamut of theater, from George Bernard Shaw to Neil Simon, with one play by William Shakespeare being featured nearly every season. The company has also encouraged works by Kentucky playwrights, including at least one such work in its repertory nearly every season. Sallie Bingham, a descendant of the Bingham family of Louisville (former owners of \"The Courier-Journal\" and numerous other media properties), has had three of her plays produced by KRT.\n\nThe theater was housed in two renovated buildings, and seated 346 people in its main auditorium. An entrance building, built to resemble a tobacco barn typically found in southern Kentucky, was added at the opening. In 1998, the company purchased a residential building for office space, and a nearby warehouse for scenery and prop construction. The main theater buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nWarren Hammack was KRT's first artistic director, serving the company for 25 years until his retirement.\n\nHe was succeeded by director, Robert Brock. Mr. Brock was the Artistic Director of Kentucky Repertory Theatre from 2002-2011. In that time he produced 86 plays, 11 of them were new scripts premiering at the theatre. Under his directorship the theatre's Educational Outreach Programs tripled the number of students impacted (15,000 students in 22 counties annually). He created the very popular and successful Young Performers Program in 1999 and produced and directed 14 shows involving middle and high school students from the region. The Young Performers Program produced a number of young actors that went on to receive theatre scholarships to colleges and universities nationwide. 9 Young Performers were accepted into the Governor's School for the Arts. Mr. Brock also initiated a cooperative program with T J Samson Hospital and Barren County Drug Prevention to address health issues with young people in the region. The program was called Project HEAT (Health Education Awareness Theatre) and produced three plays that toured to schools. These plays offered an entertaining and imaginative approach to looking at Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco Abuse, Bullying and Hygiene. In 2008 Mr. Brock accepted the Governor's Arts Award on behalf of KRT. While Mr. Brock was Artistic Director, KRT received many accolades, among them being named ‘one of the Top Ten small regional theatres in the nation’ by USA Today. The Theatre's Educational Outreach Program was written up in the Cincinnati Enquirer, The Indianapolis Star, The Evansville Courier, and The Dallas Morning News. While Mr. Brock was Director, KRT was commissioned by the Kentucky Humanities Council and the Kentucky Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to produce two plays about Lincoln ( Abraham Lincoln and One Man's Lincoln) during the bicentennial years 2008-2009. Mr Brock performed with Annie Potts in 2 productions of Love Letters in 2002 and 2003 that played in Horse Cave, Elizabethtown and Bowling Green, and directed Sally Struthers in another production of Love Letters in 2010. He was succeeded by Christopher Carter Sanderson for one season. For the 2013 season, RepALLIANCE under the direction of Ken Neil Hailey took over the producing duties. In May 2013, the theatre was closed due to debt that had built up over a number of the later seasons. The theatre and its board suspended operations while the core directors and actors who produced the successful final season moved on and formed a new company, Kentucky Stage(s), in residence at Bowling Green's new SKyPAC (Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center during the 2013-14 season. Kentucky Stage(s) observed the process after closure and has retained a contract to reacquire and restore the theatre, re-re-branding the facility again as THE HORSE CAVE THEATRE. Plans to reopen the theatre by the summer of 2015 were unsuccessful.\n\n"}

In the 62nd National Award Ceremony, the film received two awards namely ‘Special Jury Mention’ and ‘Sync Sound’. This film has also won 5 state awards for Best Debut Film Production, Best Rural Film, Best Costume Design, Best Rural Director and Best Make-Up. In 2015’s edition of Pune International Film Festival, Karhade won the award as Best Director. The film also won Best Film, Best Director, Best Debutant Actor, and Best Actor in a Negative Role at Prabhat Film Awards. \nThe film was released theatrically on Dussehra festival day (22 October 2015).\n\nFighting a legal battle for over 10 years in the hope of getting back his land from the forest department, the film narrates the story of Raghu Karhe who, along with his wife, two sons - Panda and Balu, his daughter-in-law and grandson, all wander while shepherding sheep from one village to another.\n\nBalu, a budding wrestler and a daydreamer, foreseeing prosperity and good future in agriculture hopes to find his family a permanent settlement instead of day-to-day wandering.\n\nFate brings them to a village headed by the rowdy, Ashokrao, who along with his fellow wrestlers terrorizes all the adjoining villages and very often creates trouble by picking up the sheep of poor shepherds. Balu and his family bear everything silently.\n\nIn one of the wrestling competitions, Balu defeats Ashokrao's academy's wrestlers, which leads to animosity between him and Balu. Ashokrao compels Balu to a wrestle with his ace wrestler. Feeling the pain of Ashokrao's separatist remarks, Balu applies his full strength and breaks the wrestler's spine and runs away. This further hurts Ashokrao's ego who vows to finish him. Balu's angst for finding resolution culminates in a heart-wrenching climax of the film.\n\nThrough its protagonist, the film talks about the entire shepherd community and how their lives are unstable, full of challenges and how at times, they have to pay a heavy price for survival with dignity.\n\n\nExecutive Producer Mangesh Bhimraj Jondhale & Bhaurao Karhade unable to find producers sells his land for the funding of the film.

The cartoons are drawn by famous cartoonist Uday Mohite. The cartoons have become instantly viral on social media platforms. Uday Mohite has earlier done some publicity cartoons for films like \"Balak Palak\" and \"Timepass 2\"\n\nOfficial Selections:\nFilm received extremely positive reviews from critics. ABP Majha gave 4 out of 5 stars and declared movie 'Survival of the fittest'. The \"Pune Mirror\" gave it 4 out of 5 stars and said \"For films like this climax always prove to be tricky.

It is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements, and K-pop singles will typically include a music video and a dance routine. There is a history of media censorship and conservatism in South Korea, and as a result, many risque or explicit K-pop songs or videos have been banned by South Korean broadcasting stations. Other reasons for banning include having Japanese lyrics, negatively influencing youth, or use of brand names.\n\nKBS, MBC, and SBS are the three largest broadcasting and television networks, and they account for the vast majority of banned K-pop videos. In September 2012, it was revealed that these networks had banned over 1,300 K-pop songs in the past three years alone. This list only includes titular k-pop songs that have an accompanying music video, but many K-pop songs that were not title tracks have been banned as well.\n\nOften, the entertainment company that owns the banned song will try to revise the song and have its reevaluated by the broadcasting company. They may edit the music video and delete the controversial scenes and re-release the new video. Other times, they may alter the explicit dance moves or change a song's lyrics so that the song may still be performed on music shows, such as Music Bank. In the case of EXO's \"Lotto,\" which as banned due to the title being a brand name, the group sang the word \"louder\" instead of \"lotto\" while performing the song live. This revision allowed the song to be performed on KBS and MBC music shows.\n\nAlthough K-pop songs and videos are often banned by KBS, is it less often for MBC or SBS to place a ban. Some groups are content to promote themselves on networks other than KBS and do not make any changes to their original material. In regards to PSY's \"Gentlemen,\" a spokesperson for YG Entertainment said they had no plans to submit a difference version of their video, and they followed the decision made by KBS.\n\nWhen 12 out of 18 songs of Cheetah's album were deemed unfit for broadcast by KBS and five by SBS, the agency stated that they did not plan on making any changes to the lyrics in order to \"keep the original intentions and meanings of the song.\"\n\nOf all the broadcasting networks, KBS has banned the most songs and videos, earning it the nickname \"Korean Banning System.\" When a more explicit video is released, fans have come to expect the video to be deemed inappropriate for broadcast by KBS.\n\nThere have been cases of fans arguing against a banning decision. When KBS deemed several of Block B's new songs as being unfit for broadcast, an online petition appeared, requesting that KBS reconsider their decision. It gained 2,400 signatures within a day.\n\n"}

Malibu Potteries was founded by May Knight Rindge in 1926. A fire devastated the company 30 September 1931, and the company closed in 1932. Tile designs included influences the styles of Moorish, Egyptian, Mayan and Saracen cultures. Many of the tile designs were geometric. The company was known for their tile murals consisting of tiles with peacocks and other birds. The company also produced decorated tiles for floors in the style of a laid-out Persian rug. May Rindge's daughter's house, the Adamson House has many examples of the tile produced by Malibu Potteries.\n\nFounded in 1926 by May Knight Rindge, Malibu Potteries was formed under the corporate name Marblehead Land Company. Rindge after unsuccessfully prospecting for oil on her property near Zuma Beach, instead found red and buff clays suitable for the production of pottery. In Malibu, California alongside the ocean coast, a factory was built to produce ceramic tile.\n\nRindge hired Rufus Keeler. Keeler was formerly a ceramic engineer for California Clay Products Company (Calco). Rindge and Keeler hired William Handley, a former product designer for Calco. At the height of the companies production, 125 employees produced over 30,000 square feet of tile a month.\n\nThe company specialized in the production of ceramic tile. The styles were influenced by Moorish, Egyptian, Mayan and Saracen cultures. Tile designs were mostly geometric. Tile murals were made with peacocks, ships, and birds. The company also produced fountains. Tiles were produced for the architectural, builder and design trades for use indoors and outdoors on floors, walls, fireplaces, step treads, tables, benches, and fountains.\n\nAfter the stock market crash of 1929, the pottery closed for a short period of time and reopened. A devastating fire destroyed the factory on 30 September 1931. The unsold stock of tile was moved to Rindge's unfinished home near the former factory. In 1942, Rindge died and her home was sold to the Franciscan Friars. The Friars named Rindge's former home Serra Retreat. Serra Retreat was damaged in the September 1970 Malibu Canyon wild fire and was rebuilt using many of the original tiles. The wild fire had exposed a massive amount of Malibu Potteries tile stored on the property. The supply of vintage tile was unknown except to the heirs of Rindge. The vast majority of the tiles were unscathed by the fire. The excess tiles not used in the restoration of Serra Retreat were eventually sold with many being placed in private collections.\n\n\nRobert (Bob) Harris, a sound technician in the movie industry purchased a large collection of Malibu Potteries tile. In 1979, Harris and ceramist Jim Sullivan founded Malibu Ceramic Works and began producing tile in the style and manner of Malibu Potteries.\n"}

In 1952 it became the Ministry of Culture with the Department of Fine Arts as a subordinate agency.

The NCPO wanted a new history book covering the past 400 years to foster \"national reconciliation\". The book was written in two months. On page 195, the text reads, \"Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha as Prime Minister has carried out a policy of reforming the country, reforming politics to be truly a democracy, eliminating corruption and using moral principles to lead the country to be truly a democracy.\" On page 197 it goes on to say, \"After the coup d'etat, Gen Prayut became prime minister.

Pictographs are often used in writing and graphic systems in which the characters are to a considerable extent pictorial in appearance. A pictogram may also be used in subjects such as leisure, tourism, and geography.\n\nPictography is a form of writing which uses representational, pictorial drawings, similarly to cuneiform and, to some extent, hieroglyphic writing, which also uses drawings as phonetic letters or determinative rhymes. Some pictograms, such as Hazards pictograms, are elements of formal languages.\n\nPictograph has a rather different meaning in the field of prehistoric art, including recent art by traditional societies and then means art painted on rock surfaces, as opposed to petroglyphs; the latter are carved or incised. Such images may or may not be considered pictograms in the general sense.\n\nEarly written symbols were based on pictographs (pictures which resemble what they signify) and ideograms (symbols which represent ideas). Ancient Sumerian, Egyptian, and Chinese civilizations began to adapt such symbols to represent concepts, developing them into logographic writing systems. Pictographs are still in use as the main medium of written communication in some non-literate cultures in Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. Pictographs are often used as simple, pictorial, representational symbols by most contemporary cultures.\n\nPictographs can be considered an art form, or can be considered a written language and are designated as such in Pre-Columbian art, Native American art, Ancient Mesopotamia and Painting in the Americas before Colonization. One example of many is the Rock art of the Chumash people, part of the .\nIn 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage List added \"Petroglyph Complexes of the Mongolian Altai, Mongolia\" to celebrate the importance of the pictograms engraved in rocks.\n\nSome scientists in the field of neuropsychiatry and neuropsychology, such as Prof. Dr. Mario Christian Meyer, are studying the symbolic meaning of indigenous pictograms and petroglyphs, aiming to create new ways of communication between native people and modern scientists to safeguard and valorize their cultural diversity.\n\nAn early modern example of the extensive use of pictographs may be seen in the map in the London suburban timetables of the London and North Eastern Railway, 1936-1947, designed by George Dow, in which a variety of pictographs was used to indicate facilities available at or near each station. Pictographs remain in common use today, serving as pictorial, representational signs, instructions, or statistical diagrams. Because of their graphical nature and fairly realistic style, they are widely used to indicate public toilets, or places such as airports and train stations. Because they are a concise way to communicate a concept to people who speak many different languages, pictograms are also used extensively at the Olympics, and are redesigned for each set of games.\n\nPictographic writing as a modernist poetic technique is credited to Ezra Pound, though French surrealists accurately credit the Pacific Northwest American Indians of Alaska who introduced writing, via totem poles, to North America.\n\nContemporary artist Xu Bing created Book from the Ground, a universal language made up of pictograms collected from around the world. A Book from the Ground chat program has been exhibited in museums and galleries internationally.\n\nPictograms are used in many areas of modern life for commodity purposes, often as a formal language (see the In mathematics section).\n\nIn statistics, pictograms are charts in which icons represent numbers to make it more interesting and easier to understand. A key is often included to indicate what each icon represents. All icons must be of the same size, but a fraction of an icon can be used to show the respective fraction of that amount.\n\nFor example, the following table:\n\ncan be graphed as follows:\n\nKey: = 10 letters\n\nAs the values are rounded to the nearest 5 letters, the second icon on Tuesday is the left half of the original.\n\nPictographs can often transcend languages in that they can communicate to speakers of a number of tongues and language families equally effectively, even if the languages and cultures are completely different. This is why road signs and similar pictographic material are often applied as global standards expected to be understood by nearly all.\n\nA standard set of pictographs was defined in the international standard \"ISO 7001: Public Information Symbols\". Other common sets of pictographs are the laundry symbols used on clothing tags and the chemical hazard symbols as standardized by the GHS system.\n\nPictograms have been popularized in use on the web and in software, better known as \"icons\" displayed on a computer screen in order to help user navigate a computer system or mobile device.\n\n"}
{"id": "397064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397064", "title": "Poetics (Aristotle)", "text": "Poetics (Aristotle)\n\nAristotle's Poetics (; ; c. 335 BC) is the earliest surviving work of dramatic theory and first extant philosophical treatise to focus on literary theory in the West. This has been the traditional view for centuries. However, recent work is now challenging whether Aristotle focuses on literary theory per se (given that not one poem exists in the treatise) or whether he focuses instead on dramatic musical theory that only has language as one of the elements.\n\nIn it, Aristotle offers an account of what he calls \"poetry\" (a term which in Greek literally means \"making\" and in this context includes verse drama – comedy, tragedy, and the satyr play – as well as lyric poetry and epic poetry). They are similar in the fact that they are all imitations but different in the three ways that Aristotle describes:\n\nIn examining its \"first principles\", Aristotle finds two: 1) imitation and 2) genres and other concepts by which that of truth is applied/revealed in the poesis. His analysis of tragedy constitutes the core of the discussion. Although Aristotle's \"Poetics\" is universally acknowledged in the Western critical tradition, \"almost every detail about his seminal work has aroused divergent opinions\".\n\nThe work was lost to the Western world for a long time. It was available in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance only through a Latin translation of an Arabic version written by Averroes.\n\nAristotle's work on aesthetics consists of the \"Poetics,\" \"Politics\" (Bk VIII) and \"Rhetoric\". The \"Poetics\" is specifically concerned with drama. At some point, Aristotle's original work was divided in two, each \"book\" written on a separate roll of papyrus. Only the first part – that which focuses on tragedy and epic (as a quasi-dramatic art, given its definition in Ch 23) – survives. The lost second part addressed comedy. Some scholars speculate that the \"Tractatus coislinianus\" summarises the contents of the lost second book. Some other scholars indicate that \"tragedy\" is a very misleading translation for the Greek tragoidos, which seems to have meant \"goat-song\" originally. The reason is that Aristotle says three times in the treatise that the protagonist can go from fortune to misfortune or misfortune to fortune; also in Chapter 14 the best type of tragoidos is that which ends happily, like Cresphontes and Iphigenia (presumably \"in Tauris\")!\n\nThe table of contents page of the \"Poetics\" found in Modern Library's \"Basic Works of Aristotle\" (2001) identifies five basic parts within it.\n\n\nAristotle distinguishes between the genres of \"poetry\" in three ways:\n\nHaving examined briefly the field of \"poetry\" in general, Aristotle proceeds to his definition of tragedy:\nTragedy is a representation of a serious, complete action which has magnitude, in embellished speech, with each of its elements [used] separately in the [various] parts [of the play] and [represented] by people acting and not by narration, accomplishing by means of pity and terror the catharsis of such emotions.\n\nBy \"embellished speech\", I mean that which has rhythm and melody, i.e. song. By \"with its elements separately\", I mean that some [parts of it] are accomplished only by means of spoken verses, and others again by means of song (1449b25-30).\n\nHe then identifies the \"parts\" of tragedy:\n\n\n\nHe offers the earliest-surviving explanation for the origins of tragedy and comedy:\nAnyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities) [...] (1449a10-13)\n\nThe Arabic version of Aristotle's \"Poetics\" that influenced the Middle Ages was translated from a Greek manuscript dated to some time prior to the year 700. This manuscript, translated from Greek to Syriac, is independent of the currently-accepted 11th-century source designated \"Paris 1741.\" The Syriac-language source used for the Arabic translations departed widely in vocabulary from the original \"Poetics\" and it initiated a misinterpretation of Aristotelian thought that continued through the Middle Ages. \"Paris 1741\" appears online at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (National Library of France).\n\nArabic scholars who published significant commentaries on Aristotle's \"Poetics\" included Avicenna, Al-Farabi and Averroes. Many of these interpretations sought to use Aristotelian theory to impose morality on the Arabic poetic tradition. In particular, Averroes added a moral dimension to the \"Poetics\" by interpreting tragedy as the art of praise and comedy as the art of blame.\nAverroes' interpretation of the \"Poetics\" was accepted by the West, where it reflected the \"prevailing notions of poetry\" into the 16th century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work involved Abramović standing still while the audience was invited to do to her whatever they wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, and a gun loaded with one bullet.\n\nThere were no separate stages. Abramović and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work. The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: \"What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?\"\n\nHer instructions were placed on the table: \nInstructions.\nThere are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.\nPerformance.\nI am the object.\nDuring this period I take full responsibility.\nDuration: 6 hours (8 pm – 2 am).\n\nAbramović said the work \"pushed her body to the limits.\" Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss. Art critic Thomas McEvilley, who was present, wrote:\n\nIt began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed so someone could suck her blood. Various minor sexual assaults were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the audience factions.\"\n\nAs Abramović described it later: “What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.” ... “I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.”\n\nWhen the gallery announced the work was over, and Abramović began to move again, she said the audience left, unable to face her as a person.\n\n\"Rhythm 0\" ranked ninth on a \"Complex\" list of the greatest works of performance art ever done.\n\nMarina Abramovic on performing \"Rhythm 0\" (1974)\n\n"}

It supports a choir, youth choir, youth training choir, children's choir and a youth orchestra, and releases its recordings on its own record label, though it has occasionally released recordings on Angel Records and EMI. Since 1996 the orchestra has been resident at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.\n\nIn May 1857 the pianist and conductor Charles Hallé set up an orchestra to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, which it did until October. Hallé decided to continue working with the orchestra as a formal organisation, and it gave its first concert under those auspices on 30 January 1858. The orchestra's first home was the Free Trade Hall. By 1861 the orchestra was in financial trouble, and it performed only two concerts that year.\n\nHans Richter served as music director from 1899 to 1911. During his tenure, the orchestra gave the first performance of the Symphony No. 1 of Sir Edward Elgar.\n\nIn 1943 the orchestra was again in crisis, having diminished in size to 30 players. Over the next 27 years, from 1943 to 1970, the orchestra's next music director, Sir John Barbirolli, restored the Hallé to national prominence. Together, they made many recordings, including the first recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams' \"Symphony No. 8\", of which they also gave the first performance. During Barbirolli's tenure, one of the most notable orchestra members was concertmaster Martin Milner, who served in that capacity from 1958 to 1987. Barbirolli regarded Milner as his \"right-hand man\" and once wrote in appreciation to him: \"You are the finest leader I have ever had in my fairly long career.\"\n\nKent Nagano was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999. The orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996, as its primary concert venue. During his tenure, Nagano received criticism for his expensive and ambitious programming, as well as his conducting fees. However, poor financial management at the orchestra separately contributed to the fiscal troubles of the orchestra. The orchestra faced major financial problems during the late 1990s, including a £1.3 million deficit in 1998, to the point where the existence of the orchestra was threatened with loss of funding from the Arts Council and ultimately bankruptcy.\nDuring 1997 there was an eight-month period when the orchestra had no executive director. Leslie Robinson served for two years as chief executive after that period, starting changes to the orchestra to start to bring under control the orchestra's financial troubles. These included public fund-raising, which netted £2 million, cutting the number of people on the orchestra board in half, and reducing the number of musicians in the orchestra from 98 to 80. \n\nSince 1999, the orchestra's chief executive has been John Summers, who continued Robinson's fiscal practices to restore greater financial security to the orchestra. In 2001, the Arts Council awarded the orchestra a £3.8 million grant to allow it to pay off accumulated debts and increase musician salaries, which had been frozen for 4 years.\n\nIn September 2000 Sir Mark Elder took up the position of music director, having been appointed to the post in 1999. His concerts with the orchestra have received consistently positive reviews, and he is generally regarded as having restored the orchestra to high critical and musical standards. In 2004 Elder signed a contract to extend his tenure through 2010, and in May 2009 the Hallé announced a further extension to 2015. In November 2013, the Hallé announced the further extension of Elder's contract through \"at least 2020\".\n\nOne of the orchestra's recent ideas was to try to find alternative stage dress to the traditional \"penguin suits\", but this idea did not come to fruition. The orchestra has also begun to issue new CD recordings under its own label. In 2017, the orchestra began a series of recordings in collaboration with the film composer, Benson Taylor.\n\nIn March 2006 the orchestra was forced to cancel a planned tour of the United States because of the cost and administrative difficulties in obtaining visas for the musicians, a result of the tougher visa regulations intended to combat potential terrorist attacks.\n\nThe orchestra appointed its first-ever principal guest conductor, Cristian Mandeal, in 2006. He served in this post until 2009. In February 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of Markus Stenz as its second and next principal guest conductor, starting in 2009. Past assistant conductors have included Edward Gardner, Rory Macdonald, Andrew Gourlay, and Ewa Strusińska (2008–2010), the first female conductor named to a UK assistant conductorship. In September 2016, Jonathon Heyward became the Hallé's new assistant conductor, whose duties include musical direction of the Hallé Youth Orchestra. The current leader of the Hallé is Lyn Fletcher. The orchestra's current head of artistic planning is Geoffrey Owen.\n\nThe Hallé Choir was founded with the orchestra in 1858 by Sir Charles Hallé. The choir gives around twenty concerts a year with the Hallé at The Bridgewater Hall and other venues across the UK. Appearing with international conductors and soloists in concert and recordings, the choir performs a repertoire of major choral and operatic works ranging from mainstream pieces to more esoteric pieces and commissions. James Burton was choral director from April 2002 to July 2009. Other guest choral directors have included Tom Seligman, David Lawrence, Frances Cooke, Ralph Allwood and Justin Doyle.\n\nThe choir's activities include individual vocal coaching, sectional and full choir rehearsals as well as social events. Margaret McDonald is the choir's vocal coach.\n\nThe Hallé Choir has received critical acclaim for performances with Elder, including a Verdi centenary programme at the BBC Proms and performances of Haydn's \"The Creation\", J.S. Bach's \"St John Passion\" and Janáček's \"Glagolitic Mass\". The Hallé's CD label features the choir on its releases, \"English Rhapsody\", \"Hallé Christmas Classics\" and \"Elgar: A Self-Portrait\". The choir was also featured in The Hallé's 2008 recording of Elgar's \"The Dream of Gerontius\" with Bryn Terfel, Alice Coote, Paul Groves, Hallé Choir and the Hallé Youth Choir, which won a Gramophone Award in 2009. A second Gramophone Award was awarded in 2010 for the Hallé's live recording of 'Götterdämmerung'. In 2011, and for the third consecutive year a Gramophone Award was awarded for the live recording of Edward Elgar's 'The Kingdom' for which Tom Seligman was the guest Choral Director.\nRecent Hallé Choir Directors have included James Burton,Frances Cooke and Madeleine Venner. The current Hallé Choir Director is Matthew Hamilton.\n\nThe Hallé Youth Orchestra was founded in 2002, with Edward Gardner as their first conductor. The HYO regularly work with members of the Hallé Orchestra through workshops, and each summer undertake a tour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7454353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7454353", "title": "Tikka to Ride", "text": "Tikka to Ride\n\n\"Tikka To Ride\" is the first episode of science fiction sitcom \"Red Dwarf\" Series VII and the 37th in the series run. It was first broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 17 January 1997. Written by Doug Naylor and directed by Ed Bye, it was the first episode not to involve co-creator and writer Rob Grant.\n\nSeries VII was the first series to have extended episodes.\n\nLister makes a video explaining how the crew survived their battle with their future selves. If the future crew had killed their former selves, they would have eliminated their own existence, and therefore not have been able to destroy themselves. (See temporal paradox.) Therefore, time has reset to a point before the crew picked up time drive. Lister's explanation is too convoluted for the video camera to handle and it explodes. Kryten dismisses the whole incident as \"garbled\" and more \"boring than an in-flight magazine produced by Air Belgium.\"\n\nUnfortunately disaster has struck - \"Starbug\" is still damaged from the battle and as a consequence all the Indian food supplies have been destroyed; not even a single papadum survived. Lister proposes that the crew obtain the time drive again and go back in time to an Indian take-away and order 500 curries (even though Out of Time established that travel to other places (such as Earth) would also require a star drive). Rimmer, Cat and Kryten are against the idea and oppose going back in time, having seen the kind of people they could possibly become. Lister argues that they can use a time drive and avoid that consequence if they don't abuse it like their future selves did; however he finds himself outnumbered and seemingly concedes defeat. However, Lister swaps Kryten's head for one of his spare heads and removes the guilt chip from it, having the now guiltless Kryten reassure the crew that it will be okay. The next morning, Rimmer and Cat are confused when Kryten serves them high-calorie breakfasts, starts smoking and using phrases like \"you bet your ass\". However, when Kryten assures them it'll be ok to pick up the time drive the two assent and board the ship containing it, intending to go back to the 21st Century to one of Lister's favourite curry houses to pick up a large order.\n\nTheir time travel calculations are a little off and they find themselves in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. They appear at the Texas School Book Depository just as Lee Harvey Oswald is firing at U.S. President John F. Kennedy. They inadvertently knock him out the window to his death below, thereby preventing Kennedy's assassination. The crew use the time travel device, to go three years forward to 1966.\n\nThe crew find Dallas deserted. Wandering the streets, they find a man who has been trampled to death, indicating people left in a hurry. Reading a nearby newspaper, Kryten finds out what has happened:\n\nThe crew attempt to correct the situation by returning to the day of the shooting and driving Oswald to a higher floor in the building, but this plan still fails to lead to Kennedy's death; by sending Oswald up another floor, they made the shot's trajectory so steep that Kennedy was merely wounded. Lister suggests getting a second gunman to shoot from behind a nearby grassy knoll. With none of the crew willing to shoot the President themselves, Lister travels to Idlewild Airport in 1965 and persuades a post-impeachment Kennedy to travel back to 1963, become a \"second gunman\" on the grassy knoll, and shoot himself to restore his place in history. The plan works: Kennedy shoots his past self and the timeline is restored. Kennedy grimly thanks the gang for the chance to restore himself to his proper place in history, and fades away as a result of the resetting timeline. Lister, too late, realises he forgot to ask Kennedy for the name of a good Indian take-away. Having seen that Lister has learned absolutely nothing from the experience, the other members of the crew give him a well-deserved beating in return for all he's put them through.\n\nShown as an option on the Series 7 DVD, the Extended Edition of \"Tikka To Ride\" continues after Cat, Rimmer and Kryten take out their frustrations on Lister. After managing to correctly use the time drive and steal the Indian food supplies from Starbug before the events of the episode began (thus showing an example of a predestination paradox and allowing Lister to re-stock on curry, papadums and lager), the crew end up storing the food in one of Starbug's cargo holds (ostensibly the same cargo hold it was stolen from in the first place - B-deck). Rimmer leaves with Kryten in tow but remarks as he does \"I must've passed this thing a million times. What the hell's it for?\" in regards to a lever by the door. It doesn't take long for Lister to give into the curiosity planted by Rimmer and pull the lever. The lever, in fact, activates the separation sequence for Starbug, jettisoning the rear section of the ship into space while allowing the front half to fly away; an ace Rimmer had \"had up his sleeve for months\". Lister notes that he's stranded alone in deep space with nothing but three-and-a-half tons of curry, and couldn't be happier before eagerly digging into the crates.\n\nEven though the previous series had ended on a cliffhanger, fans had been forced to wait three years for the resolution. This was due to a number of factors, which included Craig Charles being imprisoned before being cleared of a charge of rape, Chris Barrie making no secret of his desire to leave the show, and most notably Rob Grant deciding to leave the series, ending his and Doug Naylor's long-standing writing partnership. Naylor was left with the choice of either ending or continuing the series. Although tempted to end it, he later agreed to write two more eight-episode series of the show, as this would allow the episode count to reach 52 and therefore be eligible for syndication.\n\n\"Tikka To Ride\" ushered in new production values. The cinematic quality and filming of the new episodes meant that the studio audience was no longer viable (however the show was shown to an audience at a later date and their laughter was added). Also the special effects were increasing every series and the majority of the episodes were pre-recorded. One of Naylor's desires for a seventh series was the prospect of international syndication and a movie. This vision was helped with the return of Ed Bye to the director's chair, having previously left due to a scheduling clash with directing his wife Ruby Wax's new TV show at the time. He agreed to return to helm the seventh series, his first Red Dwarf episode since Series IV's \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe arrival of the seventh series was also promoted by the show making its first appearance of the front cover of the Radio Times.\n\nGuest stars included Michael J. Shannon who played John F. Kennedy, Toby Aspin as Lee Harvey Oswald, Peter Gaitens as FBI Agent and Robert Ashe as Cop.\n\nThe deserted Dallas scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airport. The expanded Starbug cargo deck scenes were filmed inside the former Royal Aircraft Establishment wind tunnels at Farnborough. The motorcade scenes were filmed at the Chobham test track, with additional crowd shots filmed around buildings at Shepperton Studios.\n\nThe title of this episode is a piece of word-play based on the name of the song \"Ticket to Ride\" by the Beatles, in accordance with the theme of curry on which the storyline focuses, tikka being an Indian spice marinade.\n\nWhen on the Grassy Knoll, Lister, Rimmer and Cat are dressed up as tramps, an outfit which the normally vain and shallow Cat would not be seen dead in: \"Superficial is my middle name\". This was based on the Three tramps, men that are reported to have been found in a boxcar behind the Grassy Knoll when the police searched it after the shooting, but were later released. Conspiracy theorists have assumed that they were part of the assassination plot.\n\nThe concept of the crew travelling backwards in time and accidentally saving someone's life, leading to a change for the worse in history, was also used in the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". In each case the person saved was actually an advocate of peace; however, there were few other similarities between the episodes.\n\nIn the commentary for the Series III episode \"Timeslides\" when talking about Kryten's shouting \"Duck!\" at the Grassy Knoll line, they note how their characters actually did something similar later on.\n\nAt the start of the episode, Lister explains that the crew survived the previous cliffhanger because of a temporal paradox, which made it impossible for them to be killed by their future selves. However, later in the same episode, Kennedy is able to kill his younger self without creating the same paradox. There is no explanation of why there is one rule for the crew of Starbug and another for Kennedy. Similarly, it is explained that by preventing the initial assassination, Russia wins the space race (this is why Starbug disappears). This means the JMC never exists and the time drive would never have been found in the first place.\n\nIn the previous episode it was made clear that the time drive was only a \"time\" drive and not a space and time drive, so the crew could travel forward or backward in time but were still stuck in deep space. It was not explained in the episode how the time drive can suddenly transport them through space, or why, given that they could travel to 1963 Earth, they did not simply travel back to 22nd Century Earth as per their original plan.\n\nOn the Red Dwarf VII DVD documentary \"Back from the Dead\", director Ed Bye recalled explaining to a fan that the time drive was made up, and was just a lump of plastic.\n\n\"Tikka to Ride\" has generally been well received by critics. DVDActive called it \"a promising start to the series\" and noted that it was \"beautifully shot, with a movie-style score\". DVD Verdict stated \"what other sitcom, sci-fi or otherwise, would take on the Kennedy Assassination and an alternative future for the United States had the beloved President not been felled by a rain of bullets?\" and concluded that the episode \"was majestic\". Sci-Fi Online noted that \"\"Tikka to Ride\" morphs into a surprisingly serious time paradox\" but felt that the final plot twist was \"a largely pointless contrivance.\" BellaOnline called the episode \"pure silliness, and I mean of the kind that makes \"Red Dwarf\" great.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "9120144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9120144", "title": "Understanding Poetry", "text": "Understanding Poetry\n\nUnderstanding Poetry was an American college textbook and poetry anthology by Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, first published in 1938. The book influenced New Criticism and went through its fourth edition in 1976.\n\nThe textbook \"widely influenced ... the study of poetry at the college level in America.\" The Intercollegiate Studies Institute has named the book one of the \"Fifty best books of the century.\"\n\n\"Understanding Poetry\", according to an article at the \"Modern American Poetry\" Web site, \"codified many of the so-called New Critical ideas into a coherent approach to literary study. Their book, and its companion volume, Understanding Fiction (1943), revolutionized the teaching of literature in the universities and spawned a host of imitators who dominated English departments well into the 1960s.\"\n\nEven those who are highly critical of the textbook's approach to poetry have acknowledged the reach and influence of the volume. Poet Ron Silliman has called it \"the hegemonic poetry textbook of the period.\"\n\nAccording to Warren's obituary in \"The New York Times\": \"\"Understanding Poetry\" and \"Understanding Fiction\", which he wrote with Mr. Brooks, taught an entire generation how to read a work of literature and helped make the New Criticism dominant in the decade surrounding World War II. It was an approach to criticism that regarded the work at hand as autonomous, as an artifact whose structure and substance could be analyzed without respect to social, biographical and political details.\"\n\nWriting in \"The Virginia Quarterly Review\", Harold B. Sween said: \"Among the rank and file of university faculty in the English-speaking world, few works of this century have gained the influence of two of his [Brooks'] textbooks written in collaboration with Warren, Understanding Poetry (1938) and Understanding Fiction (1943). They revolutionized the teaching of literature in thousands of classrooms for 25 years. . .Brooks and Warren gained universal recognition for changing the focus of reading poetry (and fiction).\" \n\nThese contents refer to the third edition (1960), which may differ in some respects, particularly in poems used as examples, from other editions.\n\n— from the Preface\n\nPoetry is inherently \"dramatic,\" the authors say, defining dramatic as something concrete which involves a process and a conflict in an effort to find meaning. There are other ways to think of poetry other than as knowledge, the authors concede, but that is \"the assumption behind this book.\"\n\nPoems should not be thought of as carrying messages or statements that can be translated more concisely or exactly in prose. Instead, the reader must \"surrender to\" the impact of the poem as a whole, which includes comprehending the form of the poem. In fact, the kind of knowledge that poetry gives readers can be comprehended \"only through form.\" Readers should carefully observe the human events, images, rhythms, and statements of the poem.\n\nContext is also important. The form of a poem is a person's attempt to deal with a certain problem, \"poetic and personal.\" Poems are written within a historical and cultural context, and the reader also has a context and needs to understand the \"dramatic implications of the form.\"\n\nFor the third edition, the authors add in the preface (in a section dated January 24, 1960) that the introductions to the several sections have been expanded, some discussions from the previous edition have been dropped and others added. The exercises have been changed and expanded; selections of poems have been changed to better represent some periods; two appendices have been dropped (\"Ambiguity, Added Dimension, and Submerged Metaphor\" and \"the Poem Viewed in Wider Perspective\"), with much of their material put into the exercises and discussions; \"How Poems Come About: Intention and Meaning\" has been revised, with new material added; Section VII, \"Poems for Study\" has turned into an anthology, although not a systematic survey, of modern poetry.\n\nPeople communicate not just to convey information for businesslike practical reasons, they also convey feelings and attitudes. Telling a joke, passing the time in conversation and greeting old friends are some examples, and poetry is another. Some propositions — including many involving values, emotions, feelings, attitudes and judgments — can't be conveyed through communicating practical information or with scientific precision. Like science, literature (and especially poetry) uses a specialized language for the purposes of precision in matters different from science.\n\nIn ordinary life, people must deal with forms of communication that use some of the methods of poetry, including editorials, sermons, political speeches, advertisements and magazine articles. Yet when approaching poems, many people confuse practical or \"scientific\" kinds of communication with poetic communication, sometimes as a way of justifying their interest in poetry, and so fall into certain mistakes.\n\nOne mistake is \"message-hunting\" — looking only for a profitable statement or idea in a poem. A short prose statement can work better than a poem for communicating advice. Something else is at work in poetry.\n\nAnother mistake is thinking that poetry deals only with emotion or sensation, or even thinking that poetry can express an emotion such as grief the way tears would express it, or bring up the emotion in the reader. But poetry can never do that as well as real experience, the authors say, and a poem, such as Keats' \"Ode to a Nightingale\", used as an example here, may really convey the poet's interpretation of an experience.\n\nA third common mistake is an attempt to mechanically combine the first two, defining poetry as the \"beautiful statement of some high truth\", or \"truth\" with \"decorations\". This mistake can lead to thinking of poems as collections of pretty language pleasing for its associations with pleasant things. But even Shakespeare and Milton wrote fine passages bringing up unpleasant and disagreeable associations. The things represented don't themselves shape the poetic effect, which depends on the \"kind of use the poet makes of them.\"\n\nThese mistakes look at poems in a mechanical way rather than in an organic way in which the elements (such as meter, rhyme, figurative language, along with attitude and emotion) need to be understood to be acting in a fundamental, intimate, organic way with each other.\n\nThe introduction also states (but doesn't develop the thought )that poems are inherently dramatic, with an implied speaker who reacts to a situation, scene or idea.\n\nIn a \"Foreword\" introducing discussions of individual poems, the authors say that poetry takes the general human interest that people have in other people (expressed at other times in news articles about such things as outlaws, lovers killing lovers or other tragedies, to cite some examples) and put into a form \"that preserves it\" even after initial curiosity wanes.\n\nPoems that tell a story use the reader's natural curiosity about how a story will turn out (the most obvious way we become interested in literature), although readers or listeners who know the ending still enjoy the poems. The story element can be prominent, as in [who?] \"Frankie and Johnny\" or much less prominent, as in Robert Frost's, \"Out, Out\". Narrative is a way for the poet to provoke certain emotional reactions and ideas in readers.\n\nUsing the ballad \"Johnie Armstrong\" as an example, the authors show how a narrative poem, far more than a novel or even a short story, will use bare \"facts\" in a dramatic way that gives them an emotional and intellectual meaning, whether or not the reader or listener has analyzed those or other elements. Poems are more concentrated or \"closely\" organized than prose in that they tend to present concentrated, sharper selected details in a concentrated, carefully arranged way, giving them more \"intensity.\" By presenting concrete, explicit statements (as in \"The Wife of Usher's Well\"), the poet can convey an emotional impact as well as information, which more abstract language can't do. The reader can also be drawn into a more immediate appreciation of a poem by drawing out ideas from suggestions rather than the poet making explicit statements. Yet not every implication of a poem needs to be understood consciously for a reader to enjoy the work.\n\nThe theme of a poem can be properly described (to give a fuller understanding of the poem) without the process becoming \"message hunting\" if the reader understands that \"the poem gives the theme its force\", not the other way around.\n\nThe poems in this section give readers an impression of some scene or object showing the impression they gave the poet either through his senses or imagination. Conveying fresh, vivid impressions of things is fundamental to good poetry, the authors assert.\n\nDescriptions in poetry are linked closely to our lives and our values, just as narratives are. When a poet describes an object it is separated from its context in the natural world and therefore looks different to the reader. We feel it carries associations, emotional or intellectual or both, that the natural object doesn't. If nothing else, we know that the poet has chosen the object to describe and we wonder why.\n\nRhythmical language in poetry is one of the ways we can see the tendency of poems towards a high degree of organization — there tends to be far more emphasis on rhythm in poetry than in prose. \n\nVerse, a specialized form of rhythm in language, is one of the elements that, when related to other elements in a poem, combines to form poetry. Rhythm is often associated with powerful or intense states of emotion, and while poetry is not concerned with only the emotional elements of human experience, it does try to \"do justice to\" those elements. \"[P]oetry is a result of a relationship among various elements and does not ever inhere specially in any single element. It is the fusion of all the elements that counts.\" (page 152, 3rd edition)\n\nVerse may seem trivial but is a powerful way of \"establishing a pervasive impression of unity.\" Stanza patterns do the same. They reveal a \"certain formality\" to the text and focus our attention. Since poetry frequently defies common sense, metrical form, in a way, offers the reader hope that the text will ultimately make sense, even that all parts of the poem will ultimately make sense. \n\nMeter can also be a subtle way for a poet to emphasize and de-emphasize. By occasionally breaking the metrical pattern, the poet can emphasize a word, for example. Certain metrical situations don't automatically produce particular effects — the use of meter achieves an effect only within the context of sense and feeling. The same is true for stanza forms, which are worth considering only as far as they help produce the particular effect of any given poem. Free verse, with varying line lengths and sometimes little else to distinguish it from prose, uses the particular lengths and line breaks to call attention to particular words or details.\n\nIn poems, tone is the expression of attitude. Tone is also linked with poetic voice.\n\nmetaphor\nsimile\npersonification\n\nPoems are simply presented here without \"critical apparatus\" directing the student. The poems are meant to be modern (although, in the third edition at least, the authors recognize that it's a stretch to include Gerard Manley Hopkins). With poets who are relatively recent and mostly still living, the works come from the same world as the student. The poems are put in \"natural groupings\" for convenience, although other groupings of the same poems could also be made.\n\nThe poem itself is what's important to the reader, but knowing something about the origin of a poem may help us better understand and appreciate it and poetry in general. Understanding the cultural context of a work of literature is also vital.\n\nThe book was reworked for each new edition:\n\n"}
{"id": "52762549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52762549", "title": "Uttoxeter Casket", "text": "Uttoxeter Casket\n\nThe Uttoxeter Casket, also known as Philip Nelson's Casket, is an Anglo Saxon reliquary from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire in the United Kingdom. As of 2017, it is held at the Cleveland Museum of Art in Ohio, USA. \nHouse-shaped and carved from a single piece of boxwood, it remains the only known surviving wood carving with such an elaborate iconographic programme from this period of British history.\n\nThe lid of the box was found at a cottage near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire in the mid-19th century. The Uttoxeter historian Francis Redfern in his \"History of the Town of Uttoxeter\", writing in the 1850s mentions that at Croxden “\"A curious carved oak panel of Jesus and the Twelve Apostles has lately come to light, and been a subject of discussion at a meeting of a brotherhood of antiquaries at Manchester\".”\n\nThe ruined Cistercian Croxden Abbey as the largest religious building in the locality, would be the most logical source of such an object. The box might have been pillaged or hidden at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries when Croxden Abbey surrendered to the Crown in 1538.\n\nIn 1936, the lid, which had first been re-discovered in Uttoxeter eight decades earlier, entered the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) for an opinion. It was by this time owned by the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Hammersmith (London). \nA Liverpool collector and specialist, Philip Nelson (1872–1953), had purchased the bottom piece in 1921 from a private owner in Warrington, Cheshire, for the sum of £175. Nelson was a man of independent means who devoted much of his energy and resources to antiquarian pursuits. He was well known in numismatic circles for a number of publications.\nThe lid came to Nelson's attention and it was realised that the two wooden items belonged together. Nelson convinced the convent to sell the lid to him for £120. The box and its lid were reunited for the first time in at least a century and possibly much longer.\n\nNelson lent the box to the V&A where it remained on exhibit from 1937 until his death in 1953. He published an article on it in the academic publication \"Archaeologia\" in 1937. After Nelson's death the reliquary was sold to an American dealer, and subsequently to The Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\nThe casket is a rare, possibly unique, example of high-quality Anglo Saxon wood carving, dating from c. 1050. It is decorated with scenes from Christ's life. On one long side, the Christ child rests in the manger. Above, the Crucifixion is shown with mourners gathered below the cross and two angels flanking it on either side. On the other long side is the Ascension, God's hand pulling Christ heavenward. Christ in Majesty appears above. The short sides show Christ’s entry into Jerusalem and the other his baptism though it is possibly first bath at the hands of the Emea (midwife) and Salome. It has a similar design influence to the Hereford Gospels and Troper, where the figures are said to resemble one another stylistically\n\nThe box measures 15 cm (6 in) in length, 5.5 cm (2¾ in) in width, and has a total height of 8.5 cm (3½ in). It is missing its lock and one hinge. The remaining hinge is made from a copper alloy.\nThis type of portable house-shrine was based on the earliest classical form of full-sized feretory or sarcophagus, aptly denominated by early medieval witnesses as a domunculus\n– or domuncula as in Bede – i.e. ‘little house’ – or even tugurium ‘hut’, which in the case of St Chad’s shrine alluded to by Bede was made of wood rather than stone.\nThe portable form, suitable for displaying on an altar, is well represented in Anglo-Saxon art by the hip-roofed Uttoxeter casket.\n\nCatherine Karkov, in her book \"The Art of Anglo Saxon England\", suggests that if the box is a reliquary, the way in which the figure of Christ appears centrally suggests it may have held a relic from one of the events of Christ’s life. As the box is made of wood, a piece of the True Cross would have been especially appropriate.\n\n\n"}

Its format is an extended narrative described as \"qissa\" or \"dastan\", and is listed along with \"Adam Khan and Durkhanai\", \"Ramadad Khan\" and \"Ajab Khan\" as important Pashto \"dastan\" which are available as chapbooks or in audio formats.\n\nA famous version of the story was put to verse by poet Ali Haydar Joshi (Joshi was a pen name) in the 1960s and was turned into a film, \"Yousuf Khan Sher Bano\", released in 1969. The poem was translated into French by Benedict Johnson (in 1982) and into English by Heston and Nasir (in 1988). The story is transmitted by \"qissa-khwans\", a term usually translated as \"storytellers\" who \"say\" or \"sing\" (\"Wayel\") the verses. Joshi's account of the origin of the material is that he found a manuscript containing the story written in Persian at a local fair wrapped around some medicine. He returned to the seller and got more of the manuscript. Joshi's account is given in a Lok Virsa tape recorded by Mumtaz Nasir in 1982.\n\nThe story has supernatural elements, such as five holy men (\"pirs\") who give the heroine the ability to travel large distance in thirty steps, jinns who bring a woman and a bed to a mosque at night for the pleasure of a yogi. These elements suggest an influence to the story from outside Pathan culture. However, the social structures in the story, particularly the use as villains of paternal male cousins is typical to Pathan stories, and many Pathans of various social classes identify the story as one of their own, according to ethnologist Wilma L. Heston.\n\nA film version of \"Yousuf Khan Sher Bano\" was produced by Nazir Hussain.1st Evergreen Pashto Movie Yousaf khan sherbano...Aziz Tabussam was the director of the film as shown in the film title but it is said he was basically hired as Pakhtoon translator where as the film actually directed by the Nazir hussain the producer of the film.\n\n"}
