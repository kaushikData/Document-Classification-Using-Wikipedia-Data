It was initiated by artist Per Huttner and biochemist Elias Arnér. The project was transgressing the boundaries of exhibition, publication and lectures in order to stimulate dialogues between art and science. The project was a sequel to the project Begrepp – En samling from 1992 and drew on Hüttner's experiences from projects like I am a Curator and Democracy and Desire.\n\n(In)Visible Dialogues was installed in three interconnected rooms. In the first, you saw 120 fluorescent chairs facing a blank wall. On the back of each chair a copy of the project's catalogue had been nailed and officially signed by a Professor from Karolinska Institutet and approved for publication, following local academic protocol. Each chair was an authorized copy of Jonas Bohlin's Concrete from 1980 that had been customized by the design group Åbäke.\n\nThe two flanking side rooms remained empty apart from a solitary lectern painted in the same color as the chairs and which was connected to speakers that emitted music and sounds composed for the occasion by participating sound artists Andy Cox and Richard Allalouf, Natalia Kamia, Samon Takahashi, Ebbot Lundberg and Yan Jun who interpreted a text written by Hüttner and Arnér on the importance and difficulty of dialogues between art and science. A new sound piece was played back each week. Lundberg's contribution, \"There's Only One of Us Here\" was released in 2012 – his first solo album in a 25-year career.\n\nAt 2pm, every Sunday in March 2011, a dialogue took place. The dialogues were devised so that a member of the scientific community dialogued with a member of the world of visual art. The audience could not see the two dialoguing people, who could not see each other either.\n\n6 March 2011 – Probing the Boundaries of Performance\n\nPredrag Petrovic, M.D. Ph.D., Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm\n\nand\n\nA Constructed World, Artists, Jacqueline Riva MFA and Geoff Lowe Ph.D., Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts d'Angers, Angers\n\n13 March 2011 – Probing the Boundaries of Insight\n\nKonrad Kaufmann, Ph.D., Max-Planck-Institut für biophysikalische Chemie, Göttingen\n\nand\n\nArijana Kajfes, Artist, Stockholm, Sweden\n\n20 March 2011 – Probing the Boundaries of Talent\n\nSandra Masur, Ph.D, Professor, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, New York City\n\nand\n\nLaurent Devèze, Philosopher, Art Critic and Director of École Régional de Beaux Arts, Besançon\n\n27 March 2011 – Probing the Boundaries of the Mind\n\nVeronique Wiesinger, Curator and director for Alberto and Annette Giacometti Foundation, Paris\n\nand\n\nHugo Lagercrantz, MD PhD, Professor, Karolinska Institutet, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Stockholm\n\n"}

Aerograd is a new town with a strategically located airfield of vital interest to the government. Work on the new outpost is complicated when tensions develop between workers and a religious sect. The sect threatens to give their support to a band of marauding samurai warriors who battle for control of the region. Relations between the two countries are further strained in the days before World War II, dating back to the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. In this feature, the Russians are victorious as airplanes throughout the country come to the aid of the beleaguered new town.

In most cases, AARs are a combination of both. Most analytical AARs are conducted over a contemporary problem or situation that has occurred in the past, is happening right now, or what could happen in the future.\n\nThe first AARs were developed by army generals. One of the first and best examples of an AAR is Julius Caesar’s “Commentaries on the Gallic War”.\n\nContemporary examples of AARs include project evaluations in business, as well as summaries of large gaming sessions in videogame culture.\n\nLiterary AARs can be formal or informal documents that seek syntax and linguistic improvement. Many research papers published under an academic journal can be considered a literary AAR. There might not be much of a difference between literary AARs and analytical AARs in terms of research papers, but the key difference is analytical seeks to improve performance while literary seeks to improve style.\n\nAnalytical AARs are formal documents intended to serve as aids to performance evaluation and improvement, by registering situation–response interactions, analyzing critical procedures, determining their effectiveness and efficiency, and proposing adjustments and recommendations. \n\nAnalytical AARs have three central objectives:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Done in oil on canvas, the work depicts an approaching thunderstorm. It was his largest painting to date. The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is praised for its dramatic depiction of the threatening mood of blackening skies and eerily illuminated terrain prior to the storm itself.\n\nOne of a series of paintings by Heade of coastal landscapes, this work was based on a sketch that Heade made of an approaching storm on Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Here, a fisherman sits by the shore watching the storm approach; there is a faint red bolt of lightning in the left part of the sky. To his left are a dog, an iron kettle, and a spread-out boat sail. Another fisherman is rowing toward the shore, having left his sailboat out on the bay. His placement in the composition helps provide a sense of distance and a narrative for the scene. \n\nThe painting is fairly conventional for its time, but the scene is hardly picturesque. Strazdes suggests that \"Heade, by refusing to prettify his scenery by association, was attempting to inject into his artistic vision a serious, monumental simplicity it had not previously possessed.\" The composition is very open, as if seen through a wide-angle lens, and relatively empty. The swathes of dark color are novel for a landscape work. The long horizon is an influence from Heade's contemporary, Frederic Edwin Church, as in paintings such as \"Niagara\".\n\nNumerous pentimenti suggest that Heade altered the composition over time; for example, the hills on the horizon were originally larger and more jagged. Records suggest that \"Approaching Thunder Storm\" was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1860. In 1868, Heade painted \"Thunder Storm on Narragansett Bay\", a similar composition.\n\n"}

{"id": "4205876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4205876", "title": "Auxochrome", "text": "Auxochrome\n\nAn auxochrome (from Ancient Greek \"auxanō\" \"increase\" and \"chrōma\" \"colour\") is a group of atoms attached to a chromophore which modifies the ability of that chromophore to absorb light. They themselves fail to produce the colour; but when present along with the chromophores in an organic compound intensifies the colour of the chromogen. Examples include the hydroxyl group (−OH), the amino group (−NH), the aldehyde group (−CHO), and the methyl mercaptan group (−SCH).\n\nAn auxochrome is a functional group of atoms with one or more lone pairs of electrons when attached to a chromophore, alters both the wavelength and intensity of absorption. If these groups are in direct conjugation with the pi-system of the chromophore, they may increase the wavelength at which the light is absorbed and as a result intensify the absorption. A feature of these auxochromes is the presence of at least one lone pair of electrons which can be viewed as extending the conjugated system by resonance.\n\nIt increases the color of any organic compound. For example, benzene does not display color as it does not have a chromophore; but nitrobenzene is pale yellow color because of the presence of a nitro group (−NO) which acts as a chromophore. But \"p\"-hydroxynitrobenzene exhibits a deep yellow color, in which the −OH group acts as an auxochrome. Here the auxochrome (−OH) is conjugated with the chromophore −NO. Similar behavior is seen in azobenzene which has a red color, but \"p\"-hydroxyazobenzene is dark red in color.\n\nThe presence of an auxochrome in the chromogen molecule is essential to make a dye. However, if an auxochrome is present in the meta position to the chromophore, it does not affect the color.\n\nAn auxochrome is known as a compound that produces a bathochromic shift, also known as red shift because it increases the wavelength of absorption, therefore moving closer to infrared light. Woodward−Fieser rules estimate the shift in wavelength of maximum absorption for several auxochromes attached to a conjugated system in an organic molecule.\n\nAn auxochrome helps a dye to bind to the object that is to be colored. Electrolytic dissociation of the auxochrome group helps in binding and it is due to this reason a basic substance takes an acidic dye.\n\nA molecule exhibits colour because it absorbs colours only of certain frequencies and reflects or transmits others. They are capable of absorbing and emitting light of various frequencies. Light waves with frequency very close to their natural frequency are absorbed readily. This phenomenon, known as resonance, means that the molecule can absorb radiation of a particular frequency which is same as the frequency of electron movement within the molecule. The chromophore is the part of the molecule where the energy difference between two different molecular orbitals falls within the range of the visible spectrum and hence absorbs some particular colours from visible light. Hence the molecule appears coloured. When auxochromes are attached to the molecule, the natural frequency of the chromophore gets changed and thus the colour gets modified. Different auxochromes produce different effects in the chromophore which in turn causes absorption of light from other parts of the spectrum. Normally, auxochromes which intensify the colour are chosen.\n\nThere are mainly two types of auxochromes:\n\n"}

The week-long conference is organized every spring and is the largest design initiative in South Eastern Europe. It covers architecture, design, fashion, publishing, and new media, as well as related fields like communications, marketing, advertising, and arts management. The event includes design labs, competitions, and presentations from international speakers like Karim Rashid and Daniel Libeskind.\n\nDuring the rest of the year, there are related projects such as promoting local designers, holding a branding competition for the Serbian Center for the Promotion of Science, and participating in the Partners of the Human Cities/ Project. The organization also spearheaded the Belgrade 2020 project, promoting the city as a candidate for the European Capital of Culture.\n\nFirst held in 2005, Belgrade Design Week festival was founded by brand consultant Jovan Jelovac, a formally trained architect. The conference costs about half a million euros to produce and is supported mostly through commercial and media sponsorships. For Jelovac, education was the primary reason for launching the summit, as well as inspiring the country's citizens through design. In 2014, the president of Serbia, Tomislav Nikolić, presided over the event, mentioning how design can contribute to the country's economy.\n\nIn 2006, designer Karim Rashid was the ambassador for the second Belgrade Design Week and spoke at the conference. As a result, he later headed several design projects in Serbia's capital city. Rashid stated that he is fascinated by Belgrade and Eastern Europe in general, seeing it \"as the next upcoming place - everyone is psyched and enthusiastic about the rebuilding of these poetic, romantic, artistic and very intellectual places.\"\n\nAfter attending the design festival in 2008, architect Daniel Libeskind left with a billion dollar, albeit controversial, commission to redevelop the Belgrade waterfront. Major projects like this one are contributing to the renewal of the city. Other skyscrapers and shopping malls are in the planning stages, and architectural masterpieces, like the Art Nouveau \"Geozavod\" building, are being restored. Belgrade is being compared to 1990's Berlin, seen as a decaying but alive metropolis: \"Recently, the gritty city has emerged as an outpost of creative activity and urban cool on the cheap, against the lingering backdrop of socialism.\"\n\nThe principal site of the festival changes annually with various run-down or abandoned buildings being renovated for the event. Past locations have included a palace, the bombed out hotel Jugoslavija, an abandoned department store, the closed contemporary art museum, and an old factory. Every year, the conference also focuses on a common thread, for example, in 2013 the unifying theme was the square shape.\n\nApproximately thirty international speakers present each year and cover a wide range of subjects, helping to promote cultural exchanges between Serbia and the rest of the world. Notable designers and artists who have spoken at the event include Konstantin Grcic, Aylin Langreuter, Christophe de la Fontaine, Hella Jongerius, Daan Roosegaarde, Ross Lovegrove. Christophe Pillet, Sacha Lakic and Patricia Urquiola.\n\nIn addition to the presentations, there are numerous workshops and design competitions, as well as exhibits from designers such as Israeli Eilon Armon and Swiss architect duo Lang/Baumann.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1879 by Benjamin Henry Blackwell, after whom the chain is named, in Oxford on Broad Street. The firm now has a chain of 45 shops, and an accounts and library supply service. It employs around 1000 staff in its divisions.\n\nThe Broad Street branches, which include speciality music and art/poster shops, remained the only ones until expansion in the early 1990s, when at peak after taking over Heffers in Cambridge in 1999 and James Thin in Scotland in 2002, the company had over 70 outlets. Its library supply chain serves an international market, but parts were sold off in 2009, with the North American arm of Blackwell Book Services and the Australian business James Bennett sold to Baker & Taylor for their academic arm YBP Library Services. The group were also publishers, under the Blackwell publishing imprint which published over 800 journals when it was sold to John Wiley & Sons in 2007 for £572 million to form Wiley-Blackwell.\n\nThe Blackwell family have run the company since its foundation, with an ownership divided between voting shares owned by the family and wealth shares owned by family and others. However, there was a public dispute in 2002 between Julian 'Toby' Blackwell, the current owner of the group, and Nigel Blackwell, the former chairman of the publishing arm, about the possible sale of the publishing business. This led to an offer of £300 million from Taylor & Francis and to an eventual deal with John Wiley & Son in 2006, as a result of which Nigel Blackwell and Toby's son Philip Blackwell left the business, leaving Toby Blackwell the sole family member still involved in running the company. Other family voting shares are held by a trust, which Toby's shares will transfer to when he dies, eventually bringing an end to the Blackwell family involvement with the company. Toby Blackwell announced in 2009 that the wealth shares would be distributed between staff, transforming the company into an employee-partnership, similar to that of retailer John Lewis, when the company returns to profitability having spent several years experiencing losses. The company reported it was expecting to return to profit in 2012.\n\nOn 29 October 2012, Blackwell's was – with Foyles, John Lewis department stores, Waitrose, Sainsbury's and Argos – among the retailers to launch the Nook e-reader – and from, November, the Nook HD and Nook HD+ tablet computers.\n\nThe company was founded in 1879 by Benjamin Henry Blackwell, son of the first city librarian, who having finished his education at 13, was apprenticed to a local bookseller for a shilling a week. His father, Benjamin Harris Blackwell, had been heavily involved in the Temperance Society. The society promoted, as well as religion, self-education and also encouraged reading. The society provided separate rooms for non-alcoholic refreshment and silent reading. A religious family, the Blackwells had also become involved with the Temperance Society due to Benjamin's father being teetotal, and as a protest against the government making money from the excise duty on alcohol.\n\nThe flagship shop at 48–51 Broad Street, Oxford, was originally only twelve feet square but quickly grew to incorporate the upstairs, cellar and neighbouring shops. Benjamin Henry Blackwell was well respected in Oxford and was elected the first Liberal councillor for Oxford North.\n\nBasil Blackwell, Benjamin Henry's son, became the first Blackwell to go to university; he was awarded a scholarship at Oxford University's Merton College. He was expected to join the family firm, however, which he did in 1913, after a spell as an apprentice publisher in London. He was tasked with expanding his father's publishing business. \n\nThe first Blackwell publication, \"Mensæ Secundæ: verses written in Balliol College\" by H.C. Beeching, was printed in 1897. Blackwell's began the careers of many writers: J. R. R. Tolkien's first poem, \"Goblin's Feet\", was published in 1915. To promote universal access to literature, Blackwell's pioneered a series of cheaper books, from a one-volume Shakespeare to \"3-and-6 novels\". The publishing company was merged into the main company in 1921, and a scientific section was added in 1939.\n\nWhen Benjamin Henry died in 1924, Basil Blackwell took over from his father, and went on to head the company for over sixty years. Basil Blackwell also wanted to preserve fine printing. After rescuing the Shakespeare Head Press, he commissioned belles-lettres, including well-known classics such as the Pilgrim's Progress, the works of the Brontës and a complete version of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.\n\nIn 1966, the Norrington Room was opened, named after Sir Arthur Norrington, the President of Trinity College and extending under part of Trinity College. It boasts three miles (5 km) of shelving and at merited an entry in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as the largest single room selling books.\n\nThe company has followed a determined policy since the 1990s to spread out from its traditional Oxford base and take on a much broader UK presence.\n\nIn 1995, Blackwell's became the first bookshop in the UK to allow its customers to purchase online from a catalogue of over 150,000 titles, and opened a flagship shop in London the same year, at 100 Charing Cross Road, which is now one of the company's six most prominent shops. Blackwell's took over the Heffers bookshops in Cambridge in 1999, and in 2002 acquired the academic bookshops of James Thin in Scotland.\n\nBlackwell's now has over 60 retail outlets across the UK, including a number of medical and other specialist bookshops, and even a shop in Aberdeen specialising in the oil industry. Both the Oxford and London flagship shops have won Bookseller of the Year at the British Book Awards.\n\nThe company is still in the hands of the Blackwell family. Support for its activities, including Blackwell's Online, is based at Beaver House in Oxford. The company was to be partially funded by Toby Blackwell Limited in 2012.\n\nBlackwell's maintains over 40 retail outlets across the UK, with flagship stores located in Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and London. Other branches are located on university campuses or are specialist branches, focusing on Music and Art.\n\n\n"}

Borscht, a soup associated with immigrants from eastern Europe, was a colloquialism for \"Jewish\". These resorts were a popular vacation spot for New York City Jews between the 1920s and the 1970s.\nMost Borscht Belt resorts hosted traveling Jewish comedians and musicians, and many who later became famous began their careers there.\n\nThe tradition of Borscht Belt entertainment started in the early twentieth century with the indoor and outdoor theaters constructed on a 40-acre (16-hectare) tract in Hunter, New York, by Yiddish theater star Boris Thomashefsky.\n\nThe 1987 films \"Dirty Dancing\" and \"Sweet Lorraine\" reflect on the bygone era.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the growth of air travel made the Catskills less attractive, so many of the resorts eventually closed, although Jewish culture has remained present. A large percentage of the region comprises summer homes and bungalow colonies (including many of the historic colonies) for Orthodox Jewish families, primarily from the New York metropolitan area, as well as year-round dwellers.\n\nResorts still are operating in the region, including Villa Roma, an Italian American resort, Soyuzivka and Xenia, Ukrainian cultural resorts, and the Skazka and Hotel Pine, Russian cultural resorts.\nAdditionally, motorsports enthusiasts are drawn to the area visiting the Monticello Motor Club.\n\nBorscht Belt hotels, bungalow colonies, summer camps, and קאָך-אַליינס \"kokh-aleyns\" (a Yiddish name for self-catered boarding houses, literally, \"cook-alones\") were frequented by families of middle and working class Jewish New Yorkers, mostly Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants.\nAntisemitism, particularly in the 1940s, '50s, and '60s, meant that they were often denied accommodation elsewhere.\n\nSome of the Catskill hotels were converted from farms that immigrant Jews had started in the early 1900s. As the area grew, it began to cater specifically to Jews, providing kosher food, synagogues, and other features of Jewish communities, including entertainment. The area became known as \"The Jewish Alps\", and the Sullivan County portion as \"Solomon County\".\n\nFrom the 1920s through the 1970s, nearly all notable Jewish entertainers would hone their skills at resorts in the Sullivan County area. Fallsburg became the catalyst for American stand-up comedy. Comedy legends, including Woody Allen, Rodney Dangerfield, Jerry Seinfeld, and Henny Youngman, performed there, as did Sid Caesar, Billy Crystal, Buddy Hackett, Gabe Kaplan, Andy Kaufman, and Joan Rivers. Jerry Lewis worked as a busboy while his parents did a vaudeville act. He would entertain customers while cleaning tables, giving him a chance to hone his skills while upping his tips. Famed prize fighters like Rocky Marciano and Sonny Liston, and Muhammad Ali, Leon Spinks and Floyd Patterson trained there. Millions of tourists, especially New Yorkers, came to swim in the lakes and oversized hotel pools, to ski or ice-skate or take lessons in golf, tennis, and dancing. No fewer than 538 hotels sprang up in this area of Eastern New York.\n\nWell known resorts in the area included The Concord, Grossinger's, Brickman's, Brown's Hotel, Kutsher's Hotel and Country Club, the Nevele, Friar Tuck Inn, Gibber's, Gilbert's, Granit, the Woodbine Hotel, the Heiden Hotel, Irvington, Lansman's, The Laurels Hotel and Country Club, The Pines Resort, Raleigh, Silverman's River View Hotel, Stevensville, Stiers, the Tamarack Lodge, the Olympic, and the Windsor Regency.\n\nTwo of the larger hotels in High View (north of Bloomingburg) were Shawanga Lodge and the Overlook. In 1959, the Shawanga hosted a conference that marked the beginning of serious research into lasers. The hotel burned to the ground in 1973.\nThe Overlook had entertainment and summer lodging through the late 1960s and was operated by the Schrier family. It included a main building and about 50 other bungalows, plus a five-unit cottage just across the street. It remains in a different form, no longer functioning as it was in its heyday.\n\nThe New York, Ontario & Western Railway carried passengers to the resorts from Weehawken, New Jersey, until 1948. The railroad was abandoned in 1957. Despite the improvement of roads such as the original New York State Route 17, the area is no longer a major travel destination.\n\nThe decline of the Catskills resorts was apparent as early as 1965. Entertainment in America was changing as the country ushered in the jet age. As ethnic barriers in the U.S. began to fall and travel to distant resorts became easier and cheaper, fewer Jewish American families in New York City went to the Catskills. By the early 1960s, between a quarter and a third of Grossinger's annual visitors were non-Jewish. Even the universalization of air-conditioned hotels across America drew customers away from the aging resorts primarily built before this innovation became popular. In the social and cultural upheavals of the 1960s, traditional resort vacations lost their appeal for many younger adults.\n\nSmaller, more modest hotels such as Youngs Gap and the Ambassador found themselves in a niche with a vanishing clientele and closed by the end of the 1960s. By the mid-1990s, nearly 300 hotels and motels had gone out of business in Sullivan County.\n\nThe 1970s took a toll on more lavish establishments such as the Flagler and The Laurels. In 1986 Grossinger's closed for renovations, and the property was abandoned by new owners midway through work. Grossinger's largest historic rival (and the largest of all the Borscht Belt resorts), the Concord, benefitted only temporarily, filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and closing a year later.\n\nIn 1987, New York's mayor Ed Koch proposed buying the Gibber Hotel in Kiamesha Lake to house the homeless. The idea was opposed by local officials. The hotel instead became a religious school, like many old hotels in the Catskills.\n\nPlans are now in place by those who purchased the former Borscht Belt resorts Concord Resort Hotel and Grossinger's to work with Native Americans in an attempt to bring gambling to the region. Because the Borscht Belt's prime has long passed and many of the resorts are abandoned, developers believe this is the only way to revitalize the region to the popularity it once had by attracting guests to world-class casinos and resorts such as the ones in New Jersey and Connecticut. However, large-scale casino plans have not come to fruition, mainly because there are no Indian reservations anywhere near the area (the Mohawk tribe's effort to build a Catskills casino was rejected for this very reason). Instead, the state government proposed legalizing off-reservation gambling, which required a positive referendum, passed in November 2013.\n\nThe Heiden Hotel in South Fallsburg, which was the location of the movie \"Sweet Lorraine\" starring Maureen Stapleton, was destroyed by fire in May 2008.\n\nThe Stevensville Hotel in Swan Lake, which was owned by the family of David G. Friehling, who pleaded guilty as an accomplice of Bernard Madoff's, has reopened as the Swan Lake Resort Hotel.\n\nThe former Homowack Lodge in Spring Glen, New York, was converted into a summer camp for Hassidic girls. Officials of the state Department of Health ordered the property evacuated in July 2009, citing health and safety violations.\n\nThe Granit later began operating as the Hudson Valley Resort.\n\nThe Tamarack Lodge caught fire in 2012, and 30 buildings were partially or completely destroyed.\n\n\n"}

Although it was founded by rich families to compete with the upscale Park Theatre, the Bowery saw its most successful period under the populist, pro-American management of Thomas Hamblin in the 1830s and 1840s. By the 1850s, the theatre came to cater to immigrant groups such as the Irish, Germans, and Chinese. It burned down four times in 17 years, a fire in 1929 destroying it for good. Although the theatre's name changed several times (Thalia Theatre, Fay's Bowery Theatre, etc.), it was generally referred to as the \"Bowery Theatre\".\n\nBy the mid-1820s, wealthy settler families in the new ward that was made fashionable by the opening of Lafayette Street, parallel to the Bowery, wanted easy access to fashionable high-class European drama, then only available at the Park Theatre. Under the leadership of Henry Astor, they formed the New York Association and bought the land where Astor's Bull's Head Tavern stood, facing the neighborhood and occupying the area between Elizabeth, Canal (then called Walker), and Bayard streets. They hired architect Ithiel Town to design the new venue.\n\nSome notable investors included Samuel Laurence Gouverneur, son-in-law to President James Monroe, and James Alexander Hamilton, son of Alexander Hamilton.\n\nThe new playhouse, with its Neoclassical design, was more opulent than the Park, and it seated 3,500 people, making it the biggest theatre in the United States at the time. Frances Trollope compared it to the Park Theatre as \"superior in beauty; it is indeed as pretty a theatre as I ever entered, perfect as to size and proportion, elegantly decorated, and the scenery and machinery equal to any in London...\"\n\nThe Bowery Theatre opened on 22 October 1826 under the name New York Theatre, with the comedy \"The Road to Ruin,\" by Thomas Holcroft, under the management of Charles A. Gilfert. New York Mayor Philip Hone spoke at the opening ceremony, imploring the theatre's intended upper-class audience: \"It is therefore incumbent upon those whose standing in society enables them to control the opinions and direct the judgment of others, to encourage, by their countenance and support, a well-regulated theatre.\" Its first few seasons were devoted to ballet, opera, and high drama. The theatre was by this time quite fashionable, and the northward expansion of Manhattan gave the theatre access to a large patronage. The theatre burnt out in 1828, but was rebuilt behind the same facade - by the architect Joseph Sera - and reopened under the name Bowery Theatre. Gilfert's understanding of advertising was keen, but in 1829 the owners fired him.\n\nThe owners hired Thomas Hamblin and James H. Hackett in August 1830 to manage the theatre. A month later, Hackett left Hamblin in complete control. After the Bowery burned down later that year, Hamblin rebuilt. He then took the theatre in a decidedly different direction for what would be its most innovative and successful period.\n\nAmerican theatres stratified in the Jacksonian Era, and the Bowery emerged as the home of American nativists and populist causes, placing it in direct contrast to the Park Theatre's cultivated image of traditional European high culture. This was partially the result of an anti-British theatre riot at the Park; Hamblin renamed the playhouse \"the American Theatre, Bowery\" in reaction. Hamblin hired unknown American actors and playwrights and allowed them to play for long runs of up to a month. Before 1843, early blackface performers such as George Washington Dixon and Thomas D. Rice played there frequently, and acts such as J. B. Booth, Edwin Forrest, Louisa Lane Drew, and Frank Chanfrau also gained renown on the Bowery's stage. George L. Fox and his pantomime became the most popular act at the Bowery until after the Civil War. Bowery productions also debuted or popularized a number of new character types, including the Bowery B'hoy, the Yankee, the Frontiersman, and the blackface Negro.\n\nThe pro-Americanism of the Bowery's audience came to a head during the Farren Riots of 1834. Farren, the Bowery's British-born stage manager, had reportedly made anti-American comments and fired an American actor. Protesters reacted by attacking the homes, businesses, and churches of abolitionists and blacks in New York City and then storming the theatre on 9 July. Farren apologized for his comments, and George Washington Dixon sang popular songs to quell the rioters.\n\nHamblin defied conventions of theatre as high culture by booking productions that appealed to working-class patrons and by advertising them extensively according to Gilfert's model. Animal acts, blackface minstrel shows, and melodrama enjoyed the most frequent billings, and hybrid forms, such as melodramas about dogs saving their human masters, became unprecedented successes. Spectacular productions with advanced visual effects, including water and fire, featured prominently. Hamblin also innovated by using gas lighting in lieu of candles and kerosene lamps. The Bowery Theatre earned the nickname \"The Slaughterhouse\" for its low-class offerings, and terms like \"Bowery melodrama\" and \"Bowery actors\" were coined to characterize the new type of theatre.\n\nIn the spring of 1834, Hamblin began buying shares in the theatre from the New York Association; he had enough to control the enterprise completely within 18 months. By the time the Bowery burned again in September 1836, it was the most popular playhouse in New York City, despite steep increases in competition (the Bowery Amphitheatre was right across the street). Visual spectacle had become such an integral part of its appeal that Hamblin claimed $5,000 in wardrobe losses from the fire. Hamblin bought out the remaining shares in the theatre and rented the site to W. E. Dinneford and Thomas Flynn, who rebuilt. When this interim Bowery burned down in February 1838, Hamblin replaced it with a bigger and more opulent structure, which opened in May 1839.\n\nThrough Hamblin's actions, working-class theatre emerged as a form in its own right, and melodrama became the most popular form of American theatre. Low-class patrons such as Bowery b'hoys and g'hals predominated in the audience. \"The Spirit of the Times\" described the Bowery's patrons:\n\nSome sources even suggest that patrons engaged in sexual behavior in the lobbies and boxes. Understandably, Hamblin was careful to remain in this crowd's good graces. For example, he regularly offered use of the Bowery Theatre for the annual firemen's ball. Only the Chatham Garden Theatre boasted a rowdier audience.\n\nProfits were harder to come by in the 1840s, as more playhouses sprung up in New York. Hamblin staged more effects-driven melodrama and later increased bookings of circus acts, minstrel shows, and other variety entertainments. The Bowery burned down once more in April 1845. This time, Hamblin had fire insurance, and he rebuilt with an eye toward appealing to a more upscale patronage and to staging more spectacular melodrama. The theatre now seated 4,000 and with a stage square, secured its place as one of the largest playhouses in the world. The architect and builder of the new theatre was John M. Trimble. Hamblin left the management to A. W. Jackson, though Jackson and later managers largely upheld Hamblin's emphasis on melodrama and visual splendor. Hamblin died in January 1853, and the theatre remained in his family until 1867.\n\nSuccessful plays of Hamblin's tenure included:\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, immigrant groups, notably the Irish, began populating the Bowery neighborhood. They came to form a significant portion of the Bowery's audience, mostly in the low-price gallery section. In order to cater to them, the theatre offered plays by James Pilgrim and other Irish playwrights. Meanwhile, the Bowery emerged as the theatrical center for New York's Lower East Side.\n\nGermans Gustav Amberg, Heinrich Conried, and Mathilde Cottrelly converted the Bowery into the Thalia Theatre in 1879, offering primarily German theatre during their ownership. In 1891, Yiddish theatre became the predominant attraction. Italian vaudeville succeeded this, followed by Chinese vaudeville.\n\nIn 1894, Maria Roda addressed a large rally at the Thalia Theater celebrating Emma Goldman's release from prison. Although Roda spoke in Italian and Goldman understood none of it, she was moved by Roda's charismatic presence. She wrote, \"Maria's strange beauty and the music of her speech roused the whole assembly to tensest enthusiasm. Maria proved a veritable ray of sunlight to me.\" She then pledged to become Maria Roda's \"teacher, friend, comrade.\"\n\n\"Fay's Bowery Theatre\" burned down on 5 June 1929 under Chinese management and was never rebuilt.\n\n\n\n"}

The Paraorchestra was formed by conductor Charles Hazlewood in 2011 as a project to create a platform for the top disabled musicians, with the hope that its success would lead to better integration of the disabled into music and performing arts. The orchestra performed its first live show at Glastonbury Abbey in July 2012 (which was also the subject of a Channel 4 documentary), and received international attention when it played alongside Coldplay during the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London in September 2012.\n\nCharles Hazlewood was inspired by his youngest daughter Eliza to form the Paraorchestra; Eliza has cerebral palsy, but Hazlewood believed that she was still an \"outstanding\" singer. Being the father of a child with a disability, he realized that throughout his career as an orchestral conductor, he had seen few disabled performers as members of orchestras. Hazlewood felt that since music is \"universal\", an orchestra should represent all members of a communitycomparing this ordeal to the time when only men performed in orchestras. He felt that an orchestra consisting only of disabled performers could spread awareness of this issue and help achieve greater integration for the disabled in music and the performing arts.\n\nHazlewood officially announced the formation of the British Paraorchestra in July 2011 at a TED conference in Edinburgh. He did not intend the Paraorchestra to be a therapeutic or \"warm and fuzzy\" project, but rather a platform to showcase disabled musicians with virtuosic qualities. When holding auditions, he aimed to find musicians who were \"at the top of their game, technically, and with a spirit behind the virtuosity.\" The orchestra's first 17 members come from a variety of backgrounds and use a variety of instruments, including conventional instruments and electronic devices such as tablet computers and other assistive technology developed by Rolf Gehlhaar, Professor in Experimental Music at Coventry University and the technical director of the orchestra. After failing to partner with the BBC, Hazlewood successfully commissioned British broadcaster Channel 4 to produce a documentary following the formation of the Paraorchestra and its first performance, which aired on 9 September 2012. He felt airing its documentary on Channel 4 was a \"no-brainer\", as it was also the official broadcaster of the 2012 Summer Paralympics. \n\nThe Paraorchestra made its first public appearance on 1 July 2012 during Hazlewood's music festival \"Orchestra in a Field\" at Glastonbury Abbey; the performance included its versions of \"Greensleeves\" and Maurice Ravel's \"Boléro\". The orchestra's style incorporates a large amount of improvisation, intended to allow the orchestra to feel a sense of \"collective ownership\" of their performances.\n\nIn 2012, Hazlewood campaigned for the Paraorchestra to be included in the ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London. He felt that their inclusion in this international event would be a unique opportunity for the Paraorchestra and that it could also raise awareness of his cause. The Paraorchestra were ultimately incorporated into the closing ceremony of the Games, where it performed alongside British rock band Coldplay (accompanying them in a performance of \"Strawberry Swing\"), and played the Paralympic anthem. The Paraorchestra planned to use the exposure it gained through its role at the Paralympics to add more performers, make studio recordings, and tour across Europe.\n\nOn 3 December 2012, coinciding with the United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the British Paraorchestra released a cover of \"True Colors\" as a charity single, in a campaign to be Christmas number one. Accompanied by the Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children and notable Britiah paralympians, the single was released to support the British Paralympic Association in preparation for the 2014 Winter Paralympics, along with the Paraorchestra and Kaos Signing Choir themselves. The Paraorchestra was awarded a Big Society Award in September 2013.\n\nThe Paraorchestra began with 17 members, but plans to add more in the near future. Its members currently include Nicholas McCarthy, a one-handed pianist who graduated from the Royal College of Music in 2012, Clarence Adoo, a former jazz trumpet player who was paralysed below the shoulders after a car accident (and now plays an instrument known as \"Headspace\", which is controlled by breath and head motions, developed for him by Rolf Gehlhaar), Gemma Lunt, a viola player who uses a wheelchair and Lyn Levett, who uses a Macintosh to play what Hazlewood feels is \"dizzyingly creative\" electronic music. Blind members of the Paraorchestra include Pianist and violinist Abi Baker, James Risdon on recorder, Matthew Wadsworth on the lute, violist Takashi Kikuchi, and multi-instrumentalists Baluji Shrivastav and Ziad Sinno. The Paraorchestra also recently added 15-year-old deaf viola player Tilly Chester to its lineup. Hazlewood had encountered her playing with the National Youth Orchestraof which she is also a member.\n\n\n"}

To that end, films are screened at no fee with both English and Arabic subtitles and Q&A sessions, panels and master classes are held with guests of the festival.\n\nThe festival first came to existence in 2008 in the form of Entre Cineastas () or the Caravan of Arab and Latin American Women's Films (). The caravan was held in various Arab, Latin American and Spanish cities. Over the years, the initiative developed to, eventually, expand into the Cairo International Women's Film Festival, and include the Caravan as one of many sections of the festival.\n\nThroughout the festival, master classes and panels are held to introduce filmmakers to the audience and open the floor for themes or film-based discussions.\n\nOne pillar of the festival is the One Minute Workshop (). This is a workshop instructed by filmmaker and founder of CIWFF, Amal Ramsis, where she teaches non-professional women the basics of making short films in order to write, act, shoot and direct one-minute long films addressing a selected concept. It is held several times around the year in various cities and towns around Egypt and the Arab World, Latin America and Europe in collaboration with the TRAMA network and Drac Màgic—the women's film festival that had launched the initiative in 1997.\n\nSections of the festival change with every edition. One integral section, however, is the Caravan. Every edition also celebrates one prominent female filmmaker by screening a selection of her films in a section titled ′Tribute to a Cineaste′ and inviting her to conduct Q&A sessions and a panel. Other recurring sections are the International Panorama, the Country in Focus and the Guest Festival—which is often a partner women's film festival.\n\nCIWFF features one award: The Audience Award. It was first introduced in the 6th edition (2013). All films qualify except films from the Caravan, the Tribute and the Workshop. Through public vote, one film is selected to receive the award. No committee has any say in the selection. Should the audience vote for a short film, the award is divided between the first- and the second-ranking films. It is, then, presented to the director of the winning film—if present—and the film is screened on closing night.\n\nSome films that have won the Audience Award are:\n"}

The patterns originate in early Celtic developments in stone and metal-work, and later in medieval Insular art. Prehistoric spiral designs date back to Gavrinis (c. 3500 BCE).\n\nThe straight-line spirals of Celtic labyrinths originated in chevrons and lozenges and are drawn by the Celts using a connect the dots method.\n\nCeltic labyrinths are found among carvings at Camonica Valley, occupied by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one Knossos or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the labyrinths also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the labyrinths containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity Cernunnos. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as the line of the other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing Classical labyrinths from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.\n\n"}
{"id": "1068073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1068073", "title": "Charles Ricketts", "text": "Charles Ricketts\n\nCharles de Sousy Ricketts (2 October 1866 – 7 October 1931) was a versatile English artist, illustrator, author and printer, and is best known for his work as book designer and typographer from 1896 to 1904 with the Vale Press, and his work in the theatre as a set and costume designer.\n\nRicketts was born in Geneva to a French mother and an English father. He grew up mainly in France and Italy. He began his studies in art at the City and Guilds Technical Art School in Lambeth, in 1882, after both his parents had died.\n\nAccording to William Rothenstein, \"Ricketts, with his pale, delicate features, fair hair and pointed red-gold beard, looked like a Clouet drawing. Half French, he had the quick mind and the rapid speech of a southerner.\"\nAt the Art School he met Charles Shannon (1863–1937), painter and lithographer, who would be his lifelong partner in both his artistic and personal life. On the advice of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, they settled in England rather than abroad.\n\nThey founded \"The Dial\", a magazine, which had five issues from 1889 to 1897, and the Vale Press, named after their house, The Vale, in Chelsea, London. \"The portrait of Ricketts by Shannon was painted two years after Ricketts had founded the Vale Press. It is a record of their friendship, slightly tentative in its character, with Ricketts turning his head away so that he is seen in profile. He liked it precisely for this reason since it shows him 'turning away from the 20th century to think only of the 15th.' It is labelled on the back 'The Man in an Inverness Cloak'.\"\n\nRicketts was one of two well-known illustrators of Oscar Wilde's work, the other being Aubrey Beardsley who worked on \"Salomé\". He and Shannon were friends and supporters of Wilde, for whom Ricketts painted, in the style of Clouet, the hero of Wilde's short story, 'The Portrait of Mr. W. H.'\"\n\nIt was in the work of the Vale Press that Ricketts would find his talents were best employed. The enterprise also involved Thomas Sturge Moore, and later William Llewellyn Hacon (1860–1910), a barrister. The actual printing was carried out by Ballantyne Press under the supervision of Charles McCall. A total of about 75 books were produced, including a complete Shakespeare in 39 volumes, before the special type fonts were destroyed. In parallel, Ricketts was involved with the Eragny Press, run by Lucien Pissarro and his wife Esther, from 1894 to 1914.\n\nAfter 1902, he turned more to painting and sculpture. His principal pictures in public galleries are \"The Death of Don Juan\" (Tate Gallery), \"The Plague\" (Musée du Luxembourg, Paris) and \"Montezuma\" (Manchester Art Gallery).\n\nRicketts also wrote on art, was a collector, and was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1922 and a full member in 1928. In 1929 he was appointed a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission. He was also a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers.\n\nRicketts became a celebrated and sought-after designer for the stage. \"Mr Ricketts is infallible in his ideas on costume\" observed \"The Times\". Plays on which he worked included Oscar Wilde's \"Salome\" (1906), Laurence Binyon's \"Attila\" (1907), \"King Lear\" (1909), Bernard Shaw's \"The Dark Lady\" (1910), Arnold Bennett's \"Judith\" (1916), Shaw's Annajanska, the Bolshevik Empress (1918), Maurice Maeterlinck's \"The Betrothal\" (1920), Shaw's \"Saint Joan\" (1924), \"Macbeth\" (1926) and John Masefield's \"The Coming of Christ\" (1928). Outside London he worked for the Abbey Theatre, Dublin on plays by W. B. Yeats and J.M. Synge. Ricketts also designed much-publicised new productions of \"The Gondoliers\" and \"The Mikado\" for Rupert D'Oyly Carte in the 1920s.\n\nMichael MacLennan wrote \"Last Romantics\", a play based on the life of Ricketts, Shannon and their circle, including Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley and Michael Field. The play premiered in 2003 and was a finalist for the Governor General's Literary Award that year.\n\nThrough his friend, the Russian singer Vladimir Rosing, Cecil Arthur Lewis met Ricketts and Ricketts became Lewis' artistic mentor and sponsor. After Ricketts' death, Lewis edited his letters and journals for publication. Part of Ricketts' ashes are buried at Arolo, in the park of the villa that Ricketts donated to Lewis.\n\n\n\n"}

Wignell had not yet formed his company when the New Theatre was being set up to be built, but as the New Theater was being built, Wignell was in England recruiting actors to be a part of his company. The New Theater's design, modeled after the Theatre Royal, Bath, was made possible by John Inigo Richards, Wignell's brother-in-law, who obtained architect Thomas Greenway’s original plans. The New Theatre was built on Chestnut Street near the corner of Sixth Street across from Congress Hall. $30,000 was raised for the construction of the building and the finale touches were not completed until 1805 under architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The stage ran with a depth of seventy-one feet and had a width of thirty feet. The three tiers of boxes could hold nine hundred people; the theatre itself was able to hold an audience of two thousand. There were multiple dressing rooms, two green rooms, and for the first time in America a large well-stocked wardrobe. There were two different entrances from the street for the theatre patrons, those going to the pit and those headed to the boxes. The entryway to the pit was only eighteen inches wide, a death trap in the event of a fire. Like English theatres the New Theatre on Chestnut Street had all the essentials. A proscenium with proscenium doors in the proscenium walls with a balcony overhead. Not long after its construction the New Theatre was often referred to as one of the Seven Wonders of America. A yellow fever epidemic spoiled the theater’s debut in 1793, and its first regular season did not begin until the following year when the inaugural night’s entertainment offered a double feature, John O'Keeffe's \"Castle of Andalusia\" and Hannah Cowley's \"Who's the Dupe?\" Over the following twenty-seven years the theater would become a showcase for works by local and national dramatist of the day. In 1816 the New Theatre became the first American theater to be illuminated by gas fixtures rather than candlelight or oil lamps. Four years later a suspicious fire destroyed the theater along with its library, music, scenery and costumes. The cause of the fire remained a mystery since the building had been vacant for several days while the company was engaged in Baltimore.\n\nTwo years later, the second Chestnut Street Theatre rose from the ashes of the first. It was built in the customary design of the day by architect William Strickland with triple tiers of boxes making a horseshoe around the orchestra and apron of the stage that accommodated about 2,000 theatergoers. The façade was made of Italian-style marble with an arcade supported by a row of composite columns with a plain entablature. The entrance stood between two wings whose niches held statues of Tragedy and Comedy by William Rush. Below the statues were semi-circular recesses containing basso relievos of tragic and comic muses. \n\nThe Chestnut Street Theatre was once again consumed in a fire in 1856 and would not see another curtain rise for six years.\n\nThe third Chestnut Street Theatre was built in 1862, seven blocks to the west of its original location, where once again it found favor with Philadelphia audiences as a fashionable night spot. Tragic actress Jean Hosmer was among those who starred at the debut of the third theater.\n\nIt closed its doors for the last time in 1913 after the curtain fell on the final act of Arthur Wing Pinero's \"The Second Mrs Tanqueray\", and the building was demolished soon afterwards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38587552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38587552", "title": "Cultural Objects Name Authority", "text": "Cultural Objects Name Authority\n\nThe Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA) is a project by the Getty Research Institute to create a controlled vocabulary containing authority records for cultural works, including architecture and movable works such as paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, manuscripts, photographs, textiles, ceramics, furniture, other visual media such as frescoes and architectural sculpture, performance art, archaeological artifacts, and various functional objects that are from the realm of material culture and of the type collected by museums. The focus of CONA is works cataloged in scholarly literature, museum collections, visual resources collections, archives, libraries, and indexing projects with a primary emphasis on art, architecture, or archaeology. The target users are the visual resources, academic, and museum communities. \n\nIn the CONA database, each work's record (also called a subject in the database, not to be confused with iconographical depicted subjects of art works) is identified by a unique numeric ID. Linked to each work's record are titles/names, current location, dates, other fields, related works, a parent (that is, a position in the hierarchy), sources for the data, and notes. By using terms from all four Getty Vocabularies to control many of these fields, CONA uses linked data principles to pull together multiple vocabularies in the creation of an authority file for works of art. The coverage of CONA is global, from prehistory through the present.\n\nDetailed discussions regarding the Getty Vocabulary Program compiling a vocabulary comprising unique numeric identifiers and brief records for art works began in 2004. It was determined that various Getty projects collected data for movable works and architecture that could form an initial data set, upon which other contributors could build over time. The project was enthusiastically embraced by the user community. In 2005 mapping of the data model used for all three existing vocabularies (the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), the Thesaurus for Geographic Names (TGN), and the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)) to potential CONA fields was completed. The effort coincided with the development of CCO (Cataloging Cultural Objects), a more concise offshoot of the CDWA (Categories for the Description of Works of Art), and CDWA Lite, which is an XML schema intended to serve as an exchange format for art information. Both CCO and CDWA, which reflect consensus in the user community of best practice in cataloging art and architecture, lay out the required fields and rules for cataloging art objects.\n\nTechnical development of CONA began in 2010. The editorial system and online search screens for CONA are similar to those used for the existing Getty vocabularies. The data is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, building complex and changing polyhierarchies, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of CONA is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules.\n\nContributions to CONA from the user community commenced in 2012. A pilot release of CONA with a limited number of records is currently available online. The growth and utility of CONA will depend upon contributions from users. As with the AAT, TGN, and ULAN, CONA will grow and change via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the Getty Vocabulary Program.\n\nThe current manager of the Getty vocabularies is Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor. Administratively, the Vocabulary Program resides under the GRI Collection Management and Description Division (David Farneth, Head). Other GRI departments in this division are General Collection Cataloging, Special Collections Cataloging, Digital Services, the Registrar\\x92s Office, Institutional Records and Archives, and Conservation and Preservation. The Vocabulary Program works with Digital Art History Access (Murtha Baca, Head) to foster foreign language translations of the vocabularies, maintain national and international partnerships, and oversee licensing and marketing.\n\nThe focus of each CONA record is a work of art or architecture. Each work is identified with a unique and persistent numeric ID, which aids in the disambiguation of similar works. There are many fields in CONA, however through titles/names (equivalence relationships), as well as hierarchical and associative relationships, the basic structure of CONA is that of a thesaurus in compliance with ISO and NISO standards. Names or titles may be current, historical, and in various languages.\n\nAlthough it may be displayed as a list, CONA is a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the CONA hierarchy (Subject_ID: 700000000). There may be multiple broader contexts, making CONA polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships (e.g., between a print and the larger volume to which it belongs), CONA has equivalence relationships (between equivalent titles/names) and associative relationships (e.g., between a sketch and the final work). The primary top divisions of CONA are the facets Built Work and Movable Work.\n\nWith the exception of performance art, CONA records unique physical works. However, CONA may include works that were never built or that no longer exist, for example designs for a building that was not constructed or a work that has been destroyed.\n\nBuilt Works: Built works within the scope of CONA are architecture, which includes structures or parts of structures that are the result of conscious construction, are of practical use, are relatively stable and permanent, and are of a size and scale appropriate for—but not limited to—habitable buildings. Most built works in CONA are manifestations of the built environment that is typically classified as fine art, meaning it is generally considered to have aesthetic value, was designed by an architect (whether or not his or her name is known), and constructed with skilled labor.\n\nMovable Works: The term movable works is borrowed from legal jargon, referring to tangible objects capable of being moved or conveyed from one place to another, as opposed to real estate or other buildings. It is useful to separate the two types of works—built works and movable works—into different facets in CONA because movable works typically are located in a repository, have a repository identification number, have a provenance of former locations, and other characteristics that typically differ from architecture.\n\nMovable works within the scope of CONA include the visual arts that are of the type collected by art museums, although the objects themselves may actually be held by an ethnographic, anthropological, or other museum, or owned by a private collector. Performance art is included in CONA under this facet as well.\n\nThe minimum fields and editorial rules of CONA are in compliance with CDWA and CCO. The minimum fields are the following: Catalog Level, Object/Work Type, Title or Name, Creator, Creation Date, Measurements, Materials and Techniques, Depicted Subject, and Current Location.\n\n\n"}

However 1974 was proving to be another difficult year for the studio, with no real box-office hits.\n\nSince the late 1960s, Naomi Tani had been known as the \"Queen of Pink,\" the most popular actress in the low-budget, independent \"pink films\" which dominated Japan's domestic cinematic market. Nikkatsu had been trying to recruit Tani into their \"Roman Porno\" series for years, but she had always refused since the studio had been reluctant to enter the S&M genre, which was Tani's specialty. Tani finally agreed to join the studio on the condition that her first film be based on the Oniroku Dan S&M novel \"Flower and Snake\". Tani had already starred in a \"pink film\" version of Dan's novel entitled , released by Yamabe Pro.\n\nNikkatsu agreed to Tani's conditions, but there remained the problem of convincing Oniroku Dan to allow the studio to film his novel. After lengthy, inconclusive negotiations, Dan invited director Masaru Konuma and scriptwriter Yozo Tanaka to his home for \"further discussions.\" In the middle of the meeting, the electrical power suddenly went out, and Dan called for someone to light a candle. At this point, Naomi Tani, in traditional Japanese kimono, appeared in the room with a lantern. Konuma later said, \"This was Dan's theatrical sense - his way of saying yes.\"\n\nDirector Konuma and script-writer Tanaka both agreed that Dan's novel was unfilmable, and made significant changes to the story. Dan and Naomi Tani both objected to this, and there was considerable friction between the two sides over the story during the writing of the script. Konuma later commented about Naomi Tani's role in this matter, \"while we worked on the final script, she was very argumentative. However, I was impressed with her change in attitude after the company's final decision. During the shoot, she never gave us a problem. Instead- she was committed. I admire her professionalism.\"\n\nAfter the film became a huge hit for Nikkatsu, the studio wanted to follow it with a sequel. Oniroku Dan remained bitter and did not agree to participate in the next film, \"Wife to be Sacrificed\" (1974), which became even a greater success. Dan did reconcile with the studio however, and continued to have a strong professional relationship with both Nikkatsu and Naomi Tani.\n\nMakoto Katagiri (Yasunori Ishizu) is a 30-year-old man living with his mother Miyo (Hiroko Fuji), who operates a pornographic photography business specializing in sadomasochistic content out of her combined home and adult toy store. As a child, Makoto shot and killed a black American soldier whom he found having sex with his mother. The incident left Makoto psychologically stunted as well as impotent, and as such his mother and her staff treat Makoto much as a child. Despite this, Makoto has developed a strong interest in BDSM, though he has no outlet for his interests.\n\nSenzô Tôyama (Nagatoshi Sakamoto) is the elderly owner of the company Makoto works for, and also has an interest in BDSM. However, his new wife Shizuko (Naomi Tani) refuses to let Senzô tie her up or even watch her bathe; instead he vents his frustrations and needs on their housemaid Haru (Hijiri Abe), forcing her to indulge in his need for S&M. After finding some bondage pornography in Makoto's desk, Senzô summons Makoto to his home, where he first asks, then orders Makoto to kidnap and \"train\" his wife in order to break her pride so that she will submit to his desires. After some hesitation, Makoto agrees.\n\nWhile in town, Senzô drugs Shizuko's tea with sleeping pills, allowing Makoto to leave with her in his vehicle. On the way home Makoto stops in a field and attempts to rape the semi-conscious Shizuko, but his arousal brings on a hallucination of the black soldier he killed, forcing him to stop. At home, Shizuko awakes to find herself tied up and calls for help, attracting the attention of Miyo. Rather than helping the woman, Miyo seems pleased at her son's actions, and encourages him to rape Shizuko. When he says he can't because she is too beautiful, Miyo suggests Makoto give Shizuko an enema to overcome that impression. He does, and after watching her expel it finds he is able to become aroused without issue. He rapes Shizuko while his mother listens outside his room.\n\nMakoto reports his progress to Senzô regularly, providing tapes and even physical evidence of his wife's continued training. However, he also finds himself becoming attached to Shizuko. Makoto returns home one day to find his mother and her staff have been torturing Shizuko while he was at work. He orders them off of her angrily, telling them not to touch her unless he is present. Shizuko finds herself becoming more at ease with her situation and Makoto, and later asks him if he will protect her; he says yes, going on to say he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. He tells his mother this, and when she objects he responds angrily, calling her an old hag.\n\nOne day Makoto returns home to find Shizuko tied up and being used by the black soldier from his dreams. He recoils in horror when the man rises to attack him. His mother then steps in, paying the man, revealing that she staged the scene with a look-alike to render Makoto impotent once more. Makoto tries to have sex with Shizuko again, despairing when he finds that his impotence has returned. Despite this, he keeps training her, even taking her outside for a walk. Taking a chance, he unties her so that she might use the restroom; after a long, worrying delay, Shizuko returns, to the delight of Makoto. Later the two go to watch a pornographic film, which features a black man who resembles the soldier from Makoto's dreams. Uncomfortable at first, Makoto starts to remember his childhood incident in detail, eventually remembering that it was his mother who shot the man, not him. Overjoyed, Makoto calls his mother from a public phone booth to tell her he has remembered the truth, letting her listen as he has sex with Shizuko during the call.\n\nFinally, Senzô arrives to reclaim his wife. Makoto is surprised when Shizuko moves to her husband's side eagerly. He asks her to divorce him so that they might marry, but she refuses, saying that she is now happy since Makoto made her a \"total slut\" just as her husband wanted. However, she offers to let him come with the two of them, and though hesitant, Makoto agrees. Miyo begs her son not to go, but the three pile into Senzô's vehicle and leave, a distraught Miyo running after the vehicle in vain. The film ends with Shizuko bound, being ravaged simultaneously by Senzô and Makoto while Haru watches in shock.\n\n\n\"Flower and Snake\" is considered important more from a historical standpoint than for its artistic merits. The later \"Wife to be Sacrificed\" is more highly regarded by the critics. Oniroku Dan was not happy with the film, but was able to reconcile with Nikkatsu to continue making many more films from his novels, including \"Wife to be Sacrificed.\" Izumi Evers notes that \"Nikkatsu's somewhat innocent approach inadvertently adds comedy,\" but sums up her review of \"Flower and Snake\" with, \"The heroine, who was masochistically trained by men, was actually controlling them the whole time. To me, despite all the humiliations suffered by heroines like Naomi, this is the fundamental truth behind seventies-era Japanese sex films.\" The Weissers call it \"Well-made garbage,\" but add that it is one of the best of Nikkatsu's films in this genre.\n\nMedia Blasters has announced an all-region DVD release of \"Flower and Snake\" on its \"Tokyo Shock\" label, scheduled for August 28, 2007.\n\nThe film was remade with a different plot as \"Flower and Snake\" in 2004, followed by a sequel \"Flower and Snake 2\" in 2005. Both films were directed by Takashi Ishii and starred Aya Sugimoto. Another remake followed in 2010, directed by Yusuke Narita and starring Minako Komukai.\n\n\n"}

At the Coroner's inquisition for treasure trove, held in September of the same year, a police officer identified the find spot as \"33 feet east of a bridge and two feet from the water's edge\". He also identified that a mechanical extractor had recently been working in the area where the sword was found, offering a reason for its unusual discovery. The sword was not declared treasure and became the property of the finder. The finder appeared on the children's television programme \"Blue Peter\" to talk about his discovery and both he and the sword were awarded \"Blue Peter\" badges. \n\nThe sword was purchased at auction by the Yorkshire Museum in 1977.\n\nThe whole sword measures in length, with a maximum width of across the guard. The sword blade is bifacial (double edged) and the hilt is decorated in silver with a combination of geometric and floriate (depicting flowers, leaves and foliage) designs.\n\nThe blade itself measures in length from the guard. It tapers gradually from the guard, where it measures wide. The blade has a shallow fuller along its length and traces of pattern-welding are visible on its surface. The pommel is decorated with strips of silver and five matching strips are visible across the grip.\n\nThe form and decoration of the Gilling sword places it within a group of late Anglo-Saxon swords classified as 'type L'; regarded as typical Anglo-Saxon swords of the Viking period and it has been compared to a similar example from Fiskerton, Lincolnshire. The sword may originally have derived from a grave, which had been disturbed by the mechanical excavator mentioned in the Coroner's report.\n\nThe sword is in the collection of the Yorkshire Museum. It appeared in the exhibition \"The Vikings in England\", which was opened by the Prince of Wales on 30 March 1982 and was seen by over 235,000 visitors before it closed in October of the same year. This exhibition was awarded the European Museum of the Year Special Exhibition Award as a result of the presentation of the exhibition in the Museum and for additional educational projects organised by the curator Elizabeth Hartley.\n\nWhen the Museum was closed in 2010 for a major refurbishment, the Gilling sword (along with the other key objects from the Museum) were displayed at the British Museum. It returned to the Yorkshire Museum for the new exhibition opening on 1 August 2010.\n\nIn 2013 it was included in the permanent medieval exhibition \"Capital of the North\".\n\nFrom 2017 it formed part of a touring exhibition titled 'Viking: Rediscover the Legend' and is displayed alongside the Vale of York Hoard and the Cuerdale Hoard, with the tour starting at the Yorkshire Museum and subsequently including Atkinson Art Gallery and Library in Southport, Norwich Castle Museum, and the University of Nottingham.\n"}

Similar imagery is used in Psalm 23. The Good Shepherd is also discussed in the other gospels, the Epistle to the Hebrews, the First Epistle of Peter and the Book of Revelation.\n\nIn the Gospel of John, Jesus states \"I am the good shepherd\" in two verses, and .\n\nFrom (WEB):\n\nThis passage is one of several sections of John's Gospel which generate division among the Jews:\nJesus Christ is also compared to a shepherd in , , , , , , , , , , and .\n\nSeveral authors such as Tinto, Barbara Reid, Arland Hultgren or Donald Griggs comment that \"parables are noticeably absent from the Gospel of John\". According to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" article on Parables: \"There are no parables in St. John's Gospel\" and according to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" article on Gospel of St. John: \"Here Jesus' teaching contains no parables and but three allegories, the Synoptists present it as parabolic through and through.\"\n\nThe image of the Good Shepherd is the most common of the symbolic representations of Christ found in early Christian art in the Catacombs of Rome, before Christian imagery could be made explicit. The form of the image showing a young man carrying a lamb round his neck was directly borrowed from the much older pagan kriophoros (see below) and in the case of portable statuettes like the most famous one now in the Pio Cristiano Museum, Vatican City (right), it is impossible to say whether the image was originally created with the intention of having a Christian significance. The image continued to be used in the centuries after Christianity was legalized in 313. Initially it was probably not understood as a portrait of Jesus, but a symbol like others used in Early Christian art, and in some cases may also have represented the Shepherd of Hermas, a popular Christian literary work of the 2nd century. However, by about the 5th century, the figure more often took on the appearance of the conventional depiction of Christ, as it had developed by this time, and was given a halo and rich robes, as on the apse mosaic in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano in Rome, or at Ravenna (right). Images of the Good Shepherd often include a sheep on his shoulders, as in the Lukan version of the Parable of the Lost Sheep.\n\nIn ancient Greek cult, kriophoros or \"criophorus\" (Κριοφόρος), the \"ram-bearer\" is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a ram. It becomes an epithet of Hermes: \"Hermes Kriophoros\".\n\nIn two-dimensional art, \"Hermes Kriophoros\" transformed into the Christ carrying a lamb and walking among his sheep: \"Thus we find philosophers holding scrolls or a Hermes Kriophoros which can be turned into Christ giving the Law (Traditio Legis) and the Good Shepherd respectively\". The Good Shepherd is a common motif from the Catacombs of Rome (Gardner, 10, fig 54) and in sarcophagus reliefs, where Christian and pagan symbolism are often combined, making secure identifications difficult.\n\n"}

{"id": "371786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371786", "title": "Iridescence", "text": "Iridescence\n\nIridescence (also known as goniochromism) is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear to gradually change colour as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. Examples of iridescence include soap bubbles, butterfly wings and seashells, as well as certain minerals. It is often created by structural coloration (microstructures that interfere with light).\n\nPearlescence is a related effect where some or all of the reflected light is white, where iridescent effects produce only other colours. The term pearlescent is used to describe certain paint finishes, usually in the automotive industry, which actually produce iridescent effects.\n\nThe word \"iridescence\" is derived in part from the Greek word ἶρις \"îris\" (gen. ἴριδος \"íridos\"), meaning \"rainbow\", and is combined with the Latin suffix \"-escent\", meaning \"having a tendency toward\". Iris in turn derives from the goddess Iris of Greek mythology, who is the personification of the rainbow and acted as a messenger of the gods. \"Goniochromism\" is derived from the Greek words \"gonia\", meaning \"angle\", and \"chroma\", meaning \"colour\".\n\nIridescence is an optical phenomenon of surfaces in which hue changes with the angle of observation and the angle of illumination. It is often caused by multiple reflections from two or more semi-transparent surfaces in which phase shift and interference of the reflections modulates the incidental light (by amplifying or attenuating some frequencies more than others). The thickness of the layers of the material determines the interference pattern. Iridescence can for example be due to thin-film interference, the functional analogue of selective wavelength attenuation as seen with the Fabry–Pérot interferometer, and can be seen in oil films on water and soap bubbles. Iridescence is also found in plants, animals and many other items. The range of colours of natural iridescent objects can be narrow, for example shifting between two or three colours as the viewing angle changes, or a wide range of colours can be observed.\n\nIridescence can also be created by diffraction. This is found in items like CDs, DVDs, some types of prisms, or cloud iridescence. In the case of diffraction, the entire rainbow of colours will typically be observed as the viewing angle changes. In biology, this type of iridescence results from the formation of diffraction gratings on the surface, such as the long rows of cells in striated muscle, or the specialized abdominal scales of peacock spider \"Maratus robinsoni\" and \"M. chrysomelas\". Some types of flower petals can also generate a diffraction grating, but the iridescence is not visible to humans and flower-visiting insects as the diffraction signal is masked by the coloration due to plant pigments.\n\nIn biological (and biomimetic) uses, colours produced other than with pigments or dyes are called structural coloration. Microstructures, often multilayered, are used to produce bright but sometimes non-iridescent colours: quite elaborate arrangements are needed to avoid reflecting different colours in different directions. Structural coloration has been understood in general terms since Robert Hooke's 1665 book \"Micrographia\", where Hooke correctly noted that since the iridescence of a peacock's feather was lost when it was plunged into water, but reappeared when it was returned to the air, pigments could not be responsible. It was later found that iridescence in the peacock is due to a complex photonic crystal.\n\nPearlescence is an effect related to iridescence and has a similar cause. Structures within a surface cause light to be reflected back, but in the case of pearlescence some or all of the light is white. Artificial pigments and paints showing an iridescent effect are often described as pearlescent, for example when used for car paints.\n\nThe feathers of birds such as kingfishers, Birds-of-paradise, hummingbirds, parrots, starlings, grackles, ducks, and peacocks are iridescent. The lateral line on the Neon tetra is also iridescent. A single iridescent species of gecko, \"Cnemaspis kolhapurensis\", was identified in India in 2009. The tapetum lucidum, present in the eyes of many vertebrates, is also iridescent.\n\nMany groups of plants have developed iridescence as an adaptation to use more light in dark environments such as the lower levels of tropical forests. The leaves of Southeast Asia's \"Begonia pavonina\", or peacock begonia, appear iridescent azure to human observers due to each leaf's thinly layered photosynthetic structures called iridoplasts that absorb and bend light much like a film of oil over water. Iridescences based on multiple layers of cells are also found in the lycophyte \"Selaginella\" and several species of ferns.\n\nNanocellulose is sometimes iridescent, as are thin films of gasoline and some other hydrocarbons and alcohols when floating on water.\n\nTo create jewelry with crystal glass that lets light refract in a rainbow spectrum, Swarovski coats some of its products with special metallic chemical coatings and for example, Aurora Borealis, or \"AB\", gives the surface a rainbow appearance. Rainbow anodizing is also possible.\n\nIridescent products in the cosmetic and clothing industries are often referred as being holographic.\n\n"}

{"id": "982228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=982228", "title": "Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe", "text": "Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe\n\nLe Déjeuner sur l'herbe (English: \"The Luncheon on the Grass\") – originally titled Le Bain (\"The Bath\") – is a large oil on canvas painting by Édouard Manet created in 1862 and 1863. It depicts a female nude and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés, where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy. The piece is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the Courtauld Gallery, London.\n\nThe painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young dandies, seem to be engaged in conversation, ignoring the woman. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a still life. In the background, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. Too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, she seems to float above them. The roughly painted background lacks depth, giving the viewer the impression that the scene is not taking place outdoors, but in a studio. This impression is reinforced by the use of broad \"studio\" light, which casts almost no shadows. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.\n\nDespite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 x 104.1 in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious, and mythological subjects. The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of Cabanel or Ingres.\n\nA nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though Émile Zola, a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the Louvre. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently than \"analytic\" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint.\n\nThere is much still not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, exactly how he got the idea, and how and what sort of preparation works he did. Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it actually remained in his possession until 1878 when Jean-Baptiste Faure, opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.\n\nThe figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to \"Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe\". Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be l’île Saint-Ouen, which was just up the Seine from his family property in Gennevilliers. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process. The female nude is thought to be Victorine Meurent, the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of \"Olympia\". The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eugène and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor . Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet’s family portrait.\n\nWhat many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman. Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman’s gaze.\n\nAs with the later \"Olympia\" (1863) and other works, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving \"The Judgment of Paris\" (c. 1515) after a drawing by Raphael. Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the École des Beaux-Arts, where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. \"Le Bain\" (an early title for \"Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe\") was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the Renaissance into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.\n\nScholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet's painting \"Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe\": \"The Pastoral Concert\" by Giorgione or possibly Titian (in the Louvre) and Giorgione's \"The Tempest\", both of which are famous Renaissance paintings. \"The Tempest\", which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet's painting \"Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe.\" \"Pastoral Concert\" even more closely resembles \"Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe,\" as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. \"Pastoral Concert\" is in the collection of the Louvre in Paris and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet.\n\nAccording to Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, \"I copied Giorgione’s women, the women with musicians. It’s black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there.\"\n\nThere may be a connection between \"Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe\" and the work of Jean Antoine Watteau. Manet’s original title, \"Le Bain\", initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau’s \"Le Villageoise\", as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It’s possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his years before his creation of \"Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe\".\n\nThere were many mixed reviews and responses to \"Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe\" when it was first displayed and it continues to yield a variety of responses. The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the Salon des Refusés. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative. \n\nOne interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the Bois de Boulogne, a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting. Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.\n\n\nThough the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end.\n\n\"The Luncheon on the Grass\" is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the Louvre there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience. Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.\n\nZola presents a fictionalised version of the painting and the controversy surrounding it in his novel \"L'Œuvre\" (\"The Masterpiece\").\n\n"}

{"id": "50724609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50724609", "title": "Muisca architecture", "text": "Muisca architecture\n\nThis article describes the architecture of the Muisca. The Muisca, inhabiting the central highlands of the Colombian Andes (Altiplano Cundiboyacense and the southwestern part of that the Bogotá savanna), were one of the four great civilizations of the Americas. Other than the three civilizations in present-day Mexico and Peru; the Aztec, Maya and Incas respectively, they did not construct grand architecture of solid materials. While specialising in agriculture and gold-working, cloths and ceramics, their architecture was rather modest and made of non-permanent materials as wood and clay.\n\nEvidence for the Muisca architecture relies on archaeological excavations performed since the mid 20th century. In recent years larger areas showing evidence of the Early Muisca architecture have been uncovered, the biggest of them in Soacha, Cundinamarca. All of the original houses and temples have been destroyed by the Spanish conquerors and replaced with colonial architecture. Reconstructions of some houses (\"bohíos\") and the most important temple in the Muisca religion; the Temple of the Sun in Sogamoso, called Sugamuxi by the Muisca, have been built in the second half of the 20th century.\n\nImportant scholars who have contributed to the knowledge about the Muisca architecture are Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, who made the first contact with the Muisca, early 17th century friars Pedro Simón and Juan de Castellanos later bishop Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita and modern archaeologists Eliécer Silva Celis, Sylvia Broadbent, Carl Henrik Langebaek and others.\n\nThe Altiplano Cundiboyacense, the high plateau in the Colombian Andes, has been inhabited for at least 12,400 years, with the earliest evidence in El Abra, Tibitó and Tequendama. During this era, the paleoclimate and flora and fauna were different from today. It was the end of the Pleistocene, when stadials and interstadials intercalated and the glaciers in the Eastern Ranges were advancing and retreating. When the first hunter-gatherers arrived from the north (the Caribbean coast and earlier from Central America), they encountered still the Pleistocene megafauna on the highlands; \"Cuvieronius\", \"Stegomastodon\", \"Haplomastodon\" and \"Equus andium\" in particular.\n\nDuring this time and age, as is evidenced in archaeological excavations at various sites on the Altiplano, the people lived in caves and rock shelters. The prehistorical period was followed by the Herrera Period, commonly dated at 800 BCE to 800 CE. It was in this era that the agricultural advancement, that started in the latest preceramic times, caused a change towards population of the plains, away from the caves and rock shelters. This also led to an increase in population which was modest in the early Herrera Period and more pronounced towards the end of it; the start of the Muisca Period at around 800 CE. Further population growth and a more stratified society is observed in archaeological analysis of the Late Muisca Period, from 1200 CE onwards. The first contact with the Muisca happened in 1537 by the troops of conquistador and explorer Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and his brother Hernán.\n\nThe houses of the Muisca, called \"bohíos\" or \"malokas\", were circular structures made of poles of wood and walls of clay, with a conical reed roof. A long beam of wood supported the roof in the centre of the round structure and was attached to the wooden poles. The interior of the roof was decorated with cloths with thin strokes of different colours. On the floor fine straw was placed. Some \"bohíos\", probably those of the \"caciques\" had ceramic floors, as evidenced by findings in Mosquera. This was atypical for the Muisca houses.\n\nAlthough the Spanish chroniclers have reported \"great populations\" of the Muisca territories, the people lived in small settlements, described by the Spanish conquerors as \"dispersed homesteads\". As the Maya people, the Muisca related the smaller settlements with their effective agriculture. Houses on the Bogotá savanna were built on slightly elevated areas to prevent them from floodings of the various rivers, humedales and swamps, characteristic of the area.\nEach community had their own farmlands and hunting grounds surrounding their houses. The houses were constructed around a central square with the house of the \"cacique\" in the centre. Two or more \"gates\" in the \"cercado\" (enclosure) gave access to the village.\nThe exact number of houses in the villages remains unclear and requires more archaeological work. De Quesada described villages of 10 up to 100 houses. \nThe Late Muisca Period, commonly defined as 1200-1537, is characterised by denser population and larger communities, especially in Suba and Cota with more dispersed housing in the vicinity.\n\nExcavations in the Las Delicias neighbourhood of Bogotá, on an alluvial terrace of the Tunjuelito River in 1990, exposed six circular structures of in diameter, which is slightly smaller than living spaces found in other areas, e.g. in Facatativá (). The occupation of these houses has been dated from the start of the Muisca Period until the colonial period. The living space was occupied in two stages, starting from 950 BCE, followed by a next phase dated at 750 BCE. The dating has been done based on carbon, taken from the floors of the area. Ceramics, animal bones, swindles, seeds and jewellery has been found in this location too.\n\nArchaeologist Silva Celis uncovered in 1943 housing structures in Soacha with four different temporal levels with indications of population in the form of ash deposits from fires and animal bones.\n\nVarious scholars agree that the housing of the Muisca was egalitarian; little differentiation between the living spaces of the \"caciques\" and the lower-class people has been found, especially in Soacha.\n\nIt has been described -by Pedro Simón among others- that at the entrance posts of the houses of the \"caciques\" human sacrifice remains were hanging and the posts smeared with blood from the victims, who were regarded as sacred when they were young boys (\"moxas\") or captured from neighbouring indigenous groups. Archaeological evidence from Mosquera supported this thesis.\n\nThe roads of the Muisca people were unpaved, which makes it hard to identify them in archaeological excavations. Some of the roads were trade routes, with the eastern neighbours (Llanos Orientales), in the north with the Guane people and in the west with the Panche and Muzo, others were sacred routes. Examples of holy roads, used for pilgrimages, were found in Guasca and Siecha. Routes communicating Muisca territories with cotton producing areas ran through Somondoco and Súnuba. The roads crossing the mountains surrounding the Altiplano were narrow, making it more difficult for the Spanish conquistadores to cross them, especially with horses. Once they reached the open terrains of the Bogotá savanna, movement became easier.\n\nThe Muisca, as part of their religion, built various temples throughout their territories. The most sacred were the Sun Temple in Sugamuxi and the Moon Temple in Chía. The Sun Temple was built to honour Sué, the Sun god of the Muisca, and the Moon Temple was honouring his wife, Chía. Also notable was the Goranchacha Temple, according to Muisca myths built by Goranchacha. On one of the islands in Lake Fúquene there had been a temple with grand decoration and 100 priests, as described by De Piedrahita.\n\nPedro Simón noted that the temples were built with wood from the \"guayacán\" tree, to make them last long.\n\nAccording to De Piedrahita, the \"moxas\" were raised in the temples to make them as sacred as possible for when they would be sacrificed, which meant a great honour to the families who donated the young boys.\n\nOther structures of the Muisca were mostly religious in character. Apart from their celebrations at natural areas, such as Lake Guatavita, Lake Iguaque, Lake Tota, Lake Fúquene, Lake Suesca and the Siecha Lakes, the Muisca constructed some places where religious ceremonies were held, such as the Cojines del Zaque and the Hunzahúa Well, both in Hunza, present-day Tunja.\n\nAs an exception to the wood-and-clay structures of the houses and temples of the Muisca people, allegedly one of their structures had been made of stone; the fortress of Cajicá, just north of present-day Bogotá. The structure is described with walls of thick and high, but modern scientists have cast doubt on the structure and if it existed in the pre-Columbian era.\n\nThe first construction of post-conquest architecture took place shortly after De Quesada had conquered the city of Bacatá, later called Santafe and known as the capital Bogotá in modern age. At the location of present-day Teusaquillo, twelve houses and a church in the style of the Muisca -with wood and clay- had been constructed.\n\nIt was a general policy of the Spanish, eased by the non-permanent architecture of the Muisca, that existing structures would be taken down and replaced by Spanish colonial architecture.\n\nReconstructions of Muisca \"bohíos\" and the most important temple of Sogamoso, are displayed in the Archaeology Museum in Sogamoso. This work has been done in the early stage of archaeological research on the Altiplano, in the 1940s. Eliécer Silva Celis was the architect and archaeologist involved in the reconstructions.\n\nArchaeological work has been hindered by the constant expansion of the capital Bogotá in which vicinity and territory many ancient structures were built. An archaeological expedition of 2002 proved that within months the previously unoccupied archaeological site was already covered with construction.\n\n\n"}

Among the targets was the intention to enhance the access to and use of digital learning resources in secondary education, and increase the volume and the variety of such resources. Increased volume and diversity were seen as significant conditions for the introduction of free learning material in upper secondary education. The incentive was an amendment imposing the counties to provide free educational material, in print as well as digital, including digital hardware.\n\n20 September 2006 the county chief executives of education agreed to establish a joint project to develop digital subject material for all subjects in secondary education. The project was named Norwegian Digital Learning Arena (NDLA). The preliminary project work started early 2007; all counties except Oslo were parts of the collaboration. The first year the project was fully funded by the Ministry of Education and Research, and on 26 September Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg officially opened Norwegian Digital Learning Arena.

Some of these are:\n\nNDLA cooperates with Khan Academy for translation and organising pages, Norwegian subtitles of videos, Norwegian framework and Norwegian tasks. In addition NDLA has cooperation with the PhET project at the University of Colorado, providing simulations in HTML5 as well as translation and organising of the two forms of Norwegian.\n\nNDLA is developed in the publishing system Drupal 6. The solution was initially created by the developing group Utdanning.no, but further development and operation now lies with the Cerpus group. The core code of the system is open source software; open for anyone aiming to develop digital learning resources. In 2018 NDLA will relaunch on a new technological platform. \n\nIn 2011 NDLA was nominated for European Public Service Award (EPSA). The prize is awarded annually within the EU/EEC area, the ambition is to develop and improve solutions within public and civil administration. NDLA was candidate for the prize with the entry: NDLA Innovation in Acquisition, Development and Distribution of Digital Learning Resources. A total of 274 initiatives were evaluated, and 15 candidates were shortlisted for the prize.\nIn 2014 NDLA won the Boldic Award for its open and innovative web repository at ndla.no. In the jury statement, it was pointed out that NDLA's project strategy and solutions can be scalable across the Nordic and Baltic countries, and that NDLA provides a unique way of working together to promote distance learning and ICT-supported flexible lifelong learning.\nIn 2017 NDLA won the Open Educational Resources Awards for best OER Site.\n\nThe NDLA learning resources are continually evaluated by independent third parties. An external users’ study from 2013 revealed that NDLA was mostly used as supplement to a traditional textbook, and the use was largely managed by the teacher. Students pointed out e-lectures and differentiated tasks as most useful. Both teachers and students emphasized the value of the possibility to differentiate material and tasks designed for students with varying learning capability.\n\nBy publicly inviting tenders NDLA searches the market for digital learning resources to cover the competence aims of the different subject areas. NDLA asks for production services, developing groups of digital learning material, for either parts of, or prospective total solutions for a complete curriculum.\n\nThe responsibility for the editorial work, organising, meta-tagging, and putting together the material in the respective subject areas lies with competent editing groups recruited from upper secondary schools in the counties. The contents of each site are quality controlled by academy and university expertise, or otherwise specialists in that particular field. All the core material is published in the two forms of Norwegian.\n\nWhen the demand is not met by the supply, the editing groups will produce their own material. The publishing companies are invited to collaborate in every round of purchase, and are free to make an offer of their material that will benefit their interests.\n\nThe basic income of NDLA rests on a joint contribution from the part-taking counties, of NOK 400, - per student, which constitutes an annual income of estimated NOK 64 mill. In 2013 this figure was lower due to Akershus’ leaving the project. 66% of NDLA’s net expenses in 2013 were spent on purchase in the market.\n\nIn 2010 NDLA was indicted by the Norwegian Publishers' Association before the European Surveillance Authority (ESA). The publishers claimed that the state funding of more than NOK 150 mill did not comply with the international regulation of financial state support, and represented an obstacle to the establishing of a free market for digital learning resources.\n\nThe indictment was initially rejected by the EFTA Surveillance Authority on 12 October 2011, but in December 2012 the dismissal was set aside by the EFTA Court after an appeal from the Publishers’ Association. In March 2013 the EFTA Court announced a formal investigation of the funding of NDLA, and ESA reopened the case. After a close examination ESA reached the same conclusion; the funding of NDLA is in compliance with the rules of state funding.\n"}

M. W. Turner.\n\nThe painting was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1844, though it may have been painted earlier. It is now in the collection of the National Gallery, London.\n\nThe Great Western Railway (GWR) was one of a number of private British railway companies created to develop the new means of transport. The location of the painting is widely accepted as Maidenhead Railway Bridge, across the River Thames between Taplow and Maidenhead. The view is looking east towards London. The bridge was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and completed in 1838. A hare runs along the track in the bottom right of the painting, possibly symbolising speed itself. Some think this is a reference to the limits of technology. Others believe the animal is running in fear of the new machinery and Turner meant to hint at the danger of man's new technology destroying the inherent sublime elements of nature.\n\n\n"}

It is directed by first-time director Siddharth Anand and produced by Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra under the Yash Raj Films banner. The film stars Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta in their fourth film together. Arshad Warsi, Tania Zaetta and Jugal Hansraj appear in supporting roles. Released on 9 September 2005, it was the first Indian movie to be filmed entirely in Australia.\n\nThe film tells the story of two young and modern Indians, Nick and Ambar, who have left their homes Australian to make a life on their own in Melbourne, Australia. The story follows one year of their lives, dealing with their problems and relationships, from their first meeting at a wedding ceremony, to their decision to move in together without marriage, to their break-up upon discovering that Ambar is pregnant.\n\n\"Salaam Namaste\" became one of the biggest box-office hits of 2005 in India, as well as India's biggest hit in the overseas market that year. On 24 September 2005, the script of the film was invited to be included in the Margaret Herrick Library, which is operated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Zinta received several nominations for her role from various film awards, such as the Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, Star Screen Awards and Zee Cine Awards.\n\nNikhil \"Nick\" Arora (Saif Ali Khan) and Ambar \"Amby\" Malhotra (Preity Zinta) are two progressive, young Indians who have left India to live in Melbourne, Australia. Nick was originally sent abroad to become an architect, but his real passion is cooking. After graduating, he designs a restaurant, which he ultimately takes over and becomes the head chef. His job allows him to have a laid-back lifestyle and get up late in the morning, both aspects that he values very much. While living at home in Bangalore, Ambar had rejected more than a dozen marriage proposals. Her parents suspected that she did not want to get married, but she denied this. She arrived in Australia for a one-year foreign exchange program and decided to stay and become a surgeon. After hearing this, her parents disowned her. To pay for her education, she works as a R.J. at a local radio station, 'Salaam Namaste'.\n\nNick is scheduled to do an interview for Salaam Namaste, but he oversleeps and irritated Ambar insults him on the air. Another interview is arranged but Nick oversleeps again and he is, once again, insulted by Ambar for being late. \n\nNick is the caterer for a wedding attended by Ambar. His best friend Ranjan (Ron) (Arshad Warsi) falls in love with Ambar's best friend Cathy (Tania Zaetta) at the wedding. Nick also feels a connection with Ambar, although they have no idea who the other really is. Nick tells Ambar he is an architect and Amber tells him that she is a Student of Medicine. Ron and Cathy hastily marry the next day and Nick and Ambar discover each other's true identities. Nick gives the interview on Salaam Namaste, where he states, publicly, that he loves Ambar. Nick and Ambar become friends and eventually move in together and fall in love. They both make love. A few months later, Ambar discovers she is pregnant, and they decide to end the pregnancy. Nick takes her to get an abortion, but she cannot go through with it. The pair fight and then break up.\n\nOver the next five months, they have several comical disagreements. Nick finds a restaurant to buy, but the loan is disapproved as he cannot afford the down payment, since he spent all his money on the house he shares with Ambar. This results in another argument during which the baby kicks for the first time and Nick realises he still loves Ambar. Ambar asks Nick to take a blood test, because she has thalassemia minor, and if he has the disease too then there will be complications. At the hospital, the couple discovers that Ambar is carrying twins. On the way home, Nick realises that he had left Ambar alone through the whole pregnancy, when she needed him the most. He decides to commit to Ambar and his unborn children, and goes to buy an engagement ring. At the store, he sees Ambar trying on rings with her friend, Jignesh (Jugal Hansraj). Nick believes that Ambar is marrying Jignesh and is devastated. In a drunken haze, he takes home a drunk girl from the bar named Stella. The next morning, an annoyed Stella tells Nick that all he did the previous night was cry over Ambar. Nick is greatly relieved, but Ambar sees Stella in the bedroom and assumes that they have slept together, and she leaves in a rage. Nick discovers that Ambar was trying on rings for Jignesh's girlfriend, Tina. He searches for Ambar with the help of many devoted Salaam Namaste listeners. He finds her and apologises, but Ambar's water breaks, and they rush to the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, Ron is there with Cathy, who's giving birth as well, and the nurse turns out to be Stella. She tells Ambar that Nick didn't do anything the previous night and is in love with Ambar, who finally realises Nick's love for her. They then meet the obstetrician Dr. Vijay (Abhishek Bachchan), who turns out to be a very comical and incompetent doctor, but manages to deliver the children. Ambar gives birth to twins and Nick proposes to her to which she joyously agrees.\n\n\nSeveral people made cameos in the film. Abhishek Bachchan is the narrator and makes a special appearance as a doctor towards the end. Director Siddharth Anand makes an appearance as the taxi driver towards the end. The mother and son in the bookshop Saif Ali Khan's character visits, are actor Arshad Warsi's wife and son, Maria Goretti and Zeke. Preity Zinta's then-boyfriend, Ness Wadia, makes an appearance as the man reading the newspaper beside whom Preity sits on the bus.\n\nThe film has seven songs composed by the duo Vishal-Shekhar. The music of the film released on 10 August 2005. The music includes four songs and two remixes. Lyrics are penned by Jaideep Sahni. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 14,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.\n\nPopular Bollywood website Bollywood Hungama rated \"Salaam Namaste\" 3 out of 5 stars. The film received mostly positive reviews.\n\n\n"}

It is carved into a northwest-facing cliff-face beside a steep path leading down to the Lamos. A ford at this spot connected the ancient settlement of Efrenk on the hill south of the relief with Veyselli on the other side of the Lamos. The route continued on to the settlement at the mouth of the Lamos, Antiochia Lamotis (now Limonlu). After passing the relief, the route led south past Sömek towards Canbazlı and Olba, as well as Korykos and Elaiussa Sebaste on the Mediterranean coast. The river Lamos is often treated as the border between the ancient regions of Rough Cilicia (\"Kilikia Tracheia\") in the west and Flat Cilicia (\"Kilikia Pedias\") in the east.\n\nThe Athena relief of Sömek is roughly 600 m to the southeast.\n\nThe relief is carved into a vertical cliff-face about 5 m above street level. It is 1.9 m high and depicts a warrior, surrounded by a naiskos. The legs are badly damaged; the right leg supports his weight, while the left leg hangs free. His raised right arm holds up a spear. On his left side he wears a sword, with his left hand on the grip. He is dressed in a short, belted chiton, with clearly carved drapery. There are traces of white paint on the relief in several spaces - between the head and the right arm, for instance, there are traces of red paint. Paint very rarely survives on Cilician cliff reliefs.\n\nOn the left pilaster there is an inscription at about chest height, which has been resolved as an 8 line inscription:\n\nJosef Keil and Adolf Wilhelm report the illegible traces of an \"actual funerary inscription in the background on the left and right sides of the figure's head.\" The letter forms date the inscription to the middle of the Imperial period, while similarities in posture and clothing led Serra Durugönül to date the relief to the second century AD when she studied the Cilician cliff reliefs in the 1980s.\n\nThe first short description (with an incomplete reading of the inscription) was published by Edward L. Hicks in 1891 in his \"Inscriptions from Western Cilicia\". The ancient historians Keil and Wilhelm travelled Cilicia in 1891 and 1925, publishing an account in 1931, \"Denkmäler aus dem Rauhen Kilikien\" (Monuments of Rough Cilicia), in which the relief of Efrenk is described with a fuller reading of the inscription. In 1989 Serra Durugönül completed a dissertation, \"Die Felsreliefs im Rauhen Kilikien\" (The Cliff-reliefs of Rough Cilicia), which also discusses the warrior relief.\n\n"}
