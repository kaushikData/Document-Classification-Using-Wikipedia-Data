The school was founded in 1934 by Helen Corning Warden and is located at 1920 Spruce Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, few people could afford any kind of higher education, especially the long and costly training needed for a career in opera. Recognizing this difficulty, Helen Corning Warden, a prominent member of Philadelphia society, set out to establish a school where talented singers could receive highest quality training without having to suffer the financial burdens that such an education would normally entail. Encouraged by voice teacher Edgar Milton Cooke, Mrs. Warden and a group of her friends set out to establish a school for professional singers that would provide tuition-free education.\n\nFor more than six decades, gifted singers have come from throughout the world to seek training. Many current and former teachers, such as Sidney Dietch, Nicola Moscona, Giovanni Consiglio, Louis Quilico, Benita Valente, Nell Rankin, Bill Schuman and William Stone, have had highly successful careers. Admission into AVA's four-year program is highly competitive, with approximately 28 singers enrolled in any given year. Today, AVA is the only tuition-free institution dedicated exclusively to the study of voice.\n\nHelen Corning Warden served as the Academy's chairperson until her death. She was succeeded by her daughter, Adele Warden Paxson, who was followed by her daughter, Sally Paxson Davis. Since 1977, Christofer Macatsoris has held the position of music director. Baritone and 1983 alum K. James McDowell has served as president and artistic director since 1987.\n\nThe program of training offered by the Academy of Vocal Arts is centered on one-on-one repertoire coaching with a faculty of conductors and coaches and a weekly voice lesson with one of AVA's esteemed voice instructors. The program also includes French, German and Italian language classes, movement & dance, stagecraft and stage combat classes, history of opera & care of the professional voice seminars, and professional development coaching through private classes and workshops. AVA mounts four operatic productions each year featuring resident artists in leading and supporting roles, produced and directed by visiting professional directors with full orchestra. Additionally, chamber music recitals, a sacred music concert and an annual vocal competition feature in the Academy's season. Resident artists are given opportunities to audition for visiting companies from the US and Europe as well as international agents and managers. The Academy of Vocal Arts is also unique among training institutions in offering all residents merit-based fellowships to help offset the cost of living expenses while attending AVA.\n\nNotable alumni of the school include: Lando Bartolini, Burak Bilgili, Gwendolyn Bradley, Stephen Costello, Joyce DiDonato, Michael Fabiano, Othalie Graham, Eglise Gutiérrez, Bryan Hymel, Angela Meade, Latonia Moore, James Morris, Ailyn Pérez, Seymour Schwartzman, Gregory Stapp, Ruth Ann Swenson, Richard Troxell, James Valenti, and Beverly Wolff.\n\nMany AVA alumni have national and international careers as operatic soloists. From 2009 to 2012, every recipient of the Richard Tucker Award was an AVA graduate. Current resident artists have been selected as grand final winners of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions every year since 2011. Each year since 2012, the Metropolitan Opera's Beverly Sills Award has been awarded to an AVA alumnus.\n"}

In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent through its pronunciation (, approximately \"an-tee-gon\").\n\nThe play was first performed in Paris at the Théâtre de l'Atelier on February 6, 1944, during the Nazi occupation. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regard to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation are clear, however.\n\nThe play received its British première by the Old Vic Theatre Company at the New Theatre, London, on 10 February 1949. The production was produced by Laurence Olivier (who also played the role of Chorus) and had the following cast:\n\n\nActress Katharine Cornell produced and starred in a 1946 production at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.

The production was staged by Cornell's husband Guthrie McClintic. The translation was by Lewis Galantière. It has since been published many times.\n\nThere was an English-language television production in 1959 starring Dorothy Tutin.\n\nIn 1974, an American television production of the play, presented on PBS, starred Geneviève Bujold and Stacy Keach.\n\nThere have also been more recent English translations by Barbara Bray in 2009 () and by Jeremy Sams in 2002 ().\n"}

The channel was launched on 19 September 2008 and is on-air for up to seven hours a day. The name \"\" is the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland. The station is unique in that it is the first channel to be delivered under a BBC licence by a partnership and is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland.\n\nThe channel is available in Scotland via Freeview, and throughout the UK on Sky, Freesat, Virgin Media, BBC iPlayer, and TVPlayer. BBC Alba has an average viewership of 637,000 adults over the age of 16 in Scotland each week. BBC Alba got 4.1 million views on BBC iPlayer between 2012–2013.\n\nIn 2007, the BBC Trust opened a consultation for a Gaelic digital service in partnership with the Gaelic Media Service. Following the BBC Trust consultation in November 2007, the Audience Council Scotland recommended their support for the creation of the service on 7 December 2007, stating that the Trust should pursue carriage of the service on digital terrestrial television and that existing \"gaelic zone\" programming on BBC Scotland should remain after the launch. On 28 January 2008, the BBC Trust gave the go-ahead for a Gaelic channel.\n\nThe channel began broadcasting on satellite at 9:00 pm on 19 September 2008 with a launch video featuring a new rendition of the Runrig song, '. The first part of a live céilidh from Skye, presented by Mary Ann Kennedy, was followed by a specially produced comedy drama entitled ' (Elvis), starring Greg Hemphill as Elvis Presley, at 9:30 pm. The channel's first independent commission, ' (\"Peter Manuel - The End of Evil?\"), a drama documentary produced by STV Productions, was shown at 10:30 pm before the opening night closed with the second half of the live celidh from Skye. The launch night was simulcast on BBC Two Scotland between 9:00 pm and 10:30 pm and there was a launch event held at the National Museum of Scotland, which was recorded by the channel's news service '.\n\nA study carried out for the channel indicated that 650,000 people watched BBC Alba per week in the first two months of broadcasting, in spite of only being available to around a third of Scots. After being subject to a review by the BBC Trust and a recommendation from the Audience Council Scotland in 2009, a plan was announced to broadcast the channel on Freeview, in Scotland only, from the digital switchover (2010) under the proviso that reach of the service extended beyond the core Gaelic audience to 250,000. This was approved on 27 December 2010 by the BBC Trust and the service launched on Freeview on 8 June 2011. The channel also launched on Virgin Media (Scotland only) on 18 May 2011, and was made available nationwide on the Virgin Media and Sky platforms, the former on 6 November 2012.\n\nBBC Alba is broadcast for up to seven hours a day in the United Kingdom on satellite platforms Sky and Freesat, cable provider Virgin Media and on digital terrestrial provider Freeview in Scotland only. Programmes are also available to watch on the internet live through services including the BBC iPlayer and some programmes are available for seven days after broadcast on this service and on catch up services of some other services.\n\nThe channel is financed from the BBC Scotland budget and by MG Alba, which itself is financed by the Scottish Government and UK Government. The BBC spent £8 million on the channel, of which £5 million was used for programming, in 2011/12 MG Alba applies the majority of its budget (£12.4 million in 2008/09) to the Gaelic Digital Service.\n\nBBC Alba has four studios across Scotland, located in Stornoway, Glasgow, Inverness and Portree. Continuity and channel management is based in Stornoway while the news services are based in Inverness. A short pre-recorded information program called \"\" is sent from Stornoway and is played out at 7:55 pm daily. BBC Scotland's headquarters at Pacific Quay in Glasgow is used to transmit the programmes. The First Minister, Alex Salmond opened the new BBC Alba studio in Portree in August 2008 where he recorded a message for the launch of BBC Alba.\n\nBBC Alba combines television, radio and on-line programme content, and is anticipated to have a positive impact at many levels including increasing artistic and technical skills, extending economic opportunities, stimulating parents' interest in Gaelic medium education, appealing to and serving the adult learners and strengthening Gaelic usage in extremely important media. It holds significant potential to assist with the development of positive attitudes to the acquisition and transmission of Gaelic. BBC Alba broadcasts more Scottish sport than any other channel, with over three hours a week of football, rugby and shinty. In addition, the station also broadcasts a live news programme for 30 minutes every weekday.\n\nMG Alba and the BBC have announced that around ninety minutes of television content daily will be new material. Output on the station consists of news, current affairs, sport, drama, documentary, entertainment, education, religion and children's programming, broadcast on most days between 5 pm and 12 am. Sport programmes began on Saturday 20 September 2008 and news services on Monday 22 September 2008.\n\nChildren's programmes are shown for two hours every weekday, between 17:00 and 19:00. Current affairs series ' and children's magazine show ' are broadcast on Thursday nights on BBC Alba and also continue to be shown on BBC Two Scotland at their usual timeslots on Thursdays.\n\nA nightly half-hour news programme, ', is aired on weeknights at 8:00 pm with newsreaders Angela Maclean and Iain Maclean. Radio Personality of the Year, Derek 'Pluto' Murray, is their resident sports reporter. ' on Saturday nights features weekly coverage of a selected SPL match. ' broadcasts one live Magners League rugby union game a week, involving one of the competition's Scottish teams. A Gaelic-learning programme, \"Speaking our Language\" is re-broadcast on weeknights at 7:30 pm. Former ' reporter, Derek Mackay hosts a weekly chat show, ', on Sunday nights. So far two series of current affairs documentary ' has been commissioned as of 2010, which is sometimes presented by Donald MacSween.\n\nBBC Alba also fund new programming, such as \"Fraochy Bay\".\n\nMost of the adult programming on BBC Alba contains on-screen English subtitles. For logistical reasons, live broadcasts (including the news) are not subtitled, although certain events (e.g. the annual Hogmanay broadcast \"\") have scripted elements that are subtitled, while interviews and ad-libbed lines are not.\n\nChildren's programmes are not subtitled. Controversially, no English dialogue on the channel is subtitled into Gaelic.\n\nBBC Alba concentrates on three sports: football, rugby and shinty.\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, the station broadcast one full Scottish Premier League game every Saturday night. The game selected was always one not covered by either live Sky Sports or on an on-demand basis by BT Vision and was shown three hours after the end of the match. The matches only included Gaelic commentary along with English subtitles.\n\nThe channel reached an agreement with the Scottish Football League to broadcast live football games during the 2008–09 season. This began with the final of the Challenge Cup, which was also sponsored by MG Alba. BBC Alba then started broadcasting First Division games, beginning with the match between Airdrie United and Clyde on 22 February 2009.\n\nBBC Alba also struck a deal with the Scottish rugby authorities to show one live rugby, Scottish Premiership Division One match every weekend.\n\nFor the 2015-16 season, BBC Alba will show 20 live matches (excluding Rangers) from either 2015-16 Scottish Championship (including the play-off final), League 1 or League 2 as well as four matches from the Scottish Challenge Cup. The station also altered their coverage of Scottish Premiership highlights, showing one hour highlights of two non-televised matches on a Saturday and Sunday night at 22:00. Other football coverage includes all Scotland U21s and Women's matches. As well as the final of the 2015-16 Scottish Junior Cup.\n\nIn 2010 BBC Alba bought the rights for Celtic League rugby jointly with public service broadcasters from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\nA number of independent companies have been commissioned to produce content for the channel, or have productions currently airing. These include:\n\n\nThe Gaelic community, including writers , Angus Peter Campbell, Lisa Storey and musician Allan MacDonald, have criticised the non-availability of Gaelic subtitles, and the emphasis on English language interviews and reportage in the channel's content for adults. Writers and authors were reported by the BBC Gaelic news service as setting up a campaign, GAIDHLIG.TV, to increase Gaelic content on Alba. The decision to introduce 'red button facilities' to allow viewers to switch to English language sports commentary, first announced in August 2014 for rugby and the Guinness Pro12 series, was heavily criticised by the Gaelic community. The criticism resulted in MG Alba announcing publicly in the West Highland Free Press that the 'red button option' for English language commentary would not expand to other sports or areas of the channel.\n\nBetween its launch in September 2008 and the beginning of 2010, the BBC Alba channel lost a third of its viewers, but its number of viewers remains five times larger than the size of the Gaelic speech community in Scotland (just over 58,000). The historian Michael Fry has argued that many of its viewers only watch it for the football coverage, because \"you don't need Gaelic to watch football\", and that in this way the channel is \"cheating\". The model is, however, both common and intentional as it is on comparable channels such as the Irish language channel TG4, the Basque broadcaster EITB or the Welsh channel S4C. In Europe, these channels' main mission is not commercial, but the promotion of the original languages.\n\nSome criticism had been levied over the channel's addition to Freeview, primarily due to the BBC's original plan (with acceptance from the BBC Executive) to remove all 13 BBC Radio channels from Freeview for Scottish viewers over the period that BBC Alba will be shown on Freeview (between 5 pm and midnight); however the criticism has not been directed at the BBC's decision to extend BBC Alba to Freeview in principle. On 19 May 2011, it was reported that the BBC has backed down on the plans, after the BBC had \"managed to reengineer facilities\" to allow BBC Radio 1Xtra, 5 Live and 6 Music to continue to broadcast on a 24-hour basis. The three stations were chosen because they have the highest evening audience ratings on digital television of the seven BBC radio stations unavailable on FM radio.\nOn 2 December 2013, it was confirmed that more radio stations were made available 24 hours in Scotland, but with some trade-offs. BBC Radio 4, 4 Extra, 5 Live Sports Extra, BBC Radio Scotland and BBC Asian Network were restored, but as noted in the blog with some technical trade-offs, such as mono audio rather than stereo during the evenings on the radio stations mentioned and the audio bit rate of the TV channels in Scotland on Freeview reduced to 192kbit/s from 256kbit/s.\n\n\n"}

Bellsybabble has variously been called a poly-language, a pluridialectal idiom and a ludic creation.\n\nFor Giorgio Melchiori, it is suggestive of the idea that in literary texts, there is not a single language, but a multitude of languages, a different one for each reader of the text. It has been compared with the language of Joyce's novel \"Finnegans Wake\", and has also provided the inspiration for C. George Sandulescu's study of \"Finnegans Wake\", entitled \"The Language of the Devil\".\n\nLinguist John Haiman compares Bellsybabble to ordinary language in the way it continually shapes, and is in turn shaped by, the utterances spoken within it. This challenges the rigid separation between code and message. On one hand, the language determines the presupposed content and boundaries of possible messages, as shown by the concept of linguistic relativity. On the other hand, the message may also affect the code used by that very message.\n"}

() is a global fashion brand based in Ponzano Veneto, Italy. The name comes from the Benetton family, who founded the company in 1965. Benetton has a network of about 5,000 stores in the main international markets.\n\nIn 1963, Luciano Benetton, the oldest of four children, was a 30-year-old salesman in Treviso. His initial small collection of sweaters received a positive response in local stores in the Veneto region, and soon after he asked his sister and two younger brothers, Gilberto and Carlo, to join him. In 1965, the entity known as the \"Benetton Group\" was formed.\n\nIn 1965, the Benettons opened their first store in Belluno and three years after in Paris, with Luciano as chairman, his brother Gilberto in charge of administration, their younger brother Carlo running production, and Giuliana as a chief designer.\n\nThe company's core business remains their clothing lines: United Colors of Benetton, and Sisley.\n\nThe Group has a network of about 5,000 stores around the world.\n\nThe company is known for sponsorship of a number of sports, and for the provocative and original \"United Colors\" publicity campaign. The latter originated when photographer Oliviero Toscani was given \"carte blanche\" by the Benetton management. Under Toscani's direction, ads were created that contained striking images unrelated to any actual products being sold by the company.\n\nUp to 1982, Benetton marketing campaigns relied on traditional models wearing the brand clothing. In 1982, the company decided to change its advertising campaigns by focusing on world issues to raise awareness and create an added value for the brand. In 1984, Oliviero Toscani photographed the first multiracial ad for the brand.\n\nThese graphic, billboard-sized ads included depictions of a variety of shocking subjects, one of which featured a deathbed scene of a man (AIDS activist David Kirby) dying from AIDS. Others included a bloodied, unwashed newborn baby with umbilical cord still attached, which was highly controversial. This 1991 advert prompted more than 800 complaints to the British Advertising Standards Authority during 1991 and was featured in the reference book \"Guinness World Records 2000\" as 'Most Controversial Campaign'. Others included a black stallion covering a white mare, close-up pictures of tattoos reading \"HIV Positive\" on the bodies of men and women, a cemetery of many cross-like tombstones, a collage consisting of genitals of persons of various races, a priest and nun about to engage in a romantic kiss, pictures of inmates on death row, an electric chair, an advert showing a dark-skinned boy with hair shaped into the devil's horns, three different hearts with \"black\", \"white\" and \"yellow\" written onto them (from March 1996), and a picture of a bloodied T-shirt and pants riddled with bullet holes from a soldier killed in the Bosnian War (appeared in February 1994). Most of the advertisements, although not all, had a plain white background, and in most the company's logo served as the only text accompanying the image.\n\nIn autumn 2011, Benetton launched its new worldwide communication campaign, an invitation to the leaders and citizens of the world to combat the \"culture of hatred\", and created the UNHATE Foundation. This campaign was created as the group's corporate social responsibility strategy and not as a cosmetic exercise. The Benetton Group “seeks to contribute to the creation of a new culture against hate”. Benetton's Fabrica research centre partnered up with 72andSunny to create the UNHATE poster series. According to Benetton “These are symbolic images of reconciliation—with a touch of ironic hope and constructive provocation—to stimulate reflection on how politics, faith and ideas, even when they are divergent and mutually opposed, must still lead to dialogue and mediation”. 72andSunny adds “United Colors of Benetton returns to the cultural conversation with a simple and powerful message of tolerance: UNHATE. Hate and love are often in a delicate and unstable balance. This campaign promotes a shift in the balance”. However, these posters of the lip-locking political and religious figures have sparked controversy. In addition, Benetton released an advertisement that displayed President Barack Obama of the United States and President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela kissing.\n\nOn 17 November 2011, The Vatican announced that it would take legal action against Benetton after the company used a photo purportedly showing Pope Benedict XVI kissing Ahmed Mohamed el Tayeb, the imam of the Al Azhar mosque in Egypt. Benetton responded: \"We reiterate that the meaning of this campaign is exclusively to combat the culture of hatred in all its forms,\" said a Benetton Group spokesman. \"We are therefore sorry that the use of the image of the Pope and the Imam has so offended the sentiments of the faithful. In corroboration of our intentions, we have decided, with immediate effect, to withdraw this image from every publication.\"\n\nIn November 2017, UCB launched a campaign in collaboration with Devbhumi, a registered company owned by rural women from remote villages in Uttarakhand state of India. The initiative claims to empower over 6,000 rural women artisans across India.\n\nBenetton Group entered Formula One as a sponsor of Tyrrell in , then Alfa Romeo in ; this arrangement was extended to both Alfa and Toleman in . Benetton Formula Ltd. was formed at the end of 1985 when the Toleman and Spirit teams were sold to the Benetton family. The team saw its greatest success under Flavio Briatore, who managed the team from to . Michael Schumacher won his first Drivers' Championships with the team in and , and the team won their only Constructors' title in 1995. From , the team raced under an Italian licence although it continued to be based, like Toleman, in Oxfordshire in England. The team was bought by Renault for US$120 million in and was rebranded Renault F1 in 2002.\n\nIn 1979, Benetton first sponsored their (then amateur) local rugby team, A.S. Rugby Treviso. Benetton Rugby has since become a major force in Italian rugby, with 11 league titles and supplying many players to the national team. Benetton Group has also sponsored Treviso Basket (1982–2012) and Sisley Volley (1987–2012).\n\nBenetton has faced criticism from Mapuche organizations over its purchase of traditional Mapuche lands in Patagonia. The Curiñanco-Nahuelquir family was evicted from their land in 2002 following Benetton's claim to it, but the land was restored in 2007. The company have published a position statement regarding the Mapuche in Patagonia.\n\nBenetton aroused suspicion when they considered using RFID tracking chips on clothes to monitor inventory. A boycott site alleges the tracking chips \"can be read from a distance and used to monitor the people wearing them.\" Issues of consumer privacy were raised and the plan was shelved. Benetton's position on RFID technology is also available on their website.\n\nPETA launched a boycott campaign against Benetton for buying wool from farmers who practiced mulesing. Benetton has since agreed to buy nonmulesed wool and has further urged the wool industry to adopt the PETA and Australian Wool Growers Association agreement to end mulesing. Benetton's position statement on the mulesing controversy is available on their website.\n\nOn 24 April 2013, the eight-storey \"Rana Plaza\" commercial building collapsed outside Dhaka that housed one of the factories where Benetton makes its clothing. At least 1,130 people died. Benetton first denied reports linking production of their clothing at the factory, but clothes and documents linked to Benetton were discovered at the disaster site. Of the 29 brands identified as having sourced products from the Rana Plaza factories, only nine attended meetings held in November 2013 to agree a proposal on compensation to the victims. Several companies refused to sign including Walmart, Carrefour, Bonmarché, Mango, Auchan and Kik. The agreement was signed by Primark, Loblaw, Bonmarche and El Corte Ingles. A year after the collapse, Benetton faced international protests after failing to pay any compensation to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund. Protests included shutting down Benetton's flagship Oxford Street store in London.\n\nOn April 2015, Benetton Group announced that it has doubled compensation for Rana Plaza victims recommended by independent assessors (PWC AND WRAP) and applied the principles of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety to global suppliers. Benetton's engagement for Bangladesh is available on their website.\n\n"}
{"id": "9490727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9490727", "title": "BioArt", "text": "BioArt\n\nBioArt is an art practice where humans work with live tissues, bacteria, living organisms, and life processes. Using scientific processes such as biotechnology (including technologies such as genetic engineering, tissue culture, and cloning) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or artists' studios. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to \"living forms\", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences.\n\nAlthough BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about ethical, social, and aesthetic inquiry. The phrase \"BioArt\" was coined by Eduardo Kac in 1997 in relation to his artwork \"Time Capsule\". Although it originated at the end of the 20th century, through the works of pioneers like Joe Davis, Marta de Menezes and the artists hosted by Symbiotica, BioArt is more widely practiced now.\n\nBioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous. One survey of the field, \"Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing\", puts it this way: \"BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see.\"\n\nWhile raising questions about the role of science in society, \"most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes.\"\n\nWhile most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value. This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to.\n\nThe laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required. Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue.\n\nMuch of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism.\n\nIn 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic GFP bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. \"The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green.\"\n\nThe Tissue Culture & Art Project in collaboration with Stelarc grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells. The project was carried out at Symbiotica: the Art & Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, University of Western Australia.\n\nThe scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in microbial art which by definition is made of microbes. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences. Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design. This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin, and BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples.\n\nBioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics. \"USA Today\" reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.\n\nAlka Chandna, a senior researcher with PETA in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. \"Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic.\"\n\nHowever, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as \"Victimless Leather\" by Symbiotica. \"An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings.\"\n\n\n"}

Professionals target high-priced books and books that are easily resold, such as college textbooks.\n\nIn addition to shoplifting, thievery also has been due to pilfering by shipping personnel and burglary. Book stores also are victimized by thefts of merchandise and other items aside from books. At Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, someone attempted to steal a security camera. At the Boulder Bookshop in Boulder, Colorado, prints hung in the bathroom and plants have been stolen.\n\nOwners of small, independent book stores have said they find shoplifting particularly bothersome. According to Paul Constant, a Seattle book-store employee, \"I know a few booksellers who have literally been driven a little bit crazy at the thought of their inventory evaporating out the door, and with good reason: An overabundance of shoplifters can put bookstores out of business. One local bookstore owner can famously talk about shoplifters with total strangers for hours, with the detail and passion that some people reserve for sexual conquests.\"\n\n\"Shoplifting is a particular problem,\" said Patricia Van Osdol, owner of Wellington Books in Portland, Oregon. \"It can be disastrous in a small store like this.\"\n\nAccording to several sources, in the United States certain books, or books by certain authors, are much more likely to be stolen than others, although there are no hard statistics on the subject.\n\nRon Rosenbaum, an author and \"New York Observer\" columnist, wrote in 1999 that Barnes & Noble had a list of these authors whose books are the most frequently stolen from that book-store chain (or perhaps the Union Square store in the chain, where his source, \"a helpful clerk\", worked): Martin Amis, Paul Auster, Georges Bataille, William S. Burroughs, Italo Calvino, Raymond Chandler, Michel Foucault, Dashiell Hammett, Jack Kerouac, Jeanette Winterson, but none more frequently than books by Charles Bukowski.\n\nIn 2008, Constant gave this list, which he called \"pretty much the authoritative top five, the New York Times best-seller list of stolen books\": Bukowski, Jim Thompson, Philip K. Dick, and Burroughs, along with \"any graphic novel\". Constant wrote that other popular targets are books by Hunter S. Thompson and the Beats, Chuck Palahniuk, Haruki Murakami, and Mark Z. Danielewski, and the most-stolen books tend to be a steady group with little variation over time. As of late 2009, Danielewski's \"House of Leaves\" was the most frequently stolen book from Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, California, according to a store manager there.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"The Virgin Suicides\" by Jeffrey Eugenides was the most-shoplifted book, according to a January 2008 article in \"The Telegraph\".\n\nSt. Mark's Bookshop (which closed in 2016) in the East Village of Manhattan, like Barnes & Noble, used to move frequently-stolen titles behind the counter. At that bookstore, as of late 2009, the books behind the counter included works by Amis, Bukowski, Burroughs, Raymond Carver, Don DeLillo and Jack Kerouac. Sometimes the staff moves books back to the shelves with the idea that a book's popularity for theft may lessen over time. \"Amis went out and came right back,\" a store manager told a writer for \"The New York Times.\n\nAccording to Rosenbaum, \"[I]f you look at who's actually doing the shoplifting, they're not really down-and-out, lower-depths types but like to pose as being down and out, and shoplifting is part of the aura.\" Constant wrote, \"[F]iction that young white men read, and self-satisfied young white men, the kind who love to \"stick it to the man\", are the majority of book shoplifters.\"\n\nPublic libraries have a much different set of frequently stolen books. In the United States, how-to books are more often the targets of thieves, as are books about witchcraft, the occult, UFOs or astrology, according to Larra Clark, a spokeswoman for the American Library Association, who asked members which books were most often stolen. Of the 70 libraries across the United States who responded to her query in 2001, none mentioned books by Charles Bukowski. An official from a prison library responded that dictionaries and poetry were the most frequently stolen types of books at that institution.\n\nAccording to Tom Cushman, a New York book-store manager interviewed in 2005, factors influencing book thefts included high resale value and whether or not the book was displayed in an area difficult for the store clerks to watch. When Harry Potter books were new and popular items in book stores, they were among the top targets of thieves, he said.\n\nBrian Zimmerman, associate general manager at the San Francisco State University book store, said thieves there were much more likely to be students, but professional thieves took more books and targeted volumes with higher prices. Thieves have been known to take whole stacks of books at once. According to a 1991 article in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\",\nstudies showed that the \"casual thief\", defined as \"not a professional but more than a one-timer\", accounted for 70 to 75 percent of shoplifting.\n\nIn 1992, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that thieves were so brazen in New York City that just outside St. Mark's Bookshop, \"sidewalk peddlers openly ply books – many of them still bearing St. Mark's telltale stamp – at half off the prices inside the store.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, book store owners in New York and California accused second-hand book stores of organizing theft rings to shoplift titles for resale. Drama Book Shop in Manhattan lost 533 books with a total sales price of $10,873 from January 1 to May 8, 1991. One thief told store officials that a ring organized by a second-hand store had been assigned to steal books from the Drama Book Shop, according to Rozanne Seelan, co-owner of the victimized store.\n\nBook stores at San Francisco State University and City College of San Francisco train their employees who are examining books being returned or sold to the stores to look for price tag stickers, books that don't seem to have been used, and anyone offering to sell multiple copies of a single title. When store employees approach customers to ask whether they need help, they also discourage theft, according to Zimmerman.\n\nJeffrey Eugenides and Paul Auster both laughed when journalists asked them about being some of the authors whose books are most shoplifted. \"It's one of those things authors argue about\" among themselves, Eugenides said, adding that he and Auster had discussed their status as authors of frequently stolen books.\n\nAbbie Hoffman wrote \"Steal This Book\" in 1970 and published in 1971. While largely about rebelling against authority, it includes a section on shoplifting.\n\n"}

The Opera House is a wood frame building built in 1873, attached roughly to the adjoining brick Gem Theater, a 1937 masonry cinema.\n\nThe Opera House was used as a community meeting house, dance hall and theater. The theater was built by Aleck Brown in September 1873 and featured a performance of \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" for its opening night, with a cast of professional actors from San Francisco. The Opera House was purchased in 1891 by Alexander S. Thompson of Pioche. Thompson renovated the floor and enlarged the stage. After Thompson's death in 1905 his sons Charles and Frank took over, remodeling in 1907. The Opera House screened its first silent movie in 1915. In 1935 the Opera House was renamed the Gem Theater after Frank Thompson took over sole management, but in 1937 he built a new Gem Theater next door expressly for movies. The Opera House declined from that point.\n\nThe two story rectangular building shows elements of the Greek Revival style with its shallow front gable/pediment. It originally featured a one-story porch across the width of the facade with a balustrade above, removed but now restored. The front is covered with clapboards while the side and rear are sheathed in board and batten siding. The structure is framed with heavy timber in a post-and-beam arrangement. The ground floor housed commercial space and dressing rooms. The main hall is on the second floor, entered by steep stairs from the street. A shed-roofed addition to the rear is built into the hillside and houses the stage at the second floor level.\n\nThe Opera House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is one of three 19th century theaters remaining in Nevada.\n"}
{"id": "562136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=562136", "title": "Caravanserai", "text": "Caravanserai\n\nA caravanserai () was a roadside inn where travelers (caravaners) could rest and recover from the day's journey. Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa and Southeast Europe, especially along the Silk Road.\n\nThese were found frequently along the Achaemenid Empire's Royal Road, a ancient highway that stretched from Sardis to Susa according to Herodotus: \"Now the true account of the road in question is the following: Royal stations exist along its whole length, and excellent caravanserais; and throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is free from danger.\" Major urban caravanserais were also built along the Grand Trunk Road in the Indian subcontinent, especially in the region of Mughal Delhi.\n\nThe word is also rendered as \"caravansary\", \"caravansaray\", \"caravanseray\" and \"caravansara\". The Persian word \"kārvānsarāy\" is a compound word combining \"kārvān\" \"caravan\" with \"sarāy\" \"palace\", \"building with enclosed courts\", to which the Persian suffix \"-yi\" is added. Here \"caravan\" means a group of traders, pilgrims or other travellers, engaged in long distance travel. The word \"serai\" is sometimes used with the implication of caravanserai.\n\nA number of place-names based on the word \"sarai\" have grown up: Mughal Serai, Sarai Alamgir and the Delhi Sarai Rohilla railway station for example, and a great many other places are also based on the original meaning of \"palace\".\n\nThe Persian caravanserai was built as a large road station, outside of towns. An inn built inside a town would be smaller and was known in Persian as a \"khan\" () (from Middle Persian hʾn' (xān, “house”)). In the Middle-East the term \"khan\" covers both meanings, of roadside inn as well as of inner-town inn. In Turkish the word is rendered as \"han\". The same word was used in Bosnian, having arrived through Ottoman conquest. The Greek \"pandocheion\", lit.: \"welcoming all\", thus meaning 'inn', led to \"funduq\" in Arabic (), \"pundak\" in Hebrew (פונדק), \"fundaco\" in Venice, \"fondaco\" in Genoa and \"alhóndiga\" in Spanish.\n\nAl-Muqaddasi the Arab geographer wrote in 985 CE about the hostelries, or wayfarers' inns, in the Province of Palestine, a province at that time listed under the topography of Syria, saying: \"Taxes are not heavy in Syria, with the exception of those levied on the Caravanserais (\"Fanduk\"); Here, however, the duties are oppressive...\" The reference here being to the imposts and duties charged by government officials on the importation of goods and merchandise, the importers of which and their beasts of burden usually stopping to take rest in these places. Guards were stationed at every gate to ensure that taxes for these goods be paid in full, while the revenues therefrom accruing to the Fatimid kingdom of Egypt.\n\nMost typically a caravanserai was a building with a square or rectangular walled exterior, with a single portal wide enough to permit large or heavily laden beasts such as camels to enter. The courtyard was almost always open to the sky, and the inside walls of the enclosure were outfitted with a number of identical animal stalls, bays, niches or chambers to accommodate merchants and their servants, animals, and merchandise.\n\nCaravanserais provided water for human and animal consumption, washing and ritual purification such as wudu and ghusl. Sometimes they had elaborate baths. They also kept fodder for animals and had shops for travellers where they could acquire new supplies. In addition, some shops bought goods from the travelling merchants.\n\nMultani Caravanserai, which was established in the 14th century in Azerbaijan and now houses a restaurant, was constructed in a square shape. It has very ancient style with balconies around the courtyard.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4108070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4108070", "title": "Chatham Theatre", "text": "Chatham Theatre\n\nThe Chatham Theatre or Chatham Street Theatre was a playhouse on the southeast side of Chatham Street (now Park Row) in New York City. It was located at numbers 143-9, between Roosevelt and James streets, a few blocks south of the Bowery. At its opening in 1839, the Chatham was a neighborhood establishment, which featured big-name actors and drama. By the mid-1840s, it had become primarily a venue for blackface minstrel shows. Frank S. Chanfrau restored some of its grandeur in 1848.\n\nThe playhouse's most successful period was under the management of A. H. Purdy. He staged productions of Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" beginning in 1852, the success of which prompted him to advertise heavily and to create a special section where African American patrons could sit. Following Purdy's departure in 1857, the theatre entered its final decline. It flip-flopped many times between a standard melodrama house and a concert saloon before finally being demolished in 1862.\n\nThomas Flynn and Henry Willard financed the construction of the Chatham Theatre in 1839. Under Flynn's management, the playhouse opened on 11 September 1839 with a production of \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts\" starring John R. Scott and Mrs. Thomas Flynn. It was essentially a neighborhood theatre at this time, and the effects of the Panic of 1837 were still being felt, so the establishment lost money. Nevertheless, Flynn and Willard kept it open for another year, staging comedies and dramas that starred popular actors, including James Anderson, William Rufus Blake, Junius Brutus Booth, and Mademoiselle Celeste. The theatre finally closed in January 1840 due to differences between the two owners.\n\nCharles R. Thorne bought Willard's stake and joined Flynn as manager for two weeks in February 1840. Still, the theatre saw little success. Thorne then bought out Flynn's stake for $500. As sole manager, Flynn led the playhouse to a profitable four years, featuring popular talents such as James S. Browne, Mary Duff, Edwin Forrest, Thomas D. Rice, John Sefton, Henry Wallack, and Bill Williams.\n\nIn 1844, Thorne sold the theatre to his stage manager, a Mr. Stevens, and to A. W. Jackson, who managed for one season. During this time, the theatre was mainly a blackface minstrel house. On 8 April 1845, Ben De Bar became stage manager, but he soon partnered with William S. Deverna to lease the building. De Bar ceased active management on 5 October. M. S. Phillips was the next lessee, followed by J. Fletcher, who bought the theatre in 1847.\n\nBy this time, the Chatham Theatre was performing poorly. It became a circus for a time before eventually reopening as a playhouse. Admissions were low for the time: 25¢ for the boxes, one shilling for the pit, and six pence for the gallery. The audience now consisted of the lower classes, who on holidays \"used to talk, shout, and scream so that the actors went through their parts in dumb show . . . .\"\n\nFrank S. Chanfrau and W. Olgivie Ewen became joint lessees on 28 February 1848 with Chanfrau as manager. They renamed the building Chanfrau's National Theatre and tried to reclaim some of the theatre's lost prestige. This lasted until 8 July 1850.\n\nA. H. Purdy took over operations in 1850 for what would prove the theatre's most successful period. He renamed the building Purdy's National Theatre. He renovated in April 1852, reopening on 19 April. On 23 August 1852, Purdy produced the first non-comedic stage adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in the United States. This version, written by Charles Western Taylor, ran for 11 nights but saw little success.\n\nMost of the 1853 season was devoted to a much more successful dramatization of Stowe's novel. The production ran almost non-stop from 18 July 1853 to 19 April 1854, when performances were cut back to three nights weekly until 13 May. The play proved so popular with African American audiences that Purdy created a special black-only section of the theatre on 15 August. No unaccompanied women were allowed there, and the entrance was separate from the main doors. Purdy expanded the section on 29 October. Despite the great success of the \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" production, Purdy still lost money from advertising too heavily and by splurging on too many gifts for Cordelia Howard, the young actress who was starring in the drama.\n\nDespite this one overzealous blunder, Purdy had a flair for advertising. On 1 September 1856, he began his sixth season at the Chatham by erecting a statue of George Washington atop the playhouse while the New York Brass Band played and fireworks were launched. Purdy left during the Panic of 1857.\n\nThe theatre then entered a long period of decline. The new owners redecorated before the 1858-9 season. Early on 10 July 1859, part of the theatre caught fire, apparently from gunfire special effects from the play the night before; the building suffered $500 in damages. The building was remodeled once again in November 1859 and reopened on 14 November as the Chatham Amphitheatre. Circuses provided the main attraction.\n\nOn 6 March 1860, J. Howard Rogers and Joseph C. Foster leased the building. They opened on 8 March as the National Concert Saloon. The emphasis now was on alcoholic beverages served by attractive waitresses. Admission prices were 12¢ for boxes and 6¢ for the pit. On 3 July, Charles J. Waters took over management and reopened as the National Theatre, a standard melodrama playhouse. George Beane replaced Waters on 6 October and restored the concert saloon theme. This lasted until December, when he gave it over to a German troupe.\n\nFox and Curran took over in 1861. They spent a great deal of money to restore the theatre, then reopened on 16 November as the National Music Hall. They failed to turn a profit, and George Lea, manager of the Melodeon on Broadway and Hooley's Theatre in Brooklyn gained control in December. He made the most of his three establishments by using the same actors at all three venues. They would first perform at the Melodeon, then travel to the Chatham, to finish up the night at Hooley's.\n\nIn October 1862, the Chatham Theater was demolished. Part of it survived and was rented to shopkeepers.\n\n"}

The 19th-century scholar Eugene O'Curry found a marginal note in the Book of Leinster, partly illegible, which said that the \"Cín\" was compiled by a son of Dauí, king of Connacht. O'Curry favoured Ernín, son of Dauí Galach, a nephew of Niall of the Nine Hostages and a contemporary of Patrick, but allowed that it may have been a son of Dauí Tenga Uma, a king of Connacht who died at the end of the fifth century (Francis J.

{"id": "37525015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37525015", "title": "DesignAge", "text": "DesignAge\n\nDesignAge was a cross-disciplinary action research programme within the Royal College of Art in the UK, founded in 1991 in partnership with the Helen Hamlyn Foundation to “explore the implications for design of ageing populations” in the developed world. It was directed by Roger Coleman until 1999 when it was merged into the newly created Helen Hamlyn Research Centre.\nThe programme was the recipient of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in 1994 in the category of “the Arts”.\n\nBy the early 1990s, it was recognized that older adults, in particular adults over 50, were becoming an increasingly significant portion of the population, while improvements in nutrition and medicine were enabling these older adults to remain active. This demographic shift was thought to be permanent.\nHowever, the fact that the younger population represented a shrinking market and older population a growing one was largely ignored by the design profession. In response to the lack of understanding of these issues and the design community’s lack of understanding of their implications, in 1991 DesignAge was founded to investigate the needs of the older population, to interpret the results of the research in a way relevant to designers and industry, and to develop new methodologies in design and design education in response to this demographic shift.\n\nDesignAge argued that older adults were “rendered disabled” by public spaces and transportation systems that had not been designed for this segment of the population, and therefore design had an influential role to play in shaping the future, in that improvements of the life for older adults, as well as the job market and national economy could be realized if designers, manufacturers, and retailers could shift their attitudes towards aging so as to collaborate to create age-friendly products and services. By pointing out that designing for the aging population was designing for their own aging, effectively reframing aging as an issue of self-interest, DesignAge was able to engage younger designers to design for older people.\n\nOne of the ways that DesignAge used to engage design students was to hold an annual design competition, called the DesignAge Competition, held between 1992 and 1998, to challenge design students to design for their “future selves.”\n\nDesignAge also engaged the industry at large by approaching the Design Business Association (formed in 1986 by the Chartered Society of Designers) and suggesting a “product challenge” to their member agencies; these were small-scale events where they would work with older users to design products on a speculative basis for the aging population.\n\nIn 1999 DesignAge became the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre and extended into the research of Inclusive Design.\n\nDesignAge produced a number of publications, including the seminal \"Designing For Our Future Selves\" published in 1993.\nOther publications include the “Designing for our future selves” special issue (volume 24, issue 1) of the journal \"Applied Ergonomics\" published in 1993; \"Once in a Lifetime: An Evaluation of Lifetime Homes in Hull,\" published in 1995; and \"Working Together, A New Approach To Design,\" published in 1997.\n\nWithin three years of its existence DesignAge reported that it was able to raise awareness of the issue within the design profession, in related disciplines including ergonomics, in education, and also among major retailers, manufacturers, and the age lobby.\n\nIn 1994, DesignAge was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in the category of “the Arts” in recognition of its contribution to the shift in perception towards designing for older adults and for working with corporations to design products for older adults and people incapacitated by illness.\n\nIn 1994, DesignAge established a Europe-wide research network on design and aging called the DAN (Design for Ageing Network), funded until 1997 by DG V of the European Commission (then the Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs). The network’s goal was to “develop the necessary expertise, know-how and understanding to enable design and industry to respond to the growing population of over-50’s in Europe in appropriate and life-enhancing ways” through the use of “in-depth collaboration with older people” that went “beyond simple measuring and questioning.”\n\nAfter DesignAge was subsumed into the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre, DAN continued to exist until early 2004 when it was superseded by the Include Network.\n\nDesignAge also participated in an EU-funded project called Presence, which ran from 1997 to 1999 and whose aim was “enhancing activity and presence of older people in communities”.\n\n"}

When Anderson was 11 years old, her family returned to the United States, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They continued to keep a flat in London, and spent their summers there. Anderson later said that she has always intended to return to England. In Grand Rapids, she attended Fountain Elementary and City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis on the humanities.\n\nFollowing the move to Grand Rapids, Anderson went through a rebellious stage as a teenager; experimenting with drugs, dating a much older boyfriend, and cultivating a punk appearance (dyeing her hair various colors, shaving the sides of her head, sporting a nose piercing and an all-black wardrobe). She was put in therapy at the age of 14. Anderson listened to bands such as Dead Kennedys and Skinny Puppy. She was voted by her classmates as \"class clown\", \"most bizarre girl\" and \"most likely to be arrested\". She was, in fact, arrested on graduation night for breaking and entering into her high school in an attempt to glue the locks of the doors. She later managed to reduce the charges to trespassing.\n\nAt an early age Anderson was interested in marine biology, but after becoming interested in theatre during her teenage years, she began acting in high school productions during her first year and later in community theatre. She also served as a student intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre & School of Theatre Arts. After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990. Anderson also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program at Cornell University. To support herself financially during her student years, she worked at the Goose Island Brewpub in Chicago. After Anderson became famous, the brewery named one of their beers after her – a Belgian Style Farmhouse Ale, simply called \"Gillian\".\n\nAnderson is the eldest of three siblings. Her brother Aaron – who was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis – died in 2011 of a brain tumor, at the age of 30. Aaron was a DJ, a mentor, and a practicing Buddhist. He was in his second year of a PhD program in Developmental Psychology at Stanford University when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2008. Her sister Zoe is a ceramicist, whom Anderson calls \"an exceptional artist\". Zoe is openly gay and is married to her partner.\n\nAnderson is bidialectal. With her English accent and background, she was mocked and felt out of place as a teenager in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: \"I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what the answer to that question is. I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled.\"\n\nAnderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old. To support herself as she started her career, she worked as a waitress. She began her career in Alan Ayckbourn's play \"Absent Friends\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club alongside Brenda Blethyn; for her role she won the 1990–91 Theatre World Award for \"Best Newcomer\". Her next theatrical role was in Christopher Hampton's \"The Philanthropist\" at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nAnderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992, and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, \"The Turning\", starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper. The film drama is an adaptation of the play \"Home Fires Burning\".\n\nAlthough she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: \"First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't want to be involved in it.\" She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, \"Class of '96\", on the fledgling Fox Network.\n\nAs a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for \"The X-Files\". She was 24 when she decided to audition because, \"for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character.\" Producer Chris Carter wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal. Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully. Anderson got the part assuming it would run for 13 episodes, the standard minimum order for American television networks. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, before moving to Los Angeles, the series ran for nine seasons. Two related films were also produced, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on \"The X-Files\", Anderson won numerous awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama, two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television.

Anderson's character on \"X-Files\" initiated a phenomenon referred to as \"The Scully Effect\"; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine and law enforcement. It contributed to the increase in the number of women in those fields. \"The Scully Effect\" remains a subject of academic inquiry.\n\nIn 1996, Anderson narrated the television documentaries \"Spies Above\" and \"Why Planes Go Down\".

{"id": "51059379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51059379", "title": "Ilona Kronstein", "text": "Ilona Kronstein\n\nIlona (Ili) Kronstein (née Neumann, 1897–1948) was a Jewish, Budapest-born artist. Although Kronstein was originally a graphic artist by trade, her artistic style evolved over her lifetime. Her works were newly discovered in the late 1990s and were later exhibited at the Jewish Museum in Vienna, Austria.\n\nIli was born in 1897 to Sigmund (Zsiga) Neumann and Emma Deutsch in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. Her younger sisters were born in 1899 (Margit (Manci)) and in 1903 (Klara (Klari)). Around 1908, Sigmund's textile mill went out of business and he emigrated to Trieste, Italy with his family. There, Ili became proficient in Italian and developed an appreciation for Italy and its inhabitants. She showed artistic skill during childhood, but her work was discouraged by Sigmund. The family returned to Budapest, and Ili was removed from school when she was 16, as she needed to concentrate on getting ready for marriage and the middle-class lifestyle that accompanied it. During this period of her life, she volunteered for several years in nursery schools for poor children.\n\nIli married Robert Kronstein in 1919, despite original disapproval from Sigmund and Emma. She moved with Robert to Vienna, Austria-Hungary and he purchased a pharmacy there. In 1920, the couple had its first daughter, Gerda, and in 1925 its second daughter, Nora (named after Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\"). Ili and Robert's marriage was tense and contradictory. Much of the riffs in the marriage stemmed from Ili's longing to branch out and meet fascinating and enlightened people. The couple moved to a larger apartment during her first pregnancy. Ili's mother-in-law lived with them, and she disapproved of Ili's artistic and nonconformist attitudes. Following the birth of Nora, both Ili and Robert agreed to live together in the same home as friends (not husband and wife), and \"he continued to support her throughout their lives.\"\n\nKronstein was then free to evolve artistically while being financially secure. She experimented with defining herself both as a person and as an artist for many years. She became a book binder and, after this, a German (her second language) writer. Kronstein started to diligently develop her artistry in the early 1930s, first as a graphic artist. Initially, Kronstein was significantly influenced by Egon Schiele's work, but later she was influenced by the artist-teacher Johannes Itten. She learned from Itten either at his School of Living and Art in Berlin, Germany or over the duration of one of his frequent visits to Vienna. Over the course of 1934 to 1936, Kronstein informally taught Gerda art lessons which mirrored Itten's methodology and viewpoints. Later, Itten's philosophies guided Kronstein's work; the counsel she provided for Nora (she went on to become an artist); and the description (in print) of a painting class that she had planned, which encompasses \"practice exercises\" and philosophical ideology (for instance, the relationship among breathing exercises, yoga, and art).\n\nKronstein developed herself as an artist though study of the \"old masters[']\" art when she travelled to Italy and other places periodically. She additionally educated herself on \"Japanese classical brush painting,\" and was interested in Impressionist artwork, especially Paul Cézanne. She also took interest in literary, cinematic, and artistic German Expressionism.\n\nKronstein rented an art studio in 1933 with help from Robert's economic support. There, she worked many days and nights at her work, while running a salon as well. She featured her \"graphic work, portraits and landscapes\" at her own exhibits. Her evolution as an artist was stunted by the Anschluss (1938). Not long after, Robert moved to Vaduz in Liechtenstein (Robert founded another pharmacy there in 1933.)\nDuring a Nazi street raid, Ili was coerced to scrub the sidewalk. Gerda and Ili were held in jail for six weeks (April 1938) \"as hostages for Robert.\" Prior to their release, it was required that Ili declare in writing that she and her children would leave Austria immediately, however, three months passed before they could leave Austria to reunite with Robert. At first, Kronstein felt free spirited, as she had just escaped from Nazi influence. However, that positivity was replaced by \"restlessness and unhappiness,\" because she resented \"the uncultured provincialism of Vaduz\" and she did not have a studio. During this time, Nora attended a Swiss boarding school, and Gerda went to Zürich, Switzerland in hopes to attain a visa to the U.S. Kronstein then left Vaduz and visited in Zürich periodically. In Zürich, she roomed with Gerda in a \"cheap, small room,\" consumed food moderately, but took relish in the cultural resources. In 1938, both Ili and Gerda were held in jail as foreigners and deportation to Germany was a threatened upon them. Robert managed to change their deportation location to Liechtenstein.\n\nKronstein left Liechtenstein, and stayed for a brief time in Paris, France. She then left for southern France. There, her artistic creativity blossomed. She started working with colors, and her works gained more depth. During this time, her style bordered cubism and abstraction. She spent time in Nice and befriended inspirational artists who taught her valuable lessons. In this circle of inspirations was Latvian painter Rudolf Ray-Rapaport, and he and Kronstein became close friends.\n\nThe Kronsteins still planned to emigrate, but, in June 1941, Ili's application for a U.S. visa got denied. In the past, she was confined in Gurs internment camp for six weeks alongside ten thousand refugees, both Jews and anti-Fascists. Also in Gurs was Charlotte Salomon and Hannah Arendt. In Gurs, Kronstein showed \"remarkable courage, good humor and resourcefulness,\" despite dwindling health. In late 1940, Kronstein endured paralysis of her right arm. Later on in 1945, Kronstein was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Over the course of the year 1941, she could not work for extended amounts of time, however, she still drew until she could no longer grip a pencil. Following Ray-Rapaport's immigration to the U.S. in 1942, Kronstein went to Liechtenstein and later to Switzerland in order to receive treatment for her illnesses. She was paralyzed yet mentally attentive and spent her last four years of life in private care in Zürich. She died at the age of fifty-one on April 22, 1948.\n"}

His seat was already meant as a kind of \"state church\", it was the first building of this size north of the Alps. The cathedral was completed in 1009, burnt down at the dedication, and was immediately rebuilt. Willigis may have planned to replace Aachen Cathedral as coronation church of the King of the Romans; indeed Otto's III successors Henry II (in 1002) and Conrad II (in 1024) were crowned in Mainz, but both presumably in the preceding building, since the present cathedral was not consecrated until in 1038. King Henry IV also contributed to the building after another blaze in 1081. Mainz Cathedral was the coronation site for Philip of Swabia, for Frederick II, and anti-king Henry Raspe.\n\nSpeyer Cathedral is the world's largest preserved Romanesque church (after the demolition of Cluny Abbey) and today a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was built starting about 1025 by King Conrad II as a family vault for the ruling Salian dynasty. His successor Henry III donated the Speyer Gospels in 1046; the building was completed in 1061 under the rule of King Henry IV. During the Investiture Controversy with Pope Gregory VIII, he had the church again extended from 1081, in order to stress his Imperial authority. His mortal remains were transferred to the cathedral by his son Henry V in 1111.\n\nWorms Cathedral, a highrising building, was built from about 1130 to 1181. It houses the tombs of Emperor Conrad's II family and also got its status because of its size and glory. The church was the site of the nomination of Pope Leo IX in 1048 and of the conclusion of the 1122 Concordat of Worms ending the Investiture Controversy. In 1235 the marriage of Emperor Frederick II with Isabella of England took place here.\nAachen Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1978, today is the seat of the Bishops of Aachen and the city's landmark. Its central octagon was erected from the late 8th century onwards as the chapel of the Palace of Aachen, a residence of Emperor Charlemagne. The building, a masterpiece of the Carolingian Renaissance, has been expanded several times over the centuries; from 936 it served as the coronation church of the Kings of the Romans after their election at Frankfurt. Nevertheless, the former Palatine Chapel did not attain the rank of a cathedral until 1802, permanently in 1930.\n\nFrankfurt Cathedral (St Bartholomew Church) is also described as an Imperial cathedral, though it never had been a bishop's seat. The present Gothic building replaced a Carolingian palatine chapel, erected at the Frankfurt royal palace (\"Königpfalz\"). It was rebuilt as a basilica and collegiate church consecrated by Archbishop Rabanus Maurus in 852. Frankfurt first became the site of the election of the German monarch with the accession of Frederick Barbarossa in 1152, definitely fixed in the Golden Bull of 1356. From 1562 until 1792, Frankfurt was also the site of the Imperial coronation ceremony led by the Archbishop of Mainz.\nBamberg Cathedral with its four towers also has the same status. Built from 1004 onwards for the newly established Bishopric of Bamberg at the behest of the last Ottonian King Henry II and his wife Cunigunde of Luxembourg, the church is the site where the only canonized imperial couple has their grave. In 1046 Bishop Suidger of Bamberg was elected Pope Clement II; his grave at the cathedral is the only tomb of a Pope north of the Alps. The Romanesque building, also known for the Bamberg Horseman, is part of the historic Town of Bamberg and today also listed as a World Heritage Site.\n\nLess well known is that the Imperial Cathedral in the small town of Königslutter, a basilica built from 1135 as a Benedictine abbey chuch and family vault of the Supplinburger dynasty in the Saxon lands of Emperor Lothair II. The church was completed about 1170, more than 30 years after Lothair's death, by the Welf duke Henry the Lion at the time when the Imperial rule had already passed to the Swabian house of Hohenstaufen. Like Frankfurt Cathedral, it was never the seat of a bishop.\n\nMagdeburg Cathedral, see of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg founded by Emperor Otto the Great in 968, as well as Palermo Cathedral (Maria Santissima Assunta) with the sarcophagi of the Hohenstaufen emperors Henry VI and Frederick II are sometimes also called Imperial cathedrals.\n"}
{"id": "14008439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14008439", "title": "Jami' al-tawarikh", "text": "Jami' al-tawarikh\n\nThe Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh, ( \"Compendium of Chronicles\", , ) is a work of literature and history, produced in the Mongol Ilkhanate in Persia. Written by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (1247–1318) at the start of the 14th century, the breadth of coverage of the work has caused it to be called \"the first world history\". It was in three volumes. The surviving portions total approximately 400 pages, with versions in Persian and Arabic. The work describes cultures and major events in world history from China to Europe; in addition, it covers Mongol history, as a way of establishing their cultural legacy.\n\nThe lavish illustrations and calligraphy required the efforts of hundreds of scribes and artists, with the intent that two new copies (one in Persian, and one in Arabic) would be created each year and distributed to schools and cities around the Ilkhanate, in the Middle East, Central Asia, Anatolia, and the Indian subcontinent. Approximately 20 illustrated copies were made of the work during Rashid al-Din's lifetime, but only a few portions remain, and the complete text has not survived. The oldest known copy is an Arabic version, of which half has been lost, but one set of pages is currently in the Khalili Collection, comprising 59 folios from the second volume of the work. Another set of pages, with 151 folios from the same volume, is owned by the Edinburgh University Library. Two Persian copies from the first generation of manuscripts survive in the Topkapı Palace Library in Istanbul. The early illustrated manuscripts together represent \"one of the most important surviving examples of Ilkhanid art in any medium\", and are the largest surviving body of early examples of the Persian miniature.\n\nRashid-al-Din Hamadani was born in 1247 at Hamadan, Iran into a Jewish family. The son of an apothecary, he studied medicine and joined the court of the Ilkhan emperor, Abaqa Khan, in that capacity. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty. He rapidly gained political importance, and in 1304 became the vizier of emperor and Muslim convert Ghazan. He retained his position until 1316, experiencing three successive reigns, but, convicted of having poisoned the second of these three Khans, Öljaitü, he was executed on July 13, 1318.\n\nHamdani was responsible for setting up a stable social and economic system in Iran after the destruction of the Mongol invasions, and was an important artistic and architectural patron. He expanded the university at Rab'-e Rashidi, which attracted scholars and students from Egypt and Syria to China, and which published his many works. He was also a prolific author, though few of his works have survived: only a few theological writings and a correspondence which is probably apocryphal are known today in addition to the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\". His immense wealth made it said of him that he was the best paid author in Iran.\n\nThe \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" was one of the grandest projects of the Ilkhanate period, \"not just a lavishly illustrated book, but a vehicle to justify Mongol hegemony over Iran\". The text was initially commissioned by Il-Khan Ghazan, who was anxious for the Mongols to retain a memory of their nomadic roots, now that they had become settled and adopted Persian customs. Initially, the work was intended only to set out the history of the Mongols and their predecessors on the steppes, and took the name \"Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī\", which makes up one part of the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\". To compile the History, Rashid al-Din set up an entire precinct at the university of Rab'-e Rashidi in the capital of Tabriz. It contained multiple buildings, including a mosque, hospital, library, and classrooms, employing over 300 workers.\n\nAfter the death of Ghazan in 1304, his successor Öljaitü asked Rashid al-Din to extend the work, and write a history of the whole of the known world. This text was finally completed in sometime between 1306 and 1311.\n\nAfter Rashid al-Din's execution in 1318, the Rab-i-Rashidi precinct was plundered, but the in-process copy that was being created at the time survived, probably somewhere in the city of Tabriz, possibly in the library of Rashid's son, Ghiyath al-Din. Later, Rashid's son became Vizier, in his own right, and expanded the restored university precinct of his father. Several of the \"Jāmiʿ\"s compositions were used as models for the later seminal illustrated version of the \"Shahnameh\" known as the Demotte \"Shahnameh\".\n\nIn the 15th century, the Arabic copy was in Herat, perhaps claimed after a victory by the Timurid dynasty. It then passed to the court of the Mughal Empire in India, where it was in the possession of the emperor Akbar (r. 1556–1605). There is then a record of it passing through the hands of later Mughal emperors for the next few centuries. It was probably divided into two parts in the mid-1700s, though both sections remained in India until the 19th century, when they were acquired by the British. The portion now in the Edinburgh library was presented as a gift to Ali-I Ahmad Araf Sahib on October 8, 1761, and in 1800 was in the library of the Indian prince Farzada Kuli. This fragment was acquired by Colonel John Baillie of Leys of the East India Company, and then in 1876 passed to the Edinburgh University Library. The other portion was acquired by John Staples Harriott of the East India Company sometime prior to 1813. At some point during the next two decades it was brought to England, probably when Harriott came home on furlough, when the manuscript entered the collection of Major General Thomas Gordon. He then bequeathed it to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1841. In 1948, it was loaned to the British Museum and Library, and in 1980 was auctioned at Sotheby's, where it was purchased by the Rashidiyyah Foundation in Geneva for £850,000, the highest price ever paid for a medieval manuscript. The Khalili Collection acquired it in 1990.\n\nTo write the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\", Rashid al-din based his work on many written and oral sources, some of which can be identified:\n\nThe \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" consists of four main sections of different lengths:\n\n1. The \"Taʾrīkh-ī Ghazānī\", the most extensive part, which includes:\n\n2. The second part includes :\n\n3. The \"Shu'ab-i panjganah\" (\"Five genealogies, of the Arabs, Jews, Mongols, Franks, and Chinese\"). This text exists in two copies of the manuscript in the library of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul (ms 2937), but has only been published on microfilm.\n\n4. The \"Suwar al-akalim\", a geographical compendium. Unfortunately, it has not survived in any known manuscript.\n\nRecent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in the Muslim world in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia). Although much of the illustration for the various \"Tawarikh\" copies was probably done at the Rab-al Rashidi university complex, a contemporary written account mentions that they were also done elsewhere in Mongol empire. \nThe scene now in the Kahlili collection illustrating the Battle of Badr used a collection of stock figures, and scholars are in disagreement as to who is represented. One descriptor says it shows Muhammad with Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ali before sending them to battle. Another says Muhammad is on the right, but Hamza and Ali on the left, or perhaps the center. Another description says it is Muhammad exhorting his family to fight, and that he may be one of the central figures, but it is not clear which one.\n\nThere is little reason to doubt Rashid al-Din’s editorial authorship but the work is generally considered a collective effort. It may also be possible that it was compiled by a group of international scholars under his leadership. Yet, a number of questions remain about the writing of the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh.\" Several others, such as Abu’l Qasim al-Kashani, claimed to have written the \"universal history\". Rashid al-Din was of course a very busy man, with his public life, and would have employed assistants to handle the materials assembled and to write the first draft: Abu'l Qasim may have been one of them. Furthermore, not all of the work is original: for instance, the section on the period following the death of Genghis Khan in particular is directly borrowed from Juvayni. Other questions concern the objectivity of the author and his point of view: it is after all an official history, concerning events with which Rashid al-Din in his political capacity was often involved at first hand (for the history of the Ilkhanate in particular). Nonetheless, the work \"is characterized by a matter-of-fact tone and a refreshing absence of sycophantic flattery.\" \n\nThe \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" was the center of an industry for a time, no doubt in part due to the political importance of its author. The workshop was ordered to produce one manuscript each in Arabic and Persian every year, which were to be distributed to different cities. Although approximately 20 of the first generation of manuscripts were produced, very few survive, which are described below. Other later copies were made from the first set, with some illustrations and history added to match current events.\n\nThe earliest known copy is in Arabic, dated to the early 1300s. Only portions of it have survived, divided into two parts between the University of Edinburgh (151 folios) and the Khalili Collection (59 folios), although some researchers argue for these being from two different copies. Both sections come from the second volume, with the pages interwoven. The Edinburgh part covers some of the earlier history up through a section about the Prophet Muhammad, and then this story is continued in the Khalili portion, with further narratives weaving back and forth between the two collections, ending with the final section also being in the Edinburgh collection.\n\nThe Edinburgh part has a page size of 41.5 × 34.2 cm, with a written area of 37 × 25 cm, and contains 35 lines per page written in Naskhi calligraphy. There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Atabeys, and the history of the sultans of Khwarezm. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by Duncan Forbes, who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as \"Baillie's collection\".\n\nSeventy rectangular miniatures adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of Tabriz at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists.\n\nThe miniatures have an unusual horizontal format and only take up about a third of the written area; this may reflect the influence of Chinese scrolls. Some parts of the surviving text are heavily illustrated and other parts not at all, apparently reflecting the importance accorded to them. The miniatures are ink drawings with watercolour washes added, a technique also used in China; although they are generally in good condition, there was considerable use of metallic silver for highlights, which has now oxidized to black. Borrowings from Christian art can also be seen; for example the \"Birth of Muhammad\" adapts the standard Byzantine composition for the \"Nativity of Jesus\", but instead of the Biblical Magi approaching at the left there is a file of three women. The section includes the earliest extended cycle of illustrations of the life of Muhammad. Like other early Ilkhanid miniatures, these differ from the relatively few surviving earlier Islamic book illustrations in having coherent landscape backgrounds in the many scenes set outside, rather than isolated elements of plants or rocks. Architectural settings are sometimes given a sense of depth by different layers being shown and the use of a three-quarters view.\n\nRice distinguished four major painters and two assistants:\n\n\nJust as distinguishable are different racial and ethnic types, made manifest not just in the physical attributes of the characters, but also their clothes and their hats. One can thus distinguish a remarkably well observed group of Abyssinians, Western-style figures based on Syrian Christian manuscripts, Chinese, Mongols, Arabs, and so on.\n\nThe Edinburgh folios were displayed at an exhibition at the University of Edinburgh Main Library in summer 2014\n\nThe portion in the Khalili Collection, where it is referred to as MSS727, contains 59 folios, 35 of them illustrated.\nUntil sold in 1980 it was owned by the Royal Asiatic Society in London. It is a different section of the History than that of the Edinburgh version, possibly from a different copy. Each page measures (slightly different dimensions to the Edinburgh portion due to different models copied). According to Blair's description of the collection, \"Two major sections were lost after division: thirty-five folios (73-107) covering the life of Muhammad up to the caliphate of Hisham, and thirty folios (291-48) going from the end of the Khwarazmshahs to the middle of the section on China. The latter may have been lost accidentally, but the former block may have been jettisoned deliberately because it had no illustrations. The folios about the life of the Prophet were further jumbled, and four were lost. The final three folios (301-303) covering the end of the section on the Jews were also lost, perhaps accidentally, but judging from the comparable section in MS.H 1653, they had no illustrations and may also have been discarded.\"\n\nThe manuscript was brought to Western attention by William Morley, who discovered it in 1841 while he was cataloguing the collection of the Royal Asiatic Society in London. For some time this collection was displayed in the King's Library of the British Museum. It includes twenty illustrations, plus fifteen pages with portraits of the emperors of China. The text covers the history of Islam, the end of China's history, the history of India, and a fragment from the history of the Jews. The work of the Painter of Luhrasp and Master of Alp Arslan is again evident. Some differences in style can be observed, but these can be attributed to the difference in date. A new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of Yuan mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China. The folios are dated 1314, and it was transcribed and illustrated in Tabriz under the supervision of Rashid al-Din.\n\nThere are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the Topkapi Palace Library, Istanbul.\n\n\nInterest in the work continued after the Ilkhans were replaced as Persia's ruling dynasty by the Timurids. Timur's youngest son, Shahrukh, who ruled the eastern portion of the empire from 1405–47, owned incomplete copies of the \"Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh\" and commissioned his court historian Hafiz-i Abru to complete it. The earliest dated manuscript made for Shahrukh includes the original text and additions by Hafiz-i Abru, along with other histories, and is dated 1415-16 (Topkapi Palace Library, MS B 282). The Topkapi MS H 1653, discussed above, combines an incomplete Ilkhanid \"Jāmiʿ\" with Timurid additions, which are dated 1425. Another \"Jāmiʿ\" is in Paris (BnF, Supplément persan 1113), dated to about 1430, with 113 miniatures. Most of the miniatures for these volumes copy the horizontal format and other features of the Ilkhanid manuscripts, while retaining other features of Timurid style in costume, colouring and composition, using what is sometimes known as the \"Historical style\".\n\n\n\n"}

In the Kongo Kingdom, ivory was a precious commodity that was strictly controlled by chiefs and kings, who commissioned sculptors to produce fine ivory sculptures for their personal and courtly use. With the rise of the transatlantic trade, ivory became one of the most valuable African natural resources sought by Western industry. Eventually, Kongo ivory carvers produced works not only for indigenous leaders and elites but also for Europeans and other foreigners.\n\nMost of the earliest extant ivory carvings from sub-Saharan Africa were not made for African consumers. Richly decorated oliphants, or side-blown horns, from the sixteenth century are among the earliest known of the Kongo Kingdom's royal commissions in ivory. Although made in the form of musical instruments to be used during court ceremonies, many such sculptures were likely given as gifts and made for sale to Portuguese elites, missionaries, and traders. In the 1950s, historian William Fagg coined the term “Afro-Portuguese ivories” to describe Kongo oliphants and other ivory sculptures from this period. A significant number of Afro-Portuguese ivories are in the British Museum, many of them made in Sierra Leone and Benin in the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nAbout the middle of the nineteenth century, a new style of ivory carving developed in the area to meet the demand of the export trade along the Loango Coast of west-central Africa. This style consisted of fine, detailed relief carving that depicts scenes of Kongo life. Scenes commonly portrayed in relief on the ivories capture the dynamic and cosmopolitan coastal activity related to the transatlantic trade.\n\nMost carved Loango tusks are not longer than two to three feet because they were sourced from forest elephants, which are much smaller than the African savannah elephant. Full Loango tusk sculptures that were sculpted from the enormous tusks of savannah elephants are extremely rare; one notable example is now part of the Brooklyn Museum’s collection.\n\n"}

It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010. It consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. In its initial three years, Lilith Fair raised over $10M for charity.\n\nIn 1996, Canadian Sarah McLachlan became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row. Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and Paula Cole. At least one of their appearances together — in McLachlan's home town, on September 14, 1996 — went by the name \"Lilith Fair\" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, Lisa Loeb and Michelle McAdorey, formerly of Crash Vegas.\n\nThe next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking \"Lilith\" from the biblical Jewish lore that Lilith was Adam's first wife.\n\nIn 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16 million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.

Her first major production as an executive producer was the original Fairplay concert in 2002 for Oxfam’s Make Trade Fair campaign, which she produced through her company Bottle, with partners Emily Eavis and Marianne Troup.\n\nIn June 2005, Sobhani was called upon by the Make Poverty History coalition to execute a concert in Japan for the Live 8 concert series. In a span of 4 weeks, Sobhani accomplished the impossible task of securing the venue, artists, broadcast partners and financing, and developing local messaging, for the event at Makuhari Messe in Japan, on the outskirts of Tokyo. The show, Live 8 concert, Chiba, prompted the Japanese Government to add 2 billion dollars more aid for the poorest countries of the world a few days later.\n\nDuring that experience Sobhani met Kevin Wall, founder of Live Earth and Exec Producer of Live 8, and when Live Earth was conceived, she was one of the first people he called on. Lily became Worldwide Head of Events, responsible for the delivery of all Live Earth music concerts. In this capacity, Sobhani supervised teams responsible for all facets of production – from staging and lighting design to promotion, finance, broadcast capture and distribution and artist coordination. The original Live Earth was a set of 9 concerts staged on 7 continents over 24 hours, and was broadcast to 2 billion people on 7 July 2007. It became the largest global entertainment event ever held.\n\nFollowing this, Sobhani was again tapped by Kevin Wall to produce an additional Live Earth concert to take place in Mumbai, India. Live Earth India was scheduled to take place 7 December 2008. Unfortunately, the concert was cancelled shortly after the November 2008 Mumbai attacks on 26 November 2008.\n\nIn early 2010, Sobhani was asked last minute to step in and help oversee the Chicago portion of the Live Earth Run for Water.\n\nMost recently, Lily Sobhani produced the inaugural Official FIFA 2010 World Cup Kickoff Celebration Concert, which opened the 2010 FIFA World Cup tournament on 10 June. It featured live performances from Black Eyed Peas, Shakira, Alicia Keys, John Legend and Juanes, as well as an amazing blend of African artists including Amadou & Mariam, Angelique Kidjo, BLK JKS and Tinariwen.\n\nMost recently, Lily Sobhani executive produced the American reboot of The Secret Policeman's Ball at the Radio City Music Hall in New York on March 4, 2012, a celebration of Amnesty International's 50th Anniversary. The event was a tremendous success with a focus on comedy: Russell Brand, Jon Stewart, Rashida Jones, Chris O'Dowd, Jason Sudeikis, Paul Rudd, Catherine Tate, Noel Fielding, Jimmy Carr, Sarah Silverman, David Cross, Ben Stiller, David Walliams, Liam Neeson, Jack Whitehall and many more all taking to the stage. Together with these comedy stars, Coldplay and Mumford & Sons played sets, headlining the event. \n\nLily currently resides in Los Angeles, CA.\n"}

She began her career with Studio El Fan, a Lebanese talent show, in 1990. The show aired during the 1970s, which continued through to the early 2000s. At the talent show, Labaki won a prize for directing various music video productions.\n\nLabaki obtained a degree in audiovisual studies at Saint Joseph University in Beirut. In 1997, she directed her graduation film, \"11 Rue Pasteur\", which won the Best Short Film Award at the Biennale of Arab Cinema at the Arab World Institute in Paris. Labaki is unique among her fellow Lebanese and Arab Film Makers in that she was not educated or trained abroad.\n\nIn 1998, she attended a workshop in acting at the Cours Florent in Paris. She went on to direct advertisements and music videos for renowned Middle Eastern singers, for which she won several awards.\n\nIn 2003, Labaki's name began to become more popular within the Arab media. 2003 was also the year when she began directing music videos for singer Nancy Ajram. The song, \"Akhasmak ah\" (I'll taunt you), sparked controversy due to the nudity presented and its sexually explicit dancing. \n\nIn 2005, Labaki took part in the Cannes Film Festival Residence for six months, during that time, she wrote \"Caramel\", her first feature film. In 2006, she directed and played one of the leading roles in \"Caramel\", which showcases a Beirut that most people are not familiar with. Rather than tackle political issues that have plagued Lebanon, she presents a comedy that deals with five Lebanese women in Beirut who gather at a beauty salon and deal with issues related to love, sexuality, tradition, disappointment, and everyday ups and downs. The film premiered at the Directors' Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007, which was a commercial success in the summer of that same year. It sold worldwide and collected important prizes at many festivals around the world, garnering Labaki much acclaim both as a director and actress. It also put her on Variety's 10 Directors to Watch list at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2008 the French Ministry of Culture and Communication gave her the Insignia of Chevalier in the Order of Arts and Letters.\n\nIn 2010, Labaki directed and starred in her second feature film, \"Where Do We Go Now?\" The film humorously tackles a delicate subject about a village in which church and mosque stand side by side as women try to keep their blowhard men from starting a religious war. \n\nThe film also premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in the \"Un Certain Regard\" category in 2011. The film won the Cadillac people’s choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival.

She intends to use mostly non-professional actors for this film, similar to her past works. \n\nLabaki's style of cinematography uses cinematic conventions, such as illuminations, atmosphere lighting, and silence to help convey the meaning in her films. Despite the often dangerous political situations Labaki continues to write and direct films that do not focus on conflict. \n\nShe was selected to be on the jury for the Un Certain Regard section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFollowing the success of her third feature, \"Capernaum\", which won the Jury Prize at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, Creative Artists Agency (CAA) signed Labaki in all areas, but she continues to be represented in France by Art Media Agency.\n\nNadine Labaki started acting in short films during the early 2000s.\n\nAs an actor, Labaki starred in \"Stray Bullet,\" directed by Georges Hachem in 2010. She appears in the Moroccan production \"Rock The Casbah,\" directed by Laila Marrakchi, alongside actors Hiam Abbas and Lubna Azabal.\n\nThrough her films, Nadine Labaki connects themes from the Arab world and the Western world. Her transnational feminism highlights ordinary women affected by complex realities deeply rooted in decades of political turmoil. Nadine Labaki was a candidate on the list of the new political movement Beirut Madinati for the capital’s May 2016 local election. Beirut Madinati focuses on social justice and the good of the public utilizing a diverse group of citizens as representatives.\n\nDespite achieving about 40% of the popular vote, the movement lost against its opponent, the 'Beirutis' list' supported by Saad Hariri, in all 6 out of 12 wards, but did not gain a single seat under the election’s one-district First-past-the-post system.\nLabaki is multilingual, fluent in Arabic, French, English and Italian. In 2007, she married musician and composer Khaled Mouzanar. In 2009,\nNadine Labaki gave birth to her first boy, Walid. In 2016 Nadine gave birth to a daughter.\n\nIn 2016, Labaki received an honorary degree from the American University of Beirut and was the speaker at the 150th Commencement Ceremony.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Labaki was the goodwill ambassador for the bi-lingual and multimedia campaign produced by The Brave Heart Fund (BHF).

It is located at the corner of Washington Street and Jefferson Street.\n\nThe \"Perkins Block\" was built in 1890 by Monticello businessman John H. Perkins. This building included three first floor bays housing Perkins' mercantile interests - a general store and sewing machine shop, a hardware store and a farm implement supply store. In addition, Perkins built a stable behind the building from which horses, mules and wagons were sold. The second floor of the Perkins Block included a large foyer and an opera house boasting unparalleled acoustics and the largest stage in the region.\n\nPerkins had hopes of establishing the opera house as a major theater in the South. For several years, performances included both professional touring groups and local productions. Shortly after the turn of the century, however, the railroads were re-routed, by-passing Monticello. The wealthy patrons who had once wintered in south Georgia and north Florida sought destinations further south in Florida, and the opera house faced financial disaster.\n\nUnable to attract the once-popular theatre productions, Perkins discontinued live performances. A failed attempt to utilize the building as a movie theater led to the abandonment of the auditorium. Although the downstairs bays saw continuous occupation for a variety of uses, the opera house stood idle and soon fell into disrepair.\n\nIn 1972, the vision of a handful of interested people saved the opera house, with its falling plaster and leaking roof, from the destruction of the wrecker's ball. An organization was formed to provide opportunities for young performers and restore the opera house.\n\nThe Monticello Opera Company was formed in March of that year and performed at the first fund-raising event at the home of Mr. and Mrs. John H. Phipps.\n\nThe purchase of the Perkins Block was consummated on October 17, 1973. On that date, the Monticello Opera House, Inc. purchased the building with money raised through fund-raising efforts, a grant from the State of Florida and a private donation from Mrs. Dorothy Simpson, who held one-half interest in the building.\n\nMaintenance and restoration of the facility continues to this day. In a joint effort with the Florida Department of State, Division of Historic Resources, a restoration project was completed in the area of the original stairway leading to the auditorium balcony. The construction brought the facility into compliance with fire code regulations to allow the lawful use of seating in the balcony. The project was completed with a sensitivity to the original architectural features and makes use of original molding and wainscoting wherever possible. Although the original seating in the balcony remained intact, the seats on the main level of the theater had to be replaced. The current seating was donated by Tallahassee Community College President during the school's renovation of its theater. Installation of the \"new\" seats was accomplished entirely with volunteer labor from members of the community.\n\nAlthough the downstairs had been remodeled to accommodate those with disabilities, it was not until May 2004, that the theater became accessible. In 1999 $25,000 was donated in the memory of Dr. Gerald M. Cathey to institute fund raising efforts for installation of an elevator. An additional $25,000 was raised over the course of the next two years through donations from benefactors and production proceeds from the Opera House Stage Company. A $50,000 matching grant from the Department of State, Division of Historical Resources resulted in the hiring of Riley Palmer Construction to complete this long desired renovation.\n\nThe Monticello Opera House is commonly used for a variety of events including children's theater, murder mystery dinners and large musicals. There is also a patio and gazebo in the back where weddings and receptions are held.\n"}

{"id": "13752176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13752176", "title": "Spin art", "text": "Spin art\n\nSpin art is an art form that uses paint, a canvas such as glossy cardboard and a spinning platform. It is primarily used to entertain and expose children to the process of art creation, although it can be enjoyed by people of all ages.\n\nTo create spin art, an artist initially decorates or drips paint onto a canvas. The canvas can be anything; however, the most common form of canvas is a small rectangular piece of cardboard. Before the paint on the canvas dries, the artist secures the canvas to a platform that can be rotated at high speed. Once the canvas is secure, the artist can then begin spinning the canvas. Most spinning platforms are electrical or battery operated, with more elaborate platforms enabling the artist to vary the rotational speed.\n\nAs the canvas rotates, centrifugal forces draw the wet paint outwards, creating intricate designs. The artist can drip more paint onto the canvas while it is spinning, thus layering paints on top of each other, creating different effects. Using different colors, a skilled spin artist can blend colors together into subtle designs. At any point during this process, the artist can stop the spinning platform to view the canvas. Since the canvas is usually rotating at a high rate, it is difficult if not impossible to view the image on the canvas until the platform has stopped spinning, thus creating a sense of surprise and uncertainty during the creation process.\n\n \nSince the 1960s spin art can be seen in the works of certain contemporary artists. The artists using this technique often reconfigure their own machines by incorporating a more powerful engine than those belonging to schools. The variety of results that this technique produces gives us a good idea of the infinite possibilities.\nProfessional artists:\n\nAlfons Schilling\n\nDuring the 1960s Alfons Schilling was one of the first artists to become interested in spin art. action painting also had a large influence on his work and added to its originality. Instead of installing it vertically he did it horizontally.\n\nAnnick Gendron\n\nFrom 1968 to 1973 the French artist Annick Gendron used industrial wheels to spin paint on Plexiglas. At the end of the 1960s she was one of the first artist to use centrifugal force to produce large-sized artworks. Inspired by children's games : spin art, spin painting, her goal was to transcend this modest use to get the most spectacular effects from it. Damien Hirst got the same idea in the 1990s, as her he transcends the original practice, by the use of more spectacular materials, sizes, shapes, and skill improvement. Her work has been shown at the Raymond Duncan Gallery, at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery, at the Salon des Indépendants and Surindependant at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, at the Salon des Artistes Français at the Grand Palais and the Salon d'Automne in Paris.\n\nDamien Hirst\n\nFrom 1995 the British artist Damien Hirst started a series of spin paintings. His finished pieces are circular in shape and mounted onto steel frames. This is a series of original works of art and screen prints. He was inspired by memories of the technique of spin painting which he saw as a child on the BBC's \"Blue Peter\".\n\nLawrence Stafford\n\nDuring the late 1960s developed a spinning rotating machine on which he attached raw canvas and sprayed acrylic paint while the drum spun. He exhibited those abstract paintings in the United States and in Germany in 1968-1969. Several are in important museum collections including the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nMark Chadwick\n\nMark Chadwick's art is concerned by the use of machines in a production of an artwork, questioning what happens to an artwork once a machine has been used in its production. Chadwick often creates paintings using the spinning technique to introduce the element of chance and questioning the control of the artist. He consistently changes the method and considers all types of aspects to create different works.\n\n"}

{"id": "182021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=182021", "title": "The Slim Shady LP", "text": "The Slim Shady LP\n\nThe Slim Shady LP is the second studio album and the major-label debut by American rapper Eminem. It was released on February 23, 1999 by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan, following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself. \"The Slim Shady LP\" is his first album with a major label after his first album \"Infinite\" was released on an independent label in 1996. The majority of the album's lyrical content is written from the perspective of the rapper's alter ego Slim Shady, whom the rapper created on the \"Slim Shady EP\" (1997). The lyrics are noted for their depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity.\n\nThe album was met with both critical and commercial success; critics praised Eminem for his unique lyrical style, and the album debuted at number two on the US \"Billboard\" 200 behind TLC's \"FanMail\" with 283,000 copies sold in its opening week. \"Just Don't Give a Fuck\", from the Slim Shady EP, was released in October 1998. \n\nThe first official single, \"My Name Is\", peaked at number 36 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming his first entry on that chart. \"The Slim Shady LP\" went on to be certified quadruple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has sold over 18 million copies worldwide. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and in 2012, the album was ranked number 275 on \"Rolling Stone\" \"Magazine\"'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\"The Slim Shady LP\" turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records, and he embarked on an extensive touring schedule to promote the album. In the summer of 1999, the rapper frequently performed on the Vans Warped Tour and in hip-hop clubs. He also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on American youth.\n\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album \"Infinite\", which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. \"Infinite\" achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: \"After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off.\" After the release of \"Infinite\", Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.\n\nThe disappointment of \"Infinite\" inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: \"Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it.\" Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play \"Slim Shady EP\". During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the \"Slim Shady EP\" to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\" Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.\n\n\"The Slim Shady LP\" was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\" However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; \"Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for\", Eminem recalled. He later said: \"Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them.\" \" On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished \"My Name Is\" in an hour. Three other songs, including \"Role Model\", were also recorded that day.\n\n\"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\", which was formerly featured on the \"Slim Shady EP\" as \"Just the Two of Us\", was rerecorded for \"The Slim Shady LP\" to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, \"When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out.\" Eminem also said, \"When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it.\" The song \"Guilty Conscience\" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre \"fell out of his chair laughing\" upon hearing the lyric. \"Ken Kaniff\", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Another skit, \"Bitch\", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor Henry Winkler, tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album.\n\nWhile Eminem was mixing \"The Slim Shady LP\", at the same time, Kid Rock was recording his fourth studio album, \"Devil Without a Cause\"; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record scratching for Eminem's song \"My Fault\", which appears on \"The Slim Shady LP\"; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song \"Fuck Off\" for \"Devil Without a Cause\".\n\nThe album's production was handled primarily by the Bass Brothers, Dr Dre, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that \"The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play.\" According to the staff at IGN, \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" is backed by the \"lulling serenity of a super silky groove\". \"Cum on Everybody\"; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while \"My Name Is\", which is built around a piano \"sample\" from British musician Labi Siffre's \"I Got The\", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. \"I'm Shady\" was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a \"sample\" of Curtis Mayfield's \"Pusherman\" in Ice-T's song \"I'm Your Pusher\", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use \"Pusherman\".\n\nEminem's vocal inflection on the record has been described as a \"nasal whine\"; Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\" likened his \"calmly sarcastic delivery\" to \"the early Beastie Boys turned cynical\". Writing for the \"Chicago Tribune\", columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to \"Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent\". A skit entitled \"Lounge\" appears before \"My Fault\" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line \"I never meant to give you mushrooms\" for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write \"My Fault\".\n\nMany of the songs from \"The Slim Shady LP\" are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as \"made-up tales of trailer-park stuff\". The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: \"Why can't people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen.\" Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, \"I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'\" Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word \"nigga\" on the album, with the rapper noting, \"It's not in my vocabulary.\" \"The Slim Shady LP\" begins with a \"Public Service Announcement\" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled \"Paul\" features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to \"tone down\" his lyrics.\n\n\"Guilty Conscience\" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the \"angel\" and \"devil\" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in \"Guilty Conscience\", the outcome is unclear. On \"My Fault\", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an epilogue to the song \"Kim\", although \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that \"There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words.\" On the song \"Brain Damage\", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school.\n\nAlthough many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing \"The Slim Shady LP\", Anthony Bozza of \"Rolling Stone\" described Eminem as \"probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks.\" Eminem was inspired to write \"Rock Bottom\" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday. The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as \"discouraged, hungry, and malnourished.\" \"If I Had\" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is \"tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour\". In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the \"white trash\" stereotype.\n\nThe album was met with general acclaim from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's \"expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination\", adding that \"Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make \"The Slim Shady LP\" one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music.\" David Browne of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described the album's \"unapologetic outrageousness\" as a reaction to the \"soul positivity\" of conscious hip hop, noting that \"\"The Slim Shady LP\" marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch.\" Soren Baker of the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that \"He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time\" but lamented the \"sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem.\"\n\nMany reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of \"Popular Communications\" states, \"Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homo-phobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away.\" Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing \"Simply put: Eminem will crack you up\", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that \"the wife-killing jokes of \"97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record.\" Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" felt that although the album is \"sophomoric and uninspired\" at times, Eminem's \"surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas.\" Mike Rubin of \"Spin\" noted that \"his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are.\" Chris Dafoe of \"The Globe and Mail\" opined that \"Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together.\"\n\n\"Rolling Stone Magazine\" ranked \"The Slim Shady LP\" number 275 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and 33 on its list of the \"100 Best Albums of the '90s\". At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the album won Best Rap Album, while \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. \"Ken Kaniff\" was listed as number 15 on \"Complex\"'s \"50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits\" list, while the \"Public Service Announcement\" introduction to the album, along with the \"Public Service Announcement 2000\" introduction from \"The Marshall Mathers LP\", was listed as number 50 on the list. It also won Outstanding National Album at the 2000 Detroit Music Awards. In 2015, it was ranked at number 76 by \"About.com\" in their list of \"100 best hip-hop albums of all time\".\n\nIn the album's first week of release, \"The Slim Shady LP\" sold 283,000 copies, debuting at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart behind TLC's \"FanMail\". The record remained on the \"Billboard\" 200 for 100 weeks. It also reached number one on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, staying on the chart for 92 weeks. On April 5, 1999, \"The Slim Shady LP\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. On November 15, 2000, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. \"My Name Is\", the album's lead single, peaked at number 36 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, remaining on the chart for ten weeks. The single additionally peaked at number 18 on the magazine's R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 29 on the Pop Songs chart, and 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. \"Guilty Conscience\" reached number 56 on the \"Billboard\" R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while \"Just Don't Give a Fuck\" peaked at number 62 on the chart. \n\nBy November, 2013, the album sold 5,437,000 copies in the United States. on the weekly Canadian Albums Chart and remained on the chart for twelve weeks. Additionally, the album was certified double platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 200,000 units. The record was also certified double platinum in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number ten on the UK Albums chart and remained on the chart for a total of 114 weeks. In Australia, the album peaked at number 49 on the ARIA Chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the country. The album was also certified gold in the Netherlands and New Zealand, where it peaked at the number 20 and 23 chart positions, respectively.\n\nAfter the success of \"The Slim Shady LP\", Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: \"This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her.\"\n\nTo promote \"The Slim Shady LP\", Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, \"I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder.\" However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on \"Total Request Live\".\n\nEminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial by \"Billboard\" editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery.\" During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about \"slapping a pregnant bitch\" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of \"The Slim Shady LP\". The rapper defended himself by saying, \"My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be.\"\n\nOn September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line \"I just found out my mom does more dope than I do\" from \"My Name Is\". After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a \"lawsuit queen\", and alleging that \"That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life.\" She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.\n\nIn December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song \"Brain Damage\" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey's attorney stated \"Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism.\" In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of \"Rolling Stone Magazine\". The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who rapped in her explanation that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event. The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.\n\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Go Home Pigs\" composed for the film \"Getting Straight\" by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album's liner notes state that the song contains an \"interpolation\" of \"Go Home Pigs\", Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent of the all copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally.\n\nNotes\n\n\nWorks cited\n"}
{"id": "4468597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4468597", "title": "Toy theater", "text": "Toy theater\n\nToy theater, also called paper theater and model theater (also spelt theatre, see spelling differences), is a form of miniature theater dating back to the early 19th century in Europe. Toy theaters were often printed on paperboard sheets and sold as kits at the concession stand of an opera house, playhouse, or vaudeville theater. Toy theaters were assembled at home and performed for family members and guests, sometimes with live musical accompaniment. Toy theater saw a drastic decline in popularity with a shift towards realism on the European stage in the late 19th century, and again with the arrival of television after World War II. Toy theater has seen a resurgence in recent years among many puppeteers, authors and filmmakers and there are numerous international toy theater festivals throughout the Americas and Europe.\n\nThe original toy theaters were mass-produced replicas of popular plays, sold as kits that people assembled at home, including stage, scenery, characters and costumes. They were printed on paperboard, available at English playhouses and commercial libraries for \"a penny plain or two pence coloured.\" Hobbyists often went to great pains to not only hand-color their stages, but to embellish their toy theater personae with bits of cloth and tinsel. Just as the toy-sized stages diminished a play’s scale, their corresponding scripts tended to abridge the text, paring it down to key characters and lines for a shorter, less complicated presentation.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century more than 300 of London’s most popular plays saw issue as toy theaters. Publishers sent artists to the playhouses of Georgian and early-Victorian London to record the scenery, costumes and dramatic attitudes of the greatest successes of the day. The theatre management often provided these artists with a free seat, as the toy theatre sheets were excellent free advertising.\n\nStage theater of the early 19th century had been based more on spectacle than on depth of plot or character, and these characteristics lent themselves effectively to the format of toy theater. Toward the end of the 19th century, European popular drama had shifted its preference to the trend of Realism, marking a dramaturgical swing toward psychological complexity, character motivation and settings utilizing ordinary three-dimensional scenic elements. This trend in stage theater did not make an easy conversion to its toy counterpart, and with the fanciful dramas of 50 years prior being out of fashion, the toy theaters that remained in print fell into obsolescence. \n\nDespite its fall in popularity, toy theater remained in the realm of influential artists who championed its resurgence. In 1884 British author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote an essay in tribute of toy theater’s tiny grandeur entitled “Penny Plain, Twopence Coloured” in which he extolled the virtues of the dramas supplied by Pollock's. Other children’s authors like Lewis Carroll and Hans Christian Andersen also dabbled in toy theater, as did Oscar Wilde. The brothers Jack and William Butler Yeats both used toy theaters as mock-ups for their work in art and stagecraft. In the 20th century toy theater became a tool for the avant-garde, messed with by Futurist founder F.T. Marienetti as well as Pablo Picasso. Film directors like Ingmar Bergman and Orson Welles would use toy theaters as staging grounds for their cinematic masterpieces, and Laurence Olivier even made a toy theater of his film version of \"Hamlet\", mass-produced with a little paper cutout of himself in the starring role. But after its second wave boom, toy theater fell into a second recession, replaced in the 1950s, by a different box in people’s sitting rooms that needed no live operator and whose sets, characters, stories and musical numbers were beamed in electronically from miles away to be projected on the glass of a cathode ray tube: television.\n\nToy theater has been enjoying a revival in recent decades. Collectors and traditionalists perform restored versions of Victorian plays while experimental puppeteers push the form’s limits, adapting the works of Isaac Babel and Italo Calvino, as well as that of unsung storytellers, friends, neighbors, relatives, and themselves. Contemporary toy theater may utilize any available technology and cover any subject, and numerous international toy theater festivals occur regularly throughout the Americas and Europe, attracting many well-known actors, musicians and authors to their stages.\n\nMass-produced toy theaters are usually sold as printed sheets, either in black and white to be colored as desired, or as full-color images of the proscenium, scenery, sets, props and characters. The sheets are pasted onto thin cardboard, cut out, and then assembled for the purposes of the reenacting of a play. Figures are attached to small sticks, wires, or configurations of strings that allow them to move about the set. Some toy theaters and figures are enhanced with moving parts and special effects, and it is common for performances to include live or pre-recorded sound effects and music.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

From an early age, Yoshiko was exposed to Mandarin Chinese. Fumio Yamaguchi had some influential Chinese acquaintances, among whom were Li Jichun () and Pan Yugui (). By Chinese custom for those who became sworn brothers, they also became Yoshiko's \"godfathers\" （also known as \"nominal fathers\"）and bestowed upon her two Chinese names, Li Xianglan (Li Hsiang-lan) and Pan Shuhua (). (\"Shu\" in Shuhua and \"Yoshi\" in Yoshiko are written with the same Chinese character). Yoshiko later used the former name as a stage name and assumed the latter name while she was staying with the Pan family in Beijing.\n\nAs a youth Yoshiko suffered a bout of tuberculosis. In order to strengthen her breathing, the doctor recommended voice lessons. Her father initially insisted on traditional Japanese music, but Yoshiko preferred Western music and thus received her initial classical vocal education from an Italian dramatic soprano (Madame Podresov, married into White Russian nobility). She later received schooling in Beijing, polishing her Mandarin, accommodated by the Pan family. She was a coloratura soprano.\n\nYoshiko made her debut as an actress and singer in the 1938 film \"Honeymoon Express 蜜月快車\", by Manchuria Film Production. She was billed as Li Xianglan, pronounced Ri Kōran in Japanese. The adoption of a Chinese stage name was prompted by the film company's economic and political motives—a Manchurian girl who had command over both the Japanese and Chinese languages was sought after. From this she rose to be a star and \"Japan-Manchuria Goodwill Ambassadress\" (日満親善大使). The head of the Manchukuo film industry, General Masahiko Amakasu decided she was the star he was looking for: a beautiful actress fluent in both Mandarin and Japanese who could pass as Chinese and who had an excellent singing voice. The Chinese actors who appeared in the Manchuria Film Productions films were never informed that she was Japanese, but they suspected she was at least half-Japanese as she always ate her meals with the Japanese actors instead of with the Chinese actors, was given white rice to eat instead of the sorghum given to the Chinese, and was paid ten times more than the Chinese actors were. Though in her subsequent films she was almost exclusively billed as Li Xianglan, she appeared in a few as \"Yamaguchi Yoshiko.\" Many of her films bore some degree of promotion of the Japanese national policy (in particular pertaining to the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere ideology) and can be termed \"National Policy Films\" ().\n\nThe 1940 film \"China Nights\" (支那の夜), also known as \"Shanghai Nights\" (), by Manchuria Film Productions, is especially controversial. It is unclear whether it was a \"National Policy Film\" as it portrays Japanese soldiers in both positive and negative lights. In this film, Li Xianglan played a young woman of extreme anti-Japanese sentiment who falls in love with a Japanese man. A key turning point in the film has the young Chinese woman being slapped by the Japanese man, but instead of hatred, she reacts with gratitude. The film was met with great aversion among the Chinese audience as they believed that the Chinese female character was a sketch of debasement and inferiority. 23,000 Chinese people paid to see the film in 1943. But after the war, one of her classic songs, \"Suzhou Serenade\" (蘇州夜曲), was banned in China and continues to be. A few years later when confronted by angry Chinese reporters in Shanghai, Yoshiko apologized and cited as pretext her inexperienced youth at the time of filmmaking, choosing not to reveal her Japanese identity. Though her Japanese nationality was never divulged in the Chinese media until after the Sino-Japanese War, it was brought to light by Japanese press when she performed in Japan under her assumed Chinese name and as the Japan-Manchuria Goodwill Ambassadress. Oddly enough, when she visited Japan during this period, she was criticized for being too Chinese in dress and in language. \n\nIn 1943, Yoshiko appeared in the film \"Eternity\" (萬世流芳). The film was shot in Shanghai commemorating the centennial of the Opium War. A few top Chinese stars in Shanghai also appeared in the film and consequently endured the repercussions of controversy. Though the film, anti-British in nature, was a collaboration between Chinese and Japanese film companies, its anti-colonization undertone might also be interpreted as a satire of the Japanese expansion in east Asia. Despite all this, the film was a hit and Yoshiko became a national sensation. Her film theme songs with jazz/pop-like arrangements such as \"Candy-Peddling Song\" () and \"Quitting (Opium) Song\" () elevated her status to among the top singers in all Chinese-speaking regions in Asia overnight. Many songs recorded by Yoshiko during her Shanghai period became classics in Chinese popular music history. Other noteworthy hits include \"Tuberoses\"/\"Fragrance of the Night\" (夜來香), \"Ocean Bird\" (海燕), \"If Only\" (恨不相逢未嫁時), and \"Second Dream\" (第二夢). By the 1940s, she had become one of the Seven great singing stars.\n\nAt the end of World War II she was arrested by the Chinese government for treason and collaboration with the Japanese. After her childhood Russian friend helped locate Yamaguchi's Japanese birth certificate, she was cleared of all charges, and possibly the death penalty, since she was not a Chinese national after all. Before long in 1946, she resettled in Japan and launched a new acting career there under the name Yoshiko Yamaguchi, working with directors such as Akira Kurosawa. Several of her post-war films cast her in parts that dealt either directly or indirectly with her wartime persona as a bilingual and bicultural performer. For example in 1949, Shin-Toho studios produced \"Repatriation\" (帰国「ダモイ」), an omnibus film which told four stories about the struggles of Japanese trying to return to Japan from the Soviet Union after having been taken prisoners after the defeat. The following year, Yamaguchi starred with actor Ryo Ikebe in \"Escape at Dawn\" (暁の脱走) produced by Toho and based on the novel \"Shunpuden\" (春婦伝). In the book, her character was a prostitute in a military brothel, but for this film her character was rewritten as a frontline entertainer who falls into a tragic affair with a deserter (Ikebe). In 1952, Yamaguchi appeared in \"Woman of Shanghai\" (上海の女) in which she reprised her pre-war persona as a Japanese woman passing for Chinese, who becomes caught between the two cultures.\n\nIn the 1950s, she established her acting career as Shirley Yamaguchi in Hollywood and on Broadway (in the short-lived musical \"Shangri-La\") in the US. She married Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi in 1951. Yamaguchi was Japanese, but as someone who had grown up in China, she felt torn between two identities and later wrote she felt attracted to Noguchi as someone else who was torn between two identities. They divorced in 1956. She revived the Li Xianglan name and appeared in several Chinese-language films made in Hong Kong. Some of her 1950s Chinese films were destroyed in a studio fire and have not been seen since their initial releases. Her Mandarin hit songs from this period include \"Three Years\" (三年), \"Plum Blossom\" (梅花), \"Childhood Times\" (小時候), \"Only You\" (只有你), and \"Heart Song\" (心曲 – a cover of \"Eternally\"). She then returned to Japan and after retiring from the world of film in 1958, she appeared as a hostess and anchorwoman on TV talk shows. As a result of her marriage to the Japanese diplomat Hiroshi Ōtaka, she lived for a while in Burma (modern Myanmar). They remained married until his death in 2001.\n\nIn 1969, she became the host of \"The Three O'Clock You\" (Sanji no anata) TV show on Fuji Television, reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute as well as the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, Yamaguchi became very active in pro-Palestinian causes in Japan. In 1974, she was elected to the House of Councillors (the upper House of the Japanese parliament) as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, where she served for 18 years (three terms). She co-authored the book, \"Ri Kōran, Watashi no Hansei\" (Half My Life as Ri Kōran). She served as a Vice-President of the Asian Women's Fund. As part of the 1993 autumn honours list, she was decorated with the Gold and Silver Star of the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class.\n\nYamaguchi was considered by many Chinese in the post-World War II period to be a Japanese spy and thus a traitor to the Chinese people. This misconception was caused in part by Yamaguchi passing herself off as Chinese throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Her Japanese identity not being officially revealed until her post-war persecution nearly led to her execution as a Chinese traitor. She had always expressed her guilt for taking part in Japanese propaganda films in the early days of her acting career. Because of this, she did not visit China for about 20 years after the war, since she felt that the Chinese had not forgiven her. Despite her controversial past, Li Xianglan influenced future singers who covered her evergreen hits (such as Teresa Teng, Fei Yu-Ching, and Winnie Wei 韋秀嫻). Jacky Cheung recorded a cover of Tamaki Kōji's \"行かないで\" (\"Ikanaide\") and renamed it \"Lei Hoeng Laan.\" (The original version does not have any references to Li Xianglan and nor does the remake. The Chinese title instead refers to the unknowable quality and identity of the singer's lover.) In January 1991, a musical about her life was released in Tokyo, which generated controversy because its negative portrayal of Manchukuo upset many Japanese conservatives.\n\nYamaguchi was one of the first prominent Japanese citizens to acknowledge the history of Japanese brutality during the wartime occupation. She later campaigned for greater public awareness of that history and advocated paying reparations to so-called comfort women, Korean women who were forced into sex slavery by the Japanese military during the war.\n\nA recording of a 1950 concert performance in Sacramento, California was uncovered by a professor from the University of Chicago in 2012. The concert included six songs and was performed before an audience of Japanese-Americans, many of whom had likely been interned during World War II. Speaking in 2012 about the concert, Yamaguchi said: \"I sang with hope that I could offer consolation to the Japanese-Americans, as I heard that they had gone through hardships during the war.\" She died at the age of 94 in Tokyo in 2014 on the same day as one of her fellow Seven great singing stars Gong Qiuxia.\n\nShe was credited as Shirley Yamaguchi in the Hollywood movies \"Japanese War Bride\" (1952) and \"House of Bamboo\" (1955). She was once nicknamed \"The Judy Garland of Japan\".\n\nOther names used as movie actress:\n\n\n\n\n"}
