However, he fell out of favor in 1983 and lost his power. He made a strong political comeback during the democratic transition and was elected chairman of the Bulgarian Communist Party. He led the party to transform and adapt to the post-communist era. A party referendum supported his proposal to change the name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party. After winning the first democratic elections he did not become prime minister himself, instead he eventually supported a multi-party government led by Dimitar Popov. After losing the 1991 parliamentary elections he stepped down as party leader. In 2001 he retired as MP after having served for 39 years.\n\nAleksandar Lilov was born on 31 August 1933 in the village of Granichak, northwestern Vidin Province. He graduated Bulgarian Studies (philosophy) at Sofia University in 1962 and graduated doctoral studies in communist Social Science at the Academy of Public Sciences in Moscow. In 1975 he became an associate at the institution of art at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Six years later, he defended a doctoral thesis in 1981. He died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 79.\n\nLilov joined the Dimitrov Young Communist League in Vidin and rose to the ranks of its central committee in 1963. Six years later he joined the central Party organ and in 1971 he became a prominent member of the Communist Party. Lilov was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party from July 1974 to September 1983 and was also a secretary of the Central Committee of the Party from July 1972 to September 28, 1983. He was also a member of the State Council of Bulgaria from 1976 to 1983. By the end of the 70s he was viewed as the second most powerful member of the party. After the death of Lyudmila Zhivkova (General Secretary Todor Zhivkov's daughter) in 1981, Lilov's power began to wane. In 1983 he was removed from the Politburo after criticizing the General Secretary for his economic mismanagement and apparent lack of interest in current issues.\n\nAfter fading from the public view for six year, Lilov returned from Great-Britain - where he was when Zhivkov was forced to resign on November 10, 1989 - and was welcomed back among the leaders of the BCP. There he denounced the Revival Process (started by Zhivkov and internationally condemned) and allowed Bulgarian Muslims to reinstate their former names.\n\nDuring the 14th emergency congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (held in January - February 1990), the post of general secretary was abolished, and Lilov was elected to the new post of chairman. Under his leadership the party was dissolved and reorganized into the Bulgarian Socialist Party on April 3 following an party referendum. This transition brought about revolutionary change to the party's ideology, from Communism to Socialism (from far-left to left-wing). Change was also brought to the way the party was run in order to dismantle the totalitarian apparatus in the country. In September he was reelected as party chairman by a margin of 2 to 1 against the hopes of the liberals in the party who sought to remove the remains of the former Communist regime. He remained the party's leader until the end of 1991.\n\nHe led the Socialists through the first democratic elections in 1990, elected to adopt a new constitution, where his party won a majority of the seats (211 out of 400) and 47.15% of the votes. He did not become Prime Minister himself, instead continuing his support for the socialist government in place led by Andrey Lukanov. This came to an end when mass demonstrations and a general strike led to the formation of a government under the non-partisan judge Dimitar Popov in which the BSP participated alongside the UDF, BANU and independent experts.\n\nHis second election campaign in 1991 ended with defeat after his electoral alliance won only 33.1% of the votes and 106 seats (out of 240); finishing behind the Union of Democratic Forces who won 34.4% of the votes and 110 seats. Later that year he stepped down and as chairman of the party and was succeeded by Zhan Videnov. Lilov remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, a seat he held for 39 years (1962–2001). In 2001 he was the longest serving member of parliament.\n"}

{"id": "37600159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37600159", "title": "Architectural propaganda", "text": "Architectural propaganda\n\nArchitectural propaganda is the use of architecture, intentionally or unintentionally, to communicate an attitude or idea in a persuasive manner, often for an explicitly propagandic purpose. The use of architecture for propaganda purposes in order to influence attitudes, opinions, and feelings of the target audience can be found in many cultures across history. Since architecture itself is an expression of culture, the propaganda element of architecture can organically flow from the structure by nature of its being.\n\nThe fact that something may be used for propaganda is not a values statement about the thing itself. It is a simple truism that people are influenced by things around them and therefore, when those things around include architecture, people will be influenced by it as a part of an environment. This inherent quality of architecture then can be used by those with the desire to do so. This use is what transforms the architecture from a simple influence into a piece of propaganda.\n\nThe psychological dimension of architecture and propaganda means that even when a group or government has no direct intent to use architecture for propaganda purposes, the nature of architecture proceeding as it does from the human mind will express something about the designer and his or her culture. The architecture itself becomes an expression of the larger opinions of a cultural or social group which may then be impressed upon others. By virtue of observation of an architectural work, an individual may come to understand something about the original builder and his or her culture. Thus, even with no prior intent, architecture by its very nature has a built-in propaganda value.\n\nRichard Swett, the former Congressman from New Hampshire and US ambassador to Denmark, an architect by training proposed that architecture need not be limited simply to buildings and grand constructions, but rather that architectural design and design considerations should permeate every aspect of life. He proposed that since everything utilized and created is designed at some level, it is possible and indeed necessary to include a great deal of thought and effort in the design of everything from buildings to desk lamps, to silverware. Swett proposed that “examples of integrated artistic, social and environmental harmony created by architects who have served both their calling and the needs of society” are the ideal to be striven for in architectural design. He says that in Denmark, “all aspects of the design of a civilized life’s accouterments, from the shelter we need to the implements for feeding ourselves, are treated with the same high standards of design integrity and respect,” and proposes that American architecture and architects ought to follow a similar course. \"In one of its articles in 1953, the Architectural Forum recognised US’s export architecture as a diplomatic tool, appreciating it and presenting US as a state exercising political world leadership and cultural leadership with the latter being driven especially by the US‘s architecture.\" \n\nArchitecture is a profession that is inherently engaged in public diplomacy by the nature of what it creates and who interacts with it, and that therefore, architects need to consciously participate in public diplomacy through their work rather than unwittingly be a part of it with no awareness of their significance. “The fact is too many architects are seriously marginalized, and I would go so far as to say, intentionally isolated, from the political process that determines the zoning, funding and the complex social and legal regulations that control the building of our shared environment. This subject needs to be confronted, debated and discussed in detail.\" Swett concludes that the architectural profession would do well to develop “by assisting in the design of a blueprint that will frame the future influence of our profession beyond the limitations of bricks and mortar. Such a plan suggests that our fellow architects take up leadership roles in order to balance the tectonic, economic and political aspects of city/state planning more consciously. Thomas Jefferson also wrote in 1785: “I am proud to be an architect and don’t propose we go out and tear down any buildings. I do propose, however, we tear down some of the myths and misperceptions that architects have about public policy and vice versa.”” \n\nArchitectural propaganda is not limited simply to a given propaganda value or sum; rather, it has the ability to act in the wider realm of public diplomacy because of its importance and overreaching themes that touch all aspects of life. As such, when talking about Canadian public diplomacy, Evan Potter, a Professor of Communications at the University of Ottawa made the following points. He states that the entirety of public diplomacy must be thought of: \"(1) temporally, in three time frames; (2) as an essentially contested concept that has many labels, such as cultural diplomacy, political communication, international public relations, democracy building, propaganda, branding, and military information operations; (3) as an endeavor whose effectiveness is linked to the level of societal support and understanding at home; and (4) as a form of statecraft that is not exclusive to foreign ministries but that, according to Bruce Gregory, “cuts across all political, economic, and military instruments and is essential to their implementation and success.” Public diplomacy is not a single instrument or the exclusive preserve of a country’s foreign ministry; rather, it is a process, and as Gregory writes, it has “multiple components, each with their own organizations, budgets, tribal cultures, and rules for applying principles to behavior.” These themes are not limited simply to their obvious and stated public diplomacy dimensions, but also to the inherent propaganda and public diplomacy value of architecture itself. It is this connectivity that brings together Swett's and Potter's theories into a practicable and useful set of operational principles for architecture in both its propaganda and public diplomacy aspects. Different countries and groups have utilized the propaganda and public diplomacy aspects of architecture with varying degrees of success and continue to do so today. Below, expanded are some of these countries and groups with examples of their architectural propaganda and public diplomacy.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) is currently engaged in a prolonged public relations campaign with many other nations, the developing world particularly. This campaign has been termed a \"charm offensive\" by Joshua Kurlantzick in his book of the same name. Among the many elements of soft power used by the PRC is that of architecture. China has a rich architectural tradition to draw from and to publicize with. This allows the PRC government to promote tourism to famous architectural sites like the Great Wall or the Forbidden City. Furthermore, a rich architectural history combined with a desire to spread pro-PRC sentiment means that PRC funding of building projects abroad is increasingly common. \". . . Many scholars associated China's aid with giant white-elephant projects, like large buildings and ministries and similar structures.\"\n\nIn Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony possessed of largely Portuguese-style architecture, in the capital city, Maputo, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building In East Timor, also a former Portuguese colony, the PRC funded and promoted the construction of that country's foreign ministry and funded the creation of a new East Timor embassy in Beijing despite the long-standing antagonism between the two parties.\n\nThe use of architecture to fuel tourism in the PRC has been highly successful. China is the third most visited country in the world. The number of overseas tourists was 55.98 million in 2010. Foreign exchange income was 45.8 billion U.S. dollars, the world's fourth largest in 2010. The number of domestic tourist visits totaled 1.61 billion, with a total income of 777.1 billion yuan. While certainly all of this tourism cannot be attributed to architecture alone, a significant number of the tourist sites visited possess inherent architectural value.\n\nAs part of a corporation's overall marketing and branding campaign, when it comes to constructing a central office or corporate headquarters, architectural marketing or propaganda can be employed. A company's headquarters can be the ultimate expression or symbol of that company. A building can make a statement to potential customers, clients, employees, or rivals. The architecture utilized in a corporate building can indicate general philosophies held by the corporation or principles it wishes to espouse. In some cases, corporate architecture can be used to show the success of a given corporation versus its rivals.\n\nFamous examples of corporate architecture can be found in cities around the world. In some cities, skyscrapers serve as unforgettable propaganda for the corporations for which they are named. In other places, corporate sponsorship of sports arenas, performing arts venues, and the sprawling headquarters of the corporations themselves serve as propaganda for their owners. A fine example of corporate architecture and propaganda can be found in the Chrysler Building in New York City. Built from 1928-1930, the Chrysler building gave the Chrysler Corporation a giant piece of advertising and propaganda. Not only could Chrysler lay claim to the tallest building in the world at the time of its completion, but the stainless steel spire of the building was styled after the grilles of then current Chrysler road cars. This huge building served as a massive statement of the success and power of the Chrysler Corporation while at the same time advertising its products to the world through the very architecture of the building.\n\nMexican drug cartels have utilized architecture as part of their overall propaganda campaign. Large houses called \"\"narco mansions\" or \"narco castillos\" (drug mansions or castles)\" are becoming an increasingly common feature of the recent drug conflicts in Mexico. In order to overwhelm and sway over local populaces and potential rivals, these demonstrations of wealth and power are built at least partly for their psychological value.\n\nNazi architecture adopted many elements of neoclassicism and of art deco in keeping with Adolf Hitler's personal fascination with Ancient Rome. Part of the Nazi cult involved the overaweing and subsuming of the individual into the greater German \"volk\". This giving over of oneself to the whole was also expressed through Nazi architecture. The three primary expressed roles found in Nazi architecture are the (i)Theatrical, (ii)Symbolic, and (iii)Didactic, but each of these roles has its own place within the larger sphere of propaganda value.\n\nNazi architecture was designed to make the individual feel small and insignificant through its use of high ceilings. For example, at Nuremberg rallies, the feeling produced by the use of massed groups coupled with the architecture of the Zepplintribune architecture was to create wonder and a powerful feeling of community. Indeed, Hitler stated in one of his Nuremberg rally speeches, \"Not every one of you sees me and I do not see every one of you. But I feel you and you feel me!\". At the Nuremberg rallies, the overall effect of architecture was further enhanced through the use of many searchlights pointed directly upward in order to create a \"Cathedral of Light\" that even further served to invite the individual to buy into the Nazi worldview.\n\nAnother prominent conceptual feature of Nazi architecture was the \"Theory of Ruin Value\", first put forward by Albert Speer, Hitler's personal architect. This theory postulated that in order for a civilization's influence to pass beyond the existence of the civilization itself, it was important that aesthetically pleasing and impressive ruins be left by the dilapidated buildings of that civilization. This theory, too, took inspiration from the ancient Romans and Greeks in attempting to emulate the even architectural remains of their civilizations with Nazi ones in thousands of years. Since the original inspiration for Nazi architecture was itself, the ancient Romans and Greeks, it was important to Hitler that at the end of the Thousand Year Reich, the remains would inspire others as Roman ruins had done for him.\n\nAn interesting remaining piece of Nazi architecture can be found in the former Berlin Tempelhof Airport which closed all airport operations in 2008. The main terminal was designed and built during the late 1930s and early 1940s according to a design by Ernst Sagebiel following the ideas of Speer and Hitler including that of ruin value. It was designed to be the main hub for Hitler's redesigned Berlin, to be called Germania. When completed, it was the world's largest building and today, should the building fall into disrepair, Speer and Hitler's ruin value theory may be demonstrated.\n\nThe liberal ideas of the United States' Founding Fathers heavily influenced American Federal architecture. The ideas and creations of the Ancient Greeks and Romans held great sway not only in the formation of the United States and her founding documents, but also in the ways American ideals came to be expressed physically when it came to designing the Federal City, Washington, DC. \n\nThe Embassy of the Hellenic Republic in Washington, DC has hosted lectures on the topic of Greek architectural influence on the Western World and in the United States in particular. Their website says, \"Thomas Jefferson once wrote that “design activity and political thought are indivisible.” He believed that architecture was an important vehicle for expressing political ideals, and he worked to ensure that Washington, as the seat of the American democracy, would become a city of stately and sophisticated buildings based on classical precedents.\" It can clearly be seen that while the modern state of Greece did not even exist at the time of the construction of many American government buildings, the Hellenic Republic is still able to derive some propaganda value and great national prestige from the influence of the ancient Greeks upon world history and architecture.\n\nThe style of construction found in the Lincoln Memorial closely parallels the design of a classical Greek temple. It utilizes a colonnade of thirty-six Doric columns surrounding a central interior made up of three chambers. It serves as a memorial for American President Abraham Lincoln and for his service to the United States during the United States' Civil War. The neoclassical design serves to reinforce the validity of the values Americans believed this president embodied at the time of the Memorial's construction. This itself is to some degree a self reinforcement, and thereby propaganda promoting the American values expounded therein.\n\nThe intent to showcase President Lincoln's connection to the founding values of the United States and to the values of the ancients Greeks and Romans is shown in the architecture of the monument itself. It is the implementation and exhibition of these values combined with the text inscribed on the memorial that transforms it from a simple honoring of a man into the honoring of all that he has been perceived to stand for. Even though the memorial is in President Lincoln's honor, it transcends this purpose and becomes a site for connection with American values themselves. The use of ancient Greek architecture allows for the transfer of the collective American values as passed down from the Lincoln, the Founding Fathers, and the ancient Greeks before them. This is consummate propaganda, it takes values, personifies them and holds them up as something to be aspired to, all through the use of architecture.\n\nAn interesting case study into the public diplomacy effects of architecture within a fixed culture and location is provided by the case of the United States embassy in London. “Public buildings project the identity of a country’s peoples, culture and aspirations. American public buildings convey the collective identity of our rich, culturally diverse, and increasingly complex society. An American embassy’s design expresses to the world the ideals of American democracy—the optimism, hope and promise of our time. By communicating the transcendent values that define the United States as a nation, the new Embassy of the United States of America in London has the potential to embody a new age of American openness, transparency, and renewed commitment to international collaboration. Architecture itself becomes an act of public diplomacy; as the United States Department of State envisions, the design of the new Embassy “far transcends architecture and engineering… it is fully and firmly within the realm of international diplomacy.”” The old US Embassy in Grosvenor Square became the subject of intense dislike by the local inhabitants of London when, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, “the area surrounding the embassy was transformed into a fortress, complete with heavily armed guards, ugly security corridors and unsightly bollards – all of which defaced the elegant square.” “The new US Embassy integrates aspects of British landscaping and site design, rather than high fences, to create security”; “The main building itself will be “clad in glass to emphasise a transparent, open atmosphere.” The use of architecture itself in the design of the new US Embassy in London to present American ideals and values through the building itself is ingenious and exhibits well thought out and executed public diplomacy and propaganda value in its design.\n"}

Like scissors, a board shear uses two blades to apply shear stress exceeding the paper's shear strength in order to cut. The stationary blade forms the edge of the cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm. Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.\n\nThe earliest known reference to a board shear comes from an 1842 supplement to \"Penny Magazine\", titled \"A Day at a Bookbinder's\", which included a drawing of a board shear with many of the major developments already present. An 1854 article on the history of bookbinding from \"The Bookbinder's Trade Circular\" describes early board shears, and places their development in \"about 1836\"; credit for the invention is ascribed to Warren De La Rue in the \"Reports of the Juries\" from the Great Exhibition of 1851.\n\nMany modifications of the basic design were made in the 19th century, with changes such as rack-and-pinion adjustment for the outer gauge and improved clamp bars. By the late 19th century, board shears were substantively the same as modern machines, and many 19th-century board shears are still in use today.\n\n"}

The catalyst for this was an opportunity given to them by an advertising agency to help with the corporate identity of British Gas. They worked for clients including Kodak, Lowrey, London Docklands and Legal and General.\n\nThe business grew slowly and by 1984 had grown to 10 employees working across a broad range of assignments, focusing mainly on graphic design projects. In 1984 Dave Allen joined from Kodak and helped accelerate growth winning work from Citizen, Mazda and Castrol.\n\nIn 1986, Sampson Tyrrell was acquired by the WPP Group plc. This resulted in a period of rapid growth and by 1991 the company was over 100 people in London. In 1992 Sampson and Allen led the formation of Enterprise identity Group with Jim Johnson of Anspach Grossman Portugal, Flavio Gomez of Sidjakov Berman Gomez and Miles Young of Ogilvy and Mather in Asia who owned a design network based in Hong Kong and Taiwan called Artistree.

{"id": "10735056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10735056", "title": "Brittle Books Program", "text": "Brittle Books Program\n\nThe Brittle Books Program is an initiative carried out by the National Endowment for the Humanities at the request of the United States Congress. The initiative began officially between 1988 and 1989 with the intention to involve the eventual microfilming of over 3 million endangered volumes.\n\nIn the beginning half of the 20th century it became apparent that the use of acidic wood-pulp paper, common since the 1850s, was causing paper materials to slowly burn. This has been referred to as the slow fire. A statement submitted to the House of Representatives estimated that there were 80 million brittle books in North American libraries, 12 million of which were unique titles. As mass deacidification efforts proved costly and inconsistent, librarians and archivists began looking for more practical ways to preserve the intellectual content of the decaying material. Microfilm, one of the most stable and durable mediums around at the time, was decided to be the most reasonable alternative.\n\n\nWilliam Barrow was a pioneer conservator in the library science field. He connected the paper strength or lack thereof (brittle paper)to the acidity of the groundwood used to make wood pulp after the 1850s. \nWith his own observations of his collection and tests conducted, he announced to the library community that acid deterioration begins to show signs after 20,40 and 80 years.\n\nAs with other National Endowment for the Humanities programs, the Brittle Books Program is a partnership program, meaning that qualifying institutions must apply for grants in order to participate. Should the institution be accepted, they are required to share at least 33% of the program's costs. Unlike other National Endowment for the Humanities preservation funding initiatives, the Brittle Books program does require that an institution in each state must be awarded a grant. The projects are largely run at the state level with the National Endowment for the Humanities providing methodologies, assuring a standard level of quality, and connecting the efforts of the various institutions. To be awarded a grant as part of the Brittle Books Program, institutions were required to abide by five basic conditions:\n\nWhile there is a deacidification method that can successfully lower the acidity in brittle books, many public libraries do not have the funding to implement standard programs to halt the deterioration taking place in these institutions. Some repositories have the resources to send books for a deacidification wash in stages.\n\nDeacidification washes are usually a viable option for most repositories as books can be sent in bulk; however, only books of excellent physical quality may be sent. The wash process is rather aggressive and any deformities in a book may cause damage to already brittle specimens. Therefore, libraries would have to first repair those books in less than desirable condition - specifically elements of the binding, leaf attachments, and text attachments - before deacidification. These extra conservation efforts would increase the costs of deacidification.\n\nAnother option to preserve brittle books is to perform paper splitting. This process dissects a book by its leaf and text attachment and treats each sheet of paper individually. Supervised by a book conservator, a paper conservator, and a conservation specialist, pages are literally pulled apart - fronts from backs - and a piece of alkaline paper is placed in between. The acid pages are then sandwiched back together with a non-acid buffer between them to slow the deterioration process. However, only ZFB (the Zentrum für Bucherhaltung) offers this procedure (also called mechanical paper splitting). They claim the process is so refined, they have successfully split cigarette paper. Washes will de-acidify the paper though they will remain brittle; but paper splitting increases the strength and flexibility of the paper via the extra new sheet of buffered paper and the ZFB process includes de-acidification washes.\n\nMicroform is a reasonable option for Brittle Book preservation mainly because microfilm can be usable for 500 years, so long as it is stored in proper conditions and a microfilm reader is accessible. Even microfiche is easier to store than microfilm, provided organizational practices prevent the divestment of sheets from their filing system. Despite its proven record of durability, microform is no longer a preferred method of digitization because it lacks the accessibility that modern electronic digitization provides.\n\nDigital conversion of physical items is the preferred method, despite an estimated five-year longevity for most computer files. As proper archival-quality digitization requires use of large, uncompressed TIFF files, storage can be a significant cost, especially for public libraries. Moreover, copyright law restrains the ability to digitize all brittle books. While the library is authorized to make a copy of a book it cannot obtain through reasonable means, having a digital copy offers the possibility of unauthorized distribution if circulated in this format.\n\nMany repositories, such as the University of Kansas, opt for preservation-quality photocopies. A list-serv is utilized for the posting of titles so a consortium of libraries can benefit from a reduced cost in replication so they may maintain their circulating collections. Maintained by OCLC, the submissions are processed at the OCLC Preservation Service Center and OCLC retains the digital copies produced as to defer any copyright issues away from the repositories subscribing to the service.\n\nAs libraries move into the digital era, preservation practices attempt to move with them. Current and future projects in preserving brittle volumes are more likely to involve scanning and digitization than microfilming. A recent example of such a program is the \"Digitizing America's Imprints\" project at the Library of Congress which received a $2 million grant in 2007.\n\n"}

{"id": "1458751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1458751", "title": "Celtiberian script", "text": "Celtiberian script\n\nThe Celtiberian script is a Paleohispanic script that was the main writing system of the Celtiberian language, an extinct Continental Celtic language, which was also occasionally written using the Latin alphabet. This script is a direct adaptation of the northeastern Iberian script, the most frequently used of the Iberian scripts.\n\nAll the Paleohispanic scripts, with the exception of the Greco-Iberian alphabet, share a common distinctive typological characteristic: they represent syllabic values for the stop consonants, and monophonemic values for the rest of consonants and vowels. They are thus to be classed as neither alphabets nor syllabaries; rather, they are mixed scripts normally identified as semi-syllabaries. There is no agreement about how the Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries originated; some researchers conclude that they derive only from the Phoenician alphabet, while others believe the Greek alphabet was also involved.\n\nThe basic Celtiberian signary contains 26 signs rather than the 28 signs of the original model, the northeastern Iberian script, since the Celtiberians omitted one of the two rhotic and one of the three nasals. The remaining 26 signs comprised 5 vowels, 15 syllabic signs and 6 consonants (one lateral, two sibilants, one rhotic and two nasals). The sign equivalent to Iberian \"s\" is transcribed as \"z\" in Celtiberian, because it is assumed that it sometimes expresses the fricative result of an ancient dental stop (\"d\"), while the Iberian sign \"ś\" is transcribed as \"s\". As for the use of the nasal signs, there are two variants of the Celtiberian script: In the eastern variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign \"ḿ\", while in the western variant, the excluded nasal sign was the Iberian sign \"m\". This is interpreted as evidence of a double origin of the Celtiberian script. Like one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the western variant of Celtiberian shows evidence of having allowed the voiced stops \"g\" and \"d\" to be differentiated from their respective voiceless counterparts, \"k\" and \"t\", by adding a stroke to the voiceless signs. This is known as the ‘dual system’ in Paleohispanic scripts, which otherwise do not distinguish between pairs of voiceless and voiced stops (\"p:b, t:d\" and \"k:g\").\n\nThe Celtiberian inscriptions have been found mainly in the Ebro valley and near the sources of the Tagus and Douro rivers, where Roman and Greek sources place the Celtiberian people. The Celtiberian inscriptions were made on different types of objects (silver and bronze coins, ceramic receptacles, bronze plaques and tesseras, amphores, stones, spindle-whorls, etc.). There are just under two hundred surviving inscriptions, one of which is exceptionally long: the third Botorrita bronze plaque (Zaragoza) with more than three thousand signs containing a census of nearly 250 people. Almost always the direction of the writing is left to right. The fact that nearly all the Celtiberian inscriptions were found out of archaeological context does not allow a precise chronology to be established, but it seems that the earliest inscriptions in the Celtiberian script date from the 2nd century BCE while the latest ones date from the 1st century BCE.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21775829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21775829", "title": "Cong Abbey", "text": "Cong Abbey\n\nCong Abbey also known as the Royal Abbey of Cong, is a historic site located at Cong, on the borders of counties Galway and Mayo, in Ireland's province of Connacht. The ruins of the former Augustinian abbey mostly date to the 13th century and have been described as featuring some of finest examples of medieval ecclesiastical architecture in Ireland.\n\nIn the early 7th century, a church was built at this site, reportedly by Saint Feichin. A later building was destroyed by fire in 1114. Within the next twenty years or so, Turlough Mor O’Connor, the High King of Ireland, refounded the abbey. Raiders from Munster destroyed the buildings in 1137 but they were rebuilt by King Turlough. The Abbey was refounded as an Augustinian settlement in 1138. It was one of the earliest Augustinian settlements south of Armagh which was founded in 1126.\n\nIn 1198, his son, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (Rory O'Connor), Ireland's last High King, constructed new buildings and also lived the last 15 years of his life at the abbey. He died here and was reportedly briefly buried in the abbey before being exhumed and re-interred at Clonmacnoise.\n\nCong Abbey was also closely associated with the O'Duffy family at least from 1097 to 1501. The Annals of the Four Masters record that in 1150, Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, Archbishop of Connacht, died at Cong aged 75.\n\nThe Norman knight, William de Burgh, attacked Cong in 1203, and again the abbey was rebuilt.\n\nIn the 1307 the abbey was reconstructed and dedicated to St Mary. Cong Abbey was suppressed sometime after 1542 and later fell into ruins.\n\nThe last (nominal) abbot was Father Patrick Prendergast, parish priest of Cong from 1795 until his death in 1829. He was the preserver of the Cross of Cong. After his death, the cross was bought by James MacCullagh for the Royal Irish Academy.\n\nThe first restoration of the abbey was started by Benjamin Guinness in 1855, soon after he had bought nearby Ashford Castle in 1852.\n\nThe remains of Cong Abbey have been praised as featuring some of the finest examples of early gothic architecture and masonry in Ireland. The present church, and possibly the fragmentary cloister where the monks worked and prayed, belong to the rebuilding of the early 13th century. The north doorway of the church, and the elaborate doorways that open onto the cloister from the east range of the monastery, may pre-date the attack by William de Burgo. The doorway with two fine windows on either side belongs to the chapter house, where the monastery’s daily business was conducted as well as a chapter of the rule being read each day. This was also where the community gathered to confess their sins publicly. The sculpture in the abbey, which is some of the finest in Ireland, suggests links to French styles of the period.\n\nThe grounds of the abbey also contain a monks’ fishing house, probably built in the 15th or 16th century, on an island in the River Cong leading towards nearby Lough Corrib. The house is built on a platform of stones over a small arch which allows the river to flow underneath the floor. There is a trapdoor in the floor in which the fish may have been kept fresh. According to local tradition, a line was connected from the fishing house to the monastery kitchen to alert the cook to fresh fish.\n\nCong Abbey is a national monument in the care of the Commissioners for Public Works.\n\n\n"}

In 1578, Mark Scaliot produced a lock and chain that were attached to a flea. The first recorded flea circus dates back to the early 1820s, when an Italian impresario called Louis Bertolotto advertised an “extraordinary exhibition of industrious fleas” on Regent Street, London. Some flea circuses persisted in very small venues in the United States as late as the 1960s. The flea circus at Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, Manchester, England, was still operating in 1970. At least one genuine flea circus still performs (at the annual Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany) and Svensons in the UK occasionally use real fleas, but most flea circuses are a sideline of magicians and clowns, and use electrical or mechanical effects instead of real fleas.\n\nFleas typically live only for a few months and are not trained. Fleas are observed to see if they have a predisposition for jumping or walking. Once sorted, they are harnessed by carefully wrapping a thin gold wire around their neck. Once in the harness, the fleas usually stay in it for life. The harnesses are attached to the props and the strong legs of the flea allow them to move objects significantly larger than themselves. Jumping fleas are used for kicking small lightweight balls. They are carefully given a ball; when they try to jump away (which is not possible because of the harness), they shoot the ball instead. Running fleas can pull small carts and vehicles or rotate a Ferris wheel.\n\nThere are historical reports of fleas glued to the base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought to escape, giving the impression of playing instruments.\n\nSome flea circuses may appear to use real fleas, but in fact do not. A variety of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical devices have been used to augment exhibits. In some cases, these mechanisms are responsible for all of the \"acts\", with loose fleas in the exhibit maintaining the illusion. These circuses are known as \"Humbug\" flea circuses. Michael Bentine gave a mechanical flea circus a regular slot on his television show, \"It's a Square World\" in the 1960s. In much the same way that viewers know that a woman will not actually be cut in half, the magician's showmanship allows viewers to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the show.\n\nCurrent flea circuses:\n\nIn the 1990s, María Fernanda Cardoso toured the world with her installation art flea circus.\n\nProfessor Heckler's flea circus (in residence at Hubert's Dime Museum in Times Square, New York until 1957) can be seen in the background of the films \"The Thief\" and \"Easy Rider\". L. Bertolotto ran a famous flea circus in Regent Street, London.\n\nFlea circuses have featured in cartoons, films, television shows, music, and novels.\n\n\n"}

The company is based in Edison, New Jersey, and distributes throughout the United States and Canada as well as in Europe, Japan, Australia, and South America. GUND is currently run by third generation family owner Bruce Raiffe whose grandfather Jacob Swedlin purchased the company from the original founder (Adolph Gund) in 1925. \nThe company is best known for its line of Teddy bears, and holds or has held licensing agreements with companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Street, Uglydolls, Boo, the World's Cutest Dog, Grumpy Cat, and Pusheen. It has won multiple awards during its 125+ years and was also the face of a United States Postal Service stamp. GUND is headquartered in Edison, New Jersey and currently a division of Spin Master, which acquired the company from Enesco in March 2018.\n\nGUND was founded in 1898 by Adolf Gund. He was born in Germany and resided in Norwalk, Connecticut before settling in New York City. He started GUND as a small toy and novelty company which was incorporated under the name Gund Manufacturing Company in 1910. In the early years, GUND used GEE as the company slogan in advertising on product labels. GUND produced its first products in loft factories around New York City. It moved from location to location as it expanded, starting off on Third Avenue and eventually moving to Ninth Street by 1922. The moves were all prompted by the need for larger manufacturing quarters.\nIn the early 1900s, GUND received numerous patents that introduced various mechanisms into plush toys. Once such patent was for what was described as a \"springing dog.\" The design called for a mechanism to be placed inside the stuffed animal which would cause it to jump, \"bringing it to life.\" Another patent was for a walking mechanism which allowed the plush to walk. One of the company's most notable patents was for a \"ride-on duck\" which was a duck for children to ride on. It had wheels that operated a working duck bill which moved up and down as the wheels turned. The ride-on duck was produced by GUND for approximately 10 years commencing in 1912. GUND also secured many other patents for toys such as the wind-up walking plush, dancing toys, and walking toys.\n\nGUND created many of the industry standards in its early years, including safety standards and the manufacturing processes for toys. It continued to market its products under the moniker GEE up until the late 1920s, as evidenced in various advertisements in Playthings and other toy magazines. The company was eventually sold when Adolf Gund retired in 1925.\n\nDuring the early years of the company, Adolf Gund was the mentor to Jacob Swedlin, a Russian immigrant who came to the United States in 1907. Gund taught Swedlin to become a cutter and pattern maker, teaching him the ins and outs of the company. When Gund retired in 1925, he sold the company to Swedlin for $1,500. Swedlin brought his brothers Abe and John on board with the company, which began rapid expansion. Jacob oversaw design and production, Abe acted as the chief financial officer, and John ran sales and promotions.\nSome of the most notable GUND products in the 1930s included its line of Easter Bunnies which continue to be one of its most popular products. It also introduced \"puppy purses,\" a stuffed animal dog that doubled as a purse. GUND also became the first licensor of cartoon characters, producing plush toy versions of Popeye, Mickey Mouse, Felix the Cat, and Tigger. Its relationship with The Walt Disney Company began in 1947 and contributed to expansion of GUND. The deal with Disney allowed GUND to supply every major toy retailer in the United States with licensed Disney merchandise.\n\nIn the 1940s, GUND received trade mark registrations for two versions of its logos, both of which can be seen on its products during that time. One of the logos was a lower-case \"g\" with bunny ears which became synonymous with the company and its products. The popularity of the logo sparked the creation of a new plush character known as \"GUNDy.\" GUNDy became the company mascot and grew into merchandising that included the \"GUND Club.\"\nDuring World War II in the early 1940s, GUND did not manufacture its products according to prior demand. To support the war effort, GUND only offered its products on a quota allotment. It also produced a doll in an army uniform as its way to encourage the purchase of war bonds. After the war, GUND began rapid expansion, releasing new products, including many new Disney characters in conjunction with the opening of Disneyland in California in 1955. It moved into a new manufacturing center in Brooklyn in 1957, a location that would produce its toys until 1974.\n\nBy 1969, GUND had become dependent on its licensing agreement with Disney for the majority of its business. Herbert Raiffe, the son-in-law of John Swedlin, became the company president in 1969 after Swedlin's passing. Raiffe began moving GUND away from its licensing agreements and shifted the focus to internal design. The company launched new products that included the \"Bag Full of Laughs,\" a sound mechanism placed in a fabric sack and sewn into a plush.\nDuring the 1970s, GUND expanded its product line by releasing toys and plush popular in other countries. This included beanies and Gonk toys. In 1972, GUND was able to expand again thanks to Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, two panda bears gifted to the United States from China as part of that country's panda diplomacy efforts. The plush industry had a huge demand for panda stuffed animals, with GUND leading the way with manufacturing and distribution. Raiffe was credited by publications such as Forbes for GUND marketing efforts of the bears.\n\nThe 1980s brought about one of GUND's most prominent branding campaigns, known as \"Gotta Getta GUND.\" The campaign is credited as making GUND one of the most recognized toy companies in the United States. During this decade, GUND also expanded its offering of stuffed bears, releasing its collectible series of bears called the Signature Collection. Each bear was signed by the Rita Raiffe, GUND’s Director of Design and sold in limited quantities. In 1986 it released 60 new items, the most ever since the company was formed.\n\nIn 1993, Bruce Raiffe became President of GUND. Prior to that time he served as the company's Marketing Director and later Vice President.\nGUND celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1998. As part of the celebration, GUND auctioned off a 100th anniversary bear which raised $100,000 for four children's charities. The bear was one-of-a-kind and purchased by Yoshihiro Sekiguchi who placed it in one of three Teddy bear museums he owned in Japan. It was the 100th anniversary of the Theodore Roosevelt \"teddy bear\" that brought about GUND's next milestone. In 2002, the United States Postal Service used a 1948 teddy bear of GUND to grace a 37 cent stamp in honor of the event.\nGUND entered into a licensing agreement with Sesame Street in 2003.\n\nGUND was purchased by Enesco, the giftware manufacturer best known for its line of Precious Moments figurines. GUND joined Enesco's other recently purchased brands which included Boyds Bears, Our Name is Mud, philoSphie's and Jubilee Art. Bruce Raiffe remained with the company on a consultant type basis, but returned in 2011 when he was again appointed president of GUND.\nGUND continued to take on new licensing agreements after being purchased by Enesco. One of the most notable was that of the Uglydolls line of plush toys which it signed in 2012. The same year it signed an agreement for \"Boo, the World's Cutest Dog\". It also added \"Grumpy Cat\" in 2013 and \"Pusheen\" in 2014.\nGUND went through rebranding in late 2015. It included a redesigned logo that reflects its signature plush toys. This new identity system was designed by a NYC-based digital branding agency Cynda Media Lab, and it received several national and international design awards, including 2016 Communication Arts Design Annual Award , 2017 HOW Logo Design Award , 2017 iF Design Award, and 2017 A'Design Award. It also released more than 200 new items as part of its 2016 campaign. It was in late 2015 that Enesco was purchased by private equity fund Balmoral Funds.\n\nGUND's most recent campaign is for a charitable cause that involves \"giving huggable joy to children in need,\" and incorporating social media with the hashtag #howdoyouhug \n\nGUND is the manufacturer of plush stuffed animals. It sells over 1500 products including Gund, Baby Gund, Gund Bears, Gund Snuffles teddy bears, and Gund Holiday. Gund is known for under-stuffing their products to make them softer than competing teddy bears. One of GUND's most popular bears is Snuffles, a plush the company launched in the 1981. Snuffles was one of the first plushes to contain soft stuffing which began a trend in the industry. \"Snuffles has been a beloved GUND teddy bear for over 30 years, with its popular crescent moon design.\" Some of GUND's popular products include Philbin, Peek-a-boo bear, Spunky, My First Teddy, and Sesame Street Elmo.\n\nGUND has received numerous awards throughout the company history, including multiple Tillywig awards and American International Toy Fair awards.\n\n"}

Just Buffalo Literary Center’s mission is to create and strengthen communities through the literary arts. And for more than 40 years, Just Buffalo Literary Center has brought the world’s greatest writers to Buffalo, hosted poetry events, and readings, and supported the development of young writers.\n\nJust Buffalo Literary Center's business office is currently located above the Western New York Book Arts Center on Washington Street.\n\nJust Buffalo began in 1975 when founder Debora Ott hosted a reading featuring Diane di Prima at the Allentown Community Center. In the following years, notable authors and poets such as Robert Creeley, Ed Dorn, Alice Notley, Maureen Owen, and Ted Berrigan came to Buffalo to participate in readings offered by what had by then become \"Just Buffalo\".\nThe organization proceeded to host writing workshops for writers of all-ages and published a literary magazine. It also had a radio show.\n\nIn 1982, Just Buffalo Literary Center established its renowned Writers in Education program, providing in-school creative writing programs for young people. At their peak, this program served approximately 4,000 students per year. After more than two decades of stewarding community-based literary programs and establishing Just Buffalo Literary Center as a national presence on the literary scene, Debora left the organization in 1998. She hired Michael Kelleher as Artistic Director in the months before she left. Ed Taylor served as Executive Director from 1998-2001.\n\nLaurie Dean Torrell took over as Executive Director in 2002, ushering in a new era. During her tenure, Just Buffalo Literary Center has experienced an extraordinary expansion. It moved from the Tri-Main Center to the Market Arcade Building in 2005, a change which marked the beginning of a groundbreaking administrative collaboration with CEPA and Big Orbit Galleries. All three organizations benefited from this long-term effort that involves shared resources and staff as well as a joint education effort, Writing With Light. In 2016, Just Buffalo Literary Center moved from the Market Arcade Building to its current home on the second floor at the corner of Washington and Mohawk in downtown Buffalo.\n\nJust Buffalo Literary Center's program office staff currently consists of Laurie Dean Torrell, Executive Director; Barbara Cole, Artistic Director; Noah Falck, Education Director; Kristen Pope, Development Director.\n\nBABEL is an international literary lecture series that brings notable authors to Buffalo to speak four times per year. It is cosponsored by Hallwalls. It was conceived of in 2006 by Michael Kelleher, who was at the time Just Buffalo's Artistic Director. The series was launched in 2007. Past authors have included Nobel Prize winners Orhan Pamuk, Derek Walcott and V.S. Naipaul, as well as global literary icons Isabel Allende, Amos Oz, Salman Rushdie, A.S. Byatt, Chinua Achebe and many others.\n\nBABEL was initially hosted in folk-musician Ani Difranco's recording space, \"Babeville\", in the old Asbury Delaware United Methodist Church, until it outgrew the space late in its second season and moved to Kleinhans Music Hall.\n\nIn 2009, BABEL was awarded \"Most Innovative Arts Programming (any artform)\" by Buffalo Spree Magazine. \n\nThe BABEL series has been hailed by the Buffalo News as:\n\nIn describing BABEL in its first year, Kelleher states:\n\nFrom Just Buffalo Literary Center's official website:\n\nBABEL is headed into its 11th season in 2017-18 and will feature Terry Tempest Williams, Toni Morrison, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Junot Diaz.\n\nBig Night is a multi-disciplinary poetry series featuring poets from around the country alongside local artists in other media such as music, film, video, and visual art. It is hosted at the Western New York Book Arts Center in downtown Buffalo. \n\nWriting with Light is the name for Just Buffalo's joint educational programs. In partnership with CEPA Gallery, Writing With Light offers multidisciplinary school programs such as “Picturing Poetry,” which takes a school-based, multidisciplinary approach in order to combine creative writing with photography and other art forms.\n\nSpotlight on Youth is an open mic series open to artists aged 12-21 that meet at the Smith Theatre in Shea's Performing Arts Center six times per year.\n"}

Vehicular traffic runs south on this one-way street.\n\nLudlow Street was named after Lieutenant Augustus Ludlow, the naval officer who was second-in-command to Captain James Lawrence on the USS \"Chesapeake\" during the ship’s engagement with HMS \"Shannon\" on June 1, 1813. It was to Ludlow that Lawrence said \"Don't give up the ship.\"\n\nThe land that is now Ludlow Street was once part of the huge De Lancey Estate, which had been confiscated from James De Lancey after the Revolutionary War, due to his status as a Loyalist, and auctioned off. By the early 19th century, speculative builders had constructed decent housing for workers on Ludlow Street, as well as other streets nearby, such as Eldridge, Forsyth and Chrystie Streets. At mid-century, Ludlow was in the middle of \"Kleindeutschland\", where large numbers of German-speaking immigrants had settled, and was one of the informal boundaries of the Jewish section of the neighborhood, along with Grand, Stanton, and Pitt Streets.\n\nAs far back as 1962 \"Theatre of Eternal Music\" members Tony Conrad and Angus MacLise lived and worked at 56 Ludlow and in 1965 Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground lived and recorded there. The earliest known recorded version of \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" was recorded there. Other filmmakers, performers, poets, artists and musicians that lived in the building at the time included Warhol superstars Mario Montez and Jack Smith. Tony Conrad has produced two CDs from the Jack Smith tape archives subtitled \"56 Ludlow Street\" that were recorded at 56 Ludlow Street between 1962 and 1964. In the mid-1970s Gary Weis made some short films of Taylor Mead talking to his cat in the kitchen of his Ludlow Street apartment called \"Taylor Mead's Cat\". From 1980 to the mid-80s actor/videomaker Craig Calman lived in the building adjoining Taylor Mead's. An excerpt from Tyler Hubby's film \"Tony Conrad: Completely in the Present\" documents Tony Conrad making a field recording on Ludlow Street.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ludlow Street was well known as a street where no wave Colab artists connected with ABC No Rio lived; such as Kiki Smith, Fab Five Freddy, Coleen Fitzgibbon, Tom Otterness, Beatrice (Bebe) Smith, Izhar Patkin, Tron Von Hollywood, Wolfgang Staehle, Raina Jane Sherry, Christof Kohlhofer, Carlo McCormick, Cara Perlman, Steven Parrino, Edwige Belmore, Joseph Nechvatal, Uli Rimkus, Peter Fend, Walter Robinson, Aline Mare, Emily XYZ, and George Condo. In 1980, Coleen Fitzgibbon made a video called \"Ludlow\" about Ludlow Street. From 1983 to 1989, the bimonthly cassette publication Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine was based out of 143 Ludlow Street. Leonard Abrams started the East Village Eye cultural magazine at 167 Ludlow Street. In 1989 the Beastie Boys used a photo of the southwest corner of Ludlow and Rivington Street as the cover for their album \"Paul's Boutique\". In the 1980s, the two level loft at 58 Ludlow was the home to artists such as Alex Hahn, Douglas Eisenstark, David Blair and Leslie Mentel, among others. Wolfgang Staehle presented an extended digital photographic record of Ludlow Street in his exhibition at Postmasters Gallery in 2016/2017.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, the increasing popularity of the area among hipsters, driven out of the East Village by an invasion of yuppies, led to an upturn in activity along Ludlow Street, with several old establishments, such as corner delis (a.k.a. bodegas) closing shop to make way for bars, music venues such as the Ludlow Street Bar & Grill (a basement restaurant and music venue), and alternative theatres such as (before it became an empty lot), Piano's Theater (before it became a music venue and bar), and Todo Con Nada (before it became The Dark Room).\n\nIn the 2000s, Ludlow Street was a destination street for musicians and music-lovers, and was heavily populated with fashion shops, art galleries, bars, restaurants, and performance venues such as Cake Shop, The Living Room, and Piano's making Ludlow into a small nightlife strip with a distinct subcultural flavor. Local institutions included the bistro/cafe Pink Pony, the adjacent artist bar Max Fish, Katz's Deli (one of the city's most famous delicatessens) Motor City bar, Ludlow Street Guitars, Earthmatters Cafe (hangout of musicians/actors/writers/techies), Ludlow Studio (which was home to some of the top recording artists in the mid-1990s) and the Sombrero Mexican restaurant, better known to a generation of musicians as \"The Hat.\" The art and cultural gallery Ludlow 38 is the downtown satellite for contemporary art of the Goethe-Institut New York. The space was designed by artists Ethan Breckenridge and Liam Gillick. In 2005 artist Wolfgang Staehle created \"One day of life on Ludlow Street (New York)\". The work consists of 6716 images displayed in approximately 8 second intervals over 24 hours.\n\nIn 2013, Ludlow Street between Delancey and Houston Streets lost to rising rent many small interesting shops, bars and cafes that once gave the street its distinctive flavor. Closed were: Pink Pony Cafe Littéraire & Ciné Club, the print shop at 139 Ludlow, Press Tea, Earth Matters natural food store and Motor City bar. However, Banksy installed a major street art installation on Ludlow Street in the fall of 2013 as part of his \"Better Out Than In\" residency: a strange vision of horses with camera-lens googles rearing up by a car covered with cowering humans. The work is Banksy’s largest New York work to date.\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "43225091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43225091", "title": "Mihai Ralea", "text": "Mihai Ralea\n\nMihai Dumitru Ralea (also known as Mihail Ralea, Michel Raléa, or Mihai Rale; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a Romanian social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of Poporanism, the left-wing agrarian movement, which he infused with influences from corporatism and Marxism. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic \"peasant state\". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to political sociology, the sociology of culture, and social and national psychology. He was a professor at the University of Iași and, from 1938, the University of Bucharest.\n\nBy 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the National Peasants' Party, managing \"Viața Românească\" review and \"Dreptatea\" daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and fascist Iron Guard, which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a Socialist Peasants' Party, then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and Labor Minister of the dictatorial National Renaissance Front, representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a \"fellow traveler\" of the underground Communist Party.\n\nRalea willingly cooperated with the communists and the Ploughmen's Front before and after their arrival to power, serving as Minister of Arts, Ambassador to the United States, and vice president of the Great National Assembly. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the communist regime, and, as a Marxist humanist, was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Heavily controlled by communist censorship, his work gave scientific credentials to the regime's anti-American propaganda, though Ralea also used his position to protect some of those persecuted by the authorities.\n\nRalea's final contributions assisted in the re-professionalization of Romanian psychology and education, with the retention of a more liberal communist doctrine. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, he died abroad, while on mission to the UNESCO. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises. His only, and last, direct descendant was a daughter, Catinca Ralea, who achieved literary fame as a translator of Western literature.\n\nA native of Huși, Fălciu County (currently in Vaslui County), Ralea was the son of a Dumitru Ralea, a local magistrate, and Ecaterina Botezatu-Ralea. According to historian Camelia Zavarache, Ralea's ethnic background was non-Romanian: on his father's side, he was a Bulgarian, while his mother was Jewish. The family was relatively wealthy, and Dumitru had served as Fălciu representative in the Senate of Romania. His son was always spiritually attached to his native region and, later in life, bought himself a vineyard on Dobrina Hill, just outside Huși, building himself a vacation home. Huși was where he completed his primary education, before he moved on to the urban center of Iași, where he enlisted at boarding school (\"Liceul Internat\"). He was colleagues with another future sociologist, D. I. Suchianu. The two remained personal and political friends for the rest of their lives. Another enduring friendship was formed on school grounds between Ralea and historian Petre Constantinescu-Iași, who became Ralea's main connection to the revolutionary left.\n\nRalea went on to attend the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, under Constantin Rădulescu-Motru (who shortlisted and prepared Ralea for academic tenure). He made his debut in publishing during 1916, with an essay in Rădulescu-Motru's \"Revista de Filozofie\", and with \"Convorbiri Literare\" articles that he usually signed with the initials \"M. R.\" (an alternative signature he would use for the rest of his career). Ralea was university colleagues with philosophers Tudor Vianu and Nicolae Bagdasar, with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life. Their studies were interrupted by the Romanian Campaign of World War I, during which time Ralea relocated to Iași. He took his final examination in Law and Letters at the University of Iași, in 1918. His professors included the culture critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, who became Ralea's mentor. Ralea recalled that his first encounter with Ibrăileanu was \"my life's greatest intellectual event\".\n\nDescribed by Vianu as a \"young luminary\" with \"new and original ideas\", \"always surrounded by a sizable pack of students\", Ralea returned to cultural journalism in postwar Greater Romania. From February 1919, he was a contributor to the Iași-based review \"Însemnări Literare\", which stood in for the temporarily disestablished \"Viața Românească\". The magazine was managed by the novelist Mihail Sadoveanu and heavily influenced by Ibrăileanu. Their friendship sealed Ralea's affiliation to prewar Poporanism, a leftist current which promoted agrarianism, \"national specificity\", and art with a social mission. The \"Însemnări Literare\" group also recognized that Poporanism was made inadequate by the social promises of land reform and universal male suffrage. These policies, Ibrăileanu acknowledged, \"settled a debt\" with the peasantry. Poporanism was generally pro-Westernization, with a noted reserve; taken separately, Ralea was the most pro-Western, socialist, and least culturally conservative thinker of this category.\n\nAlso in 1919, Ralea and his new friend, Andrei Oțetea, earned state scholarships to complete his doctorate in Paris. Ralea entered the École Normale Supérieure as a disciple of Lucien Herr, simultaneously registering for doctoral programs in letters and politics, with interests in sociology and psychology. He studied under the functionalist Célestin Bouglé, then under Paul Fauconnet and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, and later, at the Collège de France, under Pierre Janet. As he himself recounted, he became a passionate follower of the French Left, a reader of Jean Jaurès, and a guest of Léon Blum's. He defined himself as a rationalist, heir to the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and was ostensibly an atheist. Ralea's secular agenda was underscored when he joined the Romanian Freemasonry, which, historian Lucian Nastasă writes, implied a commitment to freethought and religious toleration.\n\nFor a while, Ralea managed a Romanian restaurant owned by the banker Aristide Blank. He was part of a tight cell of Romanian students in letters or history, which also included Oțetea, Gheorghe Brătianu, and Alexandru Rosetti, who remained close friends over the decades. Suchianu and his sister Ioana, who were also studying in Paris, lived in the same boarding house as Ralea.\n\nWith funds raised by a Support Committee that included Ralea, \"Viața Românească\" was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the Third Republic, and possibly the first Romanian notices about the work of Marcel Proust. He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and Weimar Germany.\n\nIn 1922, Ralea took his \"Docteur d'État\" degree (the sixth Romanian to ever qualify for it) with \"L'idée de la révolution dans les doctrines socialistes\" (\"The Idea of Revolution in Socialist Doctrines\"). Under the Francized name \"Michel Raléa\", he published it at Rivière company in 1923. \"L'idée de la révolution...\" theorized that, in order to be classified as a revolution, a social movement needed at once a \"social body\", an \"ideal\", and a \"transfer of power\"—depending on which trait was prevailing, revolutions were, respectively, \"organic\", \"programmatic\", or \"means-based\". The focus of his attention was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whom he rediscovered (and criticized) as a proponent of \"class solidarity\" and nonviolent revolution. The work earned Ralea the Institut de France's Prix Osiris and a Doctor of Letters degree in 1923. He spent another several months frequenting Berlin University lectures. It was there that he first met a future enemy, the poet-mathematician Ion Barbu. The latter left a corrosive record of their first encounter, dismissing Ralea as a \"clown\" with \"aristocratic manias\".\n\nUpon his return to Romania, Ralea began publishing his political and sociological essays in reviews such as \"Fapta\", \"Ideea Europeană\", and \"Gândirea\". He was also involved with Dimitrie Gusti and Virgil Madgearu's Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its \"Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială\". In 1923, it hosted his essay on \"The Issue of Societal Classification\" and his critical review of German sociology. While still in Paris, Ralea was confident that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval. The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, Garabet Aslan, ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to Ion Petrovici, while also employed as lecturer in social pedagogy. According to Ralea's own words, this was a \"ridiculous\" situation: most of his students were girls, some of whom were infatuated with him. He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the \"Viața Românească\" offices.\n\nFor the next two years, Ralea diversified his qualifications with the goal of obtaining employment in his main field. He published the tract \"Formația ideii de personalitate\" (\"How the Notion of Personality Is Formed\"), noted as a pioneering introduction to behavioural genetics. On January 1, 1926, following good referrals from Petrovici (and despite the preference of psychology students, who favored C. Fedeleș), Ralea was appointed Professor of Psychology and Aesthetics at Iași University.\n\nRalea soon became one of \"Viața Românească\"s ideologues and polemicists, as well as architect of its satire column, \"Miscellanea\" (alongside Suchianu and, initially, George Topîrceanu). By 1925, he was also regularly featured in the left-wing daily \"Adevărul\", and its cultural supplement, \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\". His essays were taken up by other cultural magazines throughout Romania, including \"Kalende\" of Pitești and \"Minerva\" of Iași. In 1927, when Ralea published his \"Contribuțiuni la știința societății\" (\"Contributions to Social Science\") and \"Introducere în sociologie\" (\"Companion to Sociology\"), Gusti's Social Institute had Ralea as a guest speaker, with a lecture on \"Social Education\". At around that time, with Gusti as president of the Broadcasting Company, Ralea became a frequent presence on the radio.\n\nIn his columns and essays, Ralea defended Ibrăileanu's \"national specificity\" against criticism from the new-wave modernists at \"Sburătorul\". Eugen Lovinescu, the modernist ideologue, had reconnected with 19th-century classical liberalism, rejecting Poporanism as a nationalist, culturally isolationist, and socializing phenomenon. Lovinescu and Ralea denounced each other's politics as reactionary. Ralea opined that Poporanist ideas were still culturally relevant, and not in fact isolationist, since they provided a recipe for \"originality\"; as he put it, \"national specificity\" had become inevitable. The conflict was not just political: Ralea also objected to modernist aesthetics, from the pure poetry cultivated by \"Sburătorul\" to the more radical Constructivism of \"Contimporanul\" magazine.\n\nRalea was not an anti-modernist, but rather a particular modernist. According to his friend and colleague Octav Botez, he was an \"integrally modern man\" in tastes and behavior, \"one of the few philosophers who conceived of, and lived, their lives as regular people, with a naturalness and facility that were charming and stimulating.\" The same was also noted by \"Contimporanul\" writer Sergiu Dan, who proposed that Ralea denied himself \"all sort of transaction with the confuse world of sentiment\".\n\nRalea's literary columns very often promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as when he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by Thomas Hardy. More famous was his reading of Proust through Henri Bergson's classification of memory. Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as Alexandru A. Philippide, and hailed Tudor Arghezi, the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day. Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for social realism in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, but he was also enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by \"Sburătorul\"s Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu.\n\nWith the Lovinescu–Ralea debate occupying the center stage at \"Viața Românească\" and \"Sburătorul\", a new intellectual movement, critical of both modernism and Poporanism, was emerging in the cultural life of Greater Romania. Led by poet-theologian Nichifor Crainic, this group took over at \"Gândirea\", turning the magazine against its former \"Viața Românească\" allies. As pointed out by Lovinescu, Ralea was initially welcoming of Crainic's \"remarkable\" program. He did not object to Crainic's Romanian Orthodox devotion (seeing it as compatible with secularism and \"national specificity\"), but mainly to his national conservatism, which worshiped the historical past. Like other Poporanists, Ralea adopted left-wing nationalism, arguing that the very concept of nation was a product of French radicalism: \"[It] emerged from the great French Revolution, the modest ideology of the bourgeoisie. [...] What's more, we may claim that only a democracy can truly be nationalistic.\" He credited the core ideas of Romanian liberalism, according to which Romanian national awareness was an afterthought of Jacobinism: \"We have had to visit France to find out we're Romanians.\" As noted by scholar Balázs Trencsényi: \"Ralea sought to separate the study of national specificity, which he considered to be legitimate, from the exhortation of national particulars, which he rejected.\"\n\nIn 1928, \"Gândirea\" hosted the inflammatory \"White Lily\" Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a \"new generation\" of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry with one of the White Lily intellectuals, Petre Pandrea. Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for aestheticism and mysticism, a critique of \"that famed social justice\" idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the \"Sburătorul\" group as \"dry\", \"barren\", all too critical. Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, could do without \"prophets\" with \"fun and interesting biases\", but not without \"liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets\". In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day Rasputins, prone to fanatical vandalism.\n\nFrom that moment on, Crainic's Orthodox spirituality and traditionalism made a slow transition into far-right politics. Their rejection of democracy became another issue of dispute, with Ralea noting, in 1930, that \"all civilized countries are democratic; all semi-civilized or primitive countries are dictatorial.\" Over the years, \"Gândirists\" produced more and more systematic attacks on Ralea's ideology, condemning its atheism, \"historical materialism\", and Francophilia. In reply, Ralea noted that, beyond their facade, national and religious conservatism meant a reinstatement of primitive customs, obscurantism, Neoplatonism, and Byzantinism. He pushed the envelope by demanding a program of forced Westernization and secularization, to mirror Kemalism.\n\nHis comments also challenged the grounding of \"Gândirist\" theory: Romanian Orthodoxy, he noted, was part of an international Orthodox phenomenon that mainly included Slavs, whereas many Romanians were Greek-Catholic. He concluded, therefore, that Orthodoxy could never claim synonymy with the Romanian ethos. Ralea also insisted that, despite its nativist anti-Western claims, Orthodox religiousness was a modern \"trifle\", that owed inspiration to Keyserling's Theosophy and Cocteau's Catholicism. He maintained that Romanian peasants, whose religiousness was exhorted by Crainic, were \"superstitious, but atheistic\", not respectful \"of any spiritual value when it should compete with their logical instincts.\" No other people, he contented, was as blasphemous as Romanians when it came to profanities.\n\nRalea collected his critical essays as a set of volumes: \"Comentarii și sugestii\" (\"Comments and Suggestions\"), \"Interpretări\" (\"Interpretations\"), \"Perspective\" (\"Perspectives\"). He was still involved in psychological research, with tracts such as \"Problema inconștientului\" (\"The Problem of the Unconscious Mind\") and \"Ipoteze și precizări privind știința sufletului\" (\"Hypotheses and Précis Regarding Spiritual Science\"). Ralea also resumed his European travels, touring the Kingdom of Spain, and was unenthusiastic about its conservatism. Ralea's travelogue, \"Memorial din Spania\", depicts the country as a reactionary bulwark of \"somber priests\" and \"festooned soldiers\". Another \"Memorial\", serialized by \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", detailed his trips through Germanic-speaking Europe.\n\nShortly before the election of December 1928, Ralea was attracted into the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), speaking out against the National Liberal political class as \"an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality.\" He successfully contested a seat in the Assembly of Deputies, and was reelected in 1933; during that interval, he also presided upon Fălciu's party chapter. Ralea was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, Constantin Balmuș, Iorgu Iordan, Petre Andrei, Traian Bratu, and Traian Ionașcu. Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, Constantin Stere, but did not follow Stere's \"Democratic Peasantist\" dissidence of 1930. Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party press organ \"Acțiunea Țărănistă\" and to Teodorescu-Braniște's \"Revista Politică\". In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic George Călinescu as editors of \"Viața Românească\".\n\nRalea eventually affiliated with the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism. Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted the vision of a \"peasant state\", accepting socialist reformism, but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejected outright the idea of proletarian primacy. Criticized by the communist left as \"outstanding shortsightedness\", this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings, including the 1933 conference in the Republic of Spain, but insisted on the benefits of statism and a planned economy.\n\nBy then, Ralea was leaving behind his sociological research. As noted by his friend Botez, he showed himself to be \"absent-minded and preoccupied most of all with politics.\" Botez noted that Ralea was showing signs of hyperactivity, seemingly incapable of concentrating during formal functions. He became infamous as one of the \"traveling professors\", who lived in Bucharest and only taught the minimum of classes allowed in Iași—one of his return trips to Iași, in 1936, was for the funeral ceremony of his mentor Ibrăileanu. He now owned an Iași townhouse and a villa in Bucharest's Filipescu Park. Although lovingly married to Ioana, he had begun an affair with another woman, Marcela Simionescu.\n\nRalea's energies were also drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent seat at the University of Iași, at the expense of PNȚ colleague Ioan Hudiță. He tried to do the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist Giorge Pascu. Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by Parliament, and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment. More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their baccalaureate examination. Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.\nFrom 1934 to March 1938, Ralea was also editor of the main PNȚ newspaper, \"Dreptatea\". He contributed its political editorials, answering to criticism from the right. In February 1935, he co-authored and published the new PNȚ Party Program, which rendered explicit the goal of transforming Romania into a \"peasant state\". In \"Dreptatea\", addressing \"Universul\" editor Pamfil Șeicaru, Ralea dismissed suspicions that the \"peasant state\" signified a \"simplistic domination\" or a dictatorship of the peasantry. He maintained that the notion simply implied \"a juster distribution of the national income\", and the \"collective\" but peaceful \"redemption of an entire class.\"\n\nRalea's time at \"Dreptatea\" overlapped with the emergence of fascism, whose leading Romanian representatives were members of the Iron Guard. This violent movement had been temporarily banned in 1931, by order of a PNȚ Interior Minister, Ion Mihalache. Mihalache's ban followed repeated requests by the party's left-wingers, Ralea included. Ralea had his own brush with the Guard in late 1932, when he was presiding upon symposiums on French literature at \"Criterion Society\". One of the sessions, focusing on André Gide, was interrupted, on Crainic's instigation, by Guardsmen under Mihai Stelescu, who assaulted \"Criterion\" activists and created a bustle. By 1933, Ralea had quarreled with the \"Criterion\" cell, which had since adopted \"new generation\" idealism and sympathy for the Iron Guard. In private, he also dismissed the Guard's new convert and ideologue, Nae Ionescu, as a \"trickster\" and a \"barber\".\n\nThe issue of Romanian fascism became stringent after the Guard assassinated Romanian Premier Ion G. Duca. In his articles, Ralea described the National Liberal administration as \"insane and degenerate\" for continuing to tolerate the Guard's existence, instead of jailing its leaders. At \"Dreptatea\", protesting against the Guard's assault of the leftist intellectual Alexandru Graur, Ralea decried fascism in Romania as an \"island of Doctor Moreau\", an experiment in the growth of \"blind and absurd mysticism\".\n\nIn 1935, 161 of Ralea's essays were collected and published at Editura Fundațiilor Regale as \"Valori\" (\"Values\"). They predicted the emergence of a stable civilization, conformist and collectivist, whose great merit was the elimination of careerism. Ralea synthesized his critique of fascism in the 1935 essays on \"The Right's Doctrine\", taken up by \"Dreptatea\" and \"Viața Românească\". These texts described the far-right and fascism as parasitical phenomena, feeding on democracy's errors, with an ignorant mindset, incapable of subtlety. His assessments were countercriticized by Guardist intellectual Toma Vlădescu, in the newspaper \"Porunca Vremii\". According to Vlădescu, the \"right-wing ideology\" existed as an expression of the \"human equilibrium\", and, at its very core, was antisemitic.\n\nWith the advent of Nazi Germany and the invigoration of European fascism, Ralea was again moving to the left, cooperating with the Social Democratic Party (PSDR). In 1936, at \"Dreptatea\", he condemned the German march into Rhineland as a bad omen and an attack on world peace. He became one of the PNȚ men affiliated with Lord Cecil's International Peace Campaign, which, in Romania, was dominated by PSDR militants.\n\nIn 1937, with an obituary piece to the \"martyr\" Stere, he defended Poporanism from accusations of \"Bolshevik\" subservience. Bolshevism, he argued, was impossible in Romania. However, he himself had established a working relationship with the outlawed Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), who was also interested in other PNȚ antifascists (one of them was the White Lily's Pandrea, who had since joined the National Peasantist left current). Ralea also allowed PCdR intellectuals such as Ștefan Voicu and Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu to publish essays in \"Viața Românească\", and hosted news about social life and culture in the Soviet Union. At the time, the PCdR acknowledged him as one of the intellectuals who could be trusted with \"fulfilling the bourgeois revolution in Romania.\"\n\nIn January 1937, at the PNȚ Youth Conference in Cluj, Ralea spoke of the \"peasant state\" as a \"neo-nationalist\" application of democratic socialism, opposed to fascism, and in natural solidarity with the trade unions. He felt confident that this alliance would be powerful enough to outweigh fashionable totalitarianism. During April of that year, Ralea and his Iași colleagues expressed public solidarity with his old Poporanist friend Sadoveanu, whose books were being burned by far-right militants. Ralea's own sociological work was falling under Guardist scrutiny: in December, \"Buna Vestire\" hosted a piece by Horia Stamatu, which referred to Ralea's contribution as \"unhinged\", and to Ralea personally as \"kike-turned\", \"at odds with the new man\".\n\nThe December 1937 election toned down Ralea's anti-Guard militancy: the PNȚ had a non-aggression pact with the Guardsmen. Consequently, Ralea campaigned in his native Fălciu County alongside the movement's candidates, in terms he would later describe as \"cordial\". His apparent compromise with the Guard is one of the most serious charges in Pandrea's later criticism of Ralea. The tied elections, and the successes of the Guard, prompted the authoritarian King Carol II to increase his participation in politics, beyond his royal prerogative. Identified as one of the PNȚ \"turncoats\", Ralea sealed a surprising deal with Carol II and Premier Miron Cristea (the Patriarch of Romania), becoming the country's Minister of Labor. He was promptly stripped of his PNȚ membership, and inaugurated his own party, the exceedingly minor Socialist Peasants' Party (PSȚ).\n\nHistorians tend to describe Ralea's attitude toward Carol as \"servile\", and Ralea himself as Carol's \"pocket Socialist\" or \"intellectual trophy\". Ralea himself claimed that the king cultivated his friendship as a likable \"communist\", though, as Camelia Zavarache argues, there is no secondary proof to attest that Ralea was ever part of Carol's \"camarilla\". Iuliu Maniu, the PNȚ chief and leader of the semi-clandestine democratic opposition, suggested that Ralea had \"not a trace of character\" to compliment his intellectual gifts. At the time, PNȚ activists began collecting evidence that Ralea was not an ethnic Romanian, which meant that he could no longer hold public office under the Romanianization laws. Ralea himself was involved in the Romanianization campaign: in late 1938, he accepted Wilhelm Filderman's proposal for the mass emigration of Romanian Jews.\n\nIn December 1938, Ralea became a founding member of Carol's single party, the National Renaissance Front (FRN). The establishment offered him several honors, including a reprint of his works by the ministry press. In addition to his ministerial appointment, Ralea became Royal Resident, or governor, of Ținutul Prut, a new administrative region incorporating parts of Western Moldavia and Bessarabia. He was created a Knight 2nd Class of the \"Meritul Cultural\" Order, publishing, at Editura Fundațiilor Regale, the volume \"Psihologie și vieață\" (\"Psychology and Life\"). Toward the end of 1938, Ralea moved from his old chair at the University of Iași and took up a similar position at his Bucharest alma mater. Vianu was the assistant professor, lecturing in specialized aesthetics and literary criticism, and in practice taking over all of Ralea's classes.\n\nHistorian Lucian Boia argues: \"Of all the king's dictatorship dignitaries, one may count Mihai Ralea as the most left-wing.\" In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: \"I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class.\" As noted in 1945 by political scientist Hugh Seton-Watson, there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: \"however much [the average Romanian intellectual] cursed the regime, he was grateful to it for one thing. It stood between him and the great, dirty, primitive, disinherited masses, whose 'Bolshevik' desire for Social Justice threatened his comforts.\" His time in office brought the creation of a workers' leisure service, \"Muncă și Voe Bună\", together with a Workers' University, a workers' theater, and a hostel for vacationing writers (\"Casa Scriitorilor\"). Nepotistic in his selection of a ministerial staff, by November 1939 his ministry was able to co-opt PSDR politicians such as George Grigorovici and Stavri Cunescu. He appropriated socialist propaganda, and attracted more or less sizable contributions from various centrists and left-wingers: Sadoveanu, Vianu, Suchianu, Philippide, as well as Demostene Botez, Octav Livezeanu, Victor Ion Popa, Gala Galaction, Barbu Lăzăreanu, and Ion Pas.\n\nRalea's mandate was also a crossover of left-wing corporatism and fascism. In June 1938, he even visited Nazi Germany and had a formal meeting with his counterpart, Robert Ley. His \"Muncă și Voe Bună\" was directly inspired by Strength Through Joy and the \"Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro\". In 1939, Ralea celebrated May Day with a large parade of support for Carol II. This was meant to undermine the leftist Workers' Day while showing the success of the FRN's worker guilds, and was partly inspired by Nazi festivities. Nevertheless, the parade was voluntarily joined by militants of the underground PCdR, who found that it gave them am opportunity for chanting \"democratic slogans\". In underground PSDR circles, as well as in inside the ministerial structures, rumors spread that Ralea was using secret funds at his discretion to sponsor various PCdR militants, including his schoolmate Petre Constantinescu-Iași; these stories were partly confirmed by Ralea himself.\n\nFrom March 1939, the premiership had passed to Armand Călinescu, a former PNȚ politician. Ralea was his friend and confidant, and, as he later claimed, tried to keep Călinescu grounded in the face of \"mythomaniacal\" rumors. The FRN regime soon organized a massive clampdown of the Iron Guard. Ralea claimed to have protected Guardsmen employed by the Labor Ministry, and to have negotiated pardons for militants interned at Miercurea Ciuc. He obtained one such reprieve for Guardist historian P. P. Panaitescu. Himself a Guard sympathizer, Ion Barbu later claimed that Ralea was behind his marginalization in academia. Ralea was also accused by Pandrea of having done nothing to prevent the arrest of his former \"Dreptatea\" colleague, the anti-Carol PNȚ-ist Madgearu.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, following a spree of extrajudicial killings ordered by government, an Iron Guard death squad took its revenge, assassinating Premier Călinescu. Ralea, Andrei, and other former PNȚ-ists preserved their governmental posts as the premiership passed to Constantin Argetoianu, then to Gheorghe Tătărescu. Ralea was also given new responsibilities within the FRN structure, becoming president of its regional chapter in Ținutul Mării.\n\nMeanwhile, the outbreak of World War II caught Romania isolated from either the Axis Powers and the Western Allies. During the Battle of France, the FRN regime itself was divided between partisans of a détente with Germany and Francophiles such as Ralea. As witnessed by the Swiss diplomat René de Weck, Ralea was restating his \"Valori\" ethos at cabinet meetings, in front of Axis representatives, declaring that the Allies stood for \"humanistic civilization\". Former PCdR activists still enjoyed access to Ralea, through Constantinescu-Iași. In May 1940, the latter tried to create a bridge of communications between the Labor Minister and the Soviet Union. Various reports on both sides confirm that Ralea was in permanent contact with Soviet diplomats, arranged for him by Constantinescu-Iași and Belu Zilber.\n\nJust a month later, the Soviets issued an ultimatum, demanding that Romania cede Bessarabia. During the deliberations, Ralea voted in favor of Argetoianu's proposal: withdrawing from the region and mobilizing the army on the Prut, in preparation of a future defense. The subsequent occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina sent Romania into a deep political crisis. The events, and revelations about the existence of a Nazi–Soviet agreement, led Carol to order a final clampdown of the PCdR's remaining Romanian cells. In July, Ralea intervened to rescue a communist friend, the journalist George Ivașcu.\n\nThe Romanian crisis was aggravated in August, when the Nazi-inspired Vienna arbitration stripped her of Northern Transylvania. The political standstill propelled the Iron Guard, which was Nazi-aligned, into government, and forced Carol into permanent exile. The emerging \"National Legionary State\" banned reviews such as \"Viața Românească\", and moved to prosecute all former FRN dignitaries. With Panaitescu as the new Rector, the University instituted a Commission for Review, which included Iron Guard sociologist Traian Herseni and eugenicist Iordache Făcăoaru. Of those professors brought before the commission, Ralea was the only one to have his contract terminated without the possibility of transfer. Panaitescu, Herseni and Făcăoaru found that his appointment to Bucharest had been illegal, and dismissed his scientific contributions as having \"zero value\". Ralea and his colleagues were able to defend Vianu, who was openly Jewish, and who was threatened with demotion under the racial purity laws. Withdrawing to Huși, Ralea became the target of surveillance by agents of the Siguranța, who monitored his subversive conversations, including his wager that Guard rule would be short-lived.\n\nIn November 1940, the Guard's Police chief, Ștefan Zăvoianu, ordered the arrests of several FRN dignitaries, Ralea included. This angered the military \"Conducător\", Ion Antonescu, who freed Ralea and the others, ordering Zăvoianu to resign. After the clashes of January 1941, the Iron Guard was ousted, and Antonescu remained unchallenged. Although fascist, the new regime reinstated Ralea to his professorship. Antonescu castigated the Commission for Review as a \"shame\", and declared Ralea to be \"indispensable\". In a companion to Romanian philosophy, published that year, Herseni revised his stance, calling Ralea \"a thinker of unquestionable talent\", whose sociological work had been \"a true revelation.\" Ralea returned to teach at the University where, in addition to Vianu, he had received as his assistant a refugee from Soviet-occupied territory, Traian Chelariu. Meanwhile, Panaitescu was stripped of his position and briefly imprisoned.\n\nStill present in public life after the Romania's entry into the anti-Soviet war, Ralea returned to publishing with articles in \"Revista Românǎ\" and the 1942 book \"Înțelesuri\" (\"Meanings\"). Despite being partly recovered by the new regime, and allegedly proposing to Antonescu that they revive together the National Socialist Party, Ralea was still under \"Siguranța\" watch, and also spied on by the Police and the German Embassy. His file contains a denunciation of his entire career and loyalties: he stood accused of having been a \"socialist-communist\" camouflaged within the PNȚ, of having revived the guilds so as to give the PCdR room for maneuver, and of having sponsored Soviet agents to protect himself in the event of a Soviet invasion.\n\nOne \"Siguranța\" record suggests that, in secret, Ralea was hoping to consolidate a left-wing opposition movement against Antonescu during the early months of 1941. More alarmingly for the regime, Ralea had also begun cultivating a revolutionary and pro-Allied youth, through a new magazine called \"Graiul Nostru\" and with British funds. In February, Ralea was subjected to formal interrogations over his contacts with the PCdR under Carol. He defended these, arguing that he had aimed at securing a protective deal between Romania and the Soviets, and that Carol had approved of his effort. The explanation was viewed as plausible by police, and Ralea was allowed to go free. Nevertheless, the file was reopened by August, after revelations that Ralea had cultivated communists since at least the 1930s. In December 1942, Antonescu ordered Ralea's interment at the concentration camp in Târgu Jiu. He was held there for about three months, to March 1943, and apparently enjoyed a mild detention regime, with visitations.\n\nRalea's return from camp coincided roughly with the Battle of Stalingrad and the turn of fortunes on the eastern front. He soon established contacts with the antifascist opposition, repeatedly seeking to set up a Peasantist left and rejoin the PNȚ. Maniu received him and listened to his pleas, but denied him readmission and invited him to create his own coalition from shards of the Renaissance Front, promising him some measure of leniency \"for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection.\" Their separation remained \"unbridgeable\"; eventually, Ralea reestablished the PSȚ, and attracted into its ranks a Social Democratic dissident faction, led by former PSDR theoretician Lothar Rădăceanu. The two reestablished contacts with the PCdR and other fringe parties: moving between Bucharest and Sinaia, Ralea was involved in trilateral talks between the communists, the Ploughmen's Front of Petru Groza, and the National Liberal inner faction of Gheorghe Tătărescu, helping to coordinate actions between them. In Brașov, he met with the economist Victor Jinga, whose antifascist and socialist program was reused in later PSȚ propaganda. Together with party colleague Stanciu Stoian, he signed the PSȚ's adherence to the PCdR's clandestine \"Patriotic Antihitlerite Front\".\n\nIn addition to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He was one of several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers, alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism. With the 1943 collection of essays, \"Între două lumi\" (\"Between Two Worlds\", published at Cartea Românească), Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of collectivism.\n\nEvidence of Ralea's participation in subversion was disregarded by government: in June 1943, when the German Foreign Ministry nominated Ralea as a high-risk target, Antonescu personally replied that this was not the case. In November, Ralea applied for a new Chair of Psychology at Bucharest, reserving his old department for Vianu. The review committee, overseen by leftist allies such as Gusti and Mircea Florian, gave him immediate approval for transfer. In February of the next year, Ralea and N. Bagdasar rejected the application of Constantin Noica, the traditionalist philosopher, to join the university teaching staff. In his report, Ralea noted that Noica had \"an absolute and metaphysical mindset\", with no \"practical reason\", and that he was therefore unsuited for research and teaching. He also appeared as a defense witness for Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, an activist of the underground Union of Patriots. Together with Hudiță and other rival PNȚ-ists, and his friends in Iași academia, Ralea signed to Grigore T. Popa's manifesto of the intellectuals, demanding that Antonescu negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets. Reputedly, the document had been stripped of references to the prosecution of FRN and Antonescian officials, leading Maniu to conclude that the signers were \"cowardly\".\n\nAccording to Hudiță, Ralea objected to the Soviets' offer of an armistice as \"too soft\" on Romania. Blocked out of the National Democratic Bloc coalition, which included the PNȚ, the PSDR, and ultimately the PCdR, Ralea watched from the side as the August 23 Coup deposed Antonescu and pushed Romania into the anti-Nazi camp. His friend and PSȚ colleague, Grigore Geamănu, was more directly involved, helping PCdR leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to escape from Târgu Jiu camp and join the other conspirators. In the PSȚ newspaper, \"Dezrobirea\", Ralea saluted \"the full triumph of the ideas and principles for which our foremost activists have been militating uninterruptedly these past six years\" (a pedigree which seemingly included Ralea's own activities under King Carol). He reissued \"Viața Românească\" with a similar statement about \"the present triumph of our credo\". Meanwhile, keeping up with his earlier threats, Maniu repeatedly asked for Ralea to be indicted for war crimes.\n\nRalea played an instrumental part in the gradual installation of communism, and is described by various authors as the prototype \"fellow traveler\". In December 1944, he was announced as the Literary Section Vice President of the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS). His PSȚ was drawn into the National Democratic Front (FND) coalition, which comprised the PCdR, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. According to the PCdR, this transformation of the Antihitlerite Front was \"a progressive step, befitting the tasks of the people's revolution\"; according to historian Adrian Cioroianu, it was more of opportunistic move on Ralea's part. In private, Ralea claimed that his alignment with the communists helped him provide for his large family, including former landowners, but his account is viewed as doubtful by Zavarache.\n\nRalea's Socialist Peasantists were eventually absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. As noted by Zavarache, Ralea now understood that his influence on political life was \"exceedingly minor\", aware that Groza himself was merely a communist \"puppet\"; \"consequently, he sought to preserve those offices which could ensure him a comfortable lifestyle\". Like the rest of the FND, Ralea participated in the movement to depose the monarchist premier, General Nicolae Rădescu. Faced with the PCdR's obstructionism, Rădescu approached Ralea with an alternative offer: the Ploughmen's Front was to form a new government with no communist ministers. Ralea divulged this offer to the Soviet envoy, Andrey Vyshinsky. On February 16, 1945, together with 10 other academics (among them Balmuș, Parhon, Rosetti and Oțetea), he signed a letter of protest, accusing Rădescu of stalling land reform and of undermining the work of the Allied Commission.\n\nBloody clashes ensued in Bucharest, most of them between anticommunists and communist agents. They signaled a new political crisis, and forced the FND into power. Ralea was made Minister of Arts on March 6, 1945, when Groza took the premiership from the deposed General Rădescu. In June 1945 Ralea was one of the rapporteurs at the Ploughmen's Front largest-ever General Congress. On March 6, 1946, he also took over the Ministry of Religious Affairs, replacing the disgraced Constantin Burducea until August (when Groza himself replaced him in this function).\n\nRalea became one of several intellectuals who were mobilized to run on the Ploughmen's Front (and FND) list in the 1946 parliamentary election. In his capacity as minister, Ralea set in motion the purge of PNȚ-ist functionaries and of artists perceived by the PCdR as pro-fascist. He extended his personal protection to Șerban Cioculescu, who became Iași University professor in 1946 upon Ralea's intervention. Ralea also pursued his projects for workers' education, authorizing the establishment of a workers' theatrical troupe, \"Teatrul Muncitoresc CFR Giulești\". He also republished his 1930s travel accounts, completed with notes from his trip to Egypt, as \"Nord-Sud\" (\"North-South\").\n\nIn September 1946, Ralea stepped down from the Ministry of Arts, only to be appointed Ambassador to the United States. Reputedly, he was a last minute replacement for the Union of Patriots' Dumitru Bagdasar. The latter had fallen severely ill, but was also seen as a political liability by the American side—Ralea, as a former monarchist, was preferable. Ralea's own arrival in Washington was delayed by his inclusion on the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, and he finally landed on American soil in October. He supported a détente in Romanian–American relations, after President Harry S. Truman had refused to recognize the Groza cabinet. In front of American criticism, he played down the electoral fraud of 1946, claiming that it was within the \"normal\" boundaries, at some 5% of the vote.\n\nRalea was also tasked with undermining the reputation of the anticommunist opposition and with popularizing communism among Romanian American exiles. The anticommunist press responded by calling Ralea \"a liaison man\" of the Politburo, tasked with planting Stalinism in America. Among expatriate Romanians, Ralea and his legation staff had difficulties convincing Maruca and George Enescu, but persuaded Dimitrie Gusti to return to Bucharest. Ralea also approached the former backers of Carol's regime. He build a connection with the industrialist Nicolae Malaxa, but found vocal adversaries in Max Auschnitt and Richard Franasovici.\n\nGoing against Soviet policies and his own government, Ralea also sought to obtain American foreign aid, and even political interventions. His persistence in this regard contributed to the relief effort organized by General Schuyler in famine-stricken Western Moldavia. However, the assistance fell below Ralea's expectations, owing to various factors, one of which was American suspicion that Groza was diverting food to relieve the Soviet famine; meanwhile, diaspora voices repeatedly argued that Ralea was playing down the scale of famine, and also insinuated that he was embezzling funds. In his reports to Bucharest, Ralea complained that: \"America's attitude toward us was oscillating between hostility and ignorance. All doors were closed. [...] We were seen as a Soviet branch office, and people were discouraged from giving us any sort of assistance.\" Reportedly, he was shocked by Truman's ignorance of Romanian affairs. Ralea's diplomatic mission was also tainted by his difficult lifestyle, including his noticeable hypochondriasis, but also his philandering. Ralea had appointed his mistress as cultural attaché, but she deserted her post and left to Mexico while Ioana Ralea took up residence in the Romanian embassy.\n\nWith the looming threat of Soviet-style collectivization, Ralea informed the Americans that Romanian peasants valued individual property. Reportedly, during his January 1947 interview with US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, he pleaded emotionally for Romanians not to be left \"behind the Iron Curtain\". He was still the country's ambassador when King Michael I was forced to abdicate by the PCdR officials and a communized people's republic was proclaimed. Nevertheless, Foreign Minister Ana Pauker greatly reduced his influence in Washington, transferring many of his attributes to a communist diplomat, Grigore Preoteasa. In June, Ralea also became chairman of a Romanian Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, which was dedicated to the spread of propaganda.\n\nA scandal erupted in July 1948, when the Raleas were denied access to the diplomats' beach in Newport, having been blacklisted as \"communists\". Ioana Ralea endangered her husband's position by protesting against this qualifier; at home, rumor spread that the couple was planning to defect. Ralea was able to persuade Pauker not to recall him, and even organized a reception in her honor during October 1948; he also organized a communist counter-manifestation upon Michael's arrival to Washington. While still abroad, Ralea had run in the formal election of March 1948, taking a Fălciu seat in the Great National Assembly. This allowed him to return to a secure position after Mihai Magheru took over as Ambassador, in late 1949.\n\nResuming his scholarly work, Ralea had to refrain from calling himself a \"sociologist\", as that field of research had been declared \"reactionary\". He was again given the position of psychology chair at the University of Bucharest, and was also made a member of the new Institute of History and Philosophy, whose president was Constantinescu-Iași. Ralea was seconded there by Constantin Ionescu Gulian, with whom he did research into the history of Romanian materialist philosophy. He also prepared an anthropological tract, \"Explicarea omului\" (\"Explaining Man\"). Translated into the French by Eugène Ionesco, it was published at Presses Universitaires de France. In November 1948, he had been accepted into the recently purged Romanian Academy, at the same time as Balmuș, Raluca Ripan, Grigore Moisil, Ștefan Milcu, Camil Petrescu, and PCdR historian Mihail Roller. A contributor to the PCdR daily, \"Scînteia\", as well as to its youth supplement and its cultural reviews (\"Studii\", \"Contemporanul\", etc.), Ralea also sat on the editorial staff of the Academy Historical Section's trimonthly, \"Buletin Științific\", alongside Roller, David Prodan, and Constantin Moisil.\n\nNevertheless, the Workers' Party (as the PCdR was known after absorbing the PSDR) was collecting evidence incriminating Ralea. In October 1949, taking its cue from Roller and Leonte Răutu, the party press carried notes critical of Ralea and Gulian's research. The following year, Roller suggested that Ralea's introduction to the works of Vasile Conta was not up to Marxist standards, and also hinted that Ralea held too many offices. The Securitate secret police opened a file on him, which recorded his criticism of Roller and other \"ignoramuses\" promoted by the regime; in exchange, the Securitate labeled Ralea \"opportunistic\" and \"a danger to our regime.\" From about 1950, his office at the Institute was infiltrated by informants, and probably also bugged.\n\nRalea responded to the pressures by presenting his services as an anti-American propagandist, making his first-hand experience in America into an irreplaceable asset; this assignment was inaugurated in January 1951, when Ralea and Gulian published in \"Studii\" a piece addressing the immorality of \"American imperialists\". Working under direct Soviet supervision, Ralea took charge of a research project endorsed by the entire Institute: \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman al psihologiei americane\" (\"The Anti-Science and Anti-Humanity Nature of American Psychology\", published 1954). He was again able to rescue Vianu, this time from communist persecution, and intervened to save the career of writer Costache Olăreanu. More discreetly, he paid the bills of his former teacher, Rădulescu-Motru, who had been expelled from academia, and rescued from eviction the conductor George Georgescu. However, he could not protect either his brother-in-law Suchianu, who was arrested and held in communist prisons, nor Chelariu, who was sacked and had to work as a rat-catcher. His disciple, psycholinguist Tatiana Slama-Cazacu, was forced to abandon her doctorate studies because of her political nonconformism.\n\nRalea still had friendly contacts with his former supervisors in Foreign Affairs, though he complained to his peers that Pauker was snubbing him. Pandrea, who had fallen out with the Workers' Party regime and spent time in prison, later alleged that Ralea, \"the impenitent servant\", cultivated the friendship of communist women, from Pauker to Liuba Chișinevschi. Ralea witnessed Pauker's 1952 downfall and banishment, and reputedly kept himself informed about her activities through mutual acquaintances. His own survival in the post-Pauker era was an unusual feat. According to Pandrea, it was possible only because Ralea was \"without scruples\", always ready for a \"cowardly submission\", and a \"valet\" of Workers' Party potentates such as Ion Gheorghe Maurer. As a sign that he was still protected by the regime, in February 1953 Ralea was awarded the Star of the People's Republic, Second Class. A close bond existed between Ralea and the Workers' Party chief, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who began cultivating his very own intellectual circle after engineering Pauker's downfall.\n\nThe death of Joseph Stalin in early 1953 signaled a path toward less dogmatism. This initially hurt Ralea: \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman\", now seen as embarrassing, was not given mass circulation. Nevertheless, Ralea supported Gheorghiu-Dej's adoption of a national communist platform, which was presented as an alternative to Soviet control. Over the early 1950s, he had grown disgusted and alarmed by the impact of communist policies in education, but still fearful of approaching the topic in his dealings with communist potentates. In 1955, with the relaxation of political pressures, he went public with his criticism, issued as a report to the Workers' Party leadership. It spoke about the poor scientific standards at Romania's universities, and criticized the appointment of political workers as school principals. The report also condemned the Art Ministry for promoting \"mediocrities\" as cultural inspectors, but avoided any proposal for actual liberalization. By 1957, the Romanian school of psychology had been relaunched, and its official publications recommended Ralea as a main reference, but without mentioning \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman\". At the time, some Romanian anticommunist circles also began taking an interest in Ralea, vainly hoping that he would be appointed premier of a post-Stalinist Romania.\n\nIn 1956, the psychology section became an independent Institute, and Ralea became its chairman. Also that year, Ralea published his historical essay on French politics and culture, \"Cele două Franțe\" (\"The Two Frances\"). It came out in a 1959 French edition, as \"Les Visages de France\", with a preface by Roger Garaudy. Ralea was also one of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 \"Scrieri din trecut\" (\"Writings from the Past).\n\nUnder a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 \"În extremul occident\" (\"Into the Far West\"). It had comments on the \"iron fisted rule\" of the United Fruit, and gibes at \"the putrefied lazy specimens\" of \"exploiters\" in pre-communist Cuba. Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and rehabilitated: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 \"Istoria psihologiei\" (\"History of Psychology\"). According to memoirist C. D. Zeletin, Ralea and Vianu had a \"courageous and noble\" stand after the student protest of 1956: acting together, they obtained the release from Securitate custody of Dumitru D. Panaitescu, son of the critic Perpessicius.\n\nRalea and his family lived at a luxurious villa on Washington Street, Dorobanți. In 1961, he had been re-inducted into the literary canon, mentioned in official manuals as one of sixteen critics whose work supported \"socialist construction\". Around that time, Ralea and Vianu mounted campaign for Marxist humanism, and were elected to the National Board of UNESCO (Ralea was its vice president). Their actions were condemned at the time by the exile writer Virgil Ierunca, who described their \"solemn agitation\" as a new ruse on the part of Gheorghiu-Dej. Ralea was also sent abroad with a dossier on exile writer Vintilă Horia, who had received the Prix Goncourt. It showed evidence of Horia's support for interwar fascism. Ralea's mission was hampered by revelations about his own compromises with fascism, published in \"Le Monde\", \"Paris-Presse\" and the Romanian diaspora press, under such titles as: \"Ralea used to lift his arm really high\". According to later assessments, the Horia affair and Ralea's participation therein were instrumented by the Securitate.\n\nAdhering to the official cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down, but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium and a seat on the republican Council of State. In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a Geneva conference on the generation gap, alongside Louis Armand, Claude Autant-Lara, and Jean Piaget. Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, Traian Herseni. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime. Together, they published \"Sociologia succesului\" (\"The Sociology of Success\"); Herseni used the pseudonym \"Traian Hariton\". Despite such interventions, Ralea was publicly shamed by the dissident poet Păstorel Teodoreanu, who nicknamed him the communist \"Viceroy\", or \"Immo-Ralea\".\n\nAccording to his younger colleague George C. Basiliade, Ralea was an \"unfulfilled sybarite\", whose luxurious lifestyle did not fit his physical frame and his background. A heavy smoker, and prone to culinary excesses, Ralea checked himself in Otopeni hospital showing symptoms of facial nerve paralysis, with hypertension and fatigue. Against the advice of his doctors, he decided to attend a UNESCO meeting in Copenhagen. He died aboard the train, outside East Berlin, on the morning of August 17, 1964. His body was transported back to Bucharest, and buried at Bellu cemetery. Ralea and Herseni had been working on a textbook, \"Introducere în psihologia socială\" (\"Companion to Social Psychology\"), which only saw print in 1966.\n\nAs seen by Zavarache, Ralea was a man of \"outstanding intelligence\" with an \"encyclopedic knowledge, tightly aligned with the rhythms of Western culture.\" Ralea's contemporaries left remarks on not just his hyperactivity, but also his neglect of details, and his eclecticism. Pompiliu Constantinescu remarked of \"petulant\" Ralea: \"Here is a soul who will not stand for the label of specialization!\" In 1926, Eugen Lovinescu dismissed Ralea as \"a fecund ideologue, paradoxical in his association and dissociation of varied and superficial ideals that have happened to have points of contact with Romanian literature.\" He reads both Ralea and Suchianu as displays of \"useless erudition\" and \"failure of logic\". Completing this verdict, Monica Lovinescu saw Ralea as \"not truly a literary critic\", but \"a sociologist, a psychologist, a moralist—a moralist with no morals, and yet a moralist\". More leniently, George Călinescu noted that Ralea was an \"epicurean\" of \"vivid intelligence\", who only chronicled \"books that he has enjoyed reading\". His free associations of concepts were \"very often surprising, quite often admirable\". Ralea, Călinescu proposes, was Romania's own \"little Fontenelle\".\n\nAfter his French sojourn, Ralea infused Poporanism and collectivism with both Durkheim's corporatism and Marx's theory of \"class consciousness\". In his earliest work, he also referenced Ludwig Gumplowicz's ideas about the fundamental inequality of class-based societies. These references helped him build a critique of innate \"class solidarity\" as presumed by early corporatism, and also of Proudhon's mutualist economics. Despite this collectivist-functionalist outlook, and although he spoke out against art for art's sake, Ralea was adamant that strictly sociological explanations of creativity were doomed to fail. As he put it, all attributes of a writer were \"subsidiary to [his] creative originality\".\n\nRalea reduced aestheticism and social determinism to the basic units of \"aesthetics\" and \"ethnicity\". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality. An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was \"obliged\" to address the national society he lived in, \"at the present stage in civilization\": \"If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, that is to say the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd stand to lose his means of expression, the point of contact with his public\". Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic Petru Comarnescu) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of Christian art.\n\nWith this analysis of aesthetic principles, borrowing from Henri Bergson, Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in relativism and intuitionism. With his respect for critical intuition, his critique of determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the \"aesthetic autonomism\" of Titu Maiorescu. Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or \"unforeseen significances\"), thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the semiotics of Roland Barthes. With \"Între două lumi\", he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.\n\nIn his essay \"Fenomenul Românesc\" (\"The Romanian Phenomenon\"), Ralea elaborated on the issue of Romanian national psychology. He understood this as a natural development of Dimitrie Gusti's sociological \"science of the nation\", but better suited to the topic and more resourceful. According to Ralea, Romanians were structurally opposed to mysticism, which could not compliment their true character: \"good-natured, even-minded, sharp-witted like all meridional men, [and] extremely lucid.\" The \"Romanian soul\" was therefore an adaptable and pragmatic entity, mixing a Western propensity for action with a Levantine fatalism. Combating antisemitism, Ralea applied this theory to the issue of European Jewish intelligence: quoting Werner Sombart, he deduced that the \"rationalist\", \"progressive\" and \"utilitarian\" essence of Jewishness was socially determined by the Jews' participation in capitalist competition.\n\nAlthough Ralea was personally responsible for establishing a laboratory of experimental psychology at Iași, he in fact abhorred experimental methods, and preferred to rely on intuition. As a theorist, he gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, in the face of philosophical sobriety. He commended Ion Luca Caragiale, the creator of modern Romanian humor, as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence. As noted by Călinescu, Ralea \"either intentionally or unconsciously [suggests] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety\". Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: \"maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done us a great harm\". During his polemic with \"Sburătorul\" modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: \"Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [the modernists]. They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics\". According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of \"lassitude\" and \"cowardice\" in urban life is \"a severe diagnostic of his own disease.\"\n\nOn such grounds, Ralea concluded that Romanian writers \"have had no deep spiritual experience\", lacking \"a comprehension of humanity, of life and death.\" In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in \"Perspective\", Ralea asked: \"Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?\". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a \"great moral significance\". He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral Romanian folklore and modern literary choices: in the absence of any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and \"doine\" had naturally mutated into novellas. In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the idea. At the time of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an \"inflation of novels\".\n\nIn a 1945 interview with writer Ion Biberi, Ralea explained himself as a Marxist humanist, influenced by André Malraux and by unspecified \"recent Russian doctrinaires\". Expanding on his earlier stances, he understood the socialist mode of production as both desirable and inevitable, to be received with \"enthusiasm\" by the masses: \"[it] provides practically infinite production opportunities, because it excludes personal gain and is no longer dominated by the game of markets, of supply and demand.\" He conceived of a socialism wherein \"man, integrated with communal life, shall have full liberty in his actions\". However, according to political scientist Ioan Stanomir, Ralea's discourse is to be read as a \"celebration of slavery\".\n\nThe transformation was accelerated during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying Marxist aesthetics and Marxist literary criticism, advising young literati, and his colleague Vianu, to do the same. Ralea was also going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it as an obstacle to the proper understanding of Romanian society. His teaching aid for social psychology was similarly adjusted, introducing chapters on \"class psychology\", though, as Zavarache argues, these modifications were \"surprisingly kept to a minimum\". Especially in his reedited \"Scrieri din trecut\", Ralea sought to reconcile Ibrăileanu's social Darwinism with the official readings of Marxism, as well as with Michurinism and Pavlovianism.\n\nShaped by political command, \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman\" excoriated American psychologists as tools of the capitalist regime, claiming that capitalism cultivated \"force\", \"triviality\", and \"sexual debauchery\"; Ralea also stated his outrage at the absence of socialized health care in the United States, even though he privately explained that American workers led \"satisfactory\" lives. To his peers, Ralea complained that \"the adoption of a Marxist canon was stifling his ability to interpret\", and therefore prevented him from \"elaborating valuable papers.\" He \"doubtlessly never imagined that there would be such excess and distortion\", and tried to persuade communist censors not to exaggerate his works' anti-Americanism.\n\nIn \"Explicarea omului\", Vianu notes, Ralea brought up \"a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself \"obstacles\" and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [Vianu's emphasis].\" According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as \"a mechanism for social self-regulation\", which helped to distill the \"vital impulse\", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality. Overall, Ralea contended that \"dialectical materialism has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring\". That answer was in \"superstructures\", and the references were Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, alongside Ludwig Klages and Max Scheler. According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of psychological anthropology, and merely showed \"what superstructures become under Marxist materialism.\" Contrarily, critic Antonio Patraș noted the links between \"Explicarea omului\" (a \"brilliant study\") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.\n\n\"Sociologia succesului\" was to some extent dependent on Ralea's study of Durkheim's \"Division of Labor\", with its distinction between laws of punishment and laws of restitution (or reward). Ralea maintained that remedial sanctions were a characteristic of modern civilized society, and that the social fact of \"success\" was created within that setting. However, the work was heavily reliant on Marxist sociology, hypothesizing that socialist societies had perfected new incentives for workers to set collective objectives and succeed at them. According to psychologist Edgar Krau, Ralea and Herseni gave credibility to \"the tenet that the individualistic ethics of capitalism disunites and hurts people\"; however, they ignored the reality of communism, which was \"not [its] collectivism, but the all-pervading party tuition\". In Romania, \"Sociologia succesului\" was mainly noted for reintegrating professional (albeit antiquated) references to American psychology and sociology. It marked a fundamental step in the restoration of Romanian sociology, and also allowed Ralea to publish again on a subject which had preoccupied him since 1944.\n\nRalea was survived by his only child, daughter Catinca Ralea (1929–1981). In her twenties, she cultivated a literary circle which included poet Geo Dumitrescu. She also had a career in letters, before becoming a Radio Romania International reporter and Romanian Television producer. In 1969, Catinca provided live coverage of the Apollo 11 mission, including the first Moon landing. Additionally, she is remembered for her translations from J. D. Salinger (which fed Romania's counterculture of the 1960s) and J. R. R. Tolkien. With Eugenia Cîncea, she completed a best-selling translation of \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\", which had five editions between 1962 and 1982. Against her father's wish, she married in 1958 the actor Emanoil Petruț, who survived her by two years.\n\nMihai Ralea's death, coinciding with a spell of liberalization, created unexpected room for maneuver for a younger generation of literary critics and historians, who were anti-sociological, subjectivist, and post-structuralist. Nevertheless, some members of this intellectual school, such as Adrian Marino and Matei Călinescu, continued to draw inspiration from Ralea, having rediscovered his early Bergsonian essays. They were joined in this by Alexandru Ivasiuc, the novelist and Marxist literary theorist. From within the anti-communist movement, Ralea was defended by author Nicolae Steinhardt. Although a devout Orthodox, Steinhardt treasured the non-believers Ralea and Paul Zarifopol for their \"quick wit\".\n\nAfter the 1989 Revolution and the fall of communism, Ralea's Dobrina estate was transferred by government order to the Orthodox Diocese of Huși, and came to host a convent. His Dorobanți villa, which Catinca Ralea had sold, bears a memorial plaque honoring the sociologist. By Government Act 503/1998, the Romanian Academy Institute of Psychology was renamed \"Mihai Ralea Institute\". The Huși library, also named after Ralea, has been hosting the entire corpus of his works since 2013.\n\nRalea's early sociological writings were republished, as \"Fenomenul Românesc\", in 1997. By then, his sociological contribution was being reassessed in various ways, leading to a reissue of his essays as a 1997 volume, put out by Constantin Schifirneț at Editura Albatros. Around 1995, a heated public debate erupted, focusing on the careers of leftist intellectuals such as Ralea, and their supposed acts of self-betrayal. The central question, brought up by researcher Marin Nițescu, was: would they have done better not to publish at all under communism? In 2010, a group of sociologists defended Ralea's prestige, noting that \"we [Romanians] are inexcusably delaying in recognizing Mihai Ralea's sociological contribution\".\n"}
{"id": "8296742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8296742", "title": "Northern (genre)", "text": "Northern (genre)\n\nThe Northern or Northwestern is a genre in various arts which tell stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the north of North America, primarily in Canada but also in Alaska. It is similar to the Western genre but many elements are different, as appropriate to its setting. It is common for central character to be a Mountie instead of a cowboy or sheriff. Other common characters include fur trappers and traders, lumberjacks, prospectors, First Nations people, settlers and townsfolk.\n\nInternational interest in the region and the genre was fuelled by the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–99) and subsequent works surrounding it, fiction and non-fiction. The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years of the twentieth century. Northerns are still produced but popularity waned in the late 1950s.\n\nNortherns are similar to westerns but are set in the frozen north of North America; that is, Canada or Alaska. Of the two, Canada was the most common setting, although many tropes could apply to both. Popular locations within Canada are the Yukon, the Barren Grounds, and area around Hudson Bay. Generic names used for this general setting included the \"Far North\", the \"Northlands\", the \"North Woods\", and the \"Great Woods\".\n\nCommon settings include boreal forests, isolated cabins, and mining towns. Snow featured to such an extent that Northern films were sometimes termed \"snow pictures\". Animals were a common feature too. Dogs and dog sleds were popularized by \"The Call of the Wild\" and \"White Fang\". Scenes involving attacks by bears date back to \"The Klondyke Nugget\".\n\nThe primary antagonist in a Northern can be the wilderness, the weather and other natural elements, which the protagonists must endure, overcome and survive.\n\nNortherns often explore the 'Matter of Canada' (the national mythos of Canada, after the Matter of Rome). Common elements of which are the Black Donnelly murders (February 1880), the North-West Rebellion (1885), the Klondike Gold Rush (1896–99), the pursuit of Albert Johnson (January 1932), the October Crisis (October 1970), and persistent national anxiety about potential annexation by the United States.\n\nThe Western idea of lawlessness set in American towns was not a part of the Canadian Northern, though individual lawbreakers or uprisings by Canadians feature in works such as \"Quebec\" (1951), \"Riel\" (1979), and \"Northwest Mounted Police\" (1940). In Northerns and wider crime fiction, the general Canadian preference is for law enforcement to be performed by the state rather than vigilantes or private investigators. Likewise, Northerns rarely feature the heroic outlaws often found in Westerns. On the subject, David Skene-Melvin writes \"Canada never had a Wild West because the Mounties got there first,\" while Margaret Atwood writes \"No outlaws or lawless men for Canada; if one appears, the Mounties always get their man.\"\n\nLaw and order in Northerns set in Canada is most often represented by the Mounties, either the North-West Mounted Police or Royal Canadian Mounted Police depending on era. Like snow, Mounties are a common enough feature to become a synonym for the genre, with Northern films sometimes called \"Mountie films\". Their popularity was not confined to film; by 1930, 75 volumes of written Mountie fiction had been published, not including juvenile fiction and material published in magazines. Where a protagonist in a Western is often part of both civilization and the wild (whether native or criminal), Mounties in Northerns are entirely a part of civilization. The nature of fictional Mounties can vary depending on the nationality of the author. Mounties as written by British authors are often younger members of upper class British families serving the British Empire in the colonies. American-authored Mounties are often little different from US Marshalls and project the values of Westerns in that they place their individual sense of justice and conscience above their duty to the law. Canadian-authored Mounties represent, and are self-abnegating champions of, the Canadian establishment and its laws. Further, their authority does not come from either their social class or physical abilities; such a Mountie \"upholds the law by moral rather than physical force\". A common story outline for Northerns involving Mounties is a pursuit, confrontation and capture: the Mountie's pursuit of a fugitive takes place across the Canadian wilderness and may be resolved non-violently.\n\nAccording to Pierre Berton \"the French-Canadian was to the northerns what the Mexican was to the westerns — an exotic primitive, adaptable as a chameleon to play a hero or a heavy.\" French-Canadians were a ubiquitous element of the genre. As characters, French-Canadians are typically depicted as rustic and uneducated. These characters were usually divided into two broad types: the heroic, happy-go-lucky bon-vivant and the villainous, lecherous killer. Some later examples merged the two stereotypes into a charming, roguish anti-villain. Common visual elements were a tuque, a sash and a pipe. All were present in the first appearance in film, in \"A Woman's Way\" (1908). Female French-Canadian characters also followed the \"tempestuous\" stereotype of female Mexican characters. Mexican actress Lupe Vélez, in line with her identity as \"The Mexican Spitfire\", played the title character in \"Tiger Rose\" (1929) in this mode; as did Renée Adorée in \"The Eternal Struggle\" (1923) and Nikki Duval in \"Quebec\" (1951).\n\nA common anachronism in Northerns was the tyranny and absolute power of the Hudson's Bay Company and its officers, even into the modern period. This was repeated not just in fiction but by reviewers and critics too. The concept of \"La Longue Traverse\", or the Journey of Death, comes from \"The Call of the North\" (1914) and was popular in later films. In this, the Hudson's Bay Company executes convicts by forcing them into the wilderness without equipment or supplies. In 1921, the Hudson's Bay Company successfully sued the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation for the villainous portrayal of their Company in the latters' remake \"The Call of the North\".\n\nAlaska Natives or Métis are featured in some depictions.\n\nBesides being set in Canadian Prairies, the stories often contrast the American frontier with the Canadian frontier in several ways. In films such as \"Pony Soldier\" and \"Saskatchewan\" the North-West Mounted Police display reason, compassion and a sense of fair play in their dealings with Aboriginal people (First Nations) as opposed to hotheaded American visitors (often criminals), lawmen or the American Army who seem to prefer extermination with violence.\n\nDavid Skene-Melvin classes the \"second period\" of Canadian crime literature (1880–1920), as \"the heyday of the 'Northern' and the literary exploration of Canada's remote and romantic frontiers.\" He refers to Joseph Edmund Collins as an important figure in this period because, despite his work being of low quality, he was the first Canadian author to address some aspects of the 'Matter of Canada' in his novels, such as \"The Story of Louis Riel: The Rebel Chief\" (1885) and \"Annette, the Métis Spy\" (1886). Northerns continued to be written after 1920 but Canadian authors largely moved to other genres after World War 1 as they moved away from a frontier and colonial ethos.\n\nThe Klondike Gold Rush during the 1890s in Canada and Alaska brought a lot of wider, international attention to the far north of North America. Adventure novels from veterans of the gold rush—such as Jack London's \"The Call of the Wild\" (1903), Rex Beach's \"The Spoilers\" (1906) and Robert W. Service's \"The Trail of Ninety-Eight\" (1909)—became best sellers. These inspired more adventure fiction which grew in popularity throughout the first half of the twentieth century. The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years, with a \"Mountie craze\" hitting its peak during the mid-1920s.\n\nA large amount of Northern fiction is the work of non-Canadians. Nevertheless, Skene-Melvin writes \"Just as the Western is widely regarded as emblematic of American culture, it can be argued that the Northern is the only truly indigenous Canadian art form, even if most of its exponents have been foreigners.\"\n\nOne of the earliest international examples of the genre is the British play \"The Klondyke Nugget\", which was first performed in 1898. Its author, Samuel Franklin Cody initially wrote it as a Western but changed the location to capitalize on the contemporary gold rush.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's 1925 film \"The Gold Rush\" is a comedy that parodies some of the cliches of the Northern genre. The Looney Tunes character Blacque Jacque Shellacque, who first appeared in the 1959 short \"Bonanza Bunny\", is another parody.\n\nWhile the Hollywood Western began to change in the post-World War 2 era and the Western myth was eventually debunked, Hollywood Northerns remained unchanged until they stopped being produced in the late 1950s and the underlying mythology was never examined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A \"griffin fighting an elk\" motif from the Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós, found in 1799 in what is today Romania, bears similarities with another griffin & elk motif discovered in the tombs of Hsiung-nu (early Huns, also Xiongnu) during Colonel Pyotr Kuzmich Kozlov expedition (1907–09) near Urga (Outer Mongolia).\n\nA gold symbolization of \"animals-in-fight\" has been also found in the vicinity of the city of Turpan, the principal crossroad of the northern Silk Road.

It is believed that the nomads ranged widely, forever moving on for sake of richer grazing for their horses and sheep. Migrations were often seasonal. Their skill at extracting gold was unprecedented. In summer, during the tribe's seasonal migration, a fleece would be weighted on a riverbed to collect particles of alluvial gold. Upon the tribes' return, the fleece would be sheared, burned, and a gold ingot the size of a horse's hoof would result. The \"tay tayak\" (the horse's hoof) was a unit of gold for a long period, which was used as a measure of an amount of golden metal rather than money, since gold was not fabricated as currency. Using gold was a spiritual practice, as emblems of priestly office, prizes for physical prowess in ritual sport, or as adornment of the sacral ceremony of marriage.\n\n"}
{"id": "23356214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23356214", "title": "Philadelphia Grand Opera Company", "text": "Philadelphia Grand Opera Company\n\nThe Philadelphia Grand Opera Company was the name of four different American opera companies active at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania during the twentieth century. The last and best known of the four was founded in November 1954 with the merger of the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company and the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company. That company in turn merged with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1975 to form the Opera Company of Philadelphia. Of the three earlier companies, only one lasted beyond one season; a company founded in 1926 which later became associated with the Curtis Institute of Music in 1929. That company closed its doors in 1932 due to financial reasons during the Great Depression.\n\nThe first company to be known as the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (PGOC) was founded in 1916. Its first production, Gaetano Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\", opened on December 18 of that year at the Academy of Music with Regina Vicarino in the title role, Forrest Lamont as Edgardo, and Ettore Martini conducting. Short lived, the company produced one more opera in December 1916, Giuseppe Verdi's \"Il trovatore\", before disbanding.\n\nThe second company to be known as the PGOC was actually a company based out of New York City that was active in both NYC and Philadelphia. The company was founded by impresario Alfred Salmaggi (later founder of the Salmaggi Opera Company) in the spring of 1920 under the name the Italian Lyric Federation. The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was Verdi's \"Otello\" on June 30, 1920 with Nicola Zerola in the title role. The company changed its name to the PGOC in November 1920 after the financial backers fired Salmaggi. From this point on the company worked out of Philadelphia, although Salmaggi countered his firing by continuing to perform works with different singers under the name of the Italian Lyric Federation in NYC. Like the first PGOC, this company was also short lived, with its last production, \"Rigoletto\", being held on Halloween of 1921.\n\nThe third PGOC was founded in 1926 by Helen Redington Carter, socialite wife of well known Philadelphia neurologist Joseph Leidy, William Carl Hammer, an importer and trumpeter, and his wife, Kathryn O'Gorman Hammer. Both of the Hammers ran the business side of the company, with William running the Box Office and Kathryn hiring artists, putting together sets and costumes, and sometimes directing productions. Kathryn was a bandmaster and trombonist and she was notably the world's only female opera director at that time. Mrs. Leidy served as the opera board's president and provided a considerable amount of financial backing to get the company started. She also was able to get the opera house filled, being influential among Philadelphia's high society of the day.\n\nDuring the company's first year, the Hammers announced six performances for the first season. The company's first performance at the Academy of Music was a production of Verdi's \"Aida\" on October 28, 1926 with Vera Curtis in the title role, Jerome Uhl as the King of Egypt, John Sample as Radames, and Marta Wittkowska as Amneris. Other operas that season included \"Rigoletto\" with Millo Picco in the title role and Josephine Lucchese as Gilda, Charles Gounod's \"Faust\" with Charles Hart in the title role and Irene Williams as Marguerite, Ruggero Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" with Robert Steel as Tonio and Euphemia Giannini Gregory as Nedda, \"Otello\" with Sample in the title role and Chief Caupolican as Iago, and \"Carmen\" with Wittkowska in the title role and Armand Tokatyan as Don José.\n\nDuring the company's first three seasons the company was struggling to get by. Kathryn was able to save the company a lot of money by making the company's costumes from cheesecloth on her home sewing-machine and begging and borrowing sets and properties at bargain prices. Largely due to her shrewd efforts the company managed to stay in the black. The company opened its second season on October 20, 1927 with Amilcare Ponchielli's \"La Gioconda\", starring Clara Jacobo in the title role, Mignon Sutorius as Laura, as Alvise Badoero, and Berta Levina as La cieca. Conductor Artur Rodziński joined the company that year and remained one of the PGOC's major conductors through 1929. Highlights of that second season included productions of Giacomo Puccini's \"Tosca\" with Martha Attwood in the title role and Pietro Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\" with Lisa Roma as Santuzza. Highlights of the 1928–1929 season included Franco Leoni's \"L’oracolo\" with as Uin-Sci and Adamo Didur as Cim-Fen, Camille Saint-Saëns's \"Samson et Dalila\" with Sample as Samson and Madame Cahier as Dalila, Jules Massenet's \"Manon\" with Hope Hampton in the title role and Ralph Errolle as Des Grieux, Eleanor Painter as Carmen, \"Il trovatore\" with Frances Peralta as Leonora, and \"The Barber of Seville\" with Josephine Lucchese as Rosina.\n\nIn 1929 a major windfall came to the PGOC when Mary Louise Curtis Bok offered to support the company in exchange for using the company as an outlet for opera talent in the Curtis Institute of Music. The PGOC accepted the offer and a partnership was formed with Curtis students appearing mostly in minor roles with the company. Plans were initially made to build a new $7,000,000 opera house for the company and the Philadelphia Orchestra but, like many projects of the day, these plans were ultimately abandoned as a result of the financial crisis of the Great Depression. Bok's support, however, did manage to keep the company afloat longer than it probably would have, producing three more seasons of opera at the Academy of Music. Indeed, the company's two major rivals, the Pennsylvania Grand Opera Company and the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company, both closed their doors not long after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\n\nDuring its remaining years the quality of PGOC's productions increased, particularly in regards to the sets and costumes. The quality of the singers remained high. A highlight of these years was the United States premiere of Alban Berg's \"Wozzeck\" on March 19, 1931 with Ivan Ivantzoff in the title role, Anne Roselle as Marie, Gabriel Leonoff as the Drum Major, Sergei Radamsky as Andres, Bruno Korell as the Captain, as the Doctor, and Leopold Stokowski conducting. Stokowski also conducted the world premiere of Carlos Chávez and Diego Rivera's ballet \"H. P.\" for the PGOC on March 31, 1932. The company was also notably the first American company to perform Richard Strauss's \"Elektra\" in the original German on October 29, 1931 with Roselle in the title role and Charlotte Boerner as Chrysothemis.\n\nThe PGOC's final performance was a production of \"Aida\" on April 14, 1932 with Roselle in the title role, Aroldo Lindi as Radames, Cyrena van Gordon as Amneris, and Leo de Hierapolis as the King of Egypt. The company closed due to financial reasons in 1932. At the time they canceled the end of the 1931–1932 season and announced the intention of commencing another season for 1933-1934. That never happened, possibly because Mrs. Liedy and her husband both died in 1932. The Curtis Institute of Music was also experiencing financial difficulties at that time and rumors of its imminent closing, which never occurred, were circulating in 1932.\n\nThe last company to be called the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company was formed in November 1954 when the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera and the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company merged. Anthony Terracciano served as the company's first General Director in its first season but was then succeeded by General Manager Humbert A. Pelosi who was appointed that position at the end of the 1955–1956 season. Terracciano remained with the company as an Artistic Director through the Spring of 1972. Pelosi left in March 1956 after a feud with Terracciano. He was replaced by conductor Giuseppe Bamboschek who had been working for the company since it began. Bamboschek remained the company's director until 1961 when Terracciano was again made General Manager by longtime friend and musical colleague, Max M. Leon, who was then the opera company's president. This time Terracciano stayed on until 1972.\n\nAlthough formed in 1954, the company finished the 1954–1955 season performing under the title of the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company. The company's inaugural performance as the PGOC was of \"Rigoletto\" under the baton on Giuseppe Bamboschek on October 13, 1955 at the Academy of Music. The production starred Frank Guarrera in the title role, Lisa di Julio as Gilda, and Eugene Conley as the Duke of Mantua. Other productions that first season included Puccini's \"La bohème\" (with Rosanna Carteri as Mimì, Jan Peerce as Rodolfo, and Virginia MacWatters as Musetta), \"Faust\" (with Robert Rounseville in the title role, Nicola Moscona as Méphistophélès, and Ellen Faull as Marguerite), Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" (with Licia Albanese as Cio-cio-san, Walter Fredericks as Pinkerton, Margaret Roggero as Suzuki, and Cesare Bardelli as Sharpless), Italo Montemezzi's \"L'amore dei tre re\" (with Beverly Sills as Fiora and Ramón Vinay as Avito), \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" (with MacWatters as Rosina, Guarrera as Figaro, and Cesare Valletti as Almaviva), \"Cavalleria rusticana\" (with Maria Gasi as Santuzza), \"Pagliacci\" (with Fredericks as Canio and Eva Likova as Nedda), and \"Aida\" (with Astrid Varnay in the title role, Kurt Baum as Radamès, Claramae Turner as Amneris, and John Lawler as the King of Egypt).\n\nThe Philadelphia Grand Opera Company remained active for two decades, producing six operas during an annual season. The company notably presented the world premiere of Pietro Aria's \"Jericho Road\" on March 12, 1969. Many notable singers performed with the company during its history including, John Alexander, Thelma Altman, Salvatore Baccaloni, Cesare Bardelli, Gaetano Bardini, Daniele Barioni, Ara Berberian, Frances Bible, John Brownlee, Giuseppe Campora, Richard Cassilly, George Cehanovsky, Anita Cerquetti, Eugene Conley, Fernando Corena, Viorica Cortez, Mary Costa, Mary Curtis Verna, Jon Crain, Gilda Cruz-Romo, Enrico di Giuseppe, Mignon Dunn, Pierre Duval, Otto Edelmann, Rosalind Elias, Edith Evans, Jean Fenn, Giulio Fioravanti, Nicolai Gedda, Leyla Gencer, Bonaldo Giaiotti, Tito Gobbi, Thomas Hayward, Jerome Hines, Laurel Hurley, Raoul Jobin, Robert Kerns, Dorothy Kirsten, Flaviano Labò, Albert Lance, Brenda Lewis, Thomas LoMonaco, Chester Ludgin, Cornell MacNeil, Jean Madeira, Elaine Malbin, Adriana Maliponte, Susanne Marsee, Robert Merrill, Anna Moffo, Licinio Montefusco, Irene Kramerich, Sonia Leon, Barry Morell, Nicola Moscona, Herva Nelli, Birgit Nilsson, Roberta Peters, Louis Quilico, Luciano Rampaso, Nell Rankin, Regina Resnik, Graciela Rivera, Elinor Ross, Jane Shaulis, Giulietta Simionato, Joanna Simon, Eleanor Steber, Teresa Stratas, Brian Sullivan, Giuseppe Taddei, Ferruccio Tagliavini, Pia Tassinari, Blanche Thebom, Giorgio Tozzi, Norman Treigle, Gabriella Tucci, Richard Tucker, Giuseppe Valdengo, Frank Valentino, Luigi Vellucci, and Jon Vickers to name just a few. The PGOC's last performance was of Johann Strauss II's \"Die Fledermaus\" on December 6, 1974 with Joseph Venezia as Alfred, June Fiske as Adele, Eileen Schauler as Rosalinde, Robert Goodloe as Eisenstein, and Carlo Moresco conducting.\n\nIn the companies last three years the opera board's long-term president, Max Leon, served as the company's manager after the departure of Terracciano. Experiencing some financial difficulties, the company began talks with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company about a possible merger in 1974. An agreement was reached and the two companies merged to form the Opera Company of Philadelphia in 1975 with Leon serving as General Director.\n\n"}
{"id": "25825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25825", "title": "Red", "text": "Red\n\nRed is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. The red sky at sunset results from Rayleigh scattering, while the red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. Iron oxide also gives the red color to the planet Mars. The red colour of blood comes from protein hemoglobin, while ripe strawberries, red apples and reddish autumn leaves are colored by anthocyanins.\n\nRed pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egytians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to colour early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red also became the color of revolution; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.\n\nSince red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love and joy. In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color of symbolizing happiness and good fortune.\n\nThe human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between approximately 625 and 740 nanometers. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the light just past this range is called infrared, or below red, and cannot be seen by human eyes, although it can be sensed as heat. In the language of optics, red is the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the S or the M (short and medium wavelength) cone cells of the retina, combined with a fading stimulation of the L (long-wavelength) cone cells.\n\nPrimates can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans, but many kinds of mammals, such as dogs and cattle, have dichromacy, which means they can see blues and yellows, but cannot distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray). Bulls, for instance, cannot see the red color of the cape of a bullfighter, but they are agitated by its movement. (See color vision).\n\nOne theory for why primates developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from unripe fruit and inedible vegetation. This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.\n\nRed light is used to help adapt night vision in low-light or night time, as the rod cells in the human eye are not sensitive to red.\n\nRed illumination was (and sometimes still is) used as a safelight while working in a darkroom as it does not expose most photographic paper and some films. Today modern darkrooms usually use an amber safelight.\n\nOn the color wheel long used by painters, and in traditional color theory, red is one of the three primary colors, along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet: Cennino Cennini, in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, \"If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac [red lake], ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder\" he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite.\n\nIn modern color theory, also known as the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors on your computer screen and your television. For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.\n\nSo that the maximum number of colors can be accurately reproduced on your computer screen, each color has been given a code number, or sRGB, which tells your computer the intensity of the red, green and blue components of that color. The intensity of each component is measured on a scale of zero to 255, which means the complete list includes 16,777,216 distinct colors and shades. The sRGB number of pure red, for example, is 255, 00, 00, which means the red component is at its maximum intensity, and there is no green or blue. The sRGB number for crimson is 220, 20, 60, which means that the red is slightly less intense and therefore darker, there is some green, which leans it toward orange; and there is a larger amount of blue, which makes it slightly blue-violet.\n\nAs a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to Rayleigh scattering, changing the final color of the beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye.\nAt sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow.\n\nLasers emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the ruby laser in 1960. In 1962 the red helium–neon laser was invented, and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including holography, and in education. Red helium–neon lasers were used commercially in LaserDisc players. The use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of modern DVD players, which use a 660 nm laser diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers. Portable, high-powered versions are also available for various applications. More recently, 671 nm diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers have been introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, particle image velocimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and holography.\n\nRed's wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early compact disc technologies, are being replaced by blue lasers, as red's longer wavelength causes the laser's recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.\n\n\nRed lac, also called red lake, crimson lake or carmine lake, was an important red pigment in Renaissance and Baroque art. Since it was translucent, thin layers of red lac were built up or glazed over a more opaque dark color to create a particularly deep and vivid color.\n\nUnlike vermilion or red ochre, made from minerals, red lake pigments are made by mixing organic dyes, made from insects or plants, with white chalk or alum. Red lac was made from the gum lac, the dark red resinous substance secreted by various scale insects, particularly the Laccifer lacca from India. Carmine lake was made from the cochineal insect from Central and South America, Kermes lake came from a different scale insect, \"kermes vermilio\", which thrived on oak trees around the Mediterranean. Other red lakes were made from the rose madder plant and from the brazilwood tree.\n\nRed lake pigments were an important part of the palette of 16th-century Venetian painters, particularly Titian, but they were used in all periods. Since the red lakes were made from organic dyes, they tended to be fugitive, becoming unstable and fading when exposed to sunlight.\n\nThe most common synthetic food coloring today is Allura Red AC is a red azo dye that goes by several names including: Allura Red, Food Red 17, C.I. 16035, FD&C Red 40, It was originally manufactured from coal tar, but now is mostly made from petroleum.\n\nIn Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France and Switzerland, and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994. The European Union approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant, but EU countries' local laws banning food colorants are preserved.\n\nIn the United States, Allura Red AC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cosmetics, drugs, and food. It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products, such as soft drinks, children's medications, and cotton candy. On June 30, 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called for the FDA to ban Red 40.\n\nBecause of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes, many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as carmine, made from crushing the tiny female cochineal insect. This insect, originating in Mexico and Central American, was used to make the brilliant scarlet dyes of the European Renaissance.\n\nThe red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called anthocyanins. They are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer. They develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences—both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced.\n\nDuring the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.\n\nAnthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries, red apples, blueberries, cherries, raspberries, and plums.\n\nAnthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas—a famous example being New England—up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment. In autumn forests they appear vivid in the maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, tupelos, cherry trees and persimmons. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids' colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species. (See Autumn leaf color).\n\nOxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated hemoglobin that contains iron molecules, with the iron components reflecting red light. Red meat gets its color from the iron found in the myoglobin and hemoglobin in the muscles and residual blood.\n\nPlants like apples, strawberries, cherries, tomatoes, peppers, and pomegranates are often colored by forms of carotenoids, red pigments that also assist photosynthesis.\n\n\nRed hair occurs naturally on approximately 1–2% of the human population. It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein.\n\nRed hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term redhead (originally \"redd hede\") has been in use since at least 1510. Cultural reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration; many common stereotypes exist regarding redheads and they are often portrayed as fiery-tempered. (See red hair).\n\nRed is associated with dominance in a number of animal species. For example, in mandrills, red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males, increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates, and directly correlated with levels of testosterone. Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others, leading to significant differences in mortality, reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not. In humans, wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions, including professional sport and multiplayer video games. Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise, so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance. Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue, and, when asked, a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more \"dominant\", \"aggressive\", and \"likely to win a physical competition\" than blue shapes. In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior, exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an \"achievement\" context (e.g. taking an IQ test).\n\nInside cave 13B at Pinnacle Point, an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa, paleoanthropologists in 2000 found evidence that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, Late Stone Age people were scraping and grinding ochre, a clay colored red by iron oxide, probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies.\n\nRed hematite powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing. The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago. The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead.\n\nRed, black and white were the first colors used by artists in the Upper Paleolithic age, probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived. Madder, a plant whose root could be made into a red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia. The cave of Altamira in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC.\n\nA red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus \"Kermes\", primarily \"Kermes vermilio\". The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône. Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans, who imported it from Spain. A different variety of dye was made from \"Porphyrophora hamelii\" (Armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians.\n\nKermes is also mentioned in the Bible. In the Book of Exodus, God instructs Moses to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth \"of blue, and purple, and scarlet.\" The term used for scarlet in the 4th-century Latin Vulgate version of the Bible passage is \"coccumque bis tinctum\", meaning \"colored twice with coccus.\" \"Coccus\", from the ancient Greek \"Kokkos\", means a tiny grain and is the term that was used in ancient times for the Kermes vermilio insect used to make the Kermes dye. This was also the origin of the expression \"dyed in the grain.\"\n\nIn ancient Egypt, red was associated with life, health, and victory. Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations. Egyptian women used red ochre as a cosmetic to redden cheeks and lips and also used henna to color their hair and paint their nails.\n\nBut, like many colors, it also had a negative association, with heat, destruction and evil. A prayer to god Isis states: \"Oh Isis, protect me from all things evil and red.\" The ancient Egyptians began manufacturing pigments in about 4000 BC. Red ochre was widely used as a pigment for wall paintings, particularly as the skin color of men. An ivory painter's palette found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun had small compartments with pigments of red ochre and five other colors. The Egyptians used the root of the rubia, or madder plant, to make a dye, later known as alizarin, and also used it as a pigment, which became known as madder lake, alizarin or alizarin crimson.\n\nIn Ancient China, artisans were making red and black painted pottery as early as the Yangshao Culture period (5000–3000 BC). A red-painted wooden bowl was found at a Neolithic site in Yuyao, Zhejiang. Other red-painted ceremonial objects have been found at other sites dating to the Spring and Autumn period (770–221 BC).\n\nDuring the Han dynasty (200 BC–200 AD) Chinese craftsmen made a red pigment, lead tetroxide, which they called \"ch-ien tan\", by heating lead white pigment. Like the Egyptians, they made a red dye from the madder plant to color silk fabric for gowns and used pigments colored with madder to make red lacquerware.\n\nRed lead or Lead tetroxide pigment was widely used as the red in Persian and Indian miniature paintings as well as in European art, where it was called minium.\n\nIn India, the rubia plant has been used to make dye since ancient times. A piece of cotton dyed with rubia dated to the third millennium BC was found at an archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro. It has been used by Indian monks and hermits for centuries to dye their robes.\n\nThe early inhabitants of America had their own vivid crimson dye, made from the cochineal, an insect of the same family as the Kermes of Europe and the Middle East, which feeds on the Opuntia, or prickly pear cactus plant. Red-dyed textiles from the Paracas culture (800–100 BC) have been found in tombs in Peru.\n\nRed also featured in the burials of royalty in the Maya city-states. In the Tomb of the Red Queen inside Temple XIII in the ruined Maya city of Palenque (600–700 AD), the skeleton and ceremonial items of a noble woman were completely covered with bright red powder made from cinnabar.\n\nIn ancient Greece and the Minoan civilization of ancient Crete, red was widely used in murals and in the polychrome decoration of temples and palaces. The Greeks began using red lead as a pigment.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, Tyrian purple was the color of the Emperor, but red had an important religious symbolism. Romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays, and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl, called a \"flammeum\". Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators. Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, scarlet or purple. In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war, Mars. The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold. A Roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement.\n\nThe Romans liked bright colors, and many Roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion, and it came from the mineral cinnabar, a common ore of mercury. It was one of the finest reds of ancient times – the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near Almadén, southwest of Madrid, in Spain. Working in the mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, red was adopted as a color of majesty and authority by the Byzantine Empire, the princes of Europe, and the Roman Catholic Church. It also played an important part in the rituals of the Catholic Church – it symbolized the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs – and it associated the power of the kings with the sacred rituals of the Church.\n\nRed was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red colored habitus. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\n\nRed clothing was a sign of status and wealth. It was worn not only by cardinals and princes, but also by merchants, artisans and townspeople, particularly on holidays or special occasions. Red dye for the clothing of ordinary people was made from the roots of the rubia tinctorum, the madder plant. This color leaned toward brick-red, and faded easily in the sun or during washing. The wealthy and aristocrats wore scarlet clothing dyed with kermes, or carmine, made from the carminic acid in tiny female scale insects, which lived on the leaves of oak trees in Eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. The insects were gathered, dried, crushed, and boiled with different ingredients in a long and complicated process, which produced a brilliant scarlet.\n\nBrazilin was another popular red dye in the Middle Ages. It came from the sapanwood tree, which grew in India, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. A similar tree, brazilwood, grew on the coast of South America. The red wood was ground into sawdust and mixed with an alkaline solution to make dye and pigment. It became one of the most profitable exports from the New World, and gave its name to the nation of Brazil.\n\nRed has been an important color in Chinese culture, religion, industry, fashion and court ritual since ancient times.\nSilk was woven and dyed as early as the Han Dynasty (25–220 BC). China had a monopoly on the manufacture of silk until the 6th century AD, when it was introduced into the Byzantine Empire. In the 12th century, it was introduced into Europe.\n\nAt the time of the Han Dynasty, Chinese red was a light red, but during the Tang dynasty new dyes and pigments were discovered. The Chinese used several different plants to make red dyes, including the flowers of the safflour (\"Carthamus tinctorius\"), the thorns and stems of a variety of sorghum plant called Kao-liang, and the wood of the sappanwood tree. For pigments, they used cinnabar, which produced the famous vermillion or \"Chinese red\" of Chinese lacquerware.\n\nRed played an important role in Chinese philosophy. It was believed that the world was composed of five elements: metal, wood, water, fire and earth, and that each had a color. Red was associated with fire. Each Emperor chose the color that his fortune-tellers believed would bring the most prosperity and good fortune to his reign. During the Zhou, Han, Jin, Song and Ming Dynasties, red was considered a noble color, and it was featured in all court ceremonies, from coronations to sacrificial offerings, and weddings.\n\nRed was also a badge of rank. During the Song dynasty (906–1279), officials of the top three ranks wore purple clothes; those of the fourth and fifth wore bright red; those of the sixth and seventh wore green; and the eighth and ninth wore blue. Red was the color worn by the royal guards of honor, and the color of the carriages of the imperial family. When the imperial family traveled, their servants and accompanying officials carried red and purple umbrellas. Of an official who had talent and ambition, it was said \"he is so red he becomes purple.\"\n\nRed was also featured in Chinese Imperial architecture. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, gates of palaces were usually painted red, and nobles often painted their entire mansion red. One of the most famous works of Chinese literature, \"A Dream of Red Mansions\" by Cao Xueqin (1715–63), was about the lives of noble women who passed their lives out of public sight within the walls of such mansions. In later dynasties red was reserved for the walls of temples and imperial residences. When the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty conquered the Ming and took over the Forbidden City and Imperial Palace in Beijing, all the walls, gates, beams and pillars were painted in red and gold.\n\nRed is not often used in traditional Chinese paintings, which are usually black ink on white paper with a little green sometimes added for trees or plants; but the round or square seals which contain the name of the artist are traditionally red.\n\nIn Renaissance painting, red was used to draw the attention of the viewer; it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or another central figure. In Venice, Titian was the master of fine reds, particularly vermilion; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more luminous color.\n\nDuring the Renaissance trade routes were opened to the New World, to Asia and the Middle East, and new varieties of red pigment and dye were imported into Europe, usually through Venice, Genoa or Seville, and Marseille. Venice was the major depot importing and manufacturing pigments for artists and dyers from the end of the 15th century; the catalog of a Venetian \"Vendecolori\", or pigment seller, from 1534 included vermilion and kermes. \n\nThere were guilds of dyers who specialized in red in Venice and other large Europeans cities. The Rubia plant was used to make the most common dye; it produced an orange-red or brick red color used to dye the clothes of merchants and artisans. For the wealthy, the dye used was kermes, made from a tiny scale insect which fed on the branches and leaves of the oak tree. For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as \"Kermes vermilio\" or \"Blood of Saint John\", which was made from a related insect, the \"Margodes polonicus\". It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \"Kermes\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian \"kirmiz\"), made by collecting and crushing \"Porphyophora hamelii\", an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe. Its secret ingredient was arsenic, which brightened the color.\n\nBut early in the 16th century, a brilliant new red appeared in Europe. When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and his soldiers conquered the Aztec Empire in 1519–21, they discovered slowly that the Aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold; they had the tiny cochineal, a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants, which, when dried and crushed, made a magnificent red. The cochineal in Mexico was closely related to the Kermes varieties of Europe, but unlike European Kermes, it could be harvested several times a year, and it was ten times stronger than the Kermes of Poland. It worked particularly well on silk, satin and other luxury textiles. In 1523 Cortes sent the first shipment to Spain. Soon cochineal began to arrive in European ports aboard convoys of Spanish galleons.\n\nAt first the guilds of dyers in Venice and other cities banned cochineal to protect their local products, but the superior quality of cochineal dye made it impossible to resist. By the beginning of the 17th century it was the preferred luxury red for the clothing of cardinals, bankers, courtesans and aristocrats.\n\nThe painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto. Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the Jacobins and other more radical parties adopted the red flag; it was taken from red flags hoisted by the French government to declare a state of siege or emergency. Many of them wore a red Phrygian cap, or liberty cap, modeled after the caps worn by freed slaves in Ancient Rome. During the height of the Reign of Terror, Women wearing red caps gathered around the guillotine to celebrate each execution. They were called the \"Furies of the guillotine\". The guillotines used during the Reign of Terror in 1792 and 1793 were painted red, or made of red wood. During the Reign of Terror a statue of a woman titled liberty, painted red, was placed in the square in front of the guillotine. After the end of the Reign of Terror, France went back to the blue, white and red tricolor, whose red was taken from the red and blue colors of the city of Paris, and was the traditional color of Saint Denis, the Christian martyr and patron saint of Paris.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, red became the color of a new political and social movement, socialism. It became the most common banner of the worker's movement, of the French Revolution of 1848, of the Paris Commune in 1870, and of socialist parties across Europe. (see red flags and revolution section below).\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution spread across Europe, chemists and manufacturers sought new red dyes that could be used for large-scale manufacture of textiles. One popular color imported into Europe from Turkey and India in the 18th and early 19th century was Turkey red, known in France as \"rouge d'Adrinople\". Beginning in the 1740s, this bright red color was used to dye or print cotton textiles in England, the Netherlands and France. Turkey red used madder as the colorant, but the process was longer and more complicated, involving multiple soaking of the fabrics in lye, olive oil, sheep's dung, and other ingredients. The fabric was more expensive but resulted in a fine bright and lasting red, similar to carmine, perfectly suited to cotton. The fabric was widely exported from Europe to Africa, the Middle East and America. In 19th-century America, it was widely used in making the traditional patchwork quilt.\n\nIn 1826, the French chemist Pierre-Jean Robiquet discovered the organic compound alizarin, the powerful coloring ingredient of the madder root, the most popular red dye of the time. In 1868, German chemists Carl Graebe and Liebermann were able to synthesize alizarin, and to produce it from coal tar. The synthetic red was cheaper and more lasting than the natural dye, and the plantation of madder in Europe and import of cochineal from Latin America soon almost completely ceased.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the use of red in art to create specific emotions, not just to imitate nature. It saw the systematic study of color theory, and particularly the study of how complementary colors such as red and green reinforced each other when they were placed next to each other. These studies were avidly followed by artists such as Vincent van Gogh. Describing his painting, The \"Night Cafe\", to his brother Theo in 1888, Van Gogh wrote: \"I sought to express with red and green the terrible human passions. The hall is blood red and pale yellow, with a green billiard table in the center, and four lamps of lemon yellow, with rays of orange and green. Everywhere it is a battle and antithesis of the most different reds and greens.\"\n\nIn the 20th century, red was the color of Revolution; it was the color of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and of the Chinese Revolution of 1949, and later of the Cultural Revolution. Red was the color of Communist Parties from Eastern Europe to Cuba to Vietnam.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the German chemical industry invented two new synthetic red pigments: cadmium red, which was the color of natural vermilion, and mars red, which was a synthetic red ochre, the color of the very first natural red pigment.\n\nThe French painter Henri Matisse (1869–1954) was one of the first prominent painters to use the new cadmium red. He even tried, without success, to persuade the older and more traditional Renoir, his neighbor in the south of France, to switch from vermilion to cadmium red.\n\nMatisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting, chosen to evoke emotions. \"A certain blue penetrates your soul\", he wrote. \"A certain red affects your blood pressure.\" He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors, such as red and green, strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other. He wrote, \"My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory; it is based on observation, upon feelings, upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings.\"\n\nLater in the century, the American artist Mark Rothko (1903–70) also used red, in even simpler form, in blocks of dark, somber color on large canvases, to inspire deep emotions. Rothko observed that color was \"only an instrument;\" his interest was \"in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.\"\n\nRothko also began using the new synthetic pigments, but not always with happy results. In 1962 he donated to Harvard University a series of large murals of the Passion of Christ whose predominant colors were dark pink and deep crimson. He mixed mostly traditional colors to make the pink and crimson; synthetic ultramarine, cerulean blue, and titanium white, but he also used two new organic reds, Naphtol and Lithol. The Naphtol did well, but the Lithol slowly changed color when exposed to light. Within five years the deep pinks and reds had begun to turn light blue, and by 1979 the paintings were ruined and had to be taken down.\n\nSurveys show that red is the color most associated with courage. In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George's Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George's Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.\n\nIn 1587, Mary, Queen of Scots, accused of treason against Queen Elizabeth I, wore a red shirt at her execution, to proclaim that she was an innocent martyr.\n\nThe Thin Red Line was a famous incident in the Battle of Balaclava (1854) during the Crimean War, when a thin line of Scottish Highlander infantry, assisted by Royal Marines and Turkish infantrymen, repulsed a Russian cavalry charge. It was widely reported in the British press as an example of courage in the face of overwhelming odds and became a British military legend.\n\nIn the 19th-century novel \"The Red Badge of Courage\" by Stephen Crane, a story about the American Civil War, the red badge was the blood from a wound, by which a soldier could prove his courage.\n\nRed is the color most commonly associated with love, followed at a great distance by pink. It the symbolic color of the heart and the red rose, is closely associated with romantic love or courtly love and Saint Valentine's Day.\nBoth the Greeks and the Hebrews considered red a symbol of love as well as sacrifice.\n\nThe Roman de la Rose, the Romance of the Rose, a thirteenth-century French poem, was one of the most popular works of literature of the Middle Ages. It was the allegorical search by the author for a red rose in an enclosed garden, symbolizing the woman he loved, and was a description of love in all of its aspects. Later, in the 19th century, British and French authors described a specific language of flowers – giving a single red rose meant 'I love you'.\n\nSaint Valentine, a Roman Catholic Bishop or priest who was martyred in about 296 AD, seems to have had no known connection with romantic love, but the day of his martyrdom on the Roman Catholic calendar, Saint Valentine's Day (February 14), became, in the 14th century, an occasion for lovers to send messages to each other. In recent years the celebration of Saint Valentine' s day has spread beyond Christian countries to Japan and China and other parts of the world. The celebration of Saint Valentine's Day is forbidden or strongly condemned in many Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Iran. In Saudi Arabia, in 2002 and 2011, religious police banned the sale of all Valentine's Day items, telling shop workers to remove any red items, as the day is considered a Christian holiday.\nRed is the color most commonly associated with joy and well being. It is the color of celebration and ceremony. A red carpet is often used to welcome distinguished guests. Red is also the traditional color of seats in opera houses and theaters. Scarlet academic gowns are worn by new Doctors of Philosophy at degree ceremonies at Oxford University and other schools. In China, it is considered the color of good fortune and prosperity, and it is the color traditionally worn by brides.\nIn Christian countries, it is the color traditionally worn at Christmas by Santa Claus, because in the 4th century the historic Saint Nicholas was the Greek Christian Bishop of Myra, in modern-day Turkey, and bishops then dressed in red.\n\nWhile red is the color most associated with love, it also the color most frequently associated with hatred, anger, aggression and war. People who are angry are said to \".\" Red is the color most commonly associated with passion and heat. In ancient Rome, red was the color of Mars, the god of war—the planet Mars was named for him because of its red color.\n\nRed is the traditional color of warning and danger. In the Middle Ages, a red flag announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it, and a red flag hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy. In Britain, in the early days of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 abolished this law. In automobile races, the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers. In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game.\n\nSeveral studies have indicated that red carries the strongest reaction of all the colors, with the level of reaction decreasing gradually with the colors orange, yellow, and white, respectively. For this reason, red is generally used as the highest level of warning, such as threat level of terrorist attack in the United States. In fact, teachers at a primary school in the UK have been told not to mark children's work in red ink because it encourages a \"negative approach\".\n\nRed is the international color of stop signs and stop lights on highways and intersections. It was standardized as the international color at the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968. It was chosen partly because red is the brightest color in daytime (next to orange), though it is less visible at twilight, when green is the most visible color. Red also stands out more clearly against a cool natural backdrop of blue sky, green trees or gray buildings. But it was mostly chosen as the color for stoplights and stop signs because of its universal association with danger and warning.\n\nRed is the color that most attracts attention. Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility, proximity, and extroverts. It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity.\n\nRed is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention. People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors, even if they are actually the same distance away. Monarchs, wives of presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd. It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found.\n\nBecause red attracts attention, it is frequently used in advertising, though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising, and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text.\n\nRed by a large margin is the color most commonly associated with seduction, sexuality, eroticism and immorality, possibly because of its close connection with passion and with danger.\n\nRed was long seen as having a dark side, particularly in Christian theology. It was associated with sexual passion, anger, sin, and the devil. In the Old Testament of the Bible, the Book of Isaiah said: \"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.\" In the New Testament, in the Book of Revelation, the Antichrist appears as a red monster, ridden by a woman dressed in scarlet, known as the Whore of Babylon:\n\n\"So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.\n\"And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:\n\"And upon her forehead was a name written a mystery: \"Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and of all the abominations of the earth\":\nAnd I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus\".\"\n\nSatan is often depicted as colored red and/or wearing a red costume in both iconography and popular culture. By the 20th century, the devil in red had become a folk character in legends and stories. In 1915, Irving Berlin wrote a song, \"At the Devil's Ball\", and the devil in red appeared more often in cartoons and movies than in religious art.\n\nIn 17th-century New England, red was associated with adultery. In the 1850 novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter, set in a Puritan New England community, a woman is punished for adultery with ostracism, her sin represented by a red letter 'A' sewn onto her clothes.\n\nRed is still commonly associated with prostitution. Prostitutes in many cities were required to wear red to announce their profession, and houses of prostitution displayed a red light. Beginning in the early 20th century, houses of prostitution were allowed only in certain specified neighborhoods, which became known as red-light districts. Large red-light districts are found today in Bangkok and Amsterdam.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, red represents wrath, one of the seven deadly sins.\n\nIn both Christian and Hebrew tradition, red is also sometimes associated with murder or guilt, with \"having blood on one's hands\", or \"being caught red-handed. \n\nIn China, red () is the symbol of fire and the south (both south in general and Southern China specifically). It carries a largely positive connotation, being associated with courage, loyalty, honor, success, fortune, fertility, happiness, passion, and summer. In Chinese cultural traditions, red is associated with weddings (where brides traditionally wear red dresses) and red paper is frequently used to wrap gifts of money or other objects. Special red packets ( in Mandarin or \"lai see\" in Cantonese) are specifically used during Chinese New Year celebrations for giving monetary gifts. On the more negative side, obituaries are traditionally written in red ink, and to write someone's name in red signals either cutting them out of one's life, or that they have died. Red is also associated with either the feminine or the masculine (yin and yang respectively), depending on the source. The \"Little Red Book\", a collection of quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, founding father of the People's Republic of China (PRC), was published in 1966 and widely distributed thereafter.\n\nIn Japan, red is a traditional color for a heroic figure. In the Indian subcontinent, red is the traditional color of bridal dresses, and is frequently represented in the media as a symbolic color for married women. The color is associated with purity, as well as with sexuality in marital relationships through its connection to heat and fertility. It is also the color of wealth, beauty, and the goddess Lakshmi.\n\nIn Central Africa, Ndembu warriors rub themselves with red paint during celebrations. Since their culture sees the color as a symbol of life and health, sick people are also painted with it. Like most Central African cultures, the Ndembu see red as ambivalent, better than black but not as good as white. In other parts of Africa, however, red is a color of mourning, representing death. Because red bears are associated with death in many parts of Africa, the Red Cross has changed its colors to green and white in parts of the continent.\n\nThe early Ottoman Turks led by the first Ottoman Sultan, Osman I, carried red banners symbolizing sovereignty, Ghazis and Sufism, until, according to legend, he saw a new red flag in his dream inlaid with a crescent.\n\nIn many Asian countries, red is the traditional color for a wedding dress today, symbolizing joy and good fortune.\n\nNATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems uses red to denote hostile forces, hence the terms \"red team\" and \"Red Cell\" to denote challengers during exercises.\n\nThe red military uniform was adopted by the English Parliament's New Model Army in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform by the British Army until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. Ordinary soldiers wore red coats dyed with madder, while officers wore scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive cochineal. This led to British soldiers being known as red coats.\n\nIn the modern British army, scarlet is still worn by the Foot Guards, the Life Guards, and by some regimental bands or drummers for ceremonial purposes. Officers and NCOs of those regiments which previously wore red retain scarlet as the color of their \"mess\" or formal evening jackets. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment has a scarlet tunic in its winter dress.\n\nScarlet is worn for some full dress, military band or mess uniforms in the modern armies of a number of the countries that made up the former British Empire. These include the Australian, Jamaican, New Zealand, Fijian, Canadian, Kenyan, Ghanaian, Indian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan and Pakistani armies.\n\nThe musicians of the United States Marine Corps Band wear red, following an 18th-century military tradition that the uniforms of band members are the reverse of the uniforms of the other soldiers in their unit. Since the US Marine uniform is blue with red facings, the band wears the reverse.\n\nRed Serge is the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, created in 1873 as the North-West Mounted Police, and given its present name in 1920. The uniform was adapted from the tunic of the British Army. Cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada also wear red dress uniforms.\n\nThe Brazilian Marine Corps wears a red dress uniform.\nThe first known team sport to feature red uniforms was chariot racing during the late Roman Empire. The earliest races were between two chariots, one driver wearing red, the other white. Later, the number of teams was increased to four, including drivers in light green and sky blue. Twenty-five races were run in a day, with a total of one hundred chariots participating.\n\nToday many sports teams throughout the world feature red on their uniforms. Along with blue, red is the most commonly used non-white color in sports. Numerous national sports teams wear red, often through association with their national flags. A few of these teams feature the color as part of their nickname such as Spain (with their association football (soccer) national team nicknamed \"La Furia Roja\" or \"The Red Fury\") and Belgium (whose football team bears the nickname \"Rode Duivels\" or \"Red Devils\").\n\nIn club association football (soccer), red is a commonly used color throughout the world. A number of teams' nicknames feature the color. A red penalty card is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction: the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one less player for the game's duration.\n\nIn rugby union, Ireland's Munster rugby, New Zealand's Canterbury provincial team and the Crusaders Super 14 rugby side wear red as a major color in their playing strips.\n\nRosso Corsa is the red international motor racing color of cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia, and later Ferrari and Abarth have been painted with a color known as \"rosso corsa\" (\"racing red\"). National colors were mostly replaced in Formula One by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the shade of the color varies.\n\nThe color is commonly used for professional sports teams in Canada and the United States with eleven Major League Baseball teams, eleven National Hockey League teams, seven National Football League teams and eleven National Basketball Association teams prominently featuring some shade of the color. The color is also featured in the league logos of Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. In the National Football League, a red flag is thrown by the head coach to challenge a referee's decision during the game. During the 1950s when red was strongly associated with communism in the United States, the modern Cincinnati Reds team was known as the \"Redlegs\" and the term was used on baseball cards. After the red scare faded, the team was known as the \"Reds\" again.\n\nIn boxing, red is often the color used on a fighter's gloves. George Foreman wore the same red trunks he used during his loss to Muhammad Ali when he defeated Michael Moorer 20 years later to regain the title he lost. Boxers named or nicknamed \"red\" include Red Burman, Ernie \"Red\" Lopez, and his brother Danny \"Little Red\" Lopez.\n\nRed is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow. Red is prominently featured in the flag of the United States Marine Corps.\n\nThe red on the flag of Nepal represents the floral emblem of the country, the rhododendron.\n\nRed, blue, and white are also the Pan-Slavic colors adopted by the Slavic solidarity movement of the late nineteenth century. Initially these were the colors of the Russian flag; as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples including Slovaks, Slovenes, and Serbs. The flags of the Czech Republic and Poland use red for historic heraldic reasons (see Coat of arms of Poland and Coat of arms of the Czech Republic) & not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004 Georgia adopted a new white flag, which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.\n\nRed, white, and black were the colors of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s they were adopted as the colors of the Nazi flag. In \"Mein Kampf\", Hitler explained that they were \"revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past.\" The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention – Hitler wrote: \"the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster\" because \"in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.\" The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis, aimed at German workers. Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design.\n\nRed, white, green and black are the colors of Pan-Arabism and are used by many Arab countries.\n\nRed, gold, green, and black are the colors of Pan-Africanism. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the flag of Ethiopia, one of the oldest independent African countries. Rwanda, notably, removed red from its flag after the Rwandan Genocide because of red's association with blood.\n\nThe flags of Japan and Bangladesh both have a red circle in the middle of different colored backgrounds. The flag of the Philippines has a red trapezoid on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red trapezoid is on top and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of Singapore has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the flag of Portugal is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor Republic of Turkey continuing the 1844 Ottoman Flag.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, ships in combat hoisted a long red streamer, called the Baucans, to signify a fight to the death. In the 17th century, a red flag signalled defiance. A besieged castle or city would raise a red flag to tell the attackers that they would not surrender.\n\nThe red flag appeared as a political symbol during the French Revolution, after the fall of Bastille. A law adopted by the new government on October 20, 1789 authorized the Garde Nationale to raise the red flag in the event of a riot, to signal that the Garde would imminently intervene. During a demonstration on the Champs de Mars on July 17, 1791, the Garde Nationale fired on the crowd, killed up to fifty people. The government was denounced by the more radical revolutionaries. In the words of his famous hymn, the Marseillaise, Rouget de Lisle wrote: \"Against us they have raised the bloody flag of tyranny!\" (\"Contre nous de la tyrannie, l'entendard sanglant est leve\"). Beginning in 1790, the most radical revolutionaries adopted the red flag themselves, to symbolize the blood of those killed in the demonstrations, and to call for the repression of those they considered counter-revolutionary.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, many in the Paris crowds also wore a red phrygian cap, a symbol of liberty, modeled after the caps worn in ancient Rome by freed slaves; but the colors of the Revolution finally became blue, white and red. The red in the French flag was taken from the emblem of the city of Paris, where it represented the city's patron saint, Saint Denis.\n\nKarl Marx published the Communist Manifesto in February 1848, with little attention. However, a few days later the French Revolution of 1848 broke out, which replaced the monarchy of Louis Philippe with the Second French Republic. In June 1848, Paris workers, disenchanted with the new government, built barricades and raised red flags. The new government called in the French Army to put down the uprising, the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker's movements in Europe.\n\nRed was also the color of the movement to unify Italy, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. His followers were known as the \"camicie rosse\", or (redshirts) during the fight for Italian Risorgimento in 1860.\n\nIn 1870, following the stunning defeat of the French Army by the Germans in the Franco-Prussian War, French workers and socialist revolutionaries seized Paris and created the Paris Commune. The Commune lasted for two months before it was crushed by the French Army, with much bloodshed. The original red banners of the Commune became icons of the socialist revolution; in 1921 members of the French Communist Party came to Moscow and presented the new Soviet government with one of the original Commune banners; it was placed (and is still in place) in the tomb of Vladimir Lenin, next to his open coffin.\n\nWith the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the red flag, with a hammer to symbolize the workers and sickle to symbolize peasants, became the official flag of Russia, and, in 1923, of the Soviet Union. It remained so until the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nAfter the Communist Party of China took power in 1949, the flag of China became a red flag with a large star symbolizing the Communist Party, and smaller stars symbolizing workers, peasants, the urban middle class and rural middle class. The flag of the Communist Party of China became a red banner with a hammer and sickle, similar to that on the Soviet flag. In the 1950s and 1960s, other Communist regimes such as Vietnam and Laos also adopted red flags. Some Communist countries, such as Cuba, chose to keep their old flags; and other countries used red flags which had nothing to do with Communism or socialism; the red flag of Nepal, for instance, represents the national flower.\n\nIn 18th-century Europe, red was usually associated with the monarchy and with those in power. The Pope wore red, as did the Swiss Guards of the Kings of France, the soldiers of the British Army and the Danish Army.\n\nThe French Revolution saw red used by the Jacobins as a symbol of the martyrs of the Revolution. In the nineteenth century, with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of worker's movements, it became the color of socialism (especially the Marxist variant), and, with the Paris Commune of 1870, of revolution.\n\nIn the 20th century, red was the color first of the Russian Bolsheviks and then, after the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917, of Communist Parties around the world.\n\nRed also became the color of many social democratic parties in Europe, including the Labour Party in Britain (founded 1900); the Social Democratic Party of Germany (whose roots went back to 1863) and the French Socialist Party, which dated back under different names, to 1879. The Socialist Party of America (1901–72) and the Communist Party USA (1919) both also chose red as their color.\n\nMembers of the Christian-Social People's Party in Liechtenstein (founded 1918) advocated an expansion of democracy and progressive social policies, and were often referred to disparagingly as \"Reds\" for their social liberal leanings and party colors.\n\nThe Communist Party of China, founded in 1920, adopted the red flag and hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union, which became the national symbols when the Party took power in China in 1949. Under Party leader Mao Zedong, the Party anthem became \"The East Is Red\", and Mao Zedong himself was sometimes referred to as a \"red sun\". During the Cultural Revolution in China, Party ideology was enforced by the Red Guards, and the sayings of Mao Zedong were published as a small red book in hundreds of millions of copies. Today the Communist Party of China claims to be the largest political party in the world, with eighty million members.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, paramilitary extremist groups such as the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Japanese Red Army and the Shining Path Maoist movement in Peru used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.\n\nRed is used around the world by political parties of the left or center-left. In the United States, it is the color of the Communist Party USA, of the Social Democrats, USA, and in Puerto Rico, of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the United States, political commentators often refer to the \"red states\", which traditionally vote for Republican candidates in presidential elections, and \"blue states\", which vote for the Democratic candidate. This convention is relatively recent: before the 2000 presidential election, media outlets assigned red and blue to both parties, sometimes alternating the allocation for each election. Fixed usage was established during the 39-day recount following the 2000 election, when the media began to discuss the contest in terms of \"red states\" versus \"blue states\".\n\nSuch names as Red Club (a bar), Red Carpet (a discothèque) or Red Cottbus and Club Red (event locations) suggest liveliness and excitement. The Red Hat Society is a social group founded in 1998 for women 50 and over. Use of the color red to call attention to an emergency situation is evident in the names of such organizations as the Red Cross (humanitarian aid), Red Hot Organization (AIDS support), and the Red List of Threatened Species (of IUCN). In reference to humans, term \"red\" is often used in the West to describe the indigenous peoples of the Americas.\n\nMany idiomatic expressions exploit the various connotations of red:\n\n\n\nMany film titles have included the color's name, such as:\n\n\n\n"}

The Red Wing Collectors Society is a special interest collecting organization in the United States with a membership of about 5000.\n\nThe Red Wing Collectors Society (RWCS) was founded in 1977 in conjunction with the Red Wing Collectors Society Newsletter, published by Dave Newkirk. The popularity of the RWCS Newsletter subscription and the publication of \"The Clay Giants\" by Rev. Lyndon Veil laid the cornerstone for a meeting of like-minded collectors to gather in Red Wing, MN in July 1977. It was at that one-day event held at the Goodhue County Historical Society in July 1977 that the RWCS officially became an organization. Those who attended the event and joined the RWCS that day are considered charter members of the organization. Of the 300-500 people that attended the event, just over 200 people became members and over 75 of those members are still active as of October 2008.\n\nFrom its start the RWCS has been dedicated to keeping what its members refer to as the \"Red Wing legacy\" alive. Its members focus on continually learning about the pottery products made in Red Wing, Minnesota and on making that information available to others.\n\nThe RWCS maintains a board of directors that is responsible for many of the decisions of the Society. Positions on the board include President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Historian, Auction Manager, Education Manager, Commemorative Manager, and two Representatives-at-large. The Society's Executive Director is a non-voting member of the board. Board meeting times and locations are published in the bimonthly newsletter and are open for any member to attend.\n\nDuring the annual Convention, held the second weekend in July, there is a general business meeting in which all members of the Society present may vote on issues, bylaw changes, and elect new officers to the board during election years.\n\nMembership is available to any individual who pays the annual membership dues. There are two levels of membership, Primary and Associate. A Primary member receives all benefits of membership, which include a bimonthly newsletter, the right to vote at the annual meeting, the ability to attend all portions of Society functions, the right to purchase a commemorative, and access to the Society's lending library of video materials. The cost of Primary membership dues is $35 annually as of August, 2013. An Associate membership is available to any member of a household in which there is already a Primary member (i.e. a spouse or child of a Primary member). Associate membership is $15 annually and includes all the benefits of membership with the exclusion of receipt of a newsletter.\n\nThere are multiple local chapters of the Society. Each chapter is chartered by the RWCS and holds its own meetings and functions throughout the year. Many of them also hold smaller functions in conjunction with the two RWCS sponsored events, the July Convention and the MidWinter GetTogether, held in February. Membership in the RWCS is a requirement for membership in one of its chapters. Chapters often operate much like the Society but on a smaller scale, including the production of chapter commemoratives as a fundraising activity. As of 2008 there were sixteen chapters in the United States.\nGolden State Red Wing Chapter founded In 1987 in California.\n\nThe RWCS holds two official events every year, the Convention and MidWinter GetTogether.\n\nThe July Convention is held every year and is the original event of the society. The first convention was held in July 1977 in Red Wing, Minnesota. Since then there has been an annual convention and business meeting of the society in July in Red Wing. The most recent venue has been the Red Wing High School. Educational seminars, an auction, a show and sale, displays of pottery, and children's events are held.\n\nThe MidWinter GetTogether is held in February. Meant to be an event that may relocate to new locations if possible, it has been held in Des Moines, Iowa since at least 2003. It was held in Wisconsin in 2015 and 2016 and will return to Des Moines in 2017. This is a smaller event than the Convention and is attended by fewer members. Educational seminars, a show and sale, social events, and children's events are held.\n\nChapters of the RWCS hold meetings throughout the year. Depending on the chapter these meetings may be held anywhere from monthly to four times annually. Some chapters hold annual special events in addition to their regular business meetings.\n\n"}

This type of group portrait was popular in Dutch Golden Age painting during the 17th century, and in the 18th century. They were intended to be hung in the \"regentenkamer\", the regents' meeting room, or another prominent location in the institution.\n\nThe regents of a charitable organization (such as an orphanage, poorhouse, hospital or \"hofje\") or guild were drawn from the \"regenten\", the upper class of Dutch society. It was a prestigious honorary office, so the regents were keen to have themselves depicted in this role. The leading portraitists of the day were commissioned to make \"regentenstukken\", including Rembrandt (whose \"Syndics of the Drapers' Guild\" is a subtle treatment of a group round a table), Frans Hals, Ferdinand Bol, and Bartholomeus van der Helst. The commissions proved lucrative, particularly since the regents only served for a few years, to be replaced with a new set of regents that were equally eager to be painted.\nIn some institutions the regentesses were all female, and so the portraits were of all-female groups, or there were mixed-gender regents who were painted separately, as in Hals' two portraits of the \"Regents\" and \"Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse\". Occasionally the painting depicted not just the regents but also others, such as the \"binnenvader\" or \"binnenmoeder\", who was in charge of the day-to-day operations. For instance, Abraham de Vries in 1633 painted a \"regentenstuk\" for the \"Burgerweeshuis\" orphanage in Amsterdam showing not only the regents but also the \"binnenvader\" leading in a young orphan girl.\n\nGroup portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the militia group portrait or \"schuttersstuk\" showing officers of a city's \"schutterij\" or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the 17th century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Boards of trustees preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces. Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. \n\nThe cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. \n\nIn Amsterdam most of these paintings ultimately ended up in possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the Amsterdam Museum.\n\n"}
{"id": "2303936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2303936", "title": "Rutland House", "text": "Rutland House\n\nRutland House was the name of at least two London houses occupied by the Earls and Dukes of Rutland.\nRutland House on Aldersgate Street was leased by playwright Sir William Davenant, who converted a room of it into a private theatre in the 1650s. Rutland House in Knightsbridge was a six-acre site until its demolition in the 1830s.\n\nRutland House on Aldersgate Street, near Charterhouse Square in the City of London, close to Smithfield Market, was leased by the playwright and impresario Sir William Davenant (1606–1668).\n\nIn 1656, freshly released from imprisonment, Davenant turned a room of the house into what was, at first, a private theatre performing his own plays. Soon the performances were advertised and semi-open to the public at a cost of 5 shillings a head, a figure that ensured that only persons of quality would be able to attend. The reason for Rutland House being used rather than a conventional theatre was to overcome the laws of censorship which operated in all public places following the closures of all public theatres by the Puritan government of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nThe house seems to have been not totally suitable for theatrical use; however, a low narrow hall, or salon, at the rear of the house was adapted for the performances. Rather than sitting in comfort, the audience had to sit on improvised benches, and so confined was the space available that the benches had to be arranged at an angle to the small stage to accommodate the large audiences who came. The small stage, described by Davenant as a \"Cup-board stage\", was adorned with gold and purple curtains. Above the stage in what was contemporarily described as a \"louver hole\" was concealed a small orchestra.\n\nDavenant had seen Italian opera sung in Paris; this inspired him to conceive a cunning plan: as the Puritan government had no objection to music, only drama, he obtained permission to stage a performance of his opera \"The Siege of Rhodes\", to be sung in \"recitative music\". Thus, the first English opera was performed at Rutland House in May 1656 , simultaneously overcoming the prohibition of drama. The Rutland House production also included England's first professional actress, Mrs. Coleman and was later transferred to the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane.\n\nDavenant established at least two other \"private performance houses\" in Lincoln's Inn Fields and Drury Lane. After Davenant opened more conventional theatres, he continued to use Rutland House to preview new productions, to gauge audience reaction.\n\nAnother Rutland House occupied a six-acre site in Knightsbridge, then just outside London, from the mid 18th century until it was demolished in 1836. Rutland Gate, a street-cum-square of well-proportioned houses was erected on its site. It was built for John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland.\n\n"}

Written by frontman Ian Watkins, the song was released in 2001 as the first single from the band's debut studio album, \"The Fake Sound of Progress\". It was the only charting single on the \"Billboard\" charts from the album, and was still on the band's tour setlist when they broke up in 2013.\n\nThe band wrote the song in under an hour. According to frontman Ian Watkins, it is a song about nostalgia for when the band were growing up together in their home town of Pontypridd, South Wales, and was originally inspired by the Shinobi arcade game they used to play at the Park View Café in Pontypridd. The song's name is derived from the video games \"Shinobi\" and \"Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja\".\n\n\"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja\" was released in the summer of 2001 and became the most successful song from \"The Fake Sound of Progress\" on the American rock charts. It appeared on \"Billboard\" magazine's Modern Rock Tracks chart at 33. In the United Kingdom the album peaked at 41 on the UK Singles Chart in 2001 and stayed on the charts for two weeks. After the release of the follow-up single \"The Fake Sound of Progress\" in 2002 \"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja\" re-charted and peaked at 161. The song was featured on the soundtrack of ATV Offroad Fury 2.\n\nThe video for this single is one of few Lostprophets videos actually filmed in the UK. It features the band performing to a crowd of people on the roof of a disused multi-storey car park in Edmonton, North London. The video received significant airplay on MTV2. The music video was directed by Mike Piscitelli, who would direct the music video for \"The Fake Sound of Progress,\" the follow-up single to \"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja.\" The shooting for the music video started on 5 October on a Friday at an undisclosed location. Any fan that wanted to participate in the music video could simply email their name, age, gender and contact number to the band. Once the email was received, the band chose who they wanted to include in the music video. An alternate version of the music video exists in a completely different setting, showing the band performing live. This version was also shot in black and white.\n\n"}
{"id": "2126135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2126135", "title": "Signs (journal)", "text": "Signs (journal)\n\nSigns: Journal of Women in Culture and Society is a peer-reviewed feminist academic journal. It was established in 1975 by Catharine R. Stimpson, and is published quarterly by the University of Chicago Press. \"Signs\" publishes essays examining the lives of women, men, and non-binary people around the globe from both historical and contemporary perspectives, as well as theoretical and critical articles addressing processes of gendering, sexualization, and racialization.\n\nThe founding of \"Signs\" in 1975 was part of the early development of the field of women's studies, born of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. The journal had two founding purposes, as stated in the inaugural editorial: (1) \"to publish the new scholarship about women\" in the U.S. and around the globe, and (2) \"to be interdisciplinary.\" The goal was for readers of the journal to \"grasp a sense of the totality of women's lives and the realities of which they have been a part.\" The meaning behind the name \"Signs\" is that signs \"represent\" and \"point\": the original editors wanted the journal to \"represent the originality and rigor\" of women's studies and to \"point\" to new directions for feminist scholarship.\n\nFormer editor-in-chief Ruth-Ellen Boetcher Joeres said in an article in the Yale Journal of Criticism that \"Signs\", from its inception, was meant to be \"something different, even insurgent...an agent for change\", because it emerged from the \"grassroots\" feminist movement. Joeres explored the \"paradox\" of how a journal can be both an \"agent for change\" and regarded as \"respectable in the academy,\" and concluded with the hope that \"Signs\" could retain its activist roots and transform the academy.\n\nIn the effort to avoid the tendency of the academy to \"codify\" and limit scholarship, \"Signs\" rotates institutional homes roughly every 5 years. It is currently based at Northeastern University, with Suzanna Danuta Walters, Director of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and Professor of Sociology, serving as editor-in-chief. In her inaugural editorial, Walters laid out five \"core concerns\" for \"Signs\": (1) for the field of women's studies to \"substantively reckon\" with gender and sexuality studies and queer studies; (2) to focus on \"racial and ethnic difference\"; (3) to re-emphasize \"inter- or transdisciplinarity\"; (4) to not lose sight of \"the big questions about gender and sexuality\" by getting too narrow in scope; and (5) to expand the journal's \"digital presence.\"\n\nThe history of \"Signs\" is explored extensively in Kelly Coogan-Gehr's 2011 book \"The Geopolitics of the Cold War and Narratives of Inclusion: Excavating a Feminist Archive\". Coogan-Gehr uses \"Signs\" as a case study to complicate what she calls the \"stock narrative of feminist field formation.\" She argues that dominant histories of the development of academic feminism, in focusing solely on the women's movement and other radical movements of the 1960s, fail to take into account the role of \"changes the Cold War produced in higher education.\" In the book, she calls \"Signs\" a \"premier academic feminist journal.\"\n\nIn 2015, \"Signs\" launched the Feminist Public Intellectuals Project, which seeks to engage feminist theorizing with pressing political and social problems via three open-access, online-first initiatives: Short Takes: Provocations on Public Feminism, Currents: Feminist Key Concepts and Controversies, and Ask a Feminist. Given the fragmentation of feminist activism and the persistent negative freighting of the term “feminist,” the Feminist Public Intellectuals Project seeks to reimagine what role a journal can play in provoking activism.\n\n\"Short Takes\" features commentaries by feminist activists and public intellectuals on recent books that \"have shaped popular conversations about feminist issues,\" alongside a response by the author. Featured books include Roxane Gay's \"Bad Feminist\", Rebecca Traister's \"All the Single Ladies\", and Andi Zeisler's \"We Were Feminists Once.\"\n\n\"Currents\" publishes essays that put forth \"a nuanced and edgy take on a key issue circulating in the feminist definitional landscape.\" Issues addressed include \"identity politics,\" \"trigger warnings,\" \"celebrity feminism,\" and \"affirmative consent.\"\n\n\"Ask a Feminist\" is an interview series that seeks to create \"conversation between and among feminist scholars, media activists, and community leaders,\" to bridge the divide between scholarship and activism. Recent features include \"Angela P. Harris on Gender and Gun Violence\" and \"Cathy J. Cohen on Black Lives Matter, Feminism, and Contemporary Activism.\"\n\n\"Signs\" awards the Catharine R. Stimpson Prize for Outstanding Feminist Scholarship, named for the founding editor-in-chief of \"Signs,\" biennially to the best paper from an international competition of \"emerging\" feminist scholars (meaning \"fewer than seven years since receipt of the terminal degree\"). The submissions are judged by an international jury of prominent feminist academics. Winners receive a $1,000 honorarium and have their papers published in \"Signs.\"\n\nThe 2017 co-winners of the Stimpson Prize were Cameron Awkward-Rich, for his essay \"Trans, Feminism: \"Or\", Reading like a Depressed Transsexual,\" and Meghan Healy-Clancy, for her essay \"The Family Politics of the Federation of South African Women: A History of Public Motherhood in Women's Antiracist Activism.\"\n\n\n\nThe journal is abstracted and indexed in:\n\nAccording to the \"Journal Citation Reports\", the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 1.078, ranking it 16th out of 42 journals in the category \"Women's Studies\".\n\n\n"}

Even with the advent of desktop publishing, making it possible for anyone to prepare text that appears professionally typeset, many publishers still require authors to submit manuscripts within their respective guidelines. Although there is no single set of guidelines, the \"standard\" format describes formatting that is considered to be generally acceptable.\n\nAlthough publishers guidelines for formatting are the most critical resource for authors, style guides are also key references for authors preparing manuscripts since \"virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication.\"\n\nManuscript formatting depends greatly on the type of work that is being written, as well as the individual publisher, editor or producer. Writers who intend to submit a manuscript should determine what the relevant writing standards are, and follow them. Individual publishers' standards will take precedence over style guides.\n\nIn general, a document with standard manuscript format will have the following features:\nOn the first page of the document, the author's name and contact information appears in the top left corner. In the top right corner of the first page, the wordcount appears.\n\nSubsequent pages only have text in the top right corner. This text includes: the author's name, a slash, an abbreviated title, another slash, and the page number.\n\nWriters can add the word count of the manuscript, although this may also be noted on a query letter. Most publishers pay writers based on a hypothetical number of words in the manuscript. However, this is not the physical count of actual words; this is a rough count of the number of characters divided to better estimate the space that the final text will consume in the published version. Normally, this involves counting every character in the manuscript, including spaces, and dividing by 6. If the correct font size is used, and if the margins are set so that lines contain an average of 60 characters, the editor can easily assume that there are 10 words per line. Furthermore, if the top and bottom margins are set so that there are, for example, 20 lines on each page, the editor can easily count 250 words per page.\n\nThe final reason involves how editors, copy editors, and typesetters handle manuscripts. They might work on an entire manuscript at one time or the editor might hand groups of pages to the typesetter at a time. Unstapled pages facilitate this.\n\nPage numbers, author's name, and title on every page ensure that if an unstapled manuscript is shuffled on a table, shared among two or more people, or dropped, it can easily be reassembled, and if a stack of unstapled manuscripts is dropped, it can easily be sorted into the correct sets.\n\nThere are formatting conventions for different kinds of written works, including:\n\n\n"}

It documents the mid-1990s lysine price-fixing conspiracy case and the involvement of Archer Daniels Midland executive Mark Whitacre, inspiring a film adaptation starring Matt Damon as Whitacre.\n\nIn the early 1990s, at the agri-business conglomerate Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Mark Whitacre is a corporate vice president and head of the bio-products division. In November 1992, under pressure from his wife, Whitacre confesses to an FBI agent that he, along with other ADM executives, routinely met with competitors to fix the price of lysine, a food additive. Afterwards, Whitacre assists in gathering evidence against the other conspirators by secretly taping their activities during overseas business meetings. Over the course of three years, the FBI collects hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes documenting the largest case of price-fixing in history.\n\nWhitacre is revealed to have defrauded $9 million from ADM at the same time he was aiding the FBI. After federal agents stage raid on ADM, the company hits back with damning evidence against the government's star witness. Whitacre becomes delusional and engages in pathological lying to save himself, leading the FBI to learn that he suffers from bipolar disorder. Worst of all, he gives false stories to the media about being forced to destroy evidence by the FBI. Whitacre becomes extremely manic, stops sleeping, and exhibits bizarre behavior as his meltdown continues. He attempts suicide a few months later, but is saved by his groundskeeper.\n\nAfter seeing the movie \"The Firm\", Whitacre's delusional fantasy causes him to record and collect his conversations with FBI agents. Because he violated his immunity agreement with the government, Whitacre is charged with price-fixing along with the other ADM conspirators. Whitacre's attorney, James Epstein, successfully convinces the Justice Department officials that the government was culpable for Whitacre's behavior as he was emotionally unprepared for the case. Epstein manages to get a very light sentence for Whitacre. However, Whitacre, unwilling to serve any jail time, fires Epstein.\n\nAt his trial, Whitacre is convicted and receives a federal prison sentence three times longer than the other conspirators. Whitacre's FBI handlers, along with Attorney General John Ashcroft, attempt to obtain a presidential pardon for Whitacre. With remarkable support from the FBI and his wife, Whitacre recovers from his mental problems and, after leaving prison, is promoted to COO and president of a California biotechnology company. The guilty parties in the price-fixing conspiracy, including ADM, pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements and fines, while several ADM executives serve prison time.\n\nThe book was used as the basis for the movie \"The Informant!\", directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Matt Damon as Mark Whitacre.\n\n"}

The Cornaro family was said to be descended from the Cornelia gens of ancient Rome - the same cardinal signed himself \"Marcus Cardinalis Cornelius\" in a letter asking Francesco II Gonzaga for a work from Mantegna, who was the latter's court painter at the time.\n\nThe chosen subject was from the history of the Cornelii, specifically the arrival of Cybele's image in Rome during the Second Punic War, as told in Ovid, Appian and Livy. Publius Cornelius Scipio had consulted the Sibylline Books and ordered the image brought from Mount Ida. The Delphic Oracle requested that the most worthy Roman be sent to collect it and so the senate had chosen Africanus' cousin Scipio Nasica for the role. The ship carrying the image back got stuck in the shallows of the River Tiber, but the Vestal Virgin Claudia Quinta proved her virginity by helping to free it.\n\nMantegna showed a scene after the image had been brought ashore, just as it arrives at the temple built in Rome for it. He based it on ancient Roman sarcophagi, then starting to be rediscovered and entering collections such as the Gonzaga collection in Mantua. He painted the scene as if it was carved into a piece of marble with two differently mottled layers, one forming the scene and the other the background. Two pyramid tombs to the left bear the names of Nasica's father Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Africanus' father Publius Cornelius Scipio - Gnaeus and Publius were brothers. \n\nThe two bearers in front of the image are turbaned like Moors, and the bearded pair at the back wear tiara-like hats. One of the two rear bearers also holds a laurel branch, as used in a Roman triumph, as does a young slave crouching in front of the bust. The bust wears a corona turrita and stands on a sphere on a precious carpet, with the sphere representing universality. Behind it is a ritual torch, whilst Nasica is shown as a young man kneeling before the bust - his words welcoming it are shown on the lower border. Behind him is another senator, probably Africanus, who is speaking to another man, possibly his fellow-consul Publius Licinius Crassus Dives. The furthest right figure is a shepherd, wearing a Phrygian cap, playing a flute and drum and standing on the steps of the temple to which the image is being brought - a trumpet protrudes from the temple doors.\n\nGiovanni Bellini's \"Continence of Scipio\" (National Gallery of Art, Washington) was painted as a pendant for it, but two other intended paintings were never produced. Garavaglia cites a spoken assertion by Roberto Longhi that the painting could have been accompanied by the two smaller monochrome works \"Sofonisba\" and \"Tuccia\" – they are certainly the same height as \"The Introduction\", but they are on panel not canvas and no documents support the theory.\n\nPietro Bembo wrote a letter to Isabella Gonzaga in 1505, referring to arguments about payment between the commissioner and the painter, which meant it was still mentioned in the inventory of Mantegna's studio contents after his death in 1506, which refers to it as \"principiata\" (ie begun but incomplete). It was completed by Mantegna's son Francesco, by Bellini or another painter. Like other works in Mantegna's studio upon his death, it was acquired by cardinal Sigismondo Gonzaga, who in 1507 finally delivered it to Francesco Cornaro.\n"}
{"id": "1992662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1992662", "title": "The Life and Times of Juniper Lee", "text": "The Life and Times of Juniper Lee\n\nThe Life and Times of Juniper Lee is an American animated television series, created by former MTV reality star Judd Winick for Cartoon Network. The show was produced by Cartoon Network Studios. It premiered on Cartoon Network on May 30, 2005, and ended its run on April 9, 2007. The show currently reruns on Pogo in India, Boing in Nigeria, South Africa and France, Boomerang in Thailand and Tooncast in Latin America. On April 11, 2017, it was added to Boomerang's streaming app in the United States, making it one of the few shows that are on the app that did not air on the actual Boomerang channel in the US.\n\nThe show had been renewed for two additional seasons. However, the show was cancelled for unknown reasons, thus leaving it off on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe series centers on the life of a preteen girl named Juniper Lee, who lives in Orchid Bay City. Based on Winick's adopted hometown of San Francisco, California, the city is a hub for magical activity and is filled with various monsters and demons, both good and evil. The magic and human worlds have been separated by a magical barrier, known as \"The Veil,\" which prevents ordinary humans from seeing any magic-related events or the creatures related to them. Juniper has recently been made the new Te Xuan Ze, the protector and the keeper of the balance between the human and magic worlds. To accomplish her task, she has been magically enhanced, making her far stronger and faster than ordinary humans. She can also use various kinds of magic to assist her. Maintaining the balance often interferes with her personal life, including her schoolwork and her social life, but she always manages to keep everything flowing. The show has a fairly campy and lighthearted take on the genre, often makes fun of itself, and rarely seems to take itself seriously.\n\nWinick has stated that Juniper Lee was inspired by both \"The Simpsons\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". However, Juniper does follow in the footsteps of \"Buffy\", as stated in the quote below:\nInterviewer: We've touched on just about everything else, so hit us with the high concept. Sum up the show for us…\n\nJudd: I’m sounding like a broken record, but it's kind of like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" meets \"The Simpsons\". That's the simplest way to put it. At the end of the day, it's about a little girl who fights monsters. There's a rather massive backstory to the whole thing, which really provides a spine to build from. I've only tapped into it a little in the show, but for me, knowing it's there is important. The show needs a spine, and needs a place to work from...\n\nJuniper Lee (voiced by Lara Jill Miller) is the main character of the series. Juniper is an eleven-year-old short tempered girl who lives in Orchid Bay City, and is the current Te Xuan Ze. Juniper is relatively uneducated in the world of magic, mostly relying on brute force, a real talent for insults, and the advice of her grandmother, Ah-Mah, and her enchanted dog, Monroe, to defeat her foes. She has long black hair, and after she inherits the powers of the Te Xuan Ze, a lock of hair on the left side changes to pure white from root to end (Juniper's grandmother Jasmine, the former Te Xuan Ze, has the same stripe in her hair) and Juniper later dyes this reddish-pink. The juniper flower symbolizes protection, referring to Juniper's role as the Te Xuan Ze, protecting others. She wishes to go to astronaut camp, but cannot because she can't leave Orchid Bay City while she is the Te Xuan Ze until another member of her family is chosen. She's also hoping for a breathtaking romance with her close friend Marcus Conner.\n\nJasmine Lee, or \"Ah-Mah\" (, voiced by Amy Hill) as Juniper calls her, is Juniper's grandmother, and the previous Te Xuan Ze. Many in the magical world consider her to be the greatest Te Xuan Ze ever. Calm and deliberate in most respects but crude and tough when she needs to be, the 69-year-old gives June advice on dealing with the magical community and their expectations of her, and assists her when she is in serious trouble. As of the \"Monster Con\" episode, Ah-Mah was shown to still possess a significant amount of magically-enhanced speed and strength, though her stamina and durability are severely diminished (in comparison to her granddaughter who has superhuman strength) to the point of being unable to stand unassisted after two to three minutes of combat (this is because of her old age). This supports her assertion in the first episode - that it was no longer her place to act as Te Xuan Ze - and is pragmatic, in the sense that it prevents June from shirking her responsibilities. In \"Little Big Mah\", she claims that she knows about 26 different styles of hand-to-hand combat, and that she hasn't been to China for 40 years (as Roxanne: \"I haven't been to China in 40 years! Uh, I mean weeks. For weeks.\"). Younger Jasmine is depicted with a purple streak in her hair, instead of the usual magenta Te Xuan Ze streak.\n\nRay Ray Lee (voiced by Kath Soucie) is Juniper's hyperactive, dimwitted eight-year-old little brother. Like Juniper, Ray Ray can see through the magic barrier, though this is not a naturally occurring ability. In the episodes after \"Star Quality\", he is occasionally seen watching monster TV. When Juniper first gained her powers, a group of demons attempted to drain her powers. Ray Ray unwittingly intervened, causing some of her powers to transfer to him, as seen in \"Adventures in Babysitting\". Whether or not he'll gain other powers similar to hers remains to be seen, as Ah-Mah has implied that he may over time.\n\nHe is hyperactive and careless, has crazy hair, and often gets himself into trouble when dealing with the magic world. Ray Ray is often over-eager in regards to the magic world, finding every single event involving it, no matter how bad or ominous, to be \"cooool.\" A recurring joke about him is that asks if he has ever run out of energy, where someone would say, \"but there's always a first time.\" He also has a sibling rivalry relationship with Juniper, although it is often seen that he cares for her deeply. Since episode \"Feets too big\", he has a crush on Lila, the Sasquatch. In the episodes after \"O Brother, What Art Thou?\", Ray Ray is a homunculus, his mind having been transferred to an artificial body after accidentally mutating his original body into a massive dinosaur by ingesting the growth potion that was supposed to make a giant grow back to his proper size. In \"Meet the Parent\", Monroe states that Ray Ray has a bladder control problem, though this has never been confirmed, save in \"The World According to LARP\" when Juniper said that he wet his pants on the jungle gym once, and again in \"Dream Date\" where he has trouble making it to the bathroom after drinking punch. Since he is very young still, it is probable he will outgrow these tendencies. In \"Te Xuan Me\", where after Juniper was erased from knowledge he took up being the Te Xuan Ze, and being particularly skilled at his position, even earning Monroe's praise. However, after everything was set back to normal, Ray Ray started to study in magic spells as a way to help his sister in future battles.\n\nMonroe Connery Boyd Carlyle McGregor Scott V (Monroe for short, voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) is an enchanted pug of Scottish origin. He is quite educated in the world of magic, having been alive for several centuries and assisting each Te Xuan Ze for nearly that entire time. Despite his knowledge, Juniper Lee makes him his pet dog, due to his lack of grasping hands or opposable thumbs (according to Ray Ray, he uses this as an excuse for everything). Monroe has been magically enhanced, allowing him to be understood by those who can see through the magic barrier. Anyone else listening to him will only hear barking. He is also lactose intolerant.\n\nDennis Lee (voiced by Alexander Polinsky) is Juniper's grumpy, cynical older brother who does not take June or Ray Ray seriously and usually calls them names. He loves manga and video games and does not like anyone touching his stuff. In \"Not in my Backyard\", it is revealed that Dennis never gives June a turn in his video games (he says if monkeys fly out of his butt, she will have a turn, which will never happen). Also, when he saw that Ray-Ray got one of his comics books, he didn't like it at all. In \"The World According to L.A.R.P.\", he's been known to take stuff out of June's room, which annoys her. In \"Sealed With a Fist\", Dennis has grown to trust June after they work together with Boomfist and the heroic team of H.A.T.E. (Heroes Against Terrible Evildoers) to defeat the villainous team of L.O.V.E. (League of Villainous Evildoers).\n\nJody Irwin (voiced by Colleen Villard) is Juniper's best friend and usually the happiest of the group. She tries her best to cheer the group, even in the most ridiculous of ways. June tries her best not to disappoint Jody, but, being Te Xuan Ze, she ends up doing so but Jody forgives her.\n\nOphelia Ramírez (voiced by Candi Milo) is one of Juniper's friends. She is a gothic, emo, grumpy, cynical girl with pinkish-purple colored hair and Latino descendancy. She doesn't like a lot of stuff and especially hates Roger (in fact, at some nights, Ophelia has nightmares that she's dating Roger). When she is in charge, she wants everything done perfectly and usually has Roger doing something ridiculous.\n\nRoger Radcliffe (voiced by Tara Strong) is one of Juniper's friends and the school's clown, he wears a gangsta rapper costume, is a Brit raised in America and constantly asks Ophelia to go on a date, which she refuses. He's been known to imitate really famous people or songs in the most crude and ridiculous of ways, as in \"Enter Sandman\" when he was doing arm farts to New World Symphony No. 9, and in \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Juniper Lee\" where he was dressed up as a combination of a werewolf, a robot, and Abraham Lincoln. His family is eventually revealed to be wealthy, but he has never even come close to becoming spoiled due to his cheerful personality.\n\n"}

Further distinctions may earn them the title Associate of the Inner Magic Circle (A.I.M.C.), and Member of The Inner Magic Circle (M.I.M.C) a select group limited to 300 members. The Circle was founded in 1905, and was male-only until 1991. There is a junior branch, the Young Magicians Club, which gained popularity through the success of the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nThe Magic Circle was founded in 1905 after a meeting of 23 amateur and professional magicians at London's Pinoli's Restaurant. At this founders meeting, chaired by Servais Le Roy, those present decided upon the name of the Society: it was initially felt that the name of the Society should be the Martin Chapender Club, in memory of the performer and founding member who had recently died at the age of twenty-five. However, it was then agreed that the name \"Magic Circle\" would be more appropriate and that this name shared the same initials as those of Martin Chapender.\n\nThe first official meeting was at the Green Man public house in Soho, but meetings were later in a room at St George's Hall in Langham Place, where David Devant and John Nevil Maskelyne were regularly seen performing.\n\nDevant became the first president of the Magic Circle, and in 1906, Maskelyne edited the first issue of \"The Magic Circular\" magazine, a regular feature for members ever since. The \"Magic Circular\" claims to be the longest-running regular magic magazine in conjuring history.\n\nThe club was male-only until 1991, when more than 75% of members voted to admit women. As of 2010 there were around eighty female members of the Magic Circle, including Paul Daniels' wife, Debbie McGee. In 2014, Megan Knowles-Bacon became the first female officer in the Magic Circle, as well as the youngest person to be elected as an officer; she was elected as secretary.\n\nThe motto of the society is the Latin \"indocilis privata loqui\", roughly translated as \"not apt to disclose secrets\" (lit. \"incapable [of] speaking [of] private [things]\") ; members give their word not to wilfully disclose magic secrets other than to bona fide students of magic. Anyone breaking this or any other rule may be expelled.\n\nSince 1998, the Magic Circle building in central London near Euston Station in Camden has been available for meetings and corporate entertainment. It was voted the UK's Number One Venue in the hospitality industry's Top 20 UK Venues poll 2008.\n\nThe Magic Circle's headquarters houses a theatre, library, museum, a dining room, a clubroom and bars. The museum features magic tricks, props, posters, programs, toys, photographs and artefacts related to conjuring history. Items of interest include, Robert Harbin’s original Zig Zag illusion, Chung Ling Soo's robes, an original Sooty with associated Harry Corbett apparatus, sets of props used by television magicians David Nixon and Tommy Cooper, items and a sound recording of Harry Houdini taken from an Edison cylinder, and a set of cups and balls used by HRH Charles, Prince of Wales when he took his Magic Circle exam in 1975. Visits are by arranged tour.\n\nMagicians who wish to join may spend up to two years as an Apprentice before applying for full membership. They need to have known two current members for at least one year and must be at least 18 years old. These two members are then asked to act as sponsors, or referees, on the candidate's application form and propose them as a suitable candidate for membership. Following the receipt and processing of the application, the candidate is invited to an interview with the examinations secretary, usually at the London headquarters. If the candidate proves suitable and sufficiently knowledgeable a performance exam is scheduled or a thesis may be written. The exam takes place in front of a panel of judges, and candidates must demonstrate their skills to members in a rehearsed act.\n\nIf a thesis is chosen, it is read by two examiners and a copy is made available in the Magic Circle library. The final stage is by vote by members of the Council, who will approve the candidate as a member. Once the applicant is successful, they are free to call themselves \"Members of the Society\" and use the letters M.M.C. after their name.\n\nMembers of the Magic Circle include: Charles, Prince of Wales, Luis de Matos, Michael Vincent, Dynamo, Tom London, John Archer, \n, and Stephen Fry.\n\nMembers may take a further examination to achieve the degree of Associate of the Inner Magic Circle. The designation A.I.M.C. shows this higher membership. The A.I.M.C. degree can also be attained through thesis, and in rare cases – that is when a candidate gains 18 or higher out of a possible 20 marks in the written exam – examinees taking the M.M.C. exam are awarded the A.I.M.C. degree. Those who attain an A.I.M.C. degree as a result of a performance examination are awarded the A.I.M.C. with silver star.\n\nWithin the society, there are a number of members never exceeding three-hundred known as the \"Inner Magic Circle\". Full membership of the Inner Magic Circle is denoted by the letters M.I.M.C. after the member's name. Membership of the Inner Magic Circle is by call of The Society's President. The M.I.M.C. degree may be awarded with a gold star, to signify that the recipient is a performer of magic (as opposed to e.g. an inventor, historian or noteworthy volunteer for the Society). The honour of a gold star does not necessarily signify the holder's excellence as a performer and not all recipients are performers of excellence.\n\nMembers must undertake not to reveal magic secrets to anyone except bona fide magicians, on pain of expulsion.\n\n\"The Young Magicians Club\" is part of the \"Youth Initiative of the Magic Circle\" (the other major part being the prestigious \"Young Magician of the Year Competition\") and is a club for magicians between the inclusive ages of 10 and 18 which was founded in 1996. Sponsored by the Magic Circle, members of the Young Magicians Club meet for monthly workshops at the Magic Circle Headquarters, the 'Centre for the Magic Arts' in London. \nThe Young Magicians Club has a current membership of around 200 members.\n\nThe Young Magicians Club's principal means of communication among its members is its bi-monthly magazine \"Secrets\". The worldwide membership also communicates through a members-only on-line forum on the Young Magicians Club website.\n\nMembership in The Young Magicians Club requires no interview or exam and is open to all young people interested in magic. There are monthly all-day workshops for members who come from all over the country to take part. Adult members of the Magic Circle take on the responsibility of instructing the members of the Young Magicians Club. Local adult magic clubs will often have a junior magicians club attached to them but The Young Magicians Club is the only such club associated with the Magic Circle. Members of the Young Magicians Club are eligible to join the Magic Circle at a reduced rate when they reach 18, but then they must complete the examination procedure for full membership.\n\nThe Young Magicians Club holds their annual one-day convention every October called 'J-Day'. The convention includes lectures and the finals of two competitions with awards, which include the \"Home Counties Trophy\" for stage magic, \"The Mark Leveridge Cup\" for close-up magic, \"Kaymar Komedy Cup\" and the \"Peter McCahon Award for Originality\". In recent years, the celebrity guest lectures have been presented by Derren Brown in 2010, Dynamo in 2011, John Archer in 2012, Marvin Berglas in 2013, Luis De Matos in 2014 and Dave Loosley and Andi Gladwin in 2015.\n\nThe popularity of the Harry Potter franchise was one of the key reasons for the organisation's growth this century with membership doubling after the announcement of the first film in 2001.\n\n\n\n"}

The site was not investigated by archaeologists, and has recently been covered by a housing development.\n\nWaldalgesheim is in the middle Rhine valley to the west of the point where the Rhine is joined by the Nahe.\nThe first objects were found there by the plowman Peter Heckert on 18 October 1869 while digging holes to plant beets.\nHe did not attach any importance to them at first, but a passer-by said they could be historically important.\nEventually a Bingen antique dealer bought the pieces for 450 Thaler.\nHeckert continued to explore, and eventually found over 30 pieces.\nIt was not until the 20th century that it was recognized that the objects dated to the 4th century BC.\nObjects from the site including gold rings and a bronze pot are held in the \"Rheinischen Landesmuseum\" in Bonn.\n\nAfter the objects had been found the exact location was forgotten and no effort was made to preserve the site.\nIn 1997 Professor Michael Schönherr tried to organize an investigation of the arable area where the site was presumed to be located, based on fragmentary records.\nHe received no response from the state archaeologists apart from a request not to publish the location since that could attract looters.\nIn 2002 it emerged that there were plans to build housing over the plot.\n\nThe Waldalgesheimer chariot burial is one of the most important finds from the early Celtic period.\nThe grave dates from about 330 BC.\nIt was a wooden chamber under a barrow mound, with the fragments of a two-wheeled chariot to one side.\nThe burial dates from the La Tène Iron Age of the Rhineland.\nFrom the absence of warrior equipment and presence of jewelry the burial is presumed to be of a woman.\nBased on the rich array of grave goods, it is thought to have been that of a Celtic princess.\nThe objects mostly belong to the La Tène B period, apart from a spouted flagon, which is older.\n\nThe funerary offerings include gold ornaments, a bronze flagon, a bucket and bronze plaques with repoussé human figures.\nThe finest of the ornaments were a gold torc, an arm ring and two bracelets.\nThe torc and the bracelets were decorated with low-relief \"Waldalgesheim style\" designs.\nThe style of the objects show influences from eastern France and southern Italy.\nThe bronze bucket from Campania probably dates to the second quarter of the 4th century BC, or soon after.\nThe artifacts also include the fittings of the chariot. \nThe harness and belt attachments have similar styles of ornament to the personal jewelry.\nTwo similar sheets of bronze, badly damaged, are decorated with repoussé busts ornamented with the new style.\n\nThe flagon is in Early Style.\nIt is at least a generation older than the other objects.\nThe precise engraving indicates that the flagon was made by skilled and specialized smiths.\nIt is heavily worn on the body, where it would have been held when pouring, showing that it was already old when it was buried.\nThe flagon has a flattened pedestal base, a pot belly and a tubular spout.\nSimilar vessels have been found as far apart as Eigenbilzen in Belgium and Dürrnberg in Austria, and pottery versions have also been found.\nThere is a benign human face at the foot of the flagon's handle, and a stylized ram's head at the upper end of the handle.\nA horse decorates the lid of the flagon, showing eastern influences. Similarities with a gilt-bronze spouted flagon found at Reinheim indicate the same artist may have made both, or they may have been made by artists from the same school.\n\nThe flagon and the bronze bucket seem to have been more deeply buried than the gold torc and bracelets, which has been taken as possible evidence of two burials at different dates.\nHowever, it is entirely possible that the older objects were heirlooms buried at the same time as the more recent jewelry.\n\nThe term \"Waldalgesheim Style\" was coined by Paul Jacobsthal (1880–1957) for objects with similar style to those found at Waldalgesheim.\nIt continues to draw on classical Celtic plant motifs, but marks the highest artistic level of the early Le Tene period with its confident interpretation and execution.\nThere is disagreement about the origin of the style, with no reason to suppose that it first appeared in the Rhineland. \nFor this reason, some archaeologists prefer the term \"vegetal\" to reflect the emphasis on design derived from plants, and particularly from tendrils.\nHowever, it is not the only style to use such motifs, and it included motifs unrelated to plants.\n\nMetalwork in this style appeared throughout Celtic Europe after about 350 BC.\nThe style shows influence from the Early Style, but generally has been found in different locations apart from the Marne region of the north of France.\nAlthough the Waldalgesheimer objects were found in a late barrow, Waldalgesheimer style objects are more often found in flat cemeteries in southern Germany, Switzerland, Italy and central and southeast Europe.\nSome archaeologists see Waldalgesheimer influences in British objects, but this is questionable.\nThe decorative style is found on different types of objects in different regions: sword sheaths in Italy, fibulae in Switzerland and neck rings in France.\nThis indicates that the style was developed by specialized local craftsmen who adapted new decorative designs from Greek models, as opposed to being spread by traveling craftsmen.\nThe Waldalgesheimer style is less naturalistic than the Early Style, with plant motifs that characteristically flow into each other in a continuous manner.\nThe designs subtly incorporate elements of human and animal faces and bodies.\nSometimes the designs incorporate chains of triskels, or curved-sided triangles.\nThe style includes sinuous tendrils and scrolls and asymmetrical plant spirals.\nThe low-relief compositions have over-and-under patterns.\nMegaw (1970) has called the style \"assured irrationality\".\nTwo basic themes are the serpentine scroll and the lyre-motif, often combined with palmette.\n\nThe parade armor helmets found in Amfreville-sous-les-Monts and in Agris are examples of the style.\nThe Agris Helmet is remarkable as an example of high-status Le Tene metalwork which may have been buried as a ritual offering to the underworld spirits. The upper and lower panels of the helmet are decorated with unconnected palmettes, and the central panel with a series of S-curves, again unconnected. The infilling designs on the center panel show similarities to the Waldalgesheim objects, while the ornament of the neck-guard shows a freer experiment with a sinuous composition.\n\n"}
