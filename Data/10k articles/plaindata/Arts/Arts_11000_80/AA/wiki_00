By 1912, major motion-picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles. In the early 1900s, most motion picture patents were held by Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey, and filmmakers were often sued to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west, where Edison's patents could not be enforced. Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry.\nDuring the First World War the film industries of Europe were devastated, and Hollywood replaced the French and Italian firms as the most popular film makers in the world.\n\n"}
{"id": "40658899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40658899", "title": "ART/MEDIA", "text": "ART/MEDIA\n\nART/MEDIA was a social sculpture project in the form of series of socio-political public art events that took place in 1986 in Albuquerque and Santa Fe New Mexico. This groundbreaking artist forum featured artworks presented to the public through the mass media in a series of artist-designed billboards, television, radio and print media, and in museum exhibitions, a lecture series, and performance art series. Through this extended format, the artwork and ideas of contemporary artists were made accessible to a large public audience outside of the traditional art audience. \n\nLocal and nationally known artists were commissioned to create socio-political artwork presented through the mass media, concerning critical issues of the time, such as nuclear proliferation, environmental degradation, human rights, animal rights, and loss of privacy through technology. The forum stimulated discourse between local communities and nationally known artists through hands-on video workshops, interviews, lectures, performances, informal discussions and road trips. It was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts, Albuquerque Arts Alliance, the Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Art, and the New Mexico Arts Division. ART/MEDIA operated as a \"museum without walls\" with an office located in the historical Kimo Theater on Route 66. Inspired by the concept/model of Joseph Beuys social sculpture, that have the potential to transform society, ART/MEDIA was an extended artwork that included human interactions, creating structures and systems within society using language, thought, objects, events and actions. The project was documented by seminal video artists Steina and Woody Vasulka who founded The Kitchen in New York City in 1971.\n\nArtists involved in ART/MEDIA included: Hans Haacke, Jenny Holzer, Rachel Rosenthal, Terry Allen (artist), Paul Bob of Bob and Bob, Church of the SubGenius, Godfrey Reggio and the Institute for Regional Education, Mohammed Jim 5X (Jim Stuber), Larry Goodell, Violet Ray, Bob Willis, The Carcass Sisters, Jean-Paul Curtay, Lousie Maffitt and Robert McDermott, Patrick Clancy and Gwen Widmer, Lee Connor, Barbara Bock, Manny Rettinger, John P. McCloskey, Steven Durland of High Performance Magazine, and the art critic/historian, Craig Owens (critic).\n\nArtist-designed billboards included a series of forty billboards by Jenny Holzer addressing Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, and deployed a fleet of Holzer's \"Inflammatory Statements\" street posters. Rachel Rosenthal designed a billboard dealing with animal rights for laboratory rats. Paul Bob designed a series of billboards on the practice of everyday life. Artist-designed print media projects included a color spread by Patrick Clancy and Gwen Widmer that recontextualized articles within Albuquerque Magazine, Jenny Holzer produced a large print piece containing her \"inflammatory statements\" that was inserted into the Sunday edition of the Albuquerque Journal newspaper, Paul Bob, and Rachel Rosenthal produced projects in other statewide publications.\n\nExhibitions included \"Subversive Acts: Artists Working With The Media Politically\", at the New Mexico Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico Art Museum, and the Art Gallery Fogelson Library Center at the College of Santa Fe. \"Subversive Acts\" was an exhibition of mass media forms utilized by artists to present their sociological, environmental and political messages. The video exhibition \"Tuning In\", took place at the Museum of Fine Arts, Santa Fe, and the Art Gallery of the College of Santa Fe. Public performances included visual artist and country western singer, Terry Allen (artist), performance artist and ecological activist Rachel Rosenthal, Paul Bob of the performance due Bob and Bob and performance poet, Larry Goodell. Public lectures included Hans Haacke on art, economics and ethics, Jenny Holzer speaking on the power of public art interventions to change human consciousness, Steven Durland on the history of performance art, Craig Owens (critic) of Art in America Magazine speaking on the relationship between political art and the mass media.\n\nThe concept for the project originated in 1984 with artists Duane Griffin, Patrick Clancy and Scott Portman who later joined with Co-Directors Eve Andree Laramee and Ann Zimmerman to found the project and organization. The Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Arts was the fiscal sponsor under 501c3 not-for-profit status. Bob Gaylor, then director of SFCCC and invited Griffin and Laramee to be part of a Think Tank at St. John's College where they met with Steina and Woody Vasulka, Allan Kaprow, Carolee Schneemann, Edward \"Ned\" Hall, Jerome Rothenberg, and other artists and thinkers. Empowered by this experience, a team of advisors were assembled. Gaylor served as a primary advisor throughout the project, along with Gordon Church of the City of Albuquerque Cultural Affairs Office. The Albuquerque Arts Alliance and the City of Albuquerque became the second fiscal sponsor, providing an office in the historical Kimo Theater on Route 66. Steina and Woody Vasulka introduced the organizers to Godfrey Reggio, director of the film Koyannisqatsi (1982) who provided guidance on organizing Social Sculpture events as \"public service announcements\". Reggio, having been involved in numerous progressive political causes, took interest because his Institute for Regional Education had developed a multi-media campaign of PSA's for the American Civil Liberties Union on the invasion of privacy and use of technology to control behavior in 1972. Grants were received from the National Endowment for the Arts in the InterArts and the Artist Forums categories and the New Mexico Arts Division.\n\nART/MEDIA Documentation https://vimeo.com/39454685\n\n"}

In the interwar period until 1939 it served as a trade union and in 1945, following World War II, it was formally re-established as an association. In 1980, ZPAP supported the Solidarity movement and opposed the imposition of martial law in 1981. Consequently, the military authorities disbanded the Association when it refused to retract its communiqués. ZPAP operated unofficially until the restoration of democracy in 1989. Today, ZPAP features prominently across the country with 23 regional Chapters, paid staff, curators, publications, and regional art galleries promoting work of its members.\n\nZPAP membership is limited to graduates of art faculties of relevant institutions of higher learning, with the main emphasis on regional Academies of Fine Arts. On top of its creative presence in major Polish cities, the Association operates two professional development retreats, in Ustka and in Świnoujście. It sponsors dozens of commercial art galleries across Poland as well as selected stores with professional art supplies. ZPAP organizes a number of annual events, and offers its own Jan Cybis Award for creative achievement. In 1996 the Association organized the UNESCO conference around the international status of an artist. It is the leading advocacy group working in conjunction with the Polish governmental agencies regulating labor laws applicable to practising art professionals. ZPAP is represented in the World Executive Committee of the International Association of Art (IAA).\n\nSince 1996, ZPAP manages copyrights of about 1,000 members and is in charge of issuing licenses for the commercial use of their artwork. The economic nonprofit activity of the Association is geared toward generating funds necessary for the maintaining of its venues, as well as providing financial support for members in need.\n\nThe main office of ZPAP is in Warsaw and is located at the upper floor of the historic kamienica Efrosa at ul. Nowy Świat 7 \"(pictured)\", where Princes of the Lubomirski family once lived in the 18th century. The building was rebuilt with its original baroque portal intact following wartime destruction of the Polish capital.\n\nRegional chapters of ZPAP are located in the following cities: Białystok, Bielsko-Biała, Bydgoszcz, Częstochowa, Gdańsk, Katowice, Kielce, Koszalin, Kraków, Lublin, Łódź, Olsztyn, Opole, Poznań, Radom, Rzeszów, Szczecin, Toruń, Warszawa, Wrocław, Zakopane, Zielona Góra, and Gliwice.\n"}

{"id": "249838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249838", "title": "Bound (1996 film)", "text": "Bound (1996 film)\n\nBound is a 1996 American neo-noir crime thriller film written and directed by the Wachowskis in their feature film directorial debut. Violet (Jennifer Tilly), who longs to escape her relationship with her mafioso boyfriend Caesar (Joe Pantoliano), enters into a clandestine affair with alluring ex-con Corky (Gina Gershon), and the two women hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of mafia money.\n\n\"Bound\" was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from Billy Wilder to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by Dino De Laurentiis, the film was made on a tight budget with the help of frugal crew members including cinematographer Bill Pope. The directors initially struggled to cast the lesbian characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed \"sex educator\" Susie Bright, who also made a cameo appearance in the film.\n\n\"Bound\" received positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.\n\nCorky (Gina Gershon), a lesbian ex-con who has just finished a five-year jail sentence, arrives at an apartment building to start work as a painter and plumber. On her way up to the apartment, she encounters the couple who live next-door, Violet (Jennifer Tilly) and Caesar (Joe Pantoliano). After Caesar has gone out, Violet flirts with Corky and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After Corky extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose in order to get closer to Corky, and starts to seduce her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar and Corky goes back to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.\n\nLater, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mafia associates beating and torturing Shelly (Barry Kivel), a man who has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.\n\nShelly is shot and killed by Johnnie (Christopher Meloni), the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone (Richard C. Sarafian), and Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for killing Shelly in a fit of rage and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.\n\nViolet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.\n\nEverything goes as planned until Caesar finds the money gone. He realizes that if he runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides he has to get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, thinking that maybe she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.\n\nCorky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After watching Johnnie flirt with Violet and taunt him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. In an angry panic, he kills both Gino and Johnnie, and Gino's bodyguard Roy. He tells Violet that they have to find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey (John P. Ryan), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.\n\nAfter discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, gags them, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. When Mickey arrives to see what is going on, Caesar, panicked, makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. As he prepares to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone and quickly convinces Caesar to pretend that he's on the phone with Gino, who's calling from a hospital to explain that he and Johnnie were in a car accident. Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it. Violet escapes and makes a phone call to Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her to the ground. Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. Caesar tells Violet that he knows she will not shoot him, to which she replies, \"Caesar, you don't know shit\", before killing him.\n\nLater, Mickey, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar, and that there is no need to involve the police. Mickey wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean break—which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.\n\n\nFilm producer Joel Silver has said that after working as scriptwriters on \"Assassins\", the Wachowskis made \"Bound\" as an \"audition piece\" to prove that they knew what to do on a movie set. Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel \"made that up.\" The Wachowskis themselves claim they \"decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut.\" They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because those are the kinds of films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.\n\nWhen executives at some studios read the script, they told the Wachowskis that if they changed the character of Corky to that of a man, they would be interested. The siblings declined, saying \"that movie's been made a million times, so we're really not interested in it.\" Dino De Laurentiis, the executive producer on \"Assassins\", offered to finance \"Bound\" and his company produced it, giving them \"free rein\" with regard to the story. The film's budget was $6 million.\n\nThe Wachowskis struggled to cast the roles of Violet and Corky, seemingly because of the lesbian content of the film. Few actresses were interested. The part of Violet was expected to go to Linda Hamilton, and Jennifer Tilly read for the part of Corky. She loved the role and was looking forward to playing a character very different from previous parts in her career. When the part of Violet became available, and Gina Gershon came in to read for Corky, Tilly agreed that Gershon would make a better Corky. She realized that she identified with the character of Violet, a woman \"underestimated by all the men around her\" who has to \"play the game\". She describes it as the best role she had ever had. Gina Gershon suggested Joe Pantoliano to the Wachowskis for the part of Caesar. His first lead role in a film, he describes it as his favorite.\n\n\"Bound\" was shot in thirty-eight days in Santa Monica, California. The Wachowskis' original director of photography resigned on the grounds that he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he know anyone he believed could. Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew \"a bunch of cheap guys\". Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by Frank Miller's neo-noir \"Sin City\" series in particular. Pope's sound counterpart was sound director Dane Davis. One of his ideas was to give Corky a cat-like quality by making a \"swishing\" sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.\n\nThe Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch John Huston's \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and to focus on Humphrey Bogart's character in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar. Gershon's influences for her role were James Dean, Marlon Brando and Clint Eastwood. Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking tequila.\n\nVery little improvisation took place during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar near the end of the film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.\n\nThe sex scenes were choreographed by feminist writer and sex educator Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly what was happening in the sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.\n\nBright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedian Margaret Smith played Jesse's girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright's friends—\"real life San Francisco dykes\".\n\nThe Wachowskis describe several themes present in \"Bound\". They say that the film is about \"the boxes people make of their lives\", that it is not only gay people who \"live in closets\". They wanted to define all of \"Bound\"'s characters by the \"sort of trap that they were making out of their lives\". Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar. This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says \"I had this image of you inside of me...\" This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Corky's apartment, Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.\n\nSusie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands. Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic motif to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink. Bright describes it as a movie that is \"wet\" (feminine) as opposed to \"hard\" (masculine). She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of \"lesbian signs\". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and \"girly\"—making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that \"everyone in the film wants to be with Violet\". When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the LGBT film festival screenings.\n\n\"Bound\" was rated by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) as R for \"strong sexuality, violence and language.\" To achieve that rating, the directors had to cut part of the first sex scene between Corky and Violet. The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called \"hand-sex\". It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom. In Canada it was rated as R in Manitoba and Ontario, 18 in Nova Scotia and 16+ in Quebec.\n\nThe film premiered on August 31, 1996, at the Venice Film Festival and in September went on to play at the Toronto International Film Festival. It opened in U.S. theaters on October 4, 1996 distributed by Gramercy Pictures, showing in 261 theaters. It closed after three weeks. It opened in the United Kingdom on February 28, 1997.\n\n\"Bound\" grossed $3,802,260 in the United States and $3,209,057 from other territories, for a worldwide total of $7,011,317. In its opening weekend, showing at 261 theaters, it earned $900,902, which was 23.7% of its total gross. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at 161 for all films released in the United States in 1996, and at 74 for R-rated films released that year. , its all-time ranking for LGBT-related films is 59.\n\nThe review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a positive rating of 93% based on 40 reviews, while Metacritic gave it a score of 61/100 based on 19 reviews. The Wachowskis' direction was praised, being described as clever, sophisticated and stylish. Roger Ebert said that their skillful film making showed virtuosity and confidence. Marjorie Baumgarten writing for \"The Austin Chronicle\" called it an impressive debut saying that the Wachowskis have \"style to burn\". James Kendrick called it a darkly comical and stunning film, saying it signalled the arrival of the Wachowskis on the film scene. Detractors of the film included Todd McCarthy for \"Variety\", who said that the directors had no sense of humor and lacked depth, that the film was pretentious, superficial and heavy-handed.\n\nOn the release of \"Bound\", the Wachowskis were compared by many to the Coen Brothers. Rita Kempley for \"The Washington Post\" went so far as to call them \"Coen Brothers clones\". In particular, similarities were drawn between \"Bound\" and the Coen Brothers' first film, 1984 neo-noir \"Blood Simple\". Bryant Frazer for \"Deep Focus\" called it an \"obvious precursor\". Critics noted resemblances to the films of Quentin Tarantino and Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nJanet Maslin for \"The New York Times\" said that the grisly violence in \"Bound\" would likely limit its audience and Ebert said that its shocking violence would offend some audiences. Some critics said that the violent behavior of the characters had no moral justification. Rita Kempley for \"The Washington Post\" called it \"well-nigh unwatchable cruelty for its own sake\". McCarthy, who called the central relationship between the two women unbelievable and unsympathetic, said \"just because Violet and Corky fall for each other doesn't mean they somehow fall into a privileged state of grace in which vile behavior can be forgiven.\" Other critics were less concerned, calling the violence \"comically excessive\" and \"Tarantino-like\".\n\n\"Bound\" was praised for being perhaps the first mainstream film to have a lesbian relationship at its heart without homosexuality being central to the plot. Despite the presence of \"unapologetically gay\" lead character Corky, it is not commonly considered a \"lesbian movie\". Emanuel Levy said that this is a weakness, that mainstream films with broadening storylines \"do not necessarily represent a positive development in the making of gay and lesbian films\" and that \"Bound\" has \"little, if anything, to do with lesbian cinema\". Jonathan Rosenbaum for the \"Chicago Reader\" called it a \"welcome change\" to have a lesbian couple as the main characters in a mainstream film. Sarah Warn for AfterEllen.com called Corky \"the closest thing to a realistic and sympathetic butch lesbian we've seen in a mainstream movie\". Barry Walters for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" praised the film for showing gay characters that have an active sex life. The sex scenes, described as explicit and steamy, were admired for being tasteful, discreet and realistic. Warn called them \"some of the best lesbian sex scenes to date in a mainstream movie\".\n\nThe three lead actors were complimented for their performances. Ebert said that Gershon and Tilly were electric together, and Frazer said that he would have liked to have seen more of their love story. Some critics described their onscreen relationship as unbelievable and unsympathetic. Gershon was seen to have made a comeback after her role in the less well received 1995 film \"Showgirls\". Tilly's performance was compared to her Academy Award-nominated part in \"Bullets Over Broadway\". Pantoliano was described as \"a lot of fun\" and having the \"trickiest scenes in the movie\".\n\n\"Bound\" won the Grand Jury Award—Honorable Mention at the 1996 L.A. Outfest, and in the same year won an Honorable Mention at the Stockholm International Film Festival. At the 1997 Fantasporto festival in Portugal, the Wachowskis were awarded the International Fantasy Film Award for best film, and Jennifer Tilly picked up the award for best actress. \"Bound\" won the 1997 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding (wide-release) Film. The film was nominated for the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.\n\n\"Bound\" was released on Region 1 DVD on November 12, 1997 by Republic Pictures. It featured the original theatrical trailer and an audio commentary by the directors and stars. It was released on Region 2 DVD on August 25, 2003, by Pathé featuring original theatrical trailers, audio commentary by the directors and stars, cast and crew biographies and a production featurette. Its Region 4 DVD release, distributed by Reel and featuring an audio commentary, came on August 14, 2006.\n\nThe score, composed by Don Davis, was given a promotional release on November 25, 1997 by Super Tracks Music Group, but has never been released commercially. Having her character Corky play a jaw harp was Gina Gershon's idea. The directors' budget for songs was small; they had wanted to use \"The Girl from Ipanema\" and Frank Sinatra songs, but could not afford to. The four songs used in the film were not included on the score release.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7635662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7635662", "title": "Breyer Animal Creations", "text": "Breyer Animal Creations\n\nBreyer Animal Creations (commonly referred to as Breyer), a division of Reeves International, Inc, is a manufacturer of model animals. The company specializes in model horses made from cellulose acetate, a form of plastic, and produces other animal models from the same material as well. Less well known are its porcelain and resin horse figures, which are aimed at the adult collector market. The company also produces model tack accessories, such as stables, barns, and grooming implements in scale to its model horses.\n\nBreyer Animal Creations was founded in 1950 in Chicago, Illinois, as Breyer Molding Company. It gained recognition when commissioned by F.W. Woolworth to create a horse statue (now known as the # 57 Western Horse) to adorn a mantel clock. It was approximately 1:9 scale and the model was retained as payment for molding the parts. Orders began to roll in for the horse only and the Breyer Animal Creations company was founded. Since then, Breyer has become a leader in producing model horses.\n\nIn 1984, Reeves International acquired Breyer Animal Creations and spent the next 20 years completing its transformation from toy distribution to manufacturing. Today, Breyer remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Reeves International. Model horses are sold through independent distributors and the Breyer website.\n\nWhile Breyer products were originally manufactured in the United States, production now takes place in China.\n\nThere are several scales of Breyer horse models:\n\n\nAs of 2008, the Ponies line has been replaced with a similar line titled \"Pony Gals\". The line differs from other Breyer products in that the models have brushable manes and tails and may have jointed heads, necks, and legs, and are marketed towards younger children.\n\nEach horse is cast in a two to three piece mold. Both halves are then put together and the seams are sanded and polished. Markings and color patterns are usually obtained by using a stencil known as a mask, although most older models were airbrushed by hand, with markings such as undefined socks or a bald face merely left unpainted. Most detailing, such as eye-whites (common on 1950s and 1960s models and is now enjoying a resurgence in modern models), brands, or other individual markings are painstakingly hand-painted. Sometimes, a variation in the paint job occurs. A variation is a difference, usually in the paint job, of one or a minority of a model as they came from the factory. The reason for variations is rarely known. For example, there is a common mold typically called the Proud Arabian Stallion (abbreviated PAS by collectors). For many years it was produced by Breyer with a dappled gray coat and a gray mane, tail and hooves. However, for some unknown reason a few of these models came from the factory with black manes, tails, and hooves, and black socks or stockings. These special, rare models are considered variations of the Dapple Grey PAS model and are very valuable compared to the regular model, which is quite common. They were later determined to be their own unique colorway, and not a variation.\n\nBreyer uses a number of different molds, with most molds having been released in several colors. For instance, there is a commonly used mold referred to as the Family Arabian Stallion (so popular that it is known as \"FAS\" to collectors). Breyer has released runs of this mold in a multitude of different coat colors with various markings and details such as socks and blazes, appaloosa blankets, even Native American paint decorations since its original production in 1956. Models may also have different finishes, such as matte or glossy. Each version of a particular mold is considered a separate model, and is almost always given a number and name. In certain instances, however, some models do not receive a number—these may be known as \"test runs\". New molds are often introduced, and old ones are sometimes \"retired\"—not created anymore—or even accidentally broken or lost.\n\nThe coloring and marking variations are infinite, of course, and include all the variations found among actual horses. Breyer also releases models in more unrealistic colors - \"decorator models\". The original four decorator colors were produced in the 1960s: Wedgwood (light blue with white mane and tail, intended to suggest the colors of Wedgwood china), Copenhagen (dappled blue with white mane and tail), Florentine (dappled gold with white mane and tail), and Gold Charm (solid gold body with white mane and tail). A woodgrain finish was also produced. Later Breyer introduced a \"bronze\" finish and more recently \"silver filigree\" which is basically silver Florentine. The original four decorator colors are still occasionally used in limited run editions but the original decorators are now highly sought after by collectors. Several more recent decorator models have scenes and images painted on them, especially those done in the Halloween line, and a few have been cast in a translucent form of cellulose acetate to look like blown glass, known as \"clearware\". The company recently introduced a metallic \"two-color\" paint with a very flashy effect. Models painted with this paint are typically limited edition.\n\nA particular model horse can be graded, or valued, in several ways, depending on the purpose of the grading scale.\n\nUnlike some collectible toys, Breyer horse packaging does not generally affect the model's value. Unfortunately, there have been some issues with pre-2000s packaging, in which if a model is left in the box for an extended period of time, the box can actually cause harm to the horse's finish due to rubbing of the horse's paint on the sides of the box or on the plastic ties binding it to the packaging, therefore diminishing the model's value.\n\nCommon flaws in used models are scratches, rubs, breaks (ears, tails, legs), seam splits, warped legs, yellowing, and so on, which come from use or careless storage. Other flaws come from the factory, such as very slightly off-target painting or slightly sloppy detailing, badly sanded seams, over spray, or bent legs (from improper cooling). Some flaws from the factory are considered variations and are sought after by collectors as rare oddities.\n\nThe rarity of the model is the other primary method of judging collectibility and value. A model can be defined as rare if it was released for a short time period a long while back, so there are not many left in circulation, or if it was released in very limited numbers. The most extreme cases of this are the very few Breyer releases that are one-of-a-kind (OOAK), which are always given out as prizes or sold off at auction for charity at the yearly Breyerfest gatherings. These horses are by far the most coveted and highly valued model horses.\n\nModel horse shows are a way for collectors to show off their models. In a show, a model is described as being one of two grades: Live Show Quality (LSQ) or Photo Show Quality (PSQ). LSQ means that the horse and all tack accurately depict the real animal and must be in good enough condition (considering flaws from the factory, as well as from use) to be inspected on all sides. PSQ is less demanding, since both horse and tack can be seen from only one side in the photo and close examination is not possible. Therefore, the standards of condition and realistic appearance are not quite as high.\n\nThere are two types of shows: live shows and photo shows. In a live show, the model is judged from all sides. In a photo show, images of a model are sent/emailed in, and therefore can only be judged be judged from one side. In a live show, there are three types of classes: collectability, halter, and performance. In a collectability class, an entrant's goal is to have the rarest model. In a halter class, the model must have a name and a breed, and this class is judged after how the model matches the breed it is given. The goal in performance class is to create a realistic and accurate depiction of an equine sport.\n\nAnother branch of the model horse hobby is customizing, in which a single model is remade in some way, making it unique. Sometimes models are simply repainted or have patterns etched in their existing paint (appaloosa or paint horse markings, for instance), while other models are repositioned by being heated and then shaped. In the most drastic cases, the artist will completely re-sculpt the model, cutting body parts away, repositioning and reattaching them, and re-painting and finishing them. Breyer models are popular candidates for customizing, due to their inexpensiveness and ability to be easily obtained.\n\nDepending on how well the customizing was done, how well-known the artist is, and how attractive the results are, these special, one-of-a-kind models can sometimes sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n\nBreyerFest was first held in 1990 and since then has been held annually in July at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington, Kentucky. This popular event is a three-day festival for model horse collectors of all ages. During this event, attendees can purchase special run Breyer models sold only at Breyerfest, purchase RR (Regular Run) and retired models from Breyer and dealers in attendance, and participate in large model horse shows. In addition, there are classes on how to paint, customize, and repair models as well as lectures on collecting and judging them. Special guests of honor, usually renowned trainers and famous horses, are also present and perform for the attendees. Typically, the equine guest of honor has been previously represented by a Breyer model horse. A live auction is held each year featuring one-of-a-kind model horses created by Breyer and sold to the highest bidder, often for thousands of dollars. A silent auction for rare or customized models and model horse related accessories is also held. Included in the purchase price of a 3-day ticket is a Traditional-scale \"Celebration\" model, and 1-day ticket holders receive a Stablemate-scale model. Each BreyerFest has a unique theme, upon which many or all of the special-run models are designed.\n\nBreyer models are available through the company website and from a variety of online and brick and mortar dealers such as toy and tack shops. In the secondary market models are frequently found on eBay, and Model Horse Sales Pages. Breyer also has a dealer finder on its website.\n\n\"Just About Horses\" (JAH) is Breyer's model horse magazine. Issued annually to Collector Club members, this is the most popular model horse magazine in America. Subscriber benefits include sneak peeks into Breyer releases and events, articles on the hobby, and highlights on noted collectors and sculptors. Information on back issues of \"Just About Horses\" can be found on the \"Identify Your Breyer\" website.\n\n\"Breyer Molds and Models: Horses, Riders, and Animals\", fifth edition, by Nancy Young is an encyclopedic book on models made by Breyer from 1990 to 1997. It includes information on production runs and colors, mold marks and variations, Breyer catalogs, tack, stickers, lamps, clocks, and much more. Though no new editions have been released, this book is the most informative one available on the history and minutiae of Breyer models.\n\nThe \"Breyer Animal Collector's Guide\" by Felicia Browell (and others, in the later editions) is essentially a price guide featuring photographs of most of the models released by Breyer as well as values for them based on average selling prices.\n\n"}
{"id": "22261770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22261770", "title": "Bubalus Period", "text": "Bubalus Period\n\nThe Bubalus Period, also known as the Large Wild Fauna period, is the earliest known period of Saharan rock art. Most of the engravings from this period have been dated between 10,000 BCE and 7,000 BCE. There are no images of pottery, cattle, or crops, which means that these carvings were mostly likely produced by a hunter-gatherer culture and not by a pastoralist culture, although the two may have existed simultaneously during a brief period of time. The majority of the rock engravings in the Large Wild Fauna style are located in what is known as the Maghreb region of the Sahara, encompassing a wide area spanning across Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia – specifically, the Fezzan region of southwestern Libya. During a period of time when the desert was well-watered and fertile, this region was populated by nomadic groups known today as the Berbers (from the Greek \"barbarian,\" a term they used for all foreigners). Nomadic groups such as these had trade routes across the Saharan region, many of which are older than the desert itself. It is believed that the Berbers were responsible for much of the rock engravings in the area.\n\nThe names of this particular style of rock art – \"Large Wild Fauna\" and \"Bubalus\" – refer to the subject matter depicted in the majority of the engravings. Most Bubalus art consists of animals that would have been plentiful in the region when it was fertile: giraffes, elephants, and a now-extinct species of bovine known as \"Bubalus antiquus\". The images are nearly life-sized and fairly naturalistic in style. The images have been carved in continuously flowing white lines that make it easy to forget that each image was painstakingly ground into the rock faces by hand. A distinct feature of this style is the outsized, rounded feet of the animals.\n\nOther subjects depicted in the carvings include humans and animal-headed humans (a theme which is widespread in the Art of ancient Egypt). Men are shown armed with clubs, throwing sticks, axes and bows, but never spears. One image depicts a rhinoceros on its back, surrounded by jackal-headed humans armed with clubs. Interpretations of this image are up to debate, but some believe hunting scenes like these may refer to \"Hunting magic,\" a ritualistic attempt to control the animals they hunted. Others think that the images are likely far more in-depth in religious meaning than that, but nothing has been determined with certainty in regard to an interpretation. We do know that the animal-headed humans depicted here definitely preceded those seen in Egypt.\n\nAfter the Sahara became the desert we know today (ca., 1,000 BCE), most of its ancient inhabitants migrated to other parts of Africa, taking their culture with them. Many artistic styles throughout African history owe their origins to the early Saharan rock art.\n\n"}

It was influenced by lunchtime concerts organised by Hilda Bor at the Royal Exchange and by Myra Hess at the National Gallery. The driving force in the Society's foundation was Ivan Sutton, with help and encouragement by Bor, who became its Vice-President, and from Edric Cundell, Principal of the Guildhall School of Music, who served as its first President. It was described in an obituary of Sutton as \"one of the City of London's most remarkable institutions\". \n\nThe first event, a lecture by Cundell, took place in December 1943 at the Guildhall School, shortly followed by the first concert, a performance by the Morley College Choir, in January 1944. After subsequent Society concerts at the Chartered Insurance Institute and the Royal Exchange, Sutton succeeded in convincing the Goldsmiths' Company to allow the use of its hall for a series of three evening concerts in the autumn of 1946. In the autumn of 1947 the lunchtime concerts moved from the Guildhall School to the Bishopsgate Institute where the opening concert by Louis Kentner attracted a capacity audience. Since then evening concerts at Goldsmith's Hall and Tuesday lunchtime concerts at Bishopsgate Institute have provided the regular framework within which the work of the Society has evolved.\nThe Society, at present, stages around 26 concerts per year and has over 2000 lunchtime and early evening concerts to its credit. It completed its 60th-anniversary season in April 2004. As well as featuring well-established musicians, the Society's policy has always attempted to invite outstanding young professional artists who are at the beginning of their careers to perform at its concerts, many of whom have since attained international status. Furthermore, over the years the Society has commissioned many new works - on average one every three years - from a wide and diverse range of British composers, including Roger Smalley, Nicholas Maw, Diana Burrell, Richard Rodney Bennett, Elizabeth Maconchy, Phyllis Tate, Robin Holloway, John McCabe, Geoffrey Burgon, Peter-Paul Nash, Kevin Volans and Michael Berkeley.\n\n"}
{"id": "1829787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1829787", "title": "Clement Scott", "text": "Clement Scott\n\nClement William Scott (6 October 1841 – 25 June 1904) was an influential English theatre critic for the \"Daily Telegraph\" and other journals, and a playwright, lyricist, translator and travel writer, in the final decades of the 19th century. His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today.\n\nScott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with William Archer, Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw and others. After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished.\n\nBorn the son of William Scott, the perpetual curate of Hoxton in north London, Scott converted to Roman Catholicism before his 21st birthday. Educated at Marlborough College, he became a civil servant, working in the War Office beginning in 1860.\n\nEncouraged to write by the humorist Tom Hood the younger, who also was a clerk in the War Office, Scott contributed to \"The Era\", \"Weekly Dispatch\", and to Hood's own paper, \"Fun\", where Scott and W. S. Gilbert were colleagues. Scott's interest in writing and the theatre led him to brief dalliance with the failed \"Victoria Review\".\n\nHe became the dramatic writer for \"The Sunday Times\" in 1863 but held the position for only two years because of the intemperance of his published opinions and his unpopular praise of the French theatre. In 1871, Scott began his nearly thirty years as a theatre critic with \"The Daily Telegraph\". He also contributed regularly to \"The Theatre\", a magazine that he founded, and wrote sentimental poetry and song lyrics (including \"Oh Promise Me\"), which were often published in the magazine \"Punch\" by his friend, the editor, F. C. Burnand. Scott continued to work at the War Office until 1879, when he finally decided to earn his living entirely by writing.\n\nAs well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including \"The Vicarage\", \"The Cape Mail\", \"Anne Mié\", \"Odette\", and \"The Great Divorce Case\". He wrote several English adaptations of Victorien Sardou's plays, some of which were written in collaboration with B. C. Stephenson, such as \"Nos intimes\" (as \"Peril\") and \"Dora\" (1878, as \"Diplomacy\"). The latter was described by the theatrical paper \"The Era\" as \"the great dramatic hit of the season\". It also played with success at Wallack's Theatre in New York. Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of Halévy and Meilhac's libretto for Lecocq's operetta \"Le Petit Duc\" (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production. For all of these, Scott adopted the pen name \"Saville Rowe\" (after Savile Row) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, \"Bolton Rowe\", another Mayfair street. The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the Bancrofts, the producers of T. W. Robertson's plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the British Isles and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the \"Swiss Cradle Song\", later adapted as \"Now Is the Hour\" and as \"Haere Ra\", the Māori farewell song, which white New Zealanders \"mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong\". It is also used for the hymn \"Search Me, O God\", with lyrics by J. Edwin Orr. However, an Australian family has long claimed that the \"Clement Scott\" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for a family member.\n\nIn 1883, the \"Daily Telegraph\" printed an article which Scott had written about a visit to the north Norfolk coast. He became enamoured of the district and gave it the name \"Poppyland\". His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area. Ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularisation of this previously pristine area.\nScott married Isabel Busson du Maurier, the sister of George du Maurier, and the couple had four children. She died in 1890, and he remarried Constance Margarite Brandon, an American journalist and actress, in San Francisco. Scott's long-time wish to be elected a member of the famous literary gentlemen's club, the Garrick Club (to which Henry Irving, Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, among many other notable men belonged), was finally realised in 1892. After an ill-considered 1898 interview in \"Great Thoughts\", Scott was forced to retire as a theatre critic and moved to Biarritz to write \"The Drama of Yesterday and Today\". He then worked for a couple of years at the end of the century for the \"New York Herald\", later returning to London. In 1900, he founded \"The Free Lance, a Popular Society and Critical Journal\", for writers who worked by the job, which he edited.\n\nScott fell into illness and poverty in his last years and died at his residence in Woburn Square at the age of 62.\n\nScott's position on the \"Daily Telegraph\" and the support of its proprietor, J. M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, \"The Theatre\", achieved wide circulation. He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic William Archer, the chief English supporter of Ibsen, tended to involve him often in controversies.\n\nScott played an important part in encouraging a more attentive attitude by theatre audiences. In his early days, it was not uncommon for audiences to be very boisterous and noisy, frequently booing and talking during productions, especially through the overture. He also insisted on first night reviews. It had been common for reviewers to wait a few days before writing about a production. Scott insisted that the paying audience on the first night should expect to see a fully fledged production, and not one where the leading characters did not know all their lines. Theatre managers disliked the opening night reviews when they felt that a new piece had not had time to settle down yet. On the other hand, Scott supported actor-managers of his time by providing them with translations of popular French plays and with his own plays.\nEarly in his career, he wrote approvingly of the \"cup and saucer\" realism movement, led by T. W. Robertson, whose plays were notable for treating contemporary British subjects in realistic settings. Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with new types of theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging. As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and Shaw, arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses. His scathing attacks on Ibsen and Shaw became evident in their lack of journalistic neutrality.\n\nScott outraged the theatre community with an extraordinary attack on the morals of theatre people in general, and especially of actresses, in an interview that was published in the evangelical weekly \"Great Thoughts\" in 1898. He said that the theatre warps people's character and that it was impossible for a pure woman to be successful in a stage career, and that all leading actresses were immoral and could have achieved their success only by virtue of the extent of their \"compliance\". Even before the publication, the transcript of the interview was released to the press, and Scott immediately received a firestorm of condemnation. Although he apologised and recanted his remarks, he was barred from theatres, and the \"Daily Telegraph\" was forced to dismiss him. He soon retired and found his reputation and prospects much diminished. By the end of his life, however, he received a measure of forgiveness, and shortly before his death the theatre community held a generous benefit for him.\n\nHis papers are located in the library of Rochester University, New York State. Film maker John Madden (\"Shakespeare in Love\", \"Mrs. Brown\", \"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\") made his first feature film for the BBC, \"Poppyland\" (1985), around the story of Scott's visit to Poppyland.\n\n\n"}

According to FDA regulations regarding DMFs (21 CFR 314.420(c)):\nThe Guideline for Drug Master Files (September 1989), recommends that DMF holders update their DMFs annually (see below under Annual reports).\n\nTo ensure DMFs are current, the FDA sends \"overdue notification letters\" (ONLs) to DMF holders for DMFs that are overdue for update (see above). If a DMF holder does not respond to this letter within 90 days by submitting an annual report, the FDA considers the DMF \"closed by the FDA,\" and \"retired\".\n\nNote that the FDA has a backlog sending out ONLs. DMF holders can forestall the sending of an ONL by updating their DMFs, following the procedure below under \"Retaining the activity of a DMF.\"\n\nA DMF can be retired only if it is closed. A retired DMF is unavailable for review.\n\nA DMF holder that wants to retain the activity of a DMF listed as Inactive and not closed must submit an annual report (two copies). This is also the process used to respond to an ONL. The cover letter must specify that it is an \"annual report.\"\n\nA company can return a closed DMF to active status only by submitting a \"reactivation.\" The reactivation must contain a complete re-submission of the DMF, updated to meet current guidance.\n\nFor drug master files, the version posted on the web is the current version. The address for submitting DMF documentation to the FDA in the Guidance is dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.\n\nFDA regulations require that all foreign language submissions to INDs and NDAs have complete, accurate translations. The same is true for DMFs. The FDA does not require a certified translation.\n\nDMF guidance recommendations, in general, still apply. However, the information below provides additional information or clarification in three categories:\n\nMailing address for filing original DMFs and all subsequent DMF documents (Category 3):\n\nCompanies send two paper copies of all submissions to an existing paper DMF to the address above. The FDA does not accept submissions via e-mail or CDs. Companies may submitted two-sided copies of DMFs.\n\nWhen the FDA receives a DMF, they review it for administrative content. This may take 2–3 weeks. If the DMF is acceptable from an administrative point of view, the FDA issues an acknowledgement letter, which notifies the holder of the DMF number. If the FDA finds the DMF not acceptable from an administrative view, they notify the holder of the deficiencies they must correct.\n\nThe FDA reviews the DMF for technical information only after the following events occur:\n\n\nThe FDA grants requests for preassigned DMF numbers for electronic or paper DMFs. (See \"Requesting a Pre-Assigned Application number.\")\n\nCompanies submit DMFs following the format recommended in the \"Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality.\"\n\nCompanies may convert an existing DMF in non-CTD format to CTD format. In such cases, the FDA advises DMF holders to submit an amendment that contains all applicable CTD-specified sections to the material in the DMF. Each section must be complete and current. For drug substances and excipients, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.S in Module 3. For drug products, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.P in Module 3. If the reformatting causes changes in the DMFs technical content—e.g., adds new information—the cover letter for the new submission must describe these changes. DMFs in CTD format must follow CTD Guidance, e.g., be paginated within each section. This supersedes DMF guidance.\n\nFor conversion of a paper DMF to electronic CTD format, see Electronic DMF.\n\nDMFs that cover multiple items, e.g., Type III DMFs for components of container-closure systems or Type IV DMFs for flavors, can be submitted in CTD format. Technical information can be in Module 3, following the outline in the Drug Substance Section. Sections within 3.2.S. can be populated as appropriate. Each product, such as different flavors, must have a different name—e.g. \"3.2.S.[Flavor 1], 3.2.S.[Flavor 2].\" Information common to different products—e.g., analytical procedures—can be accessed by reference (or links in the case of an Electronic DMF) from the relevant section for that product, e.g., \"3.2.4.2 [Flavor 1].\"\n\nDMF holders who submit DMFs for sterile manufacturing can consult the \"Manual of Policies and Procedures 5040.1: Product Quality Microbiology Information in the Common Technical Document - Quality (CTD-Q).\" Companies don't have to file separate sections for the same product manufactured at separate facilities unless the manufacturing processes are different.\n\nModule 1 must contain the following information\nSection 1.2: Cover Letter and Statement of Commitment\nSection 1.3: Administrative Information\n\n1.3.1 Contact/sponsor/Applicant information\n1.3.1.1 Change of address or corporate name\nCan be used to supply addresses of DMF holder and manufacturing and testing facilities\n\n1.3.1.2 Change in contact/agent\nCan be used to supply the name and address of contact persons and/or agents, including Agent Appointment Letter.\n1.4.1 - Letter of Authorization (LOA)\nSubmission by the owner of information, giving authorization for the information to be used by another. An Agent Appointment Letter is NOT an LOA and should not be called “Letter of Authorization” and should not be submitted in Section 1.4.1\n1.4.2 - Statement of Right of Reference\nSubmission by recipient of a Letter of Authorization with a copy of the LOA and statement of right of reference. Submitted in a DMF only when another DMF is referenced.\n1.4.3 - List of authorized persons to incorporate by reference\nThis list should be submitted in DMF annual reports.\nSection 1.12.14 Environmental Analysis: See Environmental Assessment\n\nThe language in the following sentence in the DMF Guidance, Section VII.B.1, has confused some DMF holders:\n\nIt does not mean to say that a company must list all individuals in the DMF holder’s company who are authorized to submit information to the DMF.\n\nThe language in the CFR is clearer:\n\nType I DMFs (Category 1)\n\nThe FDA no longer accepts Type I DMFs, per a final rule published on January 12, 2000 (65 FR 1776). See Type V DMFs below.\n\nHolders of Type II, III, and IV DMFs must not place information regarding facilities, personnel, or general operating procedures in these DMFs. They should only submit DMF holder addresses, manufacturing sites, and contact personnel. See \"Administrative Information in a DMF.\"\n\nType II DMFs (Category 1)\n\nFor Type II DMFs filed in CTD-Q format, the FDA expects Module 2.\n\nDrug Substance\nType II DMFs for drug substances may be submitted in the format for \"Drug substance\" in the \"Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality\".(Category 3) Drug Substance:\nSee the current Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances.\nIt is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.S.4.3.\nSee also the DRAFT ICH Guidance “Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances\nDrug Product:\nType II DMFs for drug products may be submitted in the format for \"Drug product\" in the \"Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality\".(Category 3) Drug Product.\nSee the Guideline For Submitting Supporting Documentation In Drug Applications For The Manufacture Of Drug Products.\nIt is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.P.5.3.\n\nExamples of drugs that would be classified as Type II DMFs include Amifostine, Caffeine, Desonide Micro, Ibuprofen Softgels, Viatmin E Oil, and Zinc Gluconate.\n\nSeparate DMFs should be submitted for drug substances and drug products.\n\nType III DMFs (Category 1)\n\nThe applicable Guidance for Type III DMFs is the “Guidance for Industry: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation” and Questions and Answers. (Category 3)\n\nA Manual of Policies and Procedures covering reviewer responsibilities for review of Type III DMFs has been implemented. MAPP 5015.5 CMC Reviews of Type III DMFs for Packaging Materials This MAPP instructs reviewers to look for information regarding many packaging materials in the application (IND, NDA, ANDA) for the drug product that utilizes the packaging material before reviewing the DMF. Much of the information needed for review can be provided directly to the applicant for inclusion in the application, thereby avoiding the need to review the DMF.\n\nExamples of products that would be classified as Type III DMFs include bottles, seals, dispensers, and vials.\n\nType IV DMFs (Category 3)\n\nType IV DMFs should be used for products such as excipients, colorants, flavors, essences, or other materials used in product preparation. Examples of materials that would use a Type IV DMF include bases, waxes, and edible inks.\n\nSee relevant section in the Guideline for Drug Master Files. Toxicology studies may be submitted in the same DMF as the CMC information but they should be in a separate volume or volumes. It is preferable for holders to submit such information as a separate Type V DMF. See also the “Guidance for Industry: Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients\nType V DMFs (Category 3)\n\nThe following types of DMFs may be filed as Type V DMFs without requesting prior clearance from FDA.\n\nManufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel for sterile manufacturing plants. See Guidance for Industry for the Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products.\nContract Facilities for the manufacture of biotech products. See Draft Guidance for Industry: Submitting Type V Drug Master Files to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research\nFor other submissions as Type V DMFs the holder must request permission from FDA before filing a Type V DMF. (21 CFR 314.420(a)(5)). Prospective Type V DMF holders may send their request to dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov, explaining the necessity for filing the information in a Type V DMF.\n\nExamples of sites and procedures that would require Type V DMFs include clinical studies, sterilization facilities, and toxicological information.\n\nAdministrative Information in a DMF (Category 3)\n\nThe only elements of the administrative information that should be in a DMF are:\n\nThe name and address of the holder\nThe name and address of manufacturing facility\nFor the contact person:\nName\nMailing Address\nTelephone number\nFax number\nE-mail address\nStatement of Commitment\nThe name and address of the agent (if applicable)\nFor the contact person at the agent (if applicable):\nName\nMailing Address\nTelephone number\nFax number\nE-mail address\nThe appointment of an Agent is optional. See discussion below under “Agents”\n\nSubmission of Amendments, Annual Reports, and Letters of Authorization(Category 3)\n\nTo facilitate processing of documents that are submitted to an existing DMF, please list the Submission Type and the Category/Subcategory of the Amendment (Supporting Document) in bold type in the header on the transmittal letter. See list below. More than one Submission Type/Category/Subcategory can be used but all must be listed.\n\nExample: If updated stability data is submitted at the same time as an Annual Report, the heading of the Cover Letter should state:\n\nAnnual Report\nOriginal: Quality/Stability\n\nFDA’s database is structured as follows:\n\nApplication:\nSubmission\nAmendment (called \"Supporting Document\") in the database)\nAmendments (Supporting Documents) are named by a Category and Subcategory\n\nFor the Application Type “Drug Master File” the Submission Types are\n\nOriginal: Information containing changes to technical information are filed in the “Original” submission. For Categories and Subcategories, see list below. Note that a new DMF does not need a “Category” designation by the holder.\nAnnual Report: There are no Amendments (Supporting Documents) Categories and Subcategories\nLetter of Authorization: There is only one Category with two Subcategories:\nLetter of Authorization\nWithdrawal of Authorization\nCategories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in General Information\nCategory: Closure Request\nCategory: Reactivation (Used only when a DMF has been Closed.)\nCategory: Administrative\n\nSubcategories under Administrative Category\nchange in the holder name\nchange in holder address\nchange in ownership of the DMF (either internal name change, or change in ownership)\nchange in the agent name or address.\nchange in the contact person at the holder or agent.\nchange in the subject of the DMF.\nchange in the type of DMF\nCategories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in Original Submission:\n\nCategory: Quality\n\nSubcategories under Quality Category (with corresponding CTD Sections, where applicable).\n\nChanges to a Subsection e.g. changes in Control of Materials (S.2.3) not specifically listed below should be reported as the next level up e.g. should be reported as Manufacture Information S.2.\n\nNew item: Additional item e.g. flavor added to a multi-item DMF\nControls Information (specifications) S.4 and P.5\nDissolution Data (Usually applies to drug product only) P.5\nFacility Information (changes in manufacturing and or testing sites) S.2.1 and P.3.1\nFormulation Information (Usually applies to drug product only) P.1 and related sections\nLot Release (batch analysis) S.4.4 and P.5.4\nManufacture Information S.2 and P.3\nMicrobiology Information\nNew Strength (Usually applies to drug product only) P.1 and related sections\nQuality (Not covered by other subcategories)\nPackaging Information (Applies to packaging of the material that is the subject of the DMF e.g. plastic bags for packaging a bulk drug substance in a Type II DMF) S.6 and P.7\nStability Information S.7 and P.8\nResponse to Information Request\nResponse to Deficiency Letter\n\nCategory: Non-clinical\nNon-clinical\nCarcinogenicity Information\nA response to an Overdue Notice Letter (ONL) to retain activity of a DMF MUST be identified as an Annual Report (with additional amendments as applicable) and contain the information listed below for an Annual Report. Responses to ONLs that are not labeled as Annual Reports or that state that an update will be submitted in the future are NOT sufficient to keep the DMF in active status.\n\nFDA does not acknowledge, whether via e-mail or letter, any submission after the original DMF.\n\nSubmissions that cover multiple DMFs MUST have a copy submitted for each DMF.\n\nWhen a company changes one part of a DMF, they should not resubmit the entire DMF. For DMFs in CTD format, the company should resumbit the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires that the company resumbit \"Section S.2.3.\"\n\nAll submissions must be paginated within the submission. For DMFs in CTD format, the company only resubmits the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires resubmitting \"Section S.2.3.\"\n\nPages that replace an already-numbered page from a previous submission should also contain the page number in the current submission (e.g. a page replacing Page 10 in the original submission may be page 14 in the new submission). For DMFs in CTD format, only the pages within the changed “Document” (Section) are subject to re-numbering.`\n\nNo pages are ever physically replaced in a DMF.\n\nAt this time, the FDA doesn't \"require\" that companies file DMFs electronically. They continue to accept paper DMFs. Beginning May 5, 2017 new DMFs and submissions to existing DMFs must be submitted using the eCTD standard. See Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD)'\n\nAll electronic submissions must have a pre-assigned number to populate in the US regional.xml. If a company converts a paper DMF to electronic format, they don't need to request a pre-assigned number.\n\nSee also Guidance for Industry: Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format—Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications. To make sure you have the most recent versions of the specifications referenced in this guidance please check Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD). Companies are encouraged to submit their DMFs in electronic form, including updating current paper DMFs. Note that all applications to CDER, including DMFs that are submitted in electronic format MUST be in ECTD format, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers are not granted for DMFs.\n\nAll Letters of Authorization for electronic DMFs should specify that the DMF has been submitted in electronic format. A company may not submit an electronic resubmission to a paper DMF unless they resubmit the entire DMF in electronic format. Companies may convert an existing DMF in paper format to electronic format (ECTD only). See “Conversion to CTD” above.\n\nThe ECTD format provides the backbone for the submission, and a guide as to where to place information. Companies need not submit all modules, nor submit all sections within a module. However, the FDA requires Module 1 for all eCTD submissions, as it contains the administrative information that identifies the DMF. Electronic signatures are accepted for electronic DMFs.\n\nThe company must submit two copies of all letters of authorization (LOAs) to the DMF. The DMF holder must then send a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (company or individual authorized to incorporate the DMF by reference). Failure to submit the LOA to the DMF may delay review of the DMF. LOAs must specify the name of the specific item referenced, and the date of the submission of information about that item. The LOA must not be called a \"letter of access.\" An LOA is required, even if the DMF holder is the same company as the authorized party.\n\nCompanies must not submit LOAs with original paper DMFs, because the LOA must contain the DMF number. Therefore, DMF holders must wait to submit an LOA until they receive an acknowledgment letter with the DMF number. An LOA can be submitted with the original DMF if the DMF has received a pre-assigned number. It is not necessary to reissue LOAs if there have been no changes in the holder, authorized party, subject of the DMF or item referenced.\n\nIf the holder or authorized party changes names, whether this represents a change in ownership or not, they should submit new LOAs to the DMF and copies sent to the authorized party.\n\nLOA Template\nAGENTS (Category 2)\n\nThere is no regulatory requirement for an agent for any DMF, foreign or domestic. An agent for DMF purposes is not the same as an agent for the purposes of the Drug Listing and Registration System. (DRLS). Holders should not include the name of the agent for Registration purposes in the DMF. Also note that in the US, the process of “Registration” applies ONLY to “registering” an establishment with the FDA.\n\nAll “Agent Appointment Letters” for DMFs MUST be sent by the holder. FDA recommends that such letters include the phrase “appoint AGENT NAME as the agent for DMF” rather than “authorize AGENT NAME to act as the agent for DMF,” since the latter can be confused with a “Letter of Authorization.”\nAn “Agent Appointment Letter” may be included in an original DMF.\n\nIf possible, the word “Agent” should be used for the legal entity (whether a company or an individual) who is authorized to act on behalf of the DMF holder. The word “Representative” should be used for an individual who is employed by the Agent or Holder as the contact point for FDA.\n\nIf a company acting as an Agent changes its name, FDA recommends that the DMF holder issue a new Agent Appointment Letter.\n\nA different agent can be appointed for different DMFs submitted by the same holder.\n\nAgent Appointment Template\nHOLDER NAMES (Category 2)\n\nWhen the company that owns a DMF (DMF holder) changes its name, whether through sale of the company or simply a change in the company’s name, the DMF holder must notify FDA. See Section VII.E. in the Guideline for DMFs for further recommendations on the procedure for transferring ownership. A change in the name of a company for registration purposes under DRLS will not change the DMF holder name.\n\nWhen a DMF is transferred from one company to another, the original holder should submit an administrative amendment stating that they are TRANSFERRING the DMF to the new holder. The new holder should then submit an administrative amendment stating that they are ACCEPTING the DMF from the former holder.\n\nIf the DMF holder changes its name and there is no transfer of ownership, the holder may submit a single Holder Name Change amendment.\n\nA DMF holder is expected to retain a complete reference copy that is identical to, and maintained in the same chronological order as, their submissions to FDA (See Section IV.D.1 in the Guideline for DMFs). Therefore, the old owner of the DMF is expected to transfer that copy to the new owner of the DMF.\n\nIf a holder name change affects multiple DMFs, all documentation must be submitted to each DMF as separate submissions.\n\nIn general, the FDA expects that the manufacturer is the holder. If a manufacturer (company A) of a material wants another company (Company B) to submit the DMF, and Company B wishes to act as the holder—the DMF must include statements from both companies that Company B is responsible for all information in the DMF, and for all processes and testing performed by the manufacturer. The title of the DMF that appears on the list of DMFs is the format \"Material manufactured in [LOCATION OF COMPANY A] for [COMPANY B].\"\n\nANNUAL REPORTS (Category 2)\n\nAccording to the DMF Guideline, companies must not use annual reports to report changes in the DMF. However, as described above, companies can submit an annual report at the same time as other information. The annual report must contain (for cover letter see Templates below):\n\n1. An administrative page that contains:\n\nNote that the DMF Guidance uses the terms “Annual Update” and “Annual Report” interchangeably. All submissions of Annual Reports should be labeled “Annual Report.” The term “Annual Update” should not be used.\n\nNote that the annual report must list the authorized parties. If the list is long and the holder wants to list only authorized parties added since the last annual report, they should highlight this in the cover letter. There should be a statement that there have been no changes in the list of authorized parties previously submitted.\n\nBIOLOGICS MASTER FILES (Category 3)\n\nMaster Files submitted in support of products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) must be submitted as BB-MFs. See the CBER web site for the products regulated by CBER.\n\nSee ”FDA IND, NDA, ANDA, or Drug Master File Binders\n“The “binders” are actually covers. These may be ordered from the\n\nU.S. Government Printing Office (GPO)\nWashington, DC 20404-0001\n(202) 512-1800\n\nIn addition these can be ordered online using the following links\n\nRed Binder\nBlue Binder\nOne copy of the DMF should use the blue cover and one should use the red cover.\n\nFasteners must be obtained separately. Use 2 Piece Prong Fasteners, 8 1/2\" Center to Center, 3 1/2\" Capacity. Binders should be used for all subsequent submissions to FDA that are more than 10 pages.\n\nFEES (Category 3)\n\nThere are no fees or charges for filing a DMF or any subsequent documents.\n\nFORMS (Category 2)\n\nCertain forms are required for submission of NDAs and INDs. However, there are no forms required or available for DMFs, except for the forms discussed above under Binders.\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF DMFs (Category 2)\n\nThe public availability of the contents of DMFs is covered in 21 CFR 314.430(e). All requests for information about DMFs beyond that provided in the tables above must be made through the CDER Freedom of Information Web site.\nFILING DMFs AND PATENT EXPIRATION AND EXCLUSIVITY ISSUES (Category 2)\n\nDMFs may be filed at any time. The Patent Expiration date and the Exclusivity Expiration dates listed in the Orange Book have no impact on DMF filing. The submission of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) that reference DMFs are subject to the regulations regarding filing of ANDAs.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (Category 2) Since DMFs are neither approved nor disapproved, there is no need to file an Environmental Assessment. However the DMF should contain a commitment by the firm that its facilities will be operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws.\n\nREORGANIZATION OF A DMF (Category 1)\nThe advice in the Guidance does not apply. It is not necessary to consult with FDA before reorganizing a DMF.\n\nREQUEST FOR CLOSURE OF A DMF BY THE HOLDER (Category 2).\n\nIt is not necessary to include a statement that \"the holder's obligations as detailed in Section VII have been fulfilled,\" as recommended in the DMF Guidance. It is sufficient to include a statement that all of the parties authorized to reference the DMF have been notified that the DMF is being closed..\n\nLETTER TEMPLATES AND COVER LETTERS (Category 2)\n\nNote that a “Transmittal Letter” and a “Cover Letter” are the same thing.\n\nCover Letter for Original DMFs\nCover Letter for Subsequent Amendments and Annual Reports (Not applicable to Holder Transfer, New Holder Acceptance, Holder Name Change, Letter of Authorization, and Closure Requests)\n\nCover Letter for Reactivation of a Closed Drug Master File\nThe following Letters do not require a Cover Letter\n\nHolder Transfer\nNew Holder Acceptance\nHolder Name Change\nLetter of Authorization\nClosure Request\nWithdrawal of Authorization\n\n"}
{"id": "22547455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22547455", "title": "Frikar Dance Company", "text": "Frikar Dance Company\n\nFRIKAR dance company (established May 2006 by Hallgrim Hansegård) is a Norwegian dance company for contemporary and traditional dance specializing in the connection between dance and nature.\n\nFRIKAR dance company was founded by choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård in 2006, and has toured 29 countries all over the world. The company is described by National Geographic as \"wildly inventive\" and is composed by 32 artists from 4 continents (India, Iran, Somalia, Brazil, Cape Verde, France, Sweden, Norway.) The artists from very diverse genres meet each other in the research of gravity and human nature.\n\nWith a background in Norwegian traditional dance choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård founded FRIKAR dance company to give acrobatic dancers living in Norway a creative environment. Together with the dancers he has been developing a new choreographical style for contemporary dance called \"Down2Earth\" including Hallingdans Capoeira and break dance. He works in the formats of aerial dance, site specific ecosophical stage arts, indoor dance and interdiciplinary arts.\n\nHansegård made his international breakthrough with an animation film at the Venice Biennale in 2003 (Tarantrance). In 2005 he won 3rd prize at Superdok. In 2007 he was awarded \"Artist of the Year\" at The Norwegian Folk Music Awards. In 2009 he won the \"Award for best choreography\" at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, among 43 countries in the most seen entertainment TV program in the world.\n\nIn 2010 he premiered \"Jamsiis\" at Bergen International Festival Youtube: Jamsiis. This was a highly personal contribution to the Nordic contemporary dance scene, based on his roots in traditional dances. Jamsiis opened up a public discussion about the boundaries of contemporary dance in Norway. NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting) writes:\n\nJAMSIIS, Hallgrim Hansegårds new production, is the most exciting I have seen here. It’s very exciting to see traditional dance in dialogue with contemporary dance. Hansegård is branching out and opening up new territory here. He has come down a path that I think is very important to go. That Hansegård is a dancer with strong will to do his own thing and blessedly uninhibited as far as exceeding boundaries is concerned is something the Norwegian dance community should be happy about… At the same time that he approaches contemporary dance, he opens doors. If he succeeds in making contemporary dance accessible to a wider audience than today’s, the genre of contemporary dance should learn to endure a ‘halling-roundkick’ or two.\n\nIn 2009 Hansegård directed TidarÅ, an outdoor full night dance performance under a waterfall with 22 dancers and musicians from FRIKAR dance company. The production collected contemporary and traditional dancers in a research for a unique contemporary dance technique. \"Tidarå\" is part of FRIKARs ecosophical productions. Hansegård directed also Yr in 2009 together with violin virtous Ragnhild Hemsing, premiere at the Bergen International Festival.\n\nIn 2008 FRIKAR was censored by the Roman Catholic Church in Naples for his non conventional interpretation of Peer Gynt, NRK: Bukkerittet. In the years 2005 to 2007 Hansegård directed \"Undergrunnsfargo\", \"Isolations\", \"Laus\", \"Kruk\", \"The snuff grinders\" and \"Bastard\".\n\nHe also participated in \"Dansefeber\", the Norwegian version of \"So You Think You Can Dance\", in 2006. In 2008, his dancing was digitalized for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) .\n\n- \"AP\" (2010)\n- \"JAMSIIS\" (2010) \n- \"Wall dance\" (2010)\n- \"TidarÅ\" (2009)\n- \"YR\" (2009)\n- \"Fairytale\" (2009)\n- \"Mjølk\" (2009\"\n- \"Bukkerittet\" (2008)\n- \"THE SNUFF GRINDERS\" (2007) \n- \"KRUK!\" (2007)\n- \"Bastard\" (2007) \n- \"LAUS\" (2006)\n\nThe whole company made it to the finals in Norway's Got Talent in 2008. Frikar performed with winner Alexander Rybak at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 (ESC) performing \"Fairytale\". The routine, based on traditional halling and choreographed by Hallgrim Hansegård, was awarded the Best Choreography of Eurovision 2009 by esctoday.com. In 2009 Frikar performed 150 times, including its outdoor big scale production TidarÅ, concerts with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, the premiere \"YR\" at Bergen International Art Festival. They toured 20 European countries with live performances and TV shows. FRIKAR was censored by the Catholic Church on their 2008 Italy tour for an unromanticized interpretation of Peer Gynt.\n\nFrikar also won the \"Norway's got talent\" competition in 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "46297077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46297077", "title": "Genesis Foundation (arts charity)", "text": "Genesis Foundation (arts charity)\n\nThe Genesis Foundation is an arts project based in the United Kingdom and the principal activity of The Studs Trust, a registered charity.\n\nEstablished by John Studzinski in 2001, the Genesis Foundation works in partnership with the leaders of UK arts organisations including LAMDA, the National Theatre, Royal Court, The Sixteen and the Young Vic. Its largest funding commitment is to programmes that support directors, playwrights, actors and musicians in the early stages of their professional lives.\n\nThe theme of art & faith increasingly characterises aspects of the Foundation’s work with choral commissions including James MacMillan’s Stabat mater and the sponsorship of the British Museum’s Living with Gods exhibition.\n\nThe Genesis Foundation was founded in January 2001 by investment banker and arts patron John J. Studzinski, CBE.\n\nSince then it has donated over £13 million primarily to its partner organisations to develop and mentor artistic talent from diverse backgrounds. The Foundation spends up to £1 million annually on its ongoing programmes with its partner organisations, all of which operate under the leadership of inspired artistic directors.\n\nIn October 2017 John Studzinski received the 2017 UK Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award for his work with the Genesis Foundation and its support of young artistic talent through long-term partnerships with artistic leaders. Others receiving the annual award include the Prince of Wales, Lord Rothschild, Sir Simon Rattle, Renzo Piano and Yoko Ono.\n\n25 students have been awarded Genesis scholarships over the past 20 years at LAMDA, the oldest drama school in the United Kingdom. Past LAMDA scholars include Samuel Barnett, Tom Riley and Ben Aldridge.\n\nIn 2017 the scholarship programme was replaced by the Genesis Network which provides mentoring to LAMDA final year students by pairing them with a graduate mentor to support them as they complete their training and enter the industry.\n\nSince 2010, the Genesis Foundation has collaborated with British chamber choir The Sixteen and funded Genesis Sixteen, the annual free young artists’ scheme for 18-23 year old ensemble singers. Genesis Sixteen provides group tuition, individual mentoring and masterclasses run by vocal experts.\n\nThe Genesis Foundation also commissions new choral pieces from leading and emerging composers, which are then premiered and recorded by Harry Christophers and The Sixteen for their record label CORO. The world premiere of James MacMillan’s Stabat mater, a 60-minute work for choir and string orchestra commissioned by the Genesis Foundation, was given its UK premiere by Harry Christophers, The Sixteen and Britten Sinfonia at the Barbican Centre, London in October 2016. Its recording was favourably reviewed, and it won numerous awards. In April 2018 it became the first concert to be live-streamed from the Sistine Chapel.\n\nIn May 2018, four new commissions led by Sir James MacMillan were premiered at Eton College Chapel and live-streamed. The commissions were all based on texts from the Eton Choirbook and were performed alongside works from the Choirbook.\n\nPast commissions include \"Spirit, Strength & Sorrow\", three new Stabat Mater pieces by three leading composers Alissa Firsova, Tõnu Kõrvits and Matthew Martin; \"O Guiding Night\", music to poetry of the \"Spanish Mystics\" St. Teresa of Ávila and St. John of the Cross by Ruth Byrchmore, Tarik O'Regan and Roderick Williams; settings of \"Padre Pio’s Prayer\" by James MacMillan, Roxanna Panufnik and Will Todd; and Will Todd’s \"Among Angels\", dedicated to John Studzinski on the occasion of his 50th birthday.\n\nOn Tuesday 9 February 2016 the Genesis Foundation, in collaboration with the Choral Foundation, brought together leaders of the Catholic Church and the Church of England for the first service according to the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church to be celebrated since the 1550s at Hampton Court Palace’s Chapel Royal.\n\nThe Vespers’ service was performed by Harry Christophers, The Sixteen and Genesis Sixteen. The ensembles sang Thomas Tallis’s \"Magnificat\", William Cornysh's \"Salve Regina\" and John Taverner’s \"‘Leroy’ Kyrie.\" Members of the public were offered the chance to attend the service through a free ballot hosted by Classic FM.\n\nThe service was celebrated byCardinal Vincent Nichols and included a sermon from Richard Chartres, KCVO, Bishop of London and Dean of Her Majesty’s Chapels Royal – Vespers was dedicated to John the Baptist. Prior to the service, the Cardinal and Dean were in conversation under the heading \"Faith and the Crown\" in Hampton Court Palace’s \"Great Hall\". Their discussion addressed the relationship between the two churches and the monarchy.\n\nFrom 2003-2009, the Genesis Foundation funded the Directors program at the Young Vic, supported and mentored by the Young Vic's previous artistic director David Lan. This programme provided support for professional directors at the early stages of their career. Rufus Norris, Artistic Director of the National Theatre was the first Genesis Young Director.\n\nPast Genesis Fellows include: Gbolahan Obisesan (\"Cuttin’ It\" and \"Sus\"), Natalie Abrahami (\"Wings, Happy Days\" and \"Ah, Wilderness!\"), Joe Hill-Gibbins (\"A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Measure for Measure\") and Carrie Cracknell (\"Macbeth\", co-directed with Lucy Guerin).\n\nPast Genesis Future Directors include: Ben Kidd, Matthew Xia, Tinuke Craig, Ola Ince, Lucy J.

{"id": "31497818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31497818", "title": "Golden Age", "text": "Golden Age\n\nThe term Golden Age comes from Greek mythology, particularly the \"Works and Days\" of Hesiod, and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five Ages, Gold being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ( \"chrýseon génos\") lived. Those living in the first Age were ruled by Kronos, after the finish of the first age was the Silver, then the Bronze, after this the Heroic age, with the fifth and current age being Iron.\n\nBy extension \"Golden Age\" denotes a period of primordial peace, harmony, stability, and prosperity. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as \"guardians\". Plato in \"Cratylus\" (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.\n\nIn classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading Titan Cronus. In some version of the myth Astraea also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation Virgo, holding the scales of Justice, or Libra.\n\nEuropean pastoral literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in Arcadia, a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed Pan, who dwelt among them.\n\nThe earliest attested reference to the European myth of the Ages of Man 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the Greek poet Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Heroic Age, and the Iron Age. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:\n\n[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.\n\nPlato in his \"Cratylus\" referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's \"Works and Days\". The Roman poet Ovid simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry, known to schoolboys from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond, was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.\n\nIn Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the Titan Prometheus conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the Caucasus, where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden Pandora to Prometheus's brother Epimetheus. The gods had entrusted Pandora with a box that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.\n\nThe Orphic school, a mystery cult that originated in Thrace and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the world view of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god Phanes, who was regent over the Olympus before Cronus. In classical mythology however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of Saturn. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher Empedocles, like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.\n\nA tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been Arcadia, an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount Maenalus. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, Theocritus, writing in Alexandria, set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first Idyll, the goat herder, Daphnis, is taught to play the Syrinx (panpipes) by Pan himself. \n\nWriting in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the Roman Republic (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet Virgil moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.\n\nVirgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth Eclogue that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:\n<poem>\"Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;\n\"magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:\n\"iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\n\"iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.\"</poem>\n<poem>Translation:\n\"Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung\n\"Has come and gone, and the majestic roll\n\"Of circling centuries begins anew:\n\"Astraea returns,\n\"Returns old Saturn's reign,\n\"With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.\"</poem>\n\nSomewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the \"Aeneid\", which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his \"Georgics\" (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the \"Georgics\" are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the \"Georgics\", he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of Jupiter, when:\n<poem>\n\"Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen\n\"To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.\n\"Even this was impious; for the common stock\n\"They gathered, and the earth of her own will\n\"All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.\"</poem>\n<poem>\n\"ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni\n\"ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum\n\"fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus\n\"omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.\" (\"Georgics\", Book 1: 125–28)</poem>\n\nThis view, which identifies a State of Nature with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a microcosm, reflects the Hellenistic cosmology that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:\n<poem>\n\"The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,\n\"No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:\n\"And, with a native bent, did good pursue.\n\"Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.\"\n\"His words were simple, and his soul sincere;\n\"Needless was written law, where none opprest:\n\"The law of Man was written in his breast.\"</poem>\n\nThe Graeco-Roman concept of the \"natural man\" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the Deistically inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to Rousseau, who did not share it.\n\nIn his famous essay, \"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition\", Erwin Panofsky remarks how in ancient times, \"that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy\":\nThere had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a \"Gegen-Konstruktion\" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed \"soft\" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, \"hard\" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.\n\nArcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft\" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the syrinx on Mount Maenalus; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.\n\nThere are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the Vedic or ancient Hindu culture saw history as cyclical, composed of yugas with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient Middle East and throughout the ancient world, as well.\n\nThe Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages (Yugas) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.\n\nThe Krita Yuga also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the Mahabharata, a Hindu epic: Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The \"Krita Yuga\" was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.\n\nSatya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.\nKnowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. Ashrams become devoid of wickedness and deceit. Natyam (such as Bharatanatyam), according to Natya Shastra, did not exist in the Satya Yuga \"because it was the time when all people were happy\".\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris and Prajapita Brahma Kumaris make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama.The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.\n\nGolden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.\n\nRajayoga Mediation taught at the Brahma Kumaris are the way to revive the seven qualities within and awaken self true divinity, the souls of Satyuga AKA Golden Age has.\n\nMeditation energizes your awareness, bringing both peace and wisdom to a busy mind. It expands one’s capacity to love, and heals broken hearts. It also dissolves many fears, replacing them with lightness and freedom from anxiety.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest gift that meditation brings is the glow of inner peace that is both gentle and strong.\n\nPractice of Rajyoga meditation or intellectual communion with God brings into the soul many powers. Of these, eight are important.The Eight Powers.\n\nThe Old Norse word \"gullaldr\" (literally \"Golden Age\") was used in Völuspá to describe the period after Ragnarök, where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city Gimlé on the ruins of Asgard. In this period, Baldr reigns.\n\nThere is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel 2, in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.\n\nThe interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45.\n\nIn modern fantasy worlds, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or elf-like creatures existed, before the coming of humans.\n\nFor example, in \"The Silmarillion\" by J. R. R. Tolkien, a Golden Age exists in Middle-earth legendarium. Arda (the part of the world where \"The Lord of the Rings\" is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as Arda Unmarred) and was called Arda Marred. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the Eldar stay on Valinor, live with the Valar and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the Noldor, reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the end of the world, the Silmarilli will be recovered and the light of the Two Trees of Valinor rekindled. Arda will be remade again as Arda Healed.\n\nIn \"The Wheel of Time\" universe, the \"Age of Legends\" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and Aes Sedai – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make \"angreal\", \"sa'angreal\", and \"ter'angreal\", and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.\n\nAnother example is in the background of the \"Lands of Lore\" classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.\n\nThe Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy. Kenneth Grahame called his evocation of early childhood \"The Golden Age\" and J. M. Barrie's fictional character Peter Pan, who first appeared in \"The Little White Bird\" was named after \"Pan\", a Greek god from the Golden Age. Barrie's further works about Peter Pan depict early childhood as a time of pre-civilised naturalness and happiness, which is destroyed by the subsequent process of education.\n\nThe term \"Golden Age\" is at present frequently used in the context of various fields, such as the \"Spanish Golden Age\", \"Dutch Golden Age\", \"Golden age of alpinism\", \"Golden Age of American animation\", \"Golden Age of Comics\", \"Golden Age of Science Fiction\", \"Golden Age of Television\", \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", \"Golden age of arcade video games\", \"Golden Age of Radio\", \"Golden Age of Hip Hop\" and even \"Golden Age of Piracy\" or \"Golden Age of Porn\". Usually, the term \"Golden Age\" is bestowed retroactively, when the period in question has ended and is compared with what followed in the specific field discussed.\n\n"}

However one might choose to view the reliability or nature of particular works, it is from these that much of our knowledge of the Middle Ages originates.\n\nPrior to the boom in historical writing in the High Middle Ages, the number and quality of works from England's earlier period is often lacking, with some notable and bright exceptions. Later historians lamented the gaps in this period and usually explained it by way of Viking invasions; in the twelfth century William of Malmesbury said: \"in many places in England that knowledge of the deeds of the saints has been wiped out, in my opinion by the violence of enemies\".\n\nListed chronologically, by author's death. Dates represent the historical period covered by the work(s). Works and authors listed are not exhaustive. Here are the major and most significant historians and chroniclers of the period:\n\n\nThe High Middle Ages were a golden period for historical writing in England. The craft of history was not a professional subject taught in school, such as the scholastic subjects of logic, theology, law and natural science, but rather something practised by well-educated men of learning, not subjected to the process of systems and procedures of Academia. It was a realm for educated men in monasteries and the courts of kings, bishops and barons, who had the time and position and particular talents to pursue it. As a result, the quality and variety of the histories from this period are highly variable, with some entertaining and appealing examples.\n\nNumerous chroniclers prepared detailed accounts of recent history. King Alfred the Great commissioned the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" in 893, and similar chronicles were prepared throughout the Middle Ages. The most famous production is by a transplanted Frenchman, Jean Froissart (1333-1410). His \"Froissart's Chronicles\", written in French, remains an important source for the first half of the Hundred Years' War.\n\nAfter the Norman Conquest of 1066 there was an explosion of interest in English history. It has been theorized this was due in part to the native English desire to reclaim their cultural identity from the debacle of 1066. As well the new Norman rulers were interested in discovering who it was they had reigned over, which fuelled demand for legends of England's early Kings, such as Geoffrey’s King Arthur.\n\nThe works of this period are often categorized by chronicles, and by literary histories. Chroniclers recorded events and dates of events with little prose or expansion. For example, the \"Winchcombe Annals\", by a twelfth-century monk, wrote one paragraph for each year, no matter how much or little happened, with one sentence for each event in that year. In this way chronicles would often give as much, or more, attention to things of little importance as those things of greater importance.\n\nUnlike chronicles, the literary histories could be classified along with other forms of medieval literature. Indeed, entertainment was considered a legitimate function of historical writing. Historical accounts of battles often included long, and entirely invented, speeches from leaders. Histories were as much a part of medieval literature as other forms, such as the romance. Most of them endeavoured to be readable, arming themselves, as Roger of Wendover does, against both \"the listless hearer and the fastidious reader\" by \"presenting something which each may relish\", and so providing for the joint \"profit and entertainment of all.\"\n\nAnother characteristic of the histories of the period is that they borrowed heavily from other writers, often directly copying entire works as their own. For example, Henry of Huntingdon's \"History of the English\" is only one quarter original, relying in many places on Bede's \"Historia Ecclesiastica\". This process would often be compounded as later writers would copy these works in full or part.\n\nBede was highly regarded by historians of this period, and later historians lamented the fact that the 223-year period between Bede's death in 735 and Eadmers \"History of Recent Events\" (starting in 960) was sparsely represented. William of Malmesbury said of Bede \"after him you will not easily find men who turned their minds to the composition of Latin histories of their own people\". Henry of Huntingdon referred to Bede as \"that holy and venerable man, a man of brilliant mind,\".\n\nFor writing contemporary history, historians could draw on their own eye-witness accounts, reports from those they met and primary source documents such as letters. A good network of contacts was essential, and taking many journeys was common. Clerics assigned to the courts of Kings would often have the best access to information, such as Roger of Howden in Henry I's reign. Although some monks, such as William of Newburgh, never left their monastery, yet he was able to obtain considerable information through the network of story-telling and gossip which existed in the theoretical seclusion and silence of monastic life.\n\nListed chronologically, by authors death. Dates represent the historical period covered by the work(s). Works and authors listed are not exhaustive. These are the major and most significant historians and chroniclers of the period.\n\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth is singled out from the list because, on the one hand, he was one of the most popular historians in England of this period. On the other hand, his \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" (\"History of the Kings of Britain\") was considered almost entirely fiction and was not considered authentic history by some other contemporary historians. \"Kings of Britain\" covers the legend of King Arthur as well as other Welsh legends of the early period of England, and was presented, and often accepted, as actual English history. It was extremely popular, but other contemporary historians, interested in impartiality and truth, were highly critical of Geoffrey. William of Newburgh devotes an extended section of the preface of \"Historia\" to discredit Geoffrey, saying at one point \"only a person ignorant of ancient history would have any doubt about how shamelessly and impudently he lies in almost everything\". The discussion over the historical basis for King Arthur continues to this day.\n\n\n"}

More specific articles are linked from the name of each palette, for the test charts, samples, simulated images, and further technical details (including references).\n\nIn the past, manufacturers have developed many different display systems in a competitive, non-collaborative basis (with a few exceptions, as the VESA consortium), creating many proprietary, non-standard different instances of display hardware. Often, as with early personal and home computers, a given machine employed its unique display subsystem, with its also unique color palette. Also, software developers had made use of the color abilities of distinct display systems in many different ways. The result is that there is no single common standard nomenclature or classification taxonomy which can encompass every computer color palette.\n\nIn order to organize the material, color palettes have been grouped following arbitrary but rational criteria. First, generic monochrome and full RGB repertories common to various computer display systems. Second, usual color repertories used for display systems that employ indexed color techniques. And finally, specific manufacturers' color palettes implemented in many representative early personal computers and videogame consoles of various brands.\n\nThe list for personal computer palettes is split into two categories: 8-bit and 16-bit machines. This is not intended as a true strict categorization of such machines, because mixed architectures also exist (16-bit processors with an 8-bit data bus or 32-bit processors with a 16-bit data bus, among others). The distinction is based more on broad 8-bit and 16-bit computer \"ages\" or \"generations\" (around 1975–1985 and 1985–1995, respectively) and their associated state of the art in color display capabilities.\n\nHere is the common color test chart and sample image used to render every palette in this series of articles:\n\nSee further details in the summary paragraph of the corresponding article.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, the term \"monochrome palette\" means a set of intensities for a monochrome display, and the term \"RGB palette\" is defined as the complete set of combinations a given RGB display can offer by mixing all the possible intensities of the red, green, and blue primaries available in its hardware.\n\nThese are generic complete repertories of colors to produce black and white and RGB color pictures by the display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertories have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component.\n\nFor specific hardware and different methods to produce colors than RGB, see the List of computer hardware palettes and the List of videogame consoles sections.\n\nFor various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit depth displays, see the List of software palettes section.\n\nSystems that use a 4-bit or 8-bit pixel depth can display up to 16 or 256 colors simultaneously. Many personal computers in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by software (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's color palette.\n\nUsual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commonly used with the 8 bpp palettes as \"master palettes\" or \"universal palettes\" (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses).\n\nThese are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such types of systems.\n\nIn early personal computers and terminals that offered color displays, some color palettes were chosen algorithmically to provide the most diverse set of colors for a given palette size, and others were chosen to assure the availability of certain colors. In many early home computers, especially when the palette choices were determined at the hardware level by resistor combinations, the palette was determined by the manufacturer.\n\nMany early models output composite video YPbPr colors. When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may not correspond with the value levels for the YPbPr values employed (most noticeable with NTSC TV color system).\n\nFor current RGB display systems for PC's (Super VGA, etc.), see the 16-bit RGB and 24-bit RGB for HighColor (\"thousands\") and TrueColor (\"millions of colors\") modes.\n\nFor video game consoles, see the List of videogame consoles section.\n\nFor every model, their main different graphical color modes are listed based exclusively in the way they handle colors on screen, not all their different screen modes.\n\nThe list is ordered roughly historically by video hardware, not grouped by branch. They are listed according to the original model of every system, which implies that enhanced versions, clones and compatibles also support the original palette.\n\nColor palettes of some of the most popular video game consoles. The criteria are the same as those of the List of computer hardware palettes section.\n\n"}

Since its inception, Mainly Mozart has added the works of other composers with an emphasis on those of the 18th and 19th centuries. Using the common language of music, Mainly Mozart has served as a regional resource by connecting communities in Southern California and Baja California to Mainly Mozart musicians, classical music, and stories behind the music.\n\nThe first Mainly Mozart Festival in June 1989 – a series of nine concerts—was performed on the outdoor stage of the Old Globe Theatre in Balboa Park. Over the ensuing years, Mainly Mozart has increased its overall annual concert performances staged at various venues. In June 2008, and just in time for the 20th anniversary of the Mainly Mozart Festival, Mainly Mozart will become the primary tenant of the restored 83-year-old, 1,300-seat Balboa Theatre in downtown San Diego. A $26-million renovation of the “jewel box” theatre has maintained its blend of Mediterranean, Moorish and Spanish Revival architectural styles. Since 1992, the Balboa Theatre has been on the National Register of Historic Places. San Diego’s Centre City Development Corporation funded the restoration.\n\nIn 1996, Mainly Mozart began producing the Spotlight Series featuring chamber music concerts during the winter and spring. The principal home of the series is The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, but facilities in the north San Diego County coastal community of Carlsbad, and the inland community of Rancho Santa Fe are also used.\n\nIn 1992 the Mainly Mozart Orchestra was invited to participate in the first Festival Internacional de Mozart in Baja California (now Mozart Binacional). This was also the year that Mainly Mozart established an educational component to bring music to students in low income or at risk neighborhoods in both San Diego County and Baja California. These programs are continually expanding and now reach over 60,000 students in both countries.\n\nThe lives and music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven are brought to school children through the Living Composers Series. These informative and entertaining half-hour assemblies engage students in interactive mini-plays set to the music of these master composers. Question and answer session rounds out the teaching session, and in-school materials are provided for both the pre- and post- performance educational activities.\n\nMainly Mozart also has been working to enrich the lives of economically disadvantaged families in Southeast San Diego through a partnership with the Jackie Robinson Family YMCA. Mainly Mozart's free ticket program has allowed hundreds of children to enjoy their very first concert experience at Copley Symphony Hall (home of the San Diego Symphony). In another outreach program, Mainly Mozart offers high school and college music students discounted concert tickets.\n\nMainly Mozart commissioned “The Amadeus Suite” in 1999. It was created by British jazz trumpeter Guy Barker, who based his composition on characters from Mozart operas. In 2006, the suite was expanded by Barker and was performed in San Diego during the Mainly Mozart-led year-long San Diego County-wide celebration of Mozart's 250th birthday (January 27, 1756). The celebration was coordinated with cultural officials in Austria.\n\nTo show its appreciation of its patron/donors, Mainly Mozart has presented a smaller, more intimate concert series known as Club Amadeus. The supporters hear chamber music in elegant private residences and other special venues throughout San Diego.\nOther annual funding for Mainly Mozart is provided, in part, by the City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture; the County of San Diego Community Enhancement program; the California Arts Council; the National Endowment for the Arts; and contributions from local businesses and foundations.\n\n"}

Esposito has published over a dozen cookbooks.\n\nShe was raised in Buffalo, New York. Her mother was a dietician.\n\nHer grandmothers, both professional chefs, moved to the United States from Italy in the 1890s. Her paternal grandmother, from Sicily, owned a butcher shop in Fairport, New York, and her maternal grandmother lived in Buffalo, where she owned a boarding house. The latter grandmother was from Naples, and continued the traditions of her Italian household within the boarding house. The boarding house was the only house in the neighborhood that had a bathtub, and on Friday nights she would offer neighbors a bath and dinner for a quarter. While her grandmothers provided traditional Italian food, Esposito desired to eat standard foods like other children: Wonder Bread and iceberg lettuce.\n\nEsposito, who never intended to pursue a career in cooking, learned to cook from her family. Her grandmothers made bread every day, with Esposito helping to make upwards of twenty loaves of bread a day, canning vegetables and fruits, and helping to prepare ingredients for meals. Eventually, Esposito attended college, where she would graduate with a teaching degree and become an elementary school teacher.\n\nIn 1979, her mother sent her a pasta maker, and despite a lack of interest in cooking as an adult, Esposito taught herself how to make pasta dough. The following year, she and her husband Guy visited Italy for the first time, visiting his cousins. While in Italy, Esposito started attending a cooking class.\n\nShe began learning the history of Italian cooking, region by region, and traveling to the country twice a year for cooking lessons. At the University of New Hampshire she took classes to learn how to speak Italian. By 1985, she had joined the history master's program at the university, writing her thesis about Italian Renaissance cooking.\n\nEsposito started teaching cooking through the University of New Hampshire's Division of Continuing Education. In the mid-1980s, she submitted a proposal for a cooking show to New Hampshire Public Television. The show was delayed production because of the small size of the television station; however, upon moving to a larger station, a pilot was taped. The pilot was a test to not only gauge viewer reception, but, to also see how Esposito would be on camera. On the hottest day of the year in the region, the television crew came to Esposito's home in Durham, New Hampshire, and the pilot was taped. Upon airing, the pilot received great reception and the longest-running television cooking show was born.\n\nEsposito has published over a dozen cooking books about Italian cooking and entertaining. Her 1997 book, \"What You Knead\", about breadmaking, was awarded best in category by the International Cookbook Revue and was named one of \"Food & Wine\" magazine's top cookbooks of 1997. She makes over forty public appearances a year nationally and has appeared on the \"Today Show\", \"Regis and Kathie Lee\", QVC, the Food Network, Martha Stewart Living Radio, and other programs. She contributed to \"The Huffington Post\" and \"New Hampshire Home\".\n\n\"Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito,\" is a thirty-minute cooking show produced for PBS by Esposito's own Mary Esposito Productions, and taped at New Hampshire Public Television. The show features Esposito's recipes and cooking tips, and visits from guest chefs. She also explores the history of Italian cooking and food. Through the show, Esposito seeks to help her viewers learn about new recipes that are \"doable, authentic, and good.\"\n\nWhen deciding what to feature on the show, Esposito has four standards: she must like to eat the food, the ingredients should be easy to find, the recipe should be something unique and new to the viewer, and should be manageable by the kitchen staff. Every episode has twenty volunteers who work on the show. An entire season of shows, generally about thirty-two episodes, can be taped within two weeks during the summer, with two to three shows being taped a day.\n\nAll of the food is made from scratch in the studio, with each dish being prepared in numerous batches and at different recipe stages. This allows Esposito to execute an entire recipe in a matter of minutes that might take hours to complete. All of the recipes are planned by Esposito and the kitchen staff. Volunteers gather all the pertinent ingredients from local markets and go to Boston for specialty foods if unavailable locally.\n\nRecipes are prepared the day of the show. \"Ciao Italia\" is not scripted. The studio set is loosely based on Esposito's home kitchen. The view out the window of the set is painted to appear as the view of the Oyster River, which is seen from her home kitchen. To prepare for shows, Esposito researches and tests recipes outside the studio.\n\nA scholarship foundation named after and maintained by Esposito awards scholarships for students seeking financial aid to study culinary arts. Esposito was awarded an honorary degree from St. Anselm College. She has received the Lifetime Achievement Award in the Culinary and Cultural Arts of Italy by the Order Sons of Italy in America. She is in the Hall of Fame for the Italian Trade Commission.\n\nOn June 2, 2013, a knighthood was bestowed upon her by the President of the Italian Republic under the title \"Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Stella d'Italia\" (Knight of the Order of the Star of Italy). She was one of 160 people worldwide to receive this honor in 2013, and the only American.\n\n"}
{"id": "39127991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39127991", "title": "Miscellany", "text": "Miscellany\n\nA miscellany is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors. Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a miscellany can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different forms. In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a \"selective\" and \"canonical\" view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise \"collectiveness\" and \"popularity\". Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:\nManuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published, before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles.\n\nThe broadest distinction is between manuscript and printed miscellanies. Manuscript miscellanies were carefully compiled by hand, but also circulated, consumed, and sometimes added to in this organic state – they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture. Printed miscellanies, which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were compiled by editors and published by booksellers in order to make a profit. While manuscript miscellanies were produced by a small coterie of writers, and so were constructed around their own personal tastes, printed miscellanies were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience, and bear the marks of commercially driven, money making, opportunistic endeavours.\n\nMulti-authored collections are known to exist in many forms – such as newspapers, magazines, or journals – and the act of commonplacing, of transcribing useful extracts and quotations from multiple sources is also well recorded. However, the formal production of \"literary\" miscellanies came into its established form in the 16th and 17th centuries, and reached a highpoint in the 18th century. Although literary miscellanies would often contain critical essays and extracts of prose or drama, their main focus was popular verse, often including songs. At this time poetry was still a dominant literary form, for both low and high literature, and its variety and accessibility further suited it to miscellaneous publication.\n\nMost medieval miscellanies include some religious texts, and many consist of nothing else. A few examples are given here to illustrate the range of material typically found. The Theological miscellany (British Library, MS Additional 43460) was made in late 8th century Italy with 202 folios of patristic writings in Latin. The 9th-century Irish Book of Armagh is also mostly in Latin but includes some of the earliest surviving Old Irish writing, as well as several texts on Saint Patrick, significant sections of the New Testament, and a 4th-century saint's \"Life\". The Nowell Codex (BL Cotton Vitellius A. xv, ignoring a later volume bound in with it) is an Old English manuscript of about 1000 to 1010. It is famous for the only text of \"Beowulf\" but also includes a life of Saint Christopher, \"Wonders of the East\" (a description of various far-off lands and their fantastic inhabitants), a translation of a \"Letter of Alexander to Aristotle\", and the poem \"Judith\" based on the Old Testament \"Book of Judith\". It is one of the four Old English Poetic Codices from which the bulk of surviving Old English poetry comes, all of which can be classed as miscellanies.\n\nThe \"Lacnunga\" is a 10th or 11th century miscellany in Old English, Latin and Old Irish, with health-related texts taking a wide range of approaches, from herbal medicine and other medical procedures, to prayers and charms. The lavishly illuminated late 13th century North French Hebrew Miscellany contains mostly biblical and liturgical texts, but also legal material, over 200 poems, and calendars. The large 9th-century Chinese text \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\", contains various Chinese and foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, and tales of the wondrous and mundane, as well as notes on such topics as medicinal herbs and tattoos. The \"Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608\", an oversized illustrated manuscript of 594 pages, depicts a wide range of subjects including herbal cures, biblical stories, a list of the mayors of London, proverbs, calendars, and embroidery patterns.\n\nVerse miscellanies are collections of poems or poetic extracts that vary in authorship, genre, and subject matter. The earlier tradition of manuscript verse continued to be produced in the 16th century and onwards, and many of these early examples are preserved in national, state, and university libraries, as well as in private collections. The Devonshire Manuscript is a verse miscellany that was produced in the 1530s and early 1540s, and contains a range of works, from original pieces and fragments to translations and medieval verse. Compiled by three eminent women, it is one of the first examples of men and women collaborating on a literary work.\nAlso prominent is the Arundel Harington manuscript, containing the writings of Sir Thomas Wyatt, Queen Elizabeth, and Sir Philip Sidney. Into the 17th century, the two Dalhousie Manuscripts are also of literary significance, as they contain the largest sustained contemporary collection of John Donne’s verse. Although fewer medieval verse miscellanies have been preserved, the Auchinleck Manuscript survives as a good example: it was produced in London in the 1330s and offers a rare snapshot of pre-Chaucerian Middle English poetry. However, most surviving manuscript verse miscellanies are from the 17th century:\n\nPrinted verse miscellanies arose in the latter half of the 16th century, during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603). One of the most influential English Renaissance verse miscellanies was Richard Tottel’s \"Songes and Sonettes\", now better known as \"Tottel's Miscellany\". First printed in 1557, it ran into nine further editions before 1587; it was not then printed again until the 18th century. Although few new miscellanies emerged during the insurrectionary years of James I and Charles I (1603–1649), there was a resurgence of interest during the Restoration period and 18th century, and the vast majority of printed verse miscellanies originate from this latter period.\n\nThe poetry in these miscellanies varied widely in genre, form, and subject, and would frequently include: love lyrics, pastorals, odes, ballads, songs, sonnets, satires, hymns, fables, panegyrics, parodies, epistles, elegies, epitaphs, and epigrams, as well as translations into English and prologues and epilogues from plays. The practice of attributing poems in miscellanies was equally varied: sometimes editors would carefully identify authors, but most often the miscellaneous form would allow them to disregard conventions of authorship. Often authors were indicated by a set of initials, a partial name, or by reference to a previous poem \"by the same hand\"; equally often there were anonymous or pseudonymous attributions, as well as misattributions to other authors – or even made-up or deceased persons. Within a miscellany, editors and booksellers would often exercise considerable freedom in reproducing, altering, and extracting texts. Due to early copyright laws, lesser-known authors would regularly play no part in the printing process, receive no remuneration or royalties, and their works could be freely redistributed (and sometimes even pirated) once in the public domain.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the miscellany was the customary mode through which popular verse and occasional poetry would be printed, circulated, and consumed. Michael F. Suarez, one of the leading authorities on miscellanies, states:\n\nIncluding songbooks, the \"New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature\" lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies which were printed between 1701 and 1800. Due to the sheer number and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations that can be made about them. From the polite (Allan Ramsay’s \"The Tea-Table Miscellany\", 1724–27) to the partly obscene (\"The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany\", 1731–33) the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader’s entertainment. However, they were also marketed with practical purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (\"Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse\", 1787), as repositories of useful information (\"A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose\", 1721–30), as elocutionary aids (William Enfield’s \"The Speaker\", 1774-1820), and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's \"The Art of English Poetry\", 1702–62).\n\nIn a competitive market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves with a wide range of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (\"The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy\", 1796), the medicinal (\"The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen\", 1730), the festive or feast (\"A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies\", 1746), the curious (\"A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies\", 1751–82), and the curatorial (\"The Foundling Hospital for Wit\", 1743–64).\n\nDespite these categorizations, miscellanies attempted to appeal to a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes. Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience, by nature of the variety of verse a much wider readership would have been possible. One-off, occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions, such as political pamphlets (\"Poems on Affairs of State\", 1689-1705), resort-based works (\"Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany\", 1712–40), local productions (\"The Yorkshire Garland\", 1788), and courtly, coterie or collegiate collections (Thomas Warton’s \"The Oxford Sausage: or select poetical pieces written by the most celebrated wits of the University of Oxford\", 1764-80).\n\nOften the commercial success of a miscellany would stimulate the publication of similarly titled, parasitic, and even entirely pirated works. Dublin booksellers, outside the jurisdiction of the Statute of Anne (1710) which had established copyright in England, could legally reproduce any popular miscellany that they thought would make a profit. Robert Dodsley’s hugely popular \"Collection of Poems by Several Hands\" (1748) was copied entirely by Dublin booksellers in 1751, though it also underwent other, more minor piracies in the English literary market – such as unauthorized continuations, supplements, or companion texts attempting to exploit the reputation of the original.\n\nAlthough poetry maintained cultural pre-eminence for most of the 18th century, it was at the same time retreating before the advance of prose, and particularly the rise of the novel, as the new dominant form of literary expression in the West. The decline of poetry as the most widely printed format is also partly technological. Lee Erickson argues:\n\nMiscellanies however remained popular throughout the 19th century, especially what came to be known as the “weekly news miscellany, which typically appeared at the weekend and featured not only a summary of the week’s intelligence but also a variety of instructive and entertaining matter”, in other words what we call today a magazine, but poetry was no longer privileged among these publications. Verse miscellanies slowly died out in the Victorian era, as literary miscellanies made possible the serial publication of novels, such as William Harrison Ainsworth’s \"Jack Sheppard\" (1839-40) or Charles Dickens’ \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1859) which was published in 31 weekly instalments in his literary periodical \"All the Year Round\". There were few, if any, miscellanies devoted to poetry. Instead, verse would be the minority of content, in order to provide variety from the extensive prose:\n\nIn the wake of collections such as Robert Anderson’s \"Works of the British Poets\" (thirteen vols., 1792-95) and Alexander Chalmers’ \"Works of the English Poets\" (twenty-one vols., 1810), anthologies were increasingly adopted for the publication of assorted poems. Barbara M. Benedict argues:\n\nPrinting technologies and the rise of the novel played an important role in reshaping the nature of miscellanies, as did changing ideas about the native literary canon. Attempts to construct a credible canon of English verse had been ongoing since the early 18th century, and with its success the place of poetry was determined by the advent of authoritative anthologies which claimed to represent the very best of the English poetic tradition.\n\nIn contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a canonical history of literature, miscellanies tend to reflect the dynamic literary culture of the time in which they were produced. As Michael F. Suarez states:\n\nThere are modifications to this definition, such as the argument that miscellanies could contain elements that might be considered anthological (the inclusion of classical literary pieces for example) or could be republished years later when their original contents had matured in literary value. Suarez also notes that eighteenth-century miscellanies often contained “extracts from a variety of single-author publications” and, furthermore, that “many miscellanies appropriated select pieces from earlier poetry collections, thus forming what were essentially anthologies of miscellanies.”\n\nIt is generally accepted that miscellanies offer insight into the popular taste of the moment, of what people read and how they read it; yet they also provide information about the aesthetic, social and economic concerns underlying the production and consumption of literature. Miscellanies were assembled, marketed and sold with a contemporary reading audience in mind, and reveal a dynamic between the taste which they played a part in shaping, and the preoccupations of the editors who complied and the publishers who sold them. Indeed, the range of price and format reveals the extent to which poetry was packaged and sold for different readerships. As Jennifer Batt argues:\n\nMiscellanies frequently placed emphasis on variety, novelty and fashionability, providing their readers with a range of different pieces by various writers, but also keeping them abreast of the newest developments in the literary market. They are a prime demonstration of early marketing and advertising techniques in literature.\n\nMiscellanies were an influential literary form at the time. From the beginning of the 18th century, verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors, past and present, and so played a part in the development of the concept of the English canon. These literary miscellanies might be sold as unique collections, arising from the combinations of writers in a small literary circle; or their function could attempt to be more national and historical, by representing the finest works of British poets to date. The multiple editions of the Dryden-Tonson \"Miscellany Poems\" (1684-1708) and the Swift-Pope \"Miscellanies\" (1727–32), as well as \"The Muses Library\" (1737) and \"The British Muse\" (1738), were from early on attempting to construct a notion of a national literary heritage. The revival of interest in English balladry is also largely due to miscellanies, most famously Thomas Percy’s \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry\" (1765). Miscellanies also played a part in the development of other literary forms, particularly the novel. Since so many collections included prose extracts alongside poetry, often from eighteenth-century novels such as Laurence Sterne’s \"Tristram Shandy\" (1759), it is arguable they aided the popularisation of novels. Leah Price’s \"The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel\" (2000), in particular, discusses the relationship between miscellanies and prose fiction in the latter half of the 18th century.\n\nBecause of the variety and novelty they emphasise, as well as the anonymity of authorship they could offer, miscellanies often enabled the inclusion and so expression of more submerged voices, such as those of women, and more marginal forms of writing, such as the comic, the curious, and the crude. As Dustin Griffin has noted:\n\nMany miscellanies contained exclusively the writing of women, most famously \"Poems by Eminent Ladies\" (1755) – a collection of verse by 18 women poets including Aphra Behn, Elizabeth Carter, Mary Leapor, Anne Finch, Katherine Philips, Margaret Cavendish, Mary Monck, Lady Mary Chudleigh, and Mary Barber – and recently critics have brought to light the ways in which such women made a key contribution to the miscellany culture of the 18th century. The \"Perdita Project\" provides the fullest evidence of women’s role in manuscript miscellanies in the period 1500-1700.\n\nMiscellanies also presented themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role, by preserving unbound sheets, fragments and ephemera which otherwise would have been lost – and thus offering a unique insight into the vibrant literary life of the 18th century. A prime example of such curiosity-shop publications is \"The fugitive miscellany: a collection of fugitive pieces in prose and verse\" (1774), which includes nonsense rhymes, epitaphs, inscriptions, poems made out of newspaper cuttings, as well as wills written in verse. Late twentieth-century criticism has drawn attention to the cultural and literary importance of these non-canonical, lesser-known and ephemeral kinds of popular verse – such as the recent discovery of a poem spuriously attributed to John Milton, “An Extempore upon a Faggot”. As the most prolific source of anonymous or pseudonymous publication, miscellanies provide insight into the unconventional history of English literature. Roger Lonsdale notes in his influential anthology, \"The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse\" (1984): “One of the most interesting poets [from this period] is the ubiquitous ‘Anonymous’, whose voice almost never registers in conventional literary history”. Crucially, he suggests that we would know more about “the landscape of eighteenth-century poetry” if more attention was paid to “the innumerable miscellanies by several hands”.\n\nIt is now widely accepted by literary critics that paying attention to forms of access to literature, and to the reception history of individual works and authors, is an important part of the history of literary culture. In this context, the miscellany has grown rapidly in interest in eighteenth-century studies. As Jennifer Batt states:\n\nIn light of such developments there have arisen projects attempting to make the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently through the process of online digitization. In 2012 \"Verse Miscellanies Online\" was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse miscellanies published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse miscellanies, others have attempted to arrange a corpus of miscellanies produced in set periods, such as \"Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online\" (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been \"The Digital Miscellanies Index\", an ongoing project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The \"Index\" seeks to create a freely available online database of the 1000-plus verse miscellanies published in the 18th century, based on a comprehensive bibliography compiled by Michael F. Suarez, and supplied by the world’s single largest collection of miscellanies held in The Bodleian Library’s Harding Collection. Begun in 2010, this project was successfully completed in September 2013. The database is currently available in a beta version.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The residential school offers training in Indian classical dance forms, Odissi, Mohiniattam, Kathak, Bharatnatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali and Manipuri, eight hours a day, six days a week for seven years, following the ancient Guru-shishya tradition. Designed by famous Indian architect Gerard da Cunha, the community is situated near Hesaraghatta Lake 30 km from Bengaluru. Today the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble has performed across India and in many countries abroad.\n\nThe word Nrityagram, literally translated, means \"dance village,\" and in founder, Protima Gauri's own words,\n\nProtima left Mumbai in 1989 to start the dance village, the land was given on lease by state government and by 1990 the institution had taken root, inaugurated on 11 May 1990, by the then Prime Minister, V.P. Singh. Being designed by the well- reputed Indian architect Gerard da Cunha, the building started coming up soon after, following the vernacular architecture of the region. The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble made its New York debut in 1996 and received rave reviews.\n\nLynne Fernandez a Delhi-based theatre actress and light designer, first came to Nrityagram in December 1995 to coordinate Surupa Sen's debut and the Nrityagram ensemble's trip abroad and after Protima suffered a mild heart attack, Lynn became actively involved managing the institution, as Protima gradually withdrew. Eventually Protima formally handed over Nrityagram to Lynne Fernandez on 10 July 1997, who became the Managing Trustee of the institution. Subsequently, in August, Protima Gauri set off on her pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar and it was there that she died in the Malpa landslide, near Pithoragarh on the night of 18 August 1997. Since then, Nrityagram has grown in its stature by leaps and bounds and is known today for some of the best ensemble work in. Perfection in dance along with a high level of good technical support, leading to a complete presentation, is its trademark. Even today, gurus and students work in the fields within the Nrityagram, which has 10 acres of land, and grow their own food. Over the years, only Odissi gurukul has been functional due to paucity of funds.\nSurupa Sen who first came as a student, debuted in 1995, later became artistic director of Nrityagram in 1997, and remains to date. Orissa Dance Academy (ODA) student Bijayini Satpathy who was first student of Nrityagram, is now in charge of the Odissi gurukul. Some of Nrityagram's few but meritorious students include, Pavithra Reddy, who has had her solo debut in 2003 and who will be hopefully seen in some solo pieces on a wider platform very soon. She has spent almost 12 years as a residential student at Nrityagram, and has learnt under the tutelage of Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy. Ayona Bhaduri and Priyambada Patnaik are also students at this gurukul. They both joined Nrityagram in 1998 and have been a part of the ensemble since 2001.\nVasanta Habba, a cultural event organised by Nrityagram is known as the classical Woodstock of India, first started in 1994 by Protima, held on first Saturday of February every year, and soon it became the famous annual night-long festival of arts that had 40,000 visitors when it was last held in 2004. When the 2004 tsunami struck, the subsequent 2005 event was cancelled, and community hasn't been able to regroup since, though it hopes to restart it in 2011.\nA 30-minute documentary on the dance village, \"Nrityagram: For the Love of Dance,\" directed and produced by Nan Melville was premiered at the annual Dance on Camera Festival, in New York City on 25 January 2010 to which dance critic Alastair Macaulay of the \"New York Times\" responded, ..\"much of the dance footage, not least during the closing credits, is spellbinding. I wanted the film to be twice as long.\" \n\nThe 1996 New York debut of the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble, with Surupa Sen, Bijayini Satpathy, Anitha Nair, Pavithra Reddy and Jaya Mukherjee was called, \"one of the most luminous dance events of the year\" by Jennifer Dunning, the dance critic of the \"New York Times\". After its New York debut, the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble has performed to sold-out shows in Hawai and Bozeman, USA, Middle East, Far East and Europe, and in time created a niche for itself in the world of dance. Today, apart from lead dancer-choreographers, Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy, Pavitra Reddy, Rasmi Raj and Manasi Tripathy are the other permanent dancers of the Ensemble, and are accompanied by musicians like Swain playing the percussion instrument, \"Mardala\", Srinibas Satapathy’s on Bamboo flute (Bansuri) and Sanjib Kumar Kunda on the violin. Its first full-length production \"Sri - In Search of the Goddess\", was premiered in Delhi in 2001 and in the United States in 2002-2003, to critical acclaim. Since then it created several productions including, \"Ansh\", \"Sacred Space\" (2005), and \"Separation and the Duality of the human spirit\" (2008) \n\nBy 2008, the ensemble had made 12 tours of the US, its 2006 production, \"Vibhakta\" (The Division), by Surupa Sen which was performed together by Surupa Sen, the artistic director, and Bijayini Satpathy was listed in \"The Ten Best Dance Performances of 2008\" by dance critic Joan Acocella of \"The New Yorker\". and prior to it in February 2008, the Ensemble had the world premiere of \"\"Pratima\": Reflection\", at New York City, Joyce Theater. It has also performed at Pittsburgh Dance Council (2002). As of 2010, the ensemble members included, Surupa Sen, Bijayini Satpathy, Pavithra Reddy, Rasmi Raj and Manasi Tripathy.\n\nA thoughtfully evolved temple (\"pictured\"), built in 1998, welcomes people to the Nrityagram, near Hesaraghatta Lake, it depicts the image of Kelucharan Mohapatra, guru of founder Protima Bedi in a dancing pose. The caption given for the picture states: \n\"Temple at Nrityagram. Fashioned from the raw mud of Nrityagram and fired after it was built, the temple is dedicated to space.

The Kangra style reached its pinnacle with paintings of Radha and Krishna, inspired by Jayadev's Gita Govinda.\n\nPahari painting grew out of the Mughal painting, though this was patronized mostly by the Rajput kings who ruled many parts of the region, and gave birth to a new idiom in Indian painting.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During his long career, English film director Ridley Scott has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, fell in development hell or are officially canceled.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, before the beginning of the filming of \"The Duellists\", Scott pitched the idea of a film adaptation of medieval romantic legend of \"Tristan and Iseult\", and he planned to release this film as his second movie. However, the project never materialized at the time, and Scott pitched the idea of \"Legend\" during the filming of \"The Duellists\" as a replacement of this project. The film, Tristan & Isolde, was finally released in 2006 with Kevin Reynolds as the director and with Scott as the producer.\n\nAround 1981, Scott was hired to direct a film adaptation of Frank Herbert's novel \"Dune\". However, Scott was finally replaced by David Lynch, and the film was released in 1984.\n\nIn February 1994, Scott signed a deal with 20th Century Fox to direct a film adaptation of Richard Preston's article \"Crisis in the Hot Zone\". In late April 1994, Robert Redford and Jodie Foster were in talks for star in the film. However, the project was finally shut down due to many production problems and Foster's departure from it.\n\nOn July 2, 1997, \"Variety\" reported that Scott had signed a contract with Warner Bros. to direct the third film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend\". Arnold Schwarzenegger was attached to portray Dr. Robert Neville and Mark Protosevich was attached to write the film, but the project was finally cancelled due to budgetary concerns on March 16, 1998. It was subsequently revived and in 2007 the film was released with Francis Lawrence as director and with Will Smith in the lead role.\n\nIn an interview on January 23, 2002, Scott expressed his desire to make a fifth installment in the \"Alien\" franchise. He stated that the fifth film would explain the Aliens' origins and where they were discovered. James Cameron was attached to return as writer and producer. However, the project was finally shelved by 20th Century Fox (since they thought that they would ruin the franchise with a fifth film) due to the production of the spin-off \"Prometheus\", and \"Alien vs. Predator\" was released in 2004 instead, as the first installment of the \"Alien vs. Predator\" spin-off franchise.\n\nOn September 11, 2003, Scott expressed interest in direct the planned sequel to his successful \"Gladiator\" film. In 2006, Rotten Tomatoes reported that Scott and Russell Crowe stated that they wanted to hire Nick Cave for rewrite the sequel's script. However, at the end, Cave's script was rejected and Scott and Crowe cancelled plans for a sequel in 2009. \n\nOn May 10, 2004, Scott revealed his intentions to make, along with screenwriter William Monahan and producer Scott Rudin, a film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's acclaimed novel \"Blood Meridian\", a project that had tried to be filmed in the past by various other filmmakers, like screenwriter Steve Tesich and actor Tommy Lee Jones. Paramount Pictures was set to develop the feature, and in June 2008, during an interview with \"Eclypse Magazine\", Scott stated that the script was written, but it contained much violence. However, on August 17, 2008, Rudin stated that Scott and Monahan had left the project and that director Todd Field would direct it instead than Scott.\n\nIn 2006, Rotten Tomatoes reported plans for a \"Gladiator\" spin-off. DreamWorks had approached Scott with the intentions of producing a spin-off with Lucius Verus as the main character. However, after the cancellation of \"Gladiator 2\", any further proposals for a sequel or spin-off were quickly abandoned.\n\nIn the 2000s, Scott mooted a sequel to 1982's \"Blade Runner\" under the title \"Metropolis\".\n\nOn June 4, 2009,\"The New York Times\" revealed that Scott along with his now-deceased brother Tony Scott were working on a webseries inspired by \"Blade Runner\" with episodes of 5 or 10 minutes, that, according to Ridley, it could have also been transmitted on television. In February 2010, it was reported that the production of the series was cancelled due to funding problems.\n\nOn April 4, 2010, Scott revealed his hopes of making a sequel to \"Robin Hood\" and more films after that. On May 13, 2010, Russell Crowe expressed his desire to reprise his role as Robin Longstride/Robin Hood. However, plans for the sequel fell in development hell, with anticipation of an update being made after this announcement.\n\nOn March 12, 2013, Tubefilter reported that Scott would work with Machinima in the production of twelve science fiction short films. However, on November 21 of that year, Scott reported that the Sci-Fi shorts project was canceled due the end of the deal.\n"}

Freud believed that humans are born with unfocused sexual libidinal drives, and therefore argued that homosexuality might be a deviation from this. Nevertheless, he also felt that certain deeply rooted forms of homosexuality were difficult or impossible to change.\n\nFreud's most important articles on homosexuality were written between 1905, when he published \"Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality\", and 1922, when he published \"Certain Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia, and Homosexuality\". Freud believed that all humans were bisexual, by which he primarily meant that everyone incorporates aspects of both sexes, and that everyone is sexually attracted to both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also mentally and psychologically. Heterosexuality and homosexuality both developed from this original bisexual disposition. As one of the causes of homosexuality, Freud mentions the distressing heterosexual experience: \"Those cases are of particular interest in which the libido changes over to an inverted sexual object after a distressing experience with a normal one.\"\n\nFreud appears to have been undecided whether or not homosexuality was pathological, expressing different views on this issue at different times and places in his work. Freud frequently called homosexuality an \"inversion\", something which in his view was distinct from the necessarily pathological perversions, and suggested that several distinct kinds might exist, cautioning that his conclusions about it were based on a small and not necessarily representative sample of patients.\n\nFreud derived much of his information on homosexuality from psychiatrists and sexologists such as Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Magnus Hirschfeld, and was also influenced by Eugen Steinach, a Viennese endocrinologist who transplanted testicles from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation. Freud stated that Steinach's research had \"thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of homoeroticism\", but cautioned that it was premature to expect that the operations he performed would make possible a therapy that could be generally applied. In his view, such transplant operations would be effective in changing sexual orientation only in cases in which homosexuality was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of the opposite sex, and probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism. In fact Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the immune systems of his patients rejected the transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.\n\nFreud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper \"The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman,\" which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a lesbian. Her father hoped that psychoanalysis would cure her lesbianism, but in Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which the woman entered therapy, and because the homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and therefore possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that \"in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse.\" Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible rather than eliminating homosexual feelings.\n\nFreud believed that homosexuals could seldom be convinced that sex with someone of the opposite sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from sex with someone of the same sex. Patients often had only superficial reasons to want to become heterosexual, pursuing treatment due to social disapproval, which was not a strong enough motive for change. Some patients might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only so that they could convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality afterwards. Freud, therefore, told the parents only that he was prepared to study their daughter to determine what effects therapy might have. Freud concluded that he was probably dealing with a case of biologically innate homosexuality, and eventually broke off the treatment because of what he saw as his patient's hostility to men.\n\nIn 1935, Freud wrote to a mother who had asked him to treat her son's homosexuality, a letter that would later become famous:\n\n"}
{"id": "28901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28901", "title": "Symmetric group", "text": "Symmetric group\n\nIn abstract algebra, the symmetric group defined over any set is the group whose elements are all the bijections from the set to itself, and whose group operation is the composition of functions. In particular, the finite symmetric group S defined over a finite set of \"n\" symbols consists of the permutation operations that can be performed on the \"n\" symbols. Since there are \"n\"! (\"n\" factorial) possible permutation operations that can be performed on a tuple composed of \"n\" symbols, it follows that the number of elements (the order) of the symmetric group S is \"n\"!.\n\nAlthough symmetric groups can be defined on infinite sets, this article focuses on the finite symmetric groups: their applications, their elements, their conjugacy classes, a finite presentation, their subgroups, their automorphism groups, and their representation theory. For the remainder of this article, \"symmetric group\" will mean a symmetric group on a finite set.\n\nThe symmetric group is important to diverse areas of mathematics such as Galois theory, invariant theory, the representation theory of Lie groups, and combinatorics. Cayley's theorem states that every group \"G\" is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on \"G\".\n\nThe symmetric group on a finite set \"X\" is the group whose elements are all bijective functions from \"X\" to \"X\" and whose group operation is that of function composition. For finite sets, \"permutations\" and \"bijective functions\" refer to the same operation, namely rearrangement. The symmetric group of degree \"n\" is the symmetric group on the set \n\nThe symmetric group on a set \"X\" is denoted in various ways including S, 𝔖, Σ, \"X\"! and Sym(\"X\"). If \"X\" is the set then the symmetric group on \"X\" is also denoted S, 𝔖, Σ, and Sym(\"n\").\n\nSymmetric groups on infinite sets behave quite differently from symmetric groups on finite sets, and are discussed in , , and .\n\nThe symmetric group on a set of \"n\" elements has order \"n\"! (the factorial of \"n\"). It is abelian if and only if \"n\" is less than or equal to 2. For and (the empty set and the singleton set), the symmetric group is trivial (it has order ). The group S is solvable if and only if . This is an essential part of the proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem that shows that for every there are polynomials of degree \"n\" which are not solvable by radicals, that is, the solutions cannot be expressed by performing a finite number of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and root extraction on the polynomial's coefficients.\n\nThe symmetric group on a set of size \"n\" is the Galois group of the general polynomial of degree \"n\" and plays an important role in Galois theory. In invariant theory, the symmetric group acts on the variables of a multi-variate function, and the functions left invariant are the so-called symmetric functions. In the representation theory of Lie groups, the representation theory of the symmetric group plays a fundamental role through the ideas of Schur functors. In the theory of Coxeter groups, the symmetric group is the Coxeter group of type A and occurs as the Weyl group of the general linear group. In combinatorics, the symmetric groups, their elements (permutations), and their representations provide a rich source of problems involving Young tableaux, plactic monoids, and the Bruhat order. Subgroups of symmetric groups are called permutation groups and are widely studied because of their importance in understanding group actions, homogeneous spaces, and automorphism groups of graphs, such as the Higman–Sims group and the Higman–Sims graph.\n\nThe elements of the symmetric group on a set \"X\" are the permutations of \"X\".\n\nThe group operation in a symmetric group is function composition, denoted by the symbol ∘ or simply by juxtaposition of the permutations. The composition of permutations \"f\" and \"g\", pronounced \"\"f\" of \"g\"\", maps any element \"x\" of \"X\" to \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")). Concretely, let (see permutation for an explanation of notation):\n\nApplying \"f\" after \"g\" maps 1 first to 2 and then 2 to itself; 2 to 5 and then to 4; 3 to 4 and then to 5, and so on. So composing \"f\" and \"g\" gives\n\nA cycle of length , taken to the \"k\"-th power, will decompose into \"k\" cycles of length \"m\": For example, (, ),\n\nTo check that the symmetric group on a set \"X\" is indeed a group, it is necessary to verify the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.\n\nA transposition is a permutation which exchanges two elements and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions; for instance, the permutation \"g\" from above can be written as \"g\" = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since \"g\" can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an odd permutation, whereas \"f\" is an even permutation.\n\nThe representation of a permutation as a product of transpositions is not unique; however, the number of transpositions needed to represent a given permutation is either always even or always odd. There are several short proofs of the invariance of this parity of a permutation.\n\nThe product of two even permutations is even, the product of two odd permutations is even, and all other products are odd. Thus we can define the sign of a permutation:\n\nWith this definition,\nis a group homomorphism ({+1, –1} is a group under multiplication, where +1 is e, the neutral element). The kernel of this homomorphism, that is, the set of all even permutations, is called the alternating group A. It is a normal subgroup of S, and for it has elements. The group S is the semidirect product of A and any subgroup generated by a single transposition.\n\nFurthermore, every permutation can be written as a product of \"adjacent transpositions\", that is, transpositions of the form . For instance, the permutation \"g\" from above can also be written as . The sorting algorithm bubble sort is an application of this fact. The representation of a permutation as a product of adjacent transpositions is also not unique.\n\nA cycle of \"length\" \"k\" is a permutation \"f\" for which there exists an element \"x\" in {1...,\"n\"} such that \"x\", \"f\"(\"x\"), \"f\"(\"x\"), ..., \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\" are the only elements moved by \"f\"; it is required that since with the element \"x\" itself would not be moved either. The permutation \"h\" defined by\n\nis a cycle of length three, since , and , leaving 2 and 5 untouched. We denote such a cycle by , but it could equally well be written or by starting at a different point. The order of a cycle is equal to its length. Cycles of length two are transpositions. Two cycles are \"disjoint\" if they move disjoint subsets of elements. Disjoint cycles commute: for example, in S there is the equality . Every element of S can be written as a product of disjoint cycles; this representation is unique up to the order of the factors, and the freedom present in representing each individual cycle by choosing its starting point.\n\nCycles admit the following conjugation property with any permutation formula_8, this property is often used to obtain its Generators and relations.\n\nCertain elements of the symmetric group of {1, 2, ..., \"n\"} are of particular interest (these can be generalized to the symmetric group of any finite totally ordered set, but not to that of an unordered set).\n\nThe is the one given by:\nThis is the unique maximal element with respect to the Bruhat order and the\nlongest element in the symmetric group with respect to generating set consisting of the adjacent transpositions , .\n\nThis is an involution, and consists of formula_11 (non-adjacent) transpositions\n\nso it thus has sign:\n\nwhich is 4-periodic in \"n\".\n\nIn S, the \"perfect shuffle\" is the permutation that splits the set into 2 piles and interleaves them. Its sign is also formula_15\n\nNote that the reverse on \"n\" elements and perfect shuffle on 2\"n\" elements have the same sign; these are important to the classification of Clifford algebras, which are 8-periodic.\n\nThe conjugacy classes of S correspond to the cycle structures of permutations; that is, two elements of S are conjugate in S if and only if they consist of the same number of disjoint cycles of the same lengths. For instance, in S, (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) are conjugate; (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 2)(4 5) are not. A conjugating element of S can be constructed in \"two line notation\" by placing the \"cycle notations\" of the two conjugate permutations on top of one another. Continuing the previous example:\n\nwhich can be written as the product of cycles, namely: (2 4).\n\nThis permutation then relates (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) via conjugation, that is,\n\nIt is clear that such a permutation is not unique.\n\nThe low-degree symmetric groups have simpler and exceptional structure, and often must be treated separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than the trivial map and the sign map , the most notable homomorphisms between symmetric groups, in order of relative dimension, are:\nThere are also a host of other homomorphisms where .\n\nSymmetric groups are Coxeter groups and reflection groups. They can be realized as a group of reflections with respect to hyperplanes . Braid groups B admit symmetric groups S as quotient groups.\n\nCayley's theorem states that every group \"G\" is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of \"G\", as a group acts on itself faithfully by (left or right) multiplication.\n\nFor , the alternating group A is simple, and the induced quotient is the sign map: which is split by taking a transposition of two elements. Thus S is the semidirect product , and has no other proper normal subgroups, as they would intersect A in either the identity (and thus themselves be the identity or a 2-element group, which is not normal), or in A (and thus themselves be A or S).\n\nS acts on its subgroup A by conjugation, and for , S is the full automorphism group of A: Aut(A) ≅ S. Conjugation by even elements are inner automorphisms of A while the outer automorphism of A of order 2 corresponds to conjugation by an odd element. For , there is an exceptional outer automorphism of A so S is not the full automorphism group of A.\n\nConversely, for , S has no outer automorphisms, and for it has no center, so for it is a complete group, as discussed in automorphism group, below.\n\nFor , S is an almost simple group, as it lies between the simple group A and its group of automorphisms.\n\nformula_18 can be embedded into formula_19 by appending the transposition formula_20 to all odd permutations, while embedding into formula_21 is impossible for formula_22.\n\nThe symmetric group on \"n\"-letters, S, may be described as follows. It has generators: formula_23 and relations:\n\nOne thinks of formula_27 as swapping the \"i\"th and position.\n\nOther popular generating sets include the set of transpositions that swap 1 and \"i\" for and a set containing any \"n\"-cycle and a 2-cycle of adjacent elements in the \"n\"-cycle.\n\nA subgroup of a symmetric group is called a permutation group.\n\nThe normal subgroups of the finite symmetric groups are well understood. If , S has at most 2 elements, and so has no nontrivial proper subgroups. The alternating group of degree \"n\" is always a normal subgroup, a proper one for and nontrivial for ; for it is in fact the only non-identity proper normal subgroup of S, except when where there is one additional such normal subgroup, which is isomorphic to the Klein four group.\n\nThe symmetric group on an infinite set does not have an associated alternating group: not all elements can be written as a (finite) product of transpositions. However it does contain a normal subgroup \"S\" of permutations that fix all but finitely many elements, and such permutations can be classified as either even or odd. The even elements of \"S\" form the alternating subgroup \"A\" of \"S\", and since \"A\" is even a characteristic subgroup of \"S\", it is also a normal subgroup of the full symmetric group of the infinite set. The groups \"A\" and \"S\" are the only non-identity proper normal subgroups of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set. For more details see or .\n\nThe maximal subgroups of the finite symmetric groups fall into three classes: the intransitive, the imprimitive, and the primitive. The intransitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form for . The imprimitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form Sym(\"k\") wr Sym(\"n\"/\"k\") where is a proper divisor of \"n\" and \"wr\" denotes the wreath product acting imprimitively. The primitive maximal subgroups are more difficult to identify, but with the assistance of the O'Nan–Scott theorem and the classification of finite simple groups, gave a fairly satisfactory description of the maximal subgroups of this type according to .\n\nThe Sylow subgroups of the symmetric groups are important examples of \"p\"-groups. They are more easily described in special cases first:\n\nThe Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"p\" are just the cyclic subgroups generated by \"p\"-cycles. There are such subgroups simply by counting generators. The normalizer therefore has order \"p\"·(\"p\"−1) and is known as a Frobenius group (especially for ), and is the affine general linear group, .\n\nThe Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"p\" are the wreath product of two cyclic groups of order \"p\". For instance, when \"p\" = 3, a Sylow 3-subgroup of Sym(9) is generated by \"a\" = (1 4 7)(2 5 8)(3 6 9) and the elements \"x\" = (1 2 3), \"y\" = (4 5 6), \"z\" = (7 8 9), and every element of the Sylow 3-subgroup has the form \"a\"\"x\"\"y\"\"z\" for 0 ≤ \"i\",\"j\",\"k\",\"l\" ≤ 2.\n\nThe Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"p\" are sometimes denoted W(\"n\"), and using this notation one has that is the wreath product of W(\"n\") and W(1).\n\nIn general, the Sylow \"p\"-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree \"n\" are a direct product of \"a\" copies of W(\"i\"), where 0 ≤ \"a\" ≤ \"p\" − 1 and \"n\" = \"a\" + \"p\"·\"a\" + ... + \"p\"·\"a\" (the base \"p\" expansion of \"n\").\n\nFor instance, W(1) = C and W(2) = D, the dihedral group of order 8, and so a Sylow 2-subgroup of the symmetric group of degree 7 is generated by { (1,3)(2,4), (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) } and is isomorphic to D × C.\n\nThese calculations are attributed to and described in more detail in . Note however that attributes the result to an 1844 work of Cauchy, and mentions that it is even covered in textbook form in .\n\nA transitive subgroup of S is a subgroup whose action on {1, 2, ..., \"n\"} is transitive. For example, the Galois group of a (finite) Galois extension is a transitive subgroup of S, for some \"n\".\n\nFor , S is a complete group: its center and outer automorphism group are both trivial.\n\nFor , the automorphism group is trivial, but S is not trivial: it is isomorphic to C, which is abelian, and hence the center is the whole group.\n\nFor , it has an outer automorphism of order 2: , and the automorphism group is a semidirect product\n\nIn fact, for any set \"X\" of cardinality other than 6, every automorphism of the symmetric group on \"X\" is inner, a result first due to according to .\n\nThe group homology of S is quite regular and stabilizes: the first homology (concretely, the abelianization) is:\n\nThe first homology group is the abelianization, and corresponds to the sign map S → S which is the abelianization for \"n\" ≥ 2; for \"n\" < 2 the symmetric group is trivial. This homology is easily computed as follows: S is generated by involutions (2-cycles, which have order 2), so the only non-trivial maps are to S and all involutions are conjugate, hence map to the same element in the abelianization (since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups). Thus the only possible maps send an involution to 1 (the trivial map) or to −1 (the sign map). One must also show that the sign map is well-defined, but assuming that, this gives the first homology of S.\n\nThe second homology (concretely, the Schur multiplier) is:\nThis was computed in , and corresponds to the double cover of the symmetric group, 2 · S.\n\nNote that the exceptional low-dimensional homology of the alternating group (formula_31 corresponding to non-trivial abelianization, and formula_32 due to the exceptional 3-fold cover) does not change the homology of the symmetric group; the alternating group phenomena do yield symmetric group phenomena – the map formula_33 extends to formula_34 and the triple covers of A and A extend to triple covers of S and S – but these are not \"homological\" – the map formula_35 does not change the abelianization of S, and the triple covers do not correspond to homology either.\n\nThe homology \"stabilizes\" in the sense of stable homotopy theory: there is an inclusion map , and for fixed \"k\", the induced map on homology is an isomorphism for sufficiently high \"n\". This is analogous to the homology of families Lie groups stabilizing.\n\nThe homology of the infinite symmetric group is computed in , with the cohomology algebra forming a Hopf algebra.\n\nThe representation theory of the symmetric group is a particular case of the representation theory of finite groups, for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from symmetric function theory to problems of quantum mechanics for a number of identical particles.\n\nThe symmetric group S has order \"n\"<nowiki>!</nowiki>. Its conjugacy classes are labeled by partitions of \"n\". Therefore, according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent irreducible representations, over the complex numbers, is equal to the number of partitions of \"n\". Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representation by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of \"n\" or equivalently Young diagrams of size \"n\".\n\nEach such irreducible representation can be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the Young symmetrizers acting on a space generated by the Young tableaux of shape given by the Young diagram.\n\nOver other fields the situation can become much more complicated. If the field \"K\" has characteristic equal to zero or greater than \"n\" then by Maschke's theorem the group algebra \"K\"S is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).\n\nHowever, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called \"Specht modules\", and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.\n\nThe determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.\n\n\n"}

Enslaving Trixie in his desert hideaway, Denton turns his back on \"white civilization.\" He hates all white men and women and assumes the leadership of a band of Indian and Mexican bandits.\n\nTwo years later, a wagon-train of Mississippi farmers who are lost and dying in the desert appeal to Denton for help. He refuses to assist them. He is secretly visited that night by Mary Jane Garth (played by Love), an innocent and virtuous young woman among the migrants who bravely confronts the Indians and Mexicans.\n\nShe pleads their cause and expresses her belief that no white man would refuse to protect a woman in distress. Deeply moved, Denton is redeemed. He guides the wagon-train out of the desert and then resumes his wanderings.\n\n\nHart was given a screenplay by the screenwriter C. Gardner Sullivan in which the hero had, according to Hart, \"no motive for his hardness.\" He argued that the audience needed an explanation. Sullivan preferred the idea that his ruthless personality was simply a given, but eventually accepted Hart's wishes. \n\nHart wanted Mae Marsh for the role as Mary Jane, but Marsh was working on a D. W. Griffith movie at the time. Griffith recommended a new actress, Bessie Love.\n\nThe movie was made at the height of Hart's career, but was unusual because he played a ruthless individual described as \"hard as flint.\" As the title suggests, the movie draws on racial ideologies of the era. Hart stated that the central character, Steve Denton, was \"a white man, who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them.\"\n\nHart believed this movie to be \"one of the best westerns ever made.\"\n\n"}

It was executed by an unknown Dutch artist who resided at the Paston family residence at Oxnead Hall near Aylsham in Norfolk for approximately 3 months, in order to complete the commission.\n\nThe objects were collected by Robert and his father, Sir William Paston (c.1610–1663) who made acquisitions on a long journey travelling through Europe and on to Cairo and Jerusalem. The collection consisted of over 200 objects and included many natural curiosities made into decorative art objects, such as mounted seashells and ostrich eggs. The painting was unknown for centuries, and before it was donated to the Norwich Castle Museum in 1947, its last owner warned that it was \"very faded, of no artistic value, only curious from an archaeological pint of view.\" It is now on display, with the strombus shell in an enamelled mount, as part of the Norwich Castle Museum Collection.\n\nThe importance of \"The Paston Treasure\" lies in the international scope and interest of the objects portrayed, reflecting both exotic nature and the skills of man.

Lyotard introduced the term 'postmodernism', which was previously only used by art critics, into philosophy and social sciences, with the following observation: \"Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives\". Originally written as a report on the influence of technology in exact sciences, commissioned by the \"Conseil des universités du Québec\", \"The Postmodern Condition\" was influential. Lyotard later admitted that he had a \"less than limited\" knowledge of the science he was to write about, deeming \"The Postmodern Condition\" his worst book.\n\nLyotard criticizes metanarratives such as reductionism and teleological notions of human history such as those of the Enlightenment and Marxism, arguing that they have become untenable because of technological progress in the areas of communication, mass media and computer science. Techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine translation show a shift to linguistic and symbolic production as central elements of the postindustrial economy and the related postmodern culture, which had risen at the end of the 1950s after the reconstruction of western Europe. The result is a plurality of language-games (a term coined by Ludwig Wittgenstein), of different types of argument. At the same time, the goal of truth in science is replaced by \"performativity\" and efficiency in the service of capital or the state, and science produces paradoxical results such as chaos theory, all of which undermine science's grand narrative. Lyotard professes a preference for this plurality of small narratives that compete with each other, replacing the totalitarianism of grand narratives.\n\n\"The Postmodern Condition\" was influential. However, Lyotard later admitted that he had a \"less than limited\" knowledge of the science he wrote about, and to compensate for this knowledge, he \"made stories up\" and referred to a number of books that he hadn't actually read. In retrospect, he called it \"a parody\" and \"simply the worst of all my books\". Poet Frederick Turner writes that, like many post-structuralist works, \"The Postmodern Condition\" \"has not worn well.\" However, he sees it more readable than other post-structuralist works, and credits Lyotard with covering \"a good deal of ground in a lively and economical fashion.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "39457781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39457781", "title": "Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape", "text": "Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\n\nBaigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique (also called \"Bathers: Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" and \"Bañistas: dos desnudos en un paisaje exótico\") is an oil painting created circa 1905-06 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). \"Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" is a Proto-Cubist work executed in a highly personal Divisionist style during the height of the Fauve period. The painting is now in the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, Spain ().\n\n\"Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 116 x 88.8 cm (45 3/8 by 35 in), signed \"Metzinger\" (lower right). The work—consistent in style with other works by Metzinger created circa 1905-1906, such as \"Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)\"—represents two nude women, one seen from the rear and the other from a more frontal position, in a lush, tropical, or subtropical setting. The landscape contains a wide variety of exotic geometrized elements (trees, bushes, flowers, a lake or river, a mountain range and a partly cloudy sky). Metzinger's use of color in \"Two Nudes\" is extremely Fauve; quasi-pure reds, greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups as if randomly.\n\nWhile the two nudes are treated with rather natural colors, the rest of the canvas appears treated with more artificial tints, tones, hues and shades. Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck or Kees van Dongen, Metzinger's composition is strongly Cézannian. The vertical format and light colors of the sky and treatment of foreground and background elements create a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of Georges Seurat, or Paul Cézanne's 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence. However, the brushstrokes and overall appearance are not at all Cézannian in nature.\n\nBy 1905 Neo-Impressionism had witnessed a major resurgence, with recent exhibitions by Maximilien Luce (, March 1904), Paul Signac (Galerie Druet, December 1904), Georges Seurat (Salon des Indépendants, 1905), Henri-Edmond Cross (Galerie Druet, March–April 1905). Metzinger's unique style of Neo-Impressionism resulted from the unification of several influences in addition to that of Seurat and Cézanne; that of Vincent van Gogh, with his heavy impasto, dense brushstrokes; and—following posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906—that of Paul Gauguin, with its exotic sumptuousness and sensuality. By this time Metzinger had already developed a full-fledged Divisionist facture with large, bold mosaic-like brushwork, beyond that of Cross or Signac.\n\nIn statement made circa 1907 regarding his mosaic-like Divisionism—where both size and direction of his cubes of color are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting—Metzinger cites parallels with Neo-Impressionism painters and Symbolist literature:\n\n\"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature.\" (Metzinger, 1907)\n\nThis statement seems to relate directly to \"Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" as well as other works of the same period such as \"La Danse (Bacchante)\", and \"Coucher de soleil no. 1\" (ca.1906)\n\nThe vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's Paysage au disque (1906–1907), \"is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...\" (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo)\n\nEach individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger would soon describe as the 'total image'.\n\nThe bilateral symmetry inherent in \"Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" is striking (even if only as an approximation). The proto-Cubist geometry is solidly constructed but the equilibrium is unstable or short-lived. Each tile of pigment juxtaposed one next to the other form a section of the painting: each section of the painting containing between 10 of 50 'tiles' dominated by blues, reds, and greens. There is no smooth transition between each section. The painting is divided, fragmented, splintered or faceted into series, not only of individual rectangles, squares or 'cubes' of color, but into individual planes or surfaces delineated by color and form, already pointing towards Cubism.\n\nThat is not say that \"Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" belongs analytic or synthetic Cubism. It does not. The subject is viewed from one point of view, not several. There is no true 'mobile perspective', anymore than in the works of Cézanne or Seurat. But a departure from nature it was, and a departure from all that had been painted to date it was too; a precursor in style, certainly, one that would resurface in the works of Metzinger and others (Gino Severini, Robert Delaunay, Piet Mondrian) several years later, within the context of Cubism.\n\n\"Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape\" signified more that just the incorporation of a radical geometry that would free Metzinger and others from the confines of nature as any artwork executed in Europe to date. This indeed was Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism, albeit in a highly altered form. Beyond the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory, \"Two Nudes\" surpassed the teachings of Cross or Signac. It contained \"iridescences\", in Metzinger's terms, certain \"aspects of color still foreign to painting\". It contained a \"chromatic versification\", as if for syllables. The rhythm of its pictorial phraseology translated the diverse emotions aroused by nature. It no longer represented nature as seen, but was a complete byproduct of the human 'sensation.'\n\nArt critic Louis Chassevent, writing about the 1906 Salon des Indépendants, used the word \"cube\" with reference to Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay, two and a half years before similar references would be made by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize the Proto-Cubist or Cubist works Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque. Recognizing the difference between Metzinger and his contemporaries Louis Chassevent wrote in 1906: \n\nThe following year Metzinger and Delaunay shared an exhibition at Berthe Weill's gallery (1907). They were singled out by Louis Vauxcelles as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.\n\nOne and a half years later, November 1908, Vauxcelles, in his brief review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery, called Braque a daring man who despises form, \"reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.\n\n\n Lot Notes:\nThe present work is one of a small number of Metzinger compositions fusing a broad, divisionist facture with a fauve palette. This group, which includes the celebrated \"Paysage coloré aux oiseaux exotiques\" (Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), represented the artist's response to the Salon d'Automne of 1905, a review of which saw Louis Vauxcelles coin the term 'Fauve' to describe the circle of artists using bright colour and broad brushstrokes. While on this occasion Metzinger did not exhibit with Matisse, Braque and Vlaminck, since 1904 he had shown alongside these artists who were gaining notoriety as Fauves, notably at the Salons des Indépendants.<br><br>\nIn the departure from the Neo-Impressionist manner of Metzinger's early years, \"Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique\" substitutes the exuberant palette and broader handling of his peers. In both composition and facture though, the work retains a rather more rigorous structure than other Fauve landscapes of the period. It's arcadian subject and a mosaic-like application of paint give a uniquely individual flavour to what Metzinger termed his 'chromatic poetry'.\n\n\n"}
