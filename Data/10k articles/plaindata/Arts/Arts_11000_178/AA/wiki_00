In 1852 he embarked on a journey to Kraków (then in the Austrian Partition) to attend classes at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts. He studied under Władysław Łuszczkiewicz and Wojciech Kornel Stattler. In 1855–1858 he went to the Academy in Vienna and studied under Karl von Blaas and Christian Ruben. While in Austria, he travelled to Munich, Venice and to Hungary, where he met his biggest future sponsor and benefactor, Count Aleksander Pappenheim. He returned to Poland in 1865 upon the collapse of the January Uprising.\n\nFor a time, Grottger moved between the estates of Polish art lovers in Podolia, among others in Manor House of Stanisław Tarnowski in Śniatynka, there he painted numerous paintings for the cycle \"Lithuania\". In 1866 he met his fiancée Wanda Monné, a young Polish patriot; and spent a lot of time at her house. However, he also developed tuberculosis. In 1867 he went to Paris hoping to make more money; visited Hôtel Lambert, and met with Jean-Léon Gérôme. His illness was getting worse and worse. He went to a sanatorium at Amélie-les-Bains-Palalda in the Pyrénées, where he died on 13 December 1867. His body was brought back to Poland by his fiancée and buried at the Lwów Cemetery on 4 July 1868.\n\nGrottger painted mostly epic battle scenes, portraits, and horses. He produced some of his most famous paintings while in Vienna. During his stay in occupied Poland, he poured all of his talent and energy into depicting the hopes and horrors of the failed Polish insurrections in several series of black-and-while pannels including \"Warszawa\", \"Polonia\", \"Lithuania\" and \"Wojna\" (1863–1867) which brought him no income. The series titled \"Polonia\" included eight boards, depicting the grim realities of everyday life and struggle under Russian occupation. \"Polonia\" was a response to the failed insurrection of 1863–65. His last painting was his self-portrait.\n\nIn 1908, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, whose own father had been caught up in the insurrection and had been arrested, completed his \"magnum opus\", the Symphony in B minor \"Polonia, which was inspired by Grottger's series of paintings.\n\n\n"}

Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, and Charles Rice-Gonzales, a writer, activist, and publicist. The Academy was first located in a community center before renting space in the historic American Bank Note Company Printing Plant in the Hunts Point neighborhood of the South Bronx and was home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company focusing on works exploring the margins of Latino and LGBTQ cultures. The programs at BAAD! were made up of dancers, LGBTQ visual artists, women, and artists of color.\n\nArtists began presenting work in the space and hosting annual arts festivals such as \"BAAD!

Influenced by literary realism and the naturalist movements in literature and theatre, \"chanson réaliste\" dealt with the lives of Paris's poor and working-class.\n\n\"Chanson réaliste\" was a musical style that was mainly performed by women; some of the more commonly known performers of the genre include Édith Piaf and Fréhel.\n\n\"Chanson réaliste\" grew out of the \"cafés-concerts\" and cabarets of the Montmartre district of Paris during the 1880s. Home to such theatrical landmarks as the Moulin Rouge, and Le Chat Noir, Montmartre became a centre for hedonistic and brazen entertainment from the late 19th century to the early 20th century.\n\nAlthough the \"chanson réaliste\" was a musical genre dominated by female vocalists, one of its earliest performers—and credited by some as \"the creator\" or \"the father\" of genre—was cabaret singer and comedian Aristide Bruant. Bruant began a career at Le Chat Noir in 1885 and his vaudeville-inspired mix of song, satire and entertainment became very popular with the bourgeoisie slumming in the poorer Montmartre district. His compositions were also different in that they included the everyday language and slang used by the commoners.\n\nBorrowing elements of the \"comédie en vaudeville\", the \"chanteuses réalistes\" (realist singers [female]) often wore black dresses, red lipstick and white face makeup—their faces highlighted with stark lighting, set against a modest, almost bare backdrop—all done to draw audiences' attention to the singers' emotive facial expressions.\n\nIn contrast to the picturesque \"chanson\" which was popular in post-World War II France—with its songs of love, cobbled Parisian streets, and the sound of the accordion—the \"chanteuses réalistes\" sang songs of loss, hopelessness and abandonment; their songs dealt with life in the poorer Parisian faubourgs, and the thugs, pimps, prostitutes, and orphans who called them home; its themes of poverty and the criminal underworld, as well as its sociopolitical commentary, were influenced by the works of such literary realists and naturalist writers as Émile Zola, Jean Richepin and Paul Bourget.\n\nThe \"chanson réaliste\" sentimentalised the plight of poor and dispossessed women, such as prostitutes, waitresses, failed singers in cheap bars, orphans, single mothers and the like. Some of the performers of the genre were also known to have lived the part—both Édith Piaf and Fréhel sang in the streets as children, were teenage mothers and lost their children very young—and many shortened their lives with drugs, alcohol and illness: Yvonne George lived an excessive lifestyle and died at the age of 34; Fréhel became an alcoholic at an early age, attempted suicide at 19 and eventually died in poverty; Piaf suffered from addictions to morphine and alcohol and died of cancer.\n\nHowever, given the dramatic and melancholy aspects of \"chanson réaliste\", the withered and diseased aspect of their appearance became an integral part of the show. Piaf, for example, was known for her waif-like stage presence and became tightly identified with her role; she was, however, critical of the style:\n\nAnother common theme of the \"chanson réaliste\" was motherhood, particularly the mother-son relationship; such songs were a speciality of the singer Berthe Sylva, whose songs dealt with such topics as dying mothers, mothers worrying about their sons at war, sons placing flowers on a mother's grave, and songs about the mundane experiences of a bored housewife.\n\nOther women known for performing in the \"chanson réaliste\" style include:\n\n"}
{"id": "1662092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1662092", "title": "Craftivism", "text": "Craftivism\n\nCraftivism is a form of activism, typically incorporating elements of anti-capitalism, environmentalism, solidarity, or third-wave feminism, that is centered on practices of craft - or what can traditionally be referred to as \"domestic arts\". Craftivism includes, but is not limited to, various forms of needlework including yarn-bombing or cross-stitch. Craftivism is a social process of collective empowerment, action, expression and negotiation. In craftivism, engaging in the social, performative and critical discourse around the work is central to its production and dissemination. Practitioners are known as craftivists.\n\nThe term craftivism was coined in 2003 by writer Betsy Greer in order to join the separate spheres of craft and activism. Her favorite self-created definition of the term states, \"craftivism is a way of looking at life where voicing opinions through creativity makes your voice stronger, your compassion deeper & your quest for justice more infinite\"\n\nAlthough the term craftivism is a recent addition to crafting lexicon, the use of craft as a subversive tactic can be found throughout history. First, the word craft is often associated with trickery. To call someone crafty is to identify them as clever and cunning In Greek, one would say to \"spin\" a plot. Similarly, the French word for trick is tricoter, which means to tie or knot together. In the novel \"A Tale of Two Cities\", the character Madame Defarge, a worker for the French Revolution, secretly encodes the names of those soon to be executed in her knitting.\n\nCraftivism identifies strongly with feminist movements. Craftivism is often interpreted as having emerged from third-wave feminism but feminist activism and craft were unified beforehand.\n\nPractices of craft or \"domestic arts\" have traditionally existed and been organized spatially within the private sphere. Therefore, the labor and production of craft was generally interpreted as unproductive female labor in the home, as it was never integrated into profit-making systems. Rather, it was marginalized and undervalued. As a result, women's significant and creative work in the private sphere—clothing the family, knitting blankets, weaving the loom—did not receive the same respect as male-dominated activity in the public realm. Furthermore, the patriarchy has been successful in claiming these domestic values for women and using it as a way to keep women in subservient roles. The rise of consumer-friendly crafts, including kits, transfers and readymade designs, has further diminished the status of craft and women's amateur practices. Women and craft have been excluded from the fine art world and as a result many women put their creativity towards craft practices. Craft was \"a universal female art from transcending race, class, and national borders. Needlework is the one art in which women controlled the education of their daughters and the production of art, and were also the critics and audience.\" Although practices of craft were spatially organized within the private sphere, women occasionally would organize groups to engage in these practices collectively. In these craft circles or meet ups women would not only share patterns and skills but also engage in conversation about their lives in the private sphere. These groups of women would discuss their lives and personal struggles encountered as women. This type of group discussion is a form of activism rooted in Consciousness raising that was key to Second-wave feminism as it helped to raise awareness about the types of oppression women were experiencing in their everyday lives.\n\nThe Anti Capitalist, Anti Sweatshop and DIY movements popularized practices of craft for activism. These movements influenced third-wave feminists to adopt a craftivism ethos. Most forms of craftivism identify strongly with third-wave feminism. Third-wave feminist crafters are attempting to subvert the association of craft with domesticity by embracing domestic arts while identifying as feminists who are making the choice to embrace this new domesticity. Third-wave feminists are reclaiming knitting, sewing, and other crafting activities traditionally feminized and associated with the private sphere. Through this reclamation, contemporary women aim to reconnect with the female-dominated art forms, to legitimatize the importance of undervalued craft, and to show that 21st century women have the privilege to express themselves through craft, with fewer constraints exercised by the patriarchy. This act of resistance and shattering of the public/private binary is expressed physically through public knitting and craft circles who take a private-sphere activity and insert themselves in the male-dominated spaces of the city One example would be the Anarchist Knitting Mob who held a \"Massive Knit\" event in Washington Square Park to honour the death of activist and urbanist Jane Jacobs. Knitters decorated the trees, benches, and light posts with colourful yarn and unique patterns.\nSarah Corbett, founder of Craftivist Collective, encourages craftivists to set up private and public what she coined 'stitch-in' workshops.\n\nWomen’s craft has often been undervalued or ignored in the art world. Women’s craft is considered belonging to a lesser cultural sphere and categorized under such terms as ‘applied’, ‘decorative’ or ‘lesser’ than other art forms such as painting or sculpture. This critique of women’s craft and craftivism as a ‘lesser’ art form has been contested within the discourse of feminism. Some Feminist Art discourse excludes craftivism. This feminist intervention into the art world perpetuates a hierarchy of art where craft is a lower art form. Some feminists deem craftivism as reinforcing domesticity and consider it a retrogression of the feminist cause rather than a subversive tactic.\n\nCraftivism is also centered on ideas of environmentalism and sustainability. When buying new materials, many craftivists choose organic fabrics and fairly traded products such as home-spun yarns. Yet, even more popular within the movement is the utilization of vintage, thrifted and repurposed goods in order to minimize waste and promote reuse. This display of resourcefulness acknowledges the finite resources on Earth, and the valorization of quality over quantity. Craftivist, Betsy Greer, is quoted saying, \"While I think that crafting has become something fairly elite and cliquish in some areas, at its heart, it is very much made for individuals who value both their time and their money\".\n\nHistorically, craft was the pre-capitalist form of production, where each created item possessed a \"use-value,\" a term comparing the usefulness of an item to the exchange equivalent. Now within a capitalist system of mass production, craft has become a commodity to be bought and sold for money, where it is now referred to as having an \"exchange-value\". Due to this movement from use-value to exchange-value, there is less emphasis on the time and skill expended to create an object, and more importance on making it available to the masses as inexpensively as possible. Traditionally associated with a strong community so vital to the creation and distribution of craft, crafting has since lost its use-value and has been \"captured by capital\".\n\nA popular way to resist the commoditization of craft is through the Do-It-Yourself or DIY movement. Popularized through \"zines\" of the 1990s, DIY inspires people to be self-sufficient and to rely less on the market for basic necessities that can easily be created on one's own. DIY is a resistance to both the capitalist nature of the fashion industry and pressures to conform and buy a style. An example of this is the Counterfeit Crochet Project, which seeks to \"debase and defile designer items one step at a time\". Crafters have also subverted the market through the use of open source patterns and information sharing on the internet. Sites like Burdastyle allow crafters to upload and download sewing projects at no charge. Similarly, Cat Mazza's online software KnitPro allows users to download images into detailed knitting patterns at no charge.\n\nEfforts within the craftivist movement against capitalism focus primarily on the international issue of sweatshops. Some craftivists believe that either sewing one's own clothing or buying only hand-made is the best way to protest unfair labor practices around the globe. Other craftivists take the issue even further, using the act of crafting as a protest against sweatshops. Artist and activist Cat Mazza created a campaign against the inhumane labor practices of Nike through the creation of a giant blanket depicting Nike's trademark swoosh. From 2003-2008, international crafters were asked to mail in 4x4 inch stitched squares to border the blanket and to sign a petition against Nike. Mazza also created a second web-based software called Knitoscope that transforms video into animated knitted stitches. Each video has a corresponding testimony featuring various professionals who work against sweatshop labor.\n\nArtist and Activist Kirsty Robertson feels that the subversive efforts of craftivists against capitalism are limited by their dependency on the internet and new communication. She points out that for this reason, global justice knitters are not completely removed from the economy themselves \n\nSome craftivists see their art form as a protest against war and violence. Anti-war craftivists choose to make their statement by juxtaposing a colorful, soft, and fuzzy yarn with cold and dangerous weapons. In 2006, Danish artist Marianne Jorgensen stitched a giant pink \"tank blanket\" and placed it over a M24 Chafee combat tank to protest the Iraq war. She has been making these blankets since Denmark entered the Iraq War, and doesn't plan to stop until it is over. She writes on her website that, \"Unsimilar to a war, knitting signals home, care, closeness and time for reflection...When [the tank] is covered in pink, it becomes completely unarmed and it loses its authority\". Much like Jorgensen, Canadian artist Barb Hunt works to question the acceptance of military logic in society by creating knitted antipersonnel land mines out of wool.\n\nSimilar to her campaign against Nike, Cat Mazza started an anti-war effort entitled \"Stitch for Senate\" on the fourth anniversary of the Iraq War. She enlisted two people from each state to knit a soldier's helmet liner which would be sent on to every senator. Unlike the apolitical Operation Home Front efforts that knitted gear for soldiers, Mazza wanted \"to start a dialogue about the war and to get politicians to keep the promises they made during the midterm elections\".\n\nThe Viral Knitting Project is an anti-war effort that translates the 0/1 binary code of the dangerous Code Red computer virus into a knitting pattern of knit/purl. The color and code relate to the anti-terrorism alerts of post 9/11 United States. The project is attempting to \"draw together links between technology, culture, capitalism and war\".\n\nThe Craftivist Collective, founded by Sarah Corbett, is an activist social enterprise which uses craftivism to engage people in social justice issues and solidarity movements. There is a manifesto and a checklist of goals for the work of the group which includes being welcoming, encouraging and positive, creative and non-threatening, and focusing on global poverty and human rights injustices.\n\nOne of the Craftivist Collective's key achievements was to convince the M&S board to pay their 50,000 employees the living wage in 2015..\nThis campaign was awarded with the Economic Justice Campaigner of the year 2017 by Sheila McKechnie Foundation, and was nominated for the 2017 Care2 UK Impact Award. \n\nOn the back of this award, Sarah Corbett continues to work with large charities to deliver strategic craftivism projects and teach them in the art of gentle protest.\n\nAustralian artist Sayraphim Lothian uses craftivism to \"make people's day brighter\". She leaves small handcrafted works of art on the streets for people to find and take home “aimed at creating tiny bubbles of joy in the lives of passersby, tiny surreal moments that might make people do a double take.\".\n\nWhen craftivists take to the street, they utilize various protest models.\n\nA popular form of protest is the \"knit-in,\" where knitters infiltrate a public space and knit. They might ride a subway, occupy a civic building, or sit in a park. They use the knit-in to draw attention to their issue of concern. The Revolutionary Knitting Circle of Calgary, Canada stage a knit-in in front of Calgary's financial office buildings during the summit of the G-8 nations in 2002. The Knit-in not only provides an opportunity to protest against injustice, but also allows for a running discussion about social issues between the stationary knitters. Jack Bratich of Rutgers University argues that, \"Knitting in public also creates a gendered question of space. It rips open the enclosure of the domestic space to public consumption, exposing productive work that has contributed to women's invisible and unpaid labor\". Women are, thereby, able to gain power from an activity that previously symbolized their repression.\n\nCraftivist Carrie Reichardt has covered her home, car and studio with mosaics which utilizes ceramics, screen-printing and transfers to highlight \"plight of inmates on death row, the Black Panthers, and the spirituality of the planet.\"\n\nAnother form of craft-themed activism is guerilla art. The Texas-based group Knitta places street art such as street pole cozies and antenna warmers in cities throughout the country. Similarly, a blogger in England, Sarah Corbett, \"creates textile art with political messages in public spaces first by herself at a blog called 'a lonely craftivist' and then as the head of the worldwide Craftivist Collective.\n\nVolunteers for Postcards To Voters often create their own hand-decorated postcards to send to potential voters ahead of elections in hopes of increasing turnout. The work can be done solo, but is often done at \"postcarding parties\" at a volunteer's home or a cafe.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, an online debate began over the definition of craftivism. The debate spread after the self-titled Craftivism team on Etsy had an inner-group argument about the political affiliation of its members, causing some members to leave the group. \nThe original description of the group states, \"The Etsy Craftivism Team is a team of progressive Etsyans who believe that craft and art can change the world. Some of us use our work to carry messages of protest and political activism. Others believe that the act of making craft can be an act of resistance. Still others see that by buying and selling directly from the maker we are challenging the all pervasive corporate culture that promotes profit over people.\"\nConservative members accused the group of assuming a liberal agenda, and argued that politics should not be involved. Some members of the group felt that the mere act of crafting itself was political, while others felt that the act must also be attached to a political message. Rayna Fahey from Radical Cross Stitch replied to a thread stating \"Personally if a John McCain supporter joined this group and told me that my latest piece in support of indigenous sovereignty was a well-made piece that serves the purpose for which it was designed well, I'd think that was awesome and I'd have hope for the future of this world.\" In contrast, craftivist Betsy Greer believes that \"the personal is political,\" and that you cannot separate the two.\n\n"}

The stone was found in Eassie burn in the late 18th century and now resides in a purpose-built perspex building in the ruined Eassie church.\n\nThe cross slab is housed in a purpose-built shelter with see-through walls within the roofless shell of the old Eassie parish church, on the north side A94 road some west of Glamis and east of Meigle.\n\nThe stone is a cross-slab high and wide, tapering to at the top, and is thick. The slab is carved on both faces in relief and, as it bears Pictish symbols, it falls into John Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a class II stone.\n\nThe cross face bears a cross with circular rings in its angles, surrounding a circular central boss decorated with a keywork design. The arms and shaft are decorated with a variety of complex interlaced knotwork designs. The upper quadrants held a pair of angels, but have suffered some damage, the right-hand figure being almost completely lost. A similar four-winged angel can be found on the nearby Glamis 2 stone. The lower left-hand quadrant shows a cloaked warrior armed with a small square buckler and spear, and the lower right-hand quadrant depicts a stag and hunting hounds.\n\nThe rear face of the slab bears a mixture of figural representations and Pictish symbols. At the top of the face is a damaged Pictish beast over a double disc and Z-rod. Below this is a trio of cloaked figures, and to the right is a figure standing in front of a potted tree, which historian Lloyd Laing has interpreted as having human heads suspended from its branches. Below this lie heavily weathered horseshoe and Pictish beast symbols. The bottom of the face holds representations of cattle that have suffered some weathering.\n\nThe cross-slab was found in the bed of the Eassie Burn, near Eassie Church by Rev. Cordiner, c. 1786. From there it was moved to the churchyard, where it stood for over a century, until the 1960s when a purpose built building with viewing windows was built for it within the structure of the ruined church. The church itself was probably built in the 16th century on the site of an earlier building that was dedicated in 1246 by Bishop David of St Andrews. In 1309 it was granted to Newbattle Abbey. Although there are elements of the original, much of it seems to have been rebuilt in the late 1500s. In 1600 the parish of Eassie was combined with a neighbouring parish.

After spending some time studying in Athens, he went to Paris where he befriended the French artist, Gustave Courbet, who stimulated his interest in painting directly from nature. In 1869, he was awarded a prize at the Salon.\n\nAs a result of his legal studies, he also served as Romanian consul general in Budapest (1879), Istanbul (1882), and Odessa (1883-1888). While in Odessa, he became acquainted with Ivan Aivazovsky, who helped him develop his interest in marine painting. In 1889, he held his first major exhibition at a salon held in the new Romanian Athenaeum.\n\nAlthough he was lauded as Romania's best maritime artist by Nicolae Iorga, he also painted portraits and genre works, as well as historical and biblical scenes. An important aspect of his career is that he was financially independent, so his painting always remained a hobby, even when he participated in decorating churches, such as the Cathedral of Saint Charalambos in Turnu Măgurele and the Church of Saint Nicholas in Bucharest. He was also one of the founders of the School of Decorative Arts at the Bucharest National University of Arts.\n\nIn 2011, Poșta Română issued a series of four commemorative stamps honoring Romanian artists, and one of Voinescu's paintings was chosen for the 2.10 Lei denomination.\n\n"}

{"id": "579468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=579468", "title": "Flower power", "text": "Flower power\n\nFlower power was a slogan used during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a symbol of passive resistance and non-violence ideology. It is rooted in the opposition movement to the Vietnam War. The expression was coined by the American Beat poet Allen Ginsberg in 1965 as a means to transform war protests into peaceful affirmative spectacles. Hippies embraced the symbolism by dressing in clothing with embroidered flowers and vibrant colors, wearing flowers in their hair, and distributing flowers to the public, becoming known as flower children. The term later became generalized as a modern reference to the hippie movement and the so-called counterculture of drugs, psychedelic music, psychedelic art and social permissiveness.\n\nFlower Power originated in Berkeley, California, as a symbolic action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled \"How to Make a March/Spectacle\", Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with \"masses of flowers\" to hand out to policemen, press, politicians and spectators. The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of street theater thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests. In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the \"specter\" of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the University of California, Berkeley. Using Ginsberg's methods, the protest received positive attention and the use of \"flower power\" became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.\n\nBy late 1966, the Flower Power method of guerilla theater had spread from California to other parts of the United States. The Bread and Puppet Theater in New York City staged numerous protests which included handing out balloons and flowers with their anti-war literature. \"Workshop in Nonviolence\" (WIN), a magazine published by New York activists, encouraged the use of Flower Power. In May 1967, Abbie Hoffman organized the Flower Brigade as an official contingent of a New York City parade honoring the soldiers in Vietnam. News coverage captured Flower Brigade participants, who carried flowers, flags and pink posters imprinted with LOVE, being attacked and beaten by bystanders. In response to the violence, Hoffman wrote in WIN magazine, \"Plans are being made to mine the East River with daffodils. Dandelion chains are being wrapped around induction centers... The cry of 'Flower Power' echoes through the land. We shall not wilt.\"\n\nOn the following Sunday in May 1967, WIN activists declared the Armed Forces Day as \"Flower Power Day\" and held a rally in Central Park to counter the traditional parade. Turnout was low and, according to Hoffman, the rally was ineffective because guerilla theater needed to be more confrontational.\n\nIn October 1967, Hoffman and Jerry Rubin helped organize the March on the Pentagon using Flower Power concepts to create a theatrical spectacle. The idea included a call for marchers to attempt to levitate the Pentagon. When the marchers faced off against more than 2500 Army national guard troops forming a human barricade in front of the Pentagon, demonstrators held flowers and some placed flowers in the soldier's rifle barrels.\nPhotographs of flower-wielding protesters at the Pentagon March became seminal images of the 1960s anti-war protests. by French photojournalist Marc Riboud that was printed throughout the world was of seventeen-year-old high school student Jan Rose Kasmir clasping a daisy and gazing at bayonet-wielding soldiers. Smithsonian Magazine later called it \"a gauzy juxtaposition of armed force and flower child innocence\".\n\nOne photo, titled \"Flower Power\" by Washington Star photographer Bernie Boston, was nominated for the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. The photo, taken on October 21, 1967, shows a young, long-haired man in a turtleneck sweater, placing carnations into the rifle barrels of military policemen. (The young man in the photo is most commonly identified as George Edgerly Harris III, an 18-year-old actor from New York who later performed in San Francisco under the stage name of Hibiscus. The young man also has been identified by Paul Krassner as Youth International Party organizer, \"Super-Joel\" Tornabene.)\n\nThe iconic center of the Flower Power movement was the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco, California. By the mid-1960s, the area, marked by the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets, had become a focal point for psychedelic rock music. Musicians and bands like Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin all lived a short distance from the famous intersection. During the 1967 Summer of Love, thousands of hippies gathered there, popularized by hit songs such as \"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\". A July 7, 1967, \"Time\" magazine cover story on \"The Hippies: Philosophy of a Subculture\" and an August CBS News television report on \"The Hippie Temptation\", as well as other major media interest, exposed the hippie subculture to national attention and popularized the Flower Power movement across the country and around the world. That same summer, the Beatles' hit single \"All You Need Is Love\" served as an anthem for the movement. On 25 June, the Beatles performed the song on the \"Our World\" international satellite broadcast, ensuring that the pacifist message reached an audience estimated at 400 million.\n\nThe avant-garde art of Milton Glaser, Heinz Edelmann, and Peter Max became synonymous with the flower power generation. Edelman's illustration style was best known in his art designs for the Beatles' 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\". Glaser, the founder of Push Pin Studios, also developed the loose psychedelic graphic design, seen for example in his seminal 1966 poster illustration of Bob Dylan with paisley hair. It was the posters by pop artist Peter Max, with their vivid fluid designs painted in Day-Glo colors, which became visual icons of flower power. Max's cover story in \"Life\" magazine (September 1969) as well as appearances on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", further established \"flower power\" style art into mainstream culture.\n\n\n"}

According to Smith, the key emphasis in such work is the importance of \"form\" and \"flatness\". The term was soon applied also in architecture (e.g. Frank Lloyd Wright and Walter Gropius) and sculpture (e.g. Epstein and Brâncuși).\n\nAfter 1960, Modernism was displaced by Postmodernism, and then by the art still at present referred to as \"contemporary art\". Since Modernism is no longer \"modern\", Smith argues that it requires a more appropriate period style name to distinguish it: hence his introduction of Formalesque. Like \"romanesque\" and \"arabesque\", the name is intended to indicate a style that arose by the development of a basic interest in form (but without the specific connotations of the term Formalism).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3121161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3121161", "title": "Goodbye Uncle Tom", "text": "Goodbye Uncle Tom\n\nGoodbye Uncle Tom () is a 1971 Italian mondo film documentary film co-directed and co-written by Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi with music by Riz Ortolani. The film is based on true events in which the filmmakers explore antebellum America, using period documents to examine in graphic detail the racist ideology and degrading conditions faced by Africans under slavery. Because of the use of published documents and materials from the public record, the film labels itself a documentary, though all footage is re-staged using actors.\n\nThe film was shot primarily in Haiti, where directors Jacopetti and Prosperi were treated as guests of Haitian dictator Papa Doc Duvalier. Duvalier supported the filmmakers by giving them diplomatic cars, clearance to film anywhere on the island, as many extras as they required, and even a nightly dinner with Duvalier himself. Hundreds of Haitian extras participated in the film's various depictions of the cruel treatment of slaves, as well as white actors portraying historical characters (including Harriet Beecher Stowe).\n\nThe film was confiscated in Italy and re-released the following year, 1972, in a cut version bearing the different title \"Zio Tom\".\n\nIn Frande, the film was released as \"Les negrières\", in Germany as \"Addio, Onkel Tom!\"\n\nThe directors' cut of \"Addio Zio Tom\" draws parallels between the horrors of slavery and the rise of the Black Power Movement, represented by Eldridge Cleaver, LeRoi Jones, Stokely Carmichael, and a few others. The film ends with an unidentified man's fantasy re-enactment of William Styron's \"The Confessions of Nat Turner.\" This man imagines Nat Turner's revolt in the present, including the brutal murder of the whites around him, who replace the figures Turner talks about in Styron's novel as the unidentified reader speculates about Turner's motivations and ultimate efficacy in changing the conditions he rebelled against. American distributors felt that such scenes were too incendiary, and forced Jacopetti and Prosperi to remove more than thirteen minutes of footage explicitly concerned with racial politics for American and other Anglophone audiences.\n\nThe film has frequently been criticized as racist, despite directors Jacopetti and Prosperi's claims to the contrary. In Roger Ebert's 1972 review of the shorter American version, he asserts that the directors have \"Made the most disgusting, contemptuous insult to decency ever to masquerade as a documentary.\" He goes on to call the film \"Cruel exploitation\", suggesting that the directors degraded the black actors playing slaves by having them enact the extremely dehumanizing situations the film depicts. Critic Pauline Kael called the film \"the most specific and rabid incitement to race war\", a view shared by white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who claimed the film was a Jewish conspiracy to incite blacks to violence against whites.\n\nThe directors denied charges of racism; in the 2003 documentary \"Godfathers of Mondo\" they specifically note that one of their intentions in making \"Addio Zio Tom\" was to \"make a new film that would be clearly anti-racist\" in response to criticism by Ebert and others over perceived racism in their previous film \"Africa Addio\".\n\nThe film was considered to have been a critical and commercial failure.\n\nItalian film critic Marco Giusti calls it \"not bad\" and remembers that the numerous scenes in the nude \"made a certain effect back then\".\n\nThe film was scored by Italian composer Riz Ortolani and is notable for the theme \"Oh My Love\" sung by Katyna Ranieri, which would later be used in the soundtrack to the 2011 film \"Drive\". Ortolani also collaborated with directors Jacopetti and Prosperi on their previous films, \"Mondo Cane\", and \"Africa Addio\".\n\n\n"}

His films typically deal with themes of marginalized subcultures, in particular homosexuality; as such, Van Sant is considered one of the most prominent auteurs of the New Queer Cinema movement.\n\nVan Sant's early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the Pacific Northwest. He made his feature-length cinematic directorial debut with \"Mala Noche\" (1985). His second feature \"Drugstore Cowboy\" (1989) was highly acclaimed, and earned Van Sant screenwriting awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and New York Film Critics Circle and the award for Best Director from the National Society of Film Critics. His following film, \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991), was similarly praised, as was the black comedy \"To Die For\" (1995), the drama \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997), and the biographical film \"Milk\" (2008); for the latter two, Van Sant was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director and both films received Best Picture nominations.\n\nIn 2003, Van Sant's film about the Columbine High School massacre, \"Elephant\", won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Van Sant also received the festival's Best Director Award that same year, making him one of only two filmmakers—the other being Joel Coen—to win both accolades at the festival in the same year. Though most of Van Sant's other films received favourable reviews, such as \"Finding Forrester\" (2000) and \"Paranoid Park\" (2007), some of his efforts, such as the art house production \"Last Days\" (2005) and the environmental drama \"Promised Land\" (2012), have received more mixed reviews from critics, while his adaptation of Tom Robbins's \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" (1994), his 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\", and \"The Sea of Trees\" (2015), were critical and commercial failures.\n\nIn addition to directing, Van Sant has written the screenplays for several of his earlier works, and is the author of a novel entitled \"Pink\". A book of his photography, called \"108 Portraits\", has also been published, and he has released two musical albums. He is openly gay and currently lives in Los Feliz, CA.\n\nVan Sant was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Betty (née Seay) and Gus Green Van Sant Sr; Gus's father was a clothing manufacturer and traveling salesman, who rapidly worked his way into middle class prosperity, holding executive marketing positions that included being president of the White Stag Manufacturing Company's Apparel Operation. As a result of his father's job, the family moved continually during Van Sant's childhood.\n\nHis paternal family is of partial Dutch origin; the name \"Van Sant\" is derived from the Dutch name \"Van Zandt\". The earliest Van Zandt arrived in the New Netherland area in the early 17th century, around what is now New York City.\n\nVan Sant is an alumnus of Darien High School in Darien, Connecticut, and The Catlin Gabel School in Portland, Oregon. One constant in the director's early years was his interest in visual arts (namely, painting and Super-8 filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant's artistic leanings took him to the Rhode Island School of Design in 1970, where his introduction to various avant-garde directors inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.\n\nAfter spending time in Europe, Van Sant went to Los Angeles in 1976. He secured a job as a production assistant to filmmaker Ken Shapiro, with whom he developed a few ideas, none of which came to fruition. In 1981, Van Sant made \"Alice in Hollywood\", a film about a naïve young actress who goes to Hollywood and abandons her ideals. It was never released. During this period, Van Sant began to spend time observing the denizens of the more down-and-out sections of Hollywood Boulevard. He became fascinated by the existence of this marginalized section of L.A.'s population, especially in context with the more ordinary, prosperous world that surrounded them. Van Sant would repeatedly focus his work on those existing on society's fringes, making his feature film directorial debut \"Mala Noche\".\n\nIt was made two years after Van Sant went to New York to work in an advertising agency. He saved $20,000 during his tenure there, enabling him to finance the majority of his tale of doomed love between a gay liquor store clerk and a Mexican immigrant. The film, which was taken from Portland street writer Walt Curtis' semi-autobiographical novella, featured some of the director's hallmarks, notably an unfulfilled romanticism, a dry sense of the absurd, and the refusal to treat homosexuality as something deserving of judgment. Unlike many gay filmmakers, Van Sant—who had long been openly gay—declined to use same-sex relationships as fodder for overtly political statements, although such relationships would frequently appear in his films.\n\nShot in black-and-white, the film earned Van Sant almost overnight acclaim on the festival circuit, with the \"Los Angeles Times\" naming it the year's best independent film. The film's success attracted Hollywood interest, and Van Sant was briefly courted by Universal; the courtship ended after Van Sant pitched a series of project ideas (including what would later become \"Drugstore Cowboy\" and \"My Own Private Idaho\") that the studio declined to take interest in.\n\nVan Sant moved back to Portland, Oregon, where he set up house and began giving life to the ideas rejected by Universal. He directed \"Drugstore Cowboy\" about four drug addicts robbing pharmacies to support their habit. The film met with great critical success and revived the career of Matt Dillon.\n\n\"Drugstore Cowboy\"'s exploration of the lives of those living on society's outer fringes, as well as its Portland setting, were mirrored in Van Sant's next effort, the similarly acclaimed \"My Own Private Idaho\" (1991). Only with the success of \"Cowboy\" was Van Sant now given license to make \"Idaho\" (a film he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now New Line Cinema had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the \"Idaho\" script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an Independent Spirit Award for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his \"Drugstore Cowboy\" screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the Venice Film Festival among others. In addition, it helped Reeves—previously best known for his work in the \"Bill and Ted\" movies—to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him.\n\nVan Sant's next film, a 1993 adaptation of Tom Robbins' \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\", was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of $8.5 million and a large, eclectic cast including Uma Thurman, John Hurt, Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister Rain (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster.\n\nVan Sant's 1995 film \"To Die For\" helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of Joyce Maynard's novel, the black comedy starred Nicole Kidman as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars Matt Dillon as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, Joaquin Phoenix, as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio (Columbia), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for Larry Clark's \"Kids\"; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's \"Drugstore Cowboy\".\n\nIn 1997, Van Sant gained mainstream recognition and critical acclaim thanks to \"Good Will Hunting\", which starred and was written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The film—about a troubled, blue-collar mathematical genius—was a huge critical and commercial success. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Director for Van Sant. It also won two, including Best Screenplay for Damon and Affleck, and Best Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams, who, in his acceptance speech, referred to Van Sant as \"the mellowest man in Hollywood.\" Van Sant, Damon and Affleck parodied themselves and the film's success in Kevin Smith's\" Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\".\n\nThe success of \"Good Will Hunting\" afforded Van Sant the opportunity to remake the Alfred Hitchcock classic \"Psycho\". As opposed to reinterpreting the 1960 film, Van Sant opted to recreate the film shot-for-shot, in color, with a cast of young Hollywood A-listers. His decision was met with equal parts curiosity, skepticism, and derision from industry insiders and outsiders alike, and the finished result met with a similar reception. It starred Anne Heche, Vince Vaughn and Julianne Moore, and met with a negative critical reception and did poorly at the box office.\n\nIn 2000, Van Sant directed \"Finding Forrester\", about a high-school student (Rob Brown) from the Bronx unlikely becoming a friend of a crusty, reclusive author (Sean Connery). Critical response was generally positive.\n\nIn addition to directing, he devoted considerable energy to releasing two albums and publishing a novel, \"Pink\", which was a thinly veiled exploration of his grief over River Phoenix's death.\n\nVan Sant traveled to the deserts of Argentina, Utah, and Death Valley for the production of 2002's \"Gerry\", a loosely devised, largely improvised feature in which stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck—both playing characters named Gerry—wander through the desert, discussing \"Wheel of Fortune\", video games, and nothing in particular. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIt took \"Gerry\" over a year to make it to theaters, in which time Van Sant began production on his next film, \"Elephant\". Approached by HBO and producer Diane Keaton to craft a fictional film based on the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, the director chose to shoot in his hometown of Portland, employing dozens of untrained, teen actors. As well as melding improvisational long takes like those in \"Gerry\" with Harris Savides' fluid camerawork, the film was also influenced by Alan Clarke's 1989 film of the same name (see \"Elephant\"). The finished film provoked strong reactions from audiences at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. At the Cannes festival, the jury awarded \"Elephant\" with their top prize, the Palme d'Or, and Van Sant with his first Best Director statue from the festival. The success of \"Elephant\" led Van Sant to show the U.S. premiere of \"Elephant\" as a fundraiser for Outside In, an organization working to help youth living on the streets of Portland, Oregon.\n\nIn 2005, Van Sant released \"Last Days\", the final component of what he refers to as his \"Death Trilogy,\" (the other parts being \"Gerry\" and \"Elephant\"). It is a fictionalized account of what happened to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in the days leading up to his death. In 2006, Van Sant began work on \"Paranoid Park\" based on the book by Blake Nelson, about a skateboarding teenager who accidentally causes someone's death. The film was released in Europe in February 2008. He also directed the \"Le Marais\" segment of the omnibus film \"Paris, je t'aime\".\n\nReleased in 2008, Van Sant's \"Milk\" is a biopic of openly gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978 and is played by Sean Penn in the movie. The film received eight Oscar nominations at the 81st Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning two for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Penn and Best Original Screenplay for writer Dustin Lance Black. Van Sant was nominated for Best Director. Van Sant later stated that his experience with Sean Penn on the film was \"amazing\".\n\nHis 2011 project \"Restless\" was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, and starred Mia Wasikowska and Henry Hopper, the son of actor Dennis Hopper.\n\nVan Sant's film, \"Promised Land\", was released on December 28, 2012. The film stars Frances McDormand, Matt Damon, and John Krasinski—the latter two co-wrote the screenplay based on a story by Dave Eggers. Filmed in April 2012, the production company, Focus Features, selected the release date so that the film is eligible to qualify for awards consideration.\n\nFollowing \"Promised Land\", Van Sant directed a film titled \"Sea of Trees\", which starred Matthew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe. The film tells the story of a man who travels to the infamous suicide forest in Japan to kill himself, only to encounter another man wishing to kill himself as well, with whom he then embarks on a \"spiritual journey.\" The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival but was met with harsh critical reception at the Cannes, being booed and laughed at.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced Van Sant would direct \"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot\", a biopic about cartoonist John Callahan, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Rooney Mara, Jonah Hill, Jack Black and Mark Webber. Principal photography began in March 2017.\n\nVan Sant released two musical albums: \"Gus Van Sant\" and \"18 Songs About Golf\". The Broken Social Scene song, \"Art House Director\", is supposedly about himself, a connection discussed by a Singaporean fan on the internet. Van Sant played himself in episodes of the HBO series \"Entourage\" and the IFC series \"Portlandia\".\n\nVan Sant directed the pilot for the Starz television program \"Boss\", starring Kelsey Grammer. Van Sant went onto The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast to discuss filmmaking, writing, film history and their collaborations that never got made (\"The Golden Suicides\") and the one that did (\"The Canyons\").\n\nThe moving image collection of Gus Van Sant is held at the Academy Film Archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1982 as Toronto Community Videotex, InterAccess is Ontario's only exhibition space devoted exclusively to technological media arts. The Centre for Contemporary Canadian Art places the founding of InterAccess as a key moment in both the history of Canadian electronic art but also within a timeline of developments in international art, science, technology and culture.\n\nIn 1983, InterAccess was incorporated as a not-for-profit, artist-run access centre, under the name Toronto Community Videotex (TCV). It provided artists access to the Telidon system, a precursor of the World Wide Web. The early conception of electronic art placed the organization within the production cooperative system in Canada. TCV's members created artworks which fell within the more systems-based notions of art production, rather than the beaux-arts aesthetic of the museum. The name change to InterAccess in 1987 reflected a new focus on Macintosh graphics, multimedia production and a dial-up artists’ network (much like a Bulletin Board System, or BBS) known as Matrix.\n\nInterAccess moved to a larger facility in 1995 allowing InterAccess to offer a gallery and production space that expanded its activities beyond simply access to multimedia production. The exhibitions began to emphasize the finished production and there was a particular focus on establishing an international presence for the centre. The exhibition \"Pandoras Box\", a collaboration between InterAccess and Fylkingen New Music and Intermedia Art in Stockholm, Sweden in 2000, was billed as \"the first international interactive encounter with art using remotely controlled robots.\"\n\nIn 2005, InterAccess moved to a renovated two-floor, three thousand square feet stand-alone building, allowing for more production space, a surround sound studio and a machine shop for constructing large-scale physical computing projects and installation.\n\nThe exhibition \"This must be the place: Vera Frenkel, David Rokeby, Nell Tenhaaf and Norman White\" was a reconsideration of the centre and as well the place of electronic art within art history. The four featured artists are pioneers in electronic and interactive art and have a history with InterAccess as both members and exhibitors.\n\nIn May 2006, InterAccess received a Canada Council Media Arts Commissioning Grant for \"The Networked City\", a series of five outdoor interactive installations on Yonge Street in Toronto.\n\n\n"}

She is the daughter of filmmaker David Lynch. She is also known as the author of the book \"The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer\".\n\nLynch was born in Philadelphia. She is the daughter of artist and filmmaker David Lynch, who is responsible for her Finnish ancestry, and painter Peggy Reavey. She began practicing Transcendental Meditation at the age of six. Lynch graduated from the Interlochen Art Academy where she studied visual arts and creative writing.\n\nLynch was educated in Los Angeles and Michigan at Interlochen Arts Academy. Together with her mother, Lynch made a brief appearance in her father's debut feature film \"Eraserhead\", but her appearance was not included in the final cut. Lynch subsequently worked as a production assistant on \"Blue Velvet\" (1986), also directed by her father.\n\nLynch's commissioned screenplay for \"Boxing Helena\", which she would later go on to direct, attracted many actresses, including Madonna. Sherilyn Fenn, one of the stars in her father's television series \"Twin Peaks\" and the film \"Wild at Heart\", was ultimately cast as leading character Helena. Kim Basinger was also attached and was famously sued after resigning from the project. The controversy surrounding that case, as well as feminist outcry over \"Helena\"'s sadistic subject matter and accusations of nepotism, accompanied the movie's critical drubbing upon its release in 1993.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with The Hollywood Interview, Lynch mentions her reactions to the critical reception of \"Boxing Helena\":\n\"I would love to know why people were so mad at me for telling a crazy fairy tale. I'm the first to say I didn't know what I was doing. I did the best I could at 19, and all these crazy things happened. The idea that the film was faulted when everyone involved worked so fucking hard and believed in me, and there were these adults believing in me, who was essentially a child…when the National Organization of Women slammed me, that was sort of the final straw. It was no wonder I put my legs behind my ears and got pregnant. (laughs) Not that I didn't love sex before then, but seriously. It was my child, essentially, who saved my life.\"\n\nFollowing a lengthy hiatus, Lynch returned to the public arena with the film \"Surveillance\" and, in October 2008, \"Surveillance\" won the top prize at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. A month later, Lynch became the first woman to receive the New York City Horror Film Festival's Best Director award.\n\nLynch was announced as director of the film \"Nagin\" (the film is also known as \"Hisss\") that featured Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat, but the film that was released was not Lynch's work, even though the producers attached her name to the final product. Lynch explained in a 2012 interview:\n\"Well, ultimately, I didn't get to make that film. I put my director's cut together, and the producers decided it was not what they wanted. They took it back to India. I never did any scoring or cutting or color-timing or any of the things you do to make the movie. They took the footage and changed it into what they wanted it to be. So it's not my film. I went to India and shot some footage, but I have nothing to do with the movie they made.\"\n\nLynch was scheduled to film \"Visibility\" for the Motion Picture Corporation of America in 2011, but, as of June 2013, this project is not completed. Lynch then directed and co-wrote the 2012 horror film \"Chained\", in which Vincent D'Onofrio stars as a cab-driving serial killer.\n\n, Lynch is filming \"A Fall from Grace\". The film stars Tim Roth as a St. Louis detective investigating the murder of young girls by a mysterious assailant and is scheduled for release late in 2015. A trailer for \"A Fall from Grace\" was published on March 7, 2013 by Apothecary Films producer David Michaels, who worked with the director on \"Surveillance\". Co-written by producer Eric Wilkinson, the film is set and filmed in St. Louis, U.S. and is inspired by the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge.\n\nLynch authored \"The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer\" to accompany the television show \"Twin Peaks\" which was created by her father David Lynch and Mark Frost.\n\nLynch also directed episodes of many television series such as \"Jessica Jones\", \"Finding Carter\", \"Psych\", \"Quantico\", \"Teen Wolf\", \"The Walking Dead\", \"The Last Ship\", \"Wayward Pines\", \"American Horror Story\", \"The Strain\", \"Once Upon a Time\", \"Hawaii Five-0\" and \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\"\n\nIn 1993, Lynch directed the music video \"Living in the Rose\" by the British rock band New Model Army.\n\nOn March 21, 2010, Lynch was a judge at the International Surrealist Film Festival and she worked as producer for the Corey Brandenstein natural horror film \"The Compound\".\n\nAn Australian documentary titled \"Despite the Gods\", which chronicles Lynch's struggle to make the film \"Hisss\", was released in 2012. The documentary was shown at the Canadian International Documentary Festival and the program described the film: \"Out of her depth shooting on location with an Indian crew and two top Bollywood stars, Lynch turns her production into a vehicle for her own self-actualization, paying no regard to timeline, budget or reality. As the story in front of the camera derails, the story behind the camera explodes.\". She eventually disowned the film.\n\nAs of 2015, she is also a member of the board of advisers for the Hollywood Horror Museum.\n\n\"Boxing Helena\" received incredibly scathing reviews upon its release and a Razzie Award for \"Worst Director.\" Nevertheless, the film was nominated for Grand Jury Prize in the Dramatic category at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nLynch revealed in a 2009 interview that she underwent three spinal surgeries following the release of \"Boxing Helena\" due to a car accident that occurred when she was 19 years old. In the same interview, Lynch stated that she is a single mother to a 13-year-old daughter.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17387457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17387457", "title": "Khmer sculpture", "text": "Khmer sculpture\n\nKhmer sculpture refers to the stone sculpture of the Khmer Empire, which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in Angkor, which served as the seat of the empire. \n\nThere are several recognisable specific art styles of the Angkorian period:\n\nEarlier Khmer art were influenced by Indian influences of Hindu themes. By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences – pre-Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures – and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. An example of Khmer style that totally departed from Indian sculpture tradition is the wholeness of its figure, which bears similarities to the ancient Egyptian sculpture. Unlike almost all of Indian and Javanese Hindu-Buddhist stone sculptures, which were carved in high reliefs, slabs or supported by stelae on the figure's back, Khmer sculpture is carved wholly in the round. Khmer stone sculpture did not employ any stelae on the back of the figure to support it, as the result broken arms, hands or ankles vividly attested to the vulnerability of this format. Nevertheless, Khmer sculptors seems to wish their works to be seen from all sides in the garbagriha in the center of the temple. Khmers attempted to make free-standing statues, supported by an arch or by an attribute of the divinity such as a piece of clothing or a hand-held object.\n\nKhmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style.\n\nThe gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, Buddhism and Hinduism. Priests supervised the execution of the works, attested to in the high iconographic precision of the sculptures. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the aristocracy through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the “deva-raja” required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign’s divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself – if, it’s true, in idealized form – immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry.\nThe sculptures are images of gods, royal and imposing presences with feminine sensuality, giving impressions of figures at the courts with considerable power. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeeds in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty.\n\nBut if we go beyond this initial impression, we can pause to observe some of the details of the sculptures, such as the double arc drawn by the eyebrows on the foreheads, evoked below by the wisely sketched curve of the noses and further down, by the double arc which masterfully outlines the lips and the double chin. Following a hypothetical vertical line down still further, we find another double arc outlining the breasts, and then, continuing down from the waist all along the skirts and ending in the ankles, we find almost at the bottom, a twisted double arc intended to represent the other side of the skirts. This detail serves, above all, to eliminate a certain hieratic fixedness, which was relatively common in the Khmer statues of lesser quality.\n\nEver since 1864, when France established a Protectorate in Cambodia, Western travellers have been amazed by the impressive ruins of Angkor. Not long after, once the École française d'Extrême-Orient began to study and catalogue the findings made at the excavations, the growing number of scholars from all around the world, art lovers and admirers of this sculpture, became fervent proponents of Khmer Art.\n\n“Khmer Art, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.” Thus wrote Madeleine Giteau, the distinguished member of the École française d’Extrême-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965. \n\nCurrently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in Paris and later at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1997.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "71246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71246", "title": "Lewis chessmen", "text": "Lewis chessmen\n\nThe Lewis chessmen (; ; ) or Uig chessmen, named after the bay where they were found, are a group of distinctive 12th-century chess pieces, along with other game pieces, most of which are carved from walrus ivory. Discovered in 1831 on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, they may constitute some of the few complete, surviving medieval chess sets, although it is not clear if a set as originally made can be assembled from the pieces. When found, the hoard contained 93 artifacts: 78 chess pieces, 14 tablemen and one belt buckle. Today, 82 pieces are owned and usually exhibited by the British Museum in London, and the remaining 11 are at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.\n\nThe British Museum claims the chessmen were probably made in Trondheim, Norway, in the 12th century, although some scholars have suggested other Nordic countries.\nDuring that period, the Outer Hebrides, along with other major groups of Scottish islands, were ruled by Norway.\n\nAccording to Dr. Alex Woolf, director of the University of St Andrews Institute for Medieval Studies, there are reasons for believing the pieces came from Trondheim:\n\nIcelanders Gudmundur Thorarinsson and Einar Einarsson have proposed that the chessmen originated in Iceland, since only in Iceland were the bishops called that at that time, while in other countries they used a name unassociated with the church. They further claim that the pieces were carved by an artist known as Margret the Adroit. However, this is disputed by Woolf, who stated that the use of bishops originated in England, and by Norwegian chess historian and member of the Ken Whyld Association Morten Lilleøren.\n\nSome historians believe that the Lewis chessmen were hidden (or lost) after some mishap occurred during their carriage from Norway to wealthy Norse towns on the east coast of Ireland, such as Dublin. The large number of pieces and their lack of wear may suggest that they were the stock of a trader or dealer. Along with the chess pieces, there were 14 plain round tablemen for the game of tables and one belt buckle, all made of ivory, making a total of 93 artifacts.\n\nAlmost all of the pieces in the collection are carved from walrus ivory, with a few made instead from whale teeth. The 78 pieces consist of eight kings, eight queens, 16 bishops, 15 knights, 12 rooks and 19 pawns. The heights of the pawns range from 3.5 to 5.8 cm, while the other pieces are between 7 and 10.2 cm. Although there are 19 pawns (a complete set requires 16), they have the greatest range of sizes of all the pieces, which has suggested that the 78 pieces might belong to at least five sets. All the pieces are sculptures of human figures, with the exception of the pawns, which are smaller, geometric shapes. The knights are mounted on rather diminutive horses and are shown holding spears and shields. The rooks are standing soldiers or warders holding shields and swords; four of the rooks are shown as wild-eyed berserkers biting their shields with battle fury. Some pieces bore traces of red stain when found, indicating that red and white were used to distinguish the two sides, rather than the black and white used in modern chess.\nScholars have observed that, to the modern eye, the figural pieces, with their bulging eyes and glum expressions, have a distinct comical character. This is especially true of the single rook with a worried, sideways glance (front right of first image below, next to queen) and the berserkers biting their shields, which have been called \"irresistibly comic to a modern audience\". It is believed, however, that the comic or sad expressions were not intended or perceived as such by the makers, to whom these images instead displayed strength, ferocity or, in the case of the queens who hold their heads with a hand and seemingly pensive expression, \"contemplation, repose and possibly wisdom\".\n\nThe chessmen were discovered in early 1831 in a sand bank at the head of Camas Uig on the west coast of the Isle of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. There are various local stories concerning their arrival and modern discovery on Lewis.\n\nMalcolm \"Sprot\" MacLeod () from the nearby township of Pennydonald discovered the trove in a small stone kist in a dune, exhibited them briefly in his byre and sold them on to Captain Roderick Ryrie. One reported detail, that it was a cow that actually unearthed the stash, is generally discounted in Uig as fabrication. After the Isle of Lewis was purchased by Sir James Matheson in 1844, Malcolm Macleod and his family were evicted and the district was transformed into sheep farms.\n\nThey were exhibited by Ryrie at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, on 11 April 1831. The chessmen were soon after split up, with 10 being purchased by Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe and the others (67 chessmen and 14 tablemen) purchased on behalf of the British Museum in London.\n\nKirkpatrick Sharpe later found another bishop to take his collection up to eleven, all of which were later sold to Lord Londesborough. In 1888, they were again sold, but this time the purchaser was the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, who donated the pieces to the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. The eleven are now on display in the National Museum of Scotland.\n\nOf the pieces given to the British Museum, most can be found in Room 40, with the registration numbers M&ME 1831, 11–1.78–159. Others have been lent to Scottish museums and temporary exhibitions. A range of wooden or plastic replicas are popular items in the Museum shops.\n\nThe chessmen were number 5 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary \"Our Top Ten Treasures\", presented by Adam Hart-Davis. They feature in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series \"A History of the World in 100 Objects\" as number 61, in the \"Status Symbols\" section.\n\nAn exhibition entitled \"The Lewis Chessmen: Unmasked\", which includes chesspieces from both the National Museum of Scotland and British Museum collections, along with other relevant objects, toured Scotland in 2010–2011. The exhibition opened in Edinburgh on 21 May 2010 and proceeded to Aberdeen, Shetland, and the Museum nan Eilean in Stornoway, opening there on 15 April 2011.\n\nAn exhibition entitled \"The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen from the Isle of Lewis\" at The Cloisters in New York City included 34 of the chess pieces, all on loan from the British Museum. The exhibit ended on 22 April 2012.\n\nOn 3 April 2013, £1.8 million from the European Regional Development Fund was granted to transform Lews Castle, on the Isle of Lewis, into a Museum for the Western Isles. Around £14 million in total is to be spent on restoring and converting the property, which has been shut for almost twenty-five years. When completed the permanent displays will include six of the Lewis Chessmen.\n\nIn 2007–2008 a dispute arose regarding the most appropriate place to display the pieces. The issue first arose late in 2007 with calls from Scottish National Party (SNP) politicians in the Western Isles (notably Councillor Annie Macdonald, MSP Alasdair Allan and MP Angus MacNeil) for the return of the pieces to the place they were found. Linda Fabiani, the Scottish Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, stated that \"it is unacceptable that only 11 Lewis Chessmen rest at the National Museum of Scotland while the other 67 (as well as the 14 tablemen) remain in the British Museum in London.\"\n\nRichard Oram, Professor of Medieval and Environmental History at the University of Stirling, agreed, arguing that there was no reason for there to be more than \"a sample\" of the collection in London. Both points of view have been dismissed by Margaret Hodge, the UK Minister of State in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, writing \"It's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?\" The local historical society in Uig, \"Comann Eachdraidh Uig\", which operates a registered museum near the find site featuring detailed information about the chessmen and Norse occupation in Lewis, has indicated publicly that it has no intention of pursuing any claim to the ownership of the pieces and does not support demands for them to be sent to Edinburgh, but would welcome short-term loans.\n\nIn October 2009, twenty-four of the pieces from London and six from Edinburgh began a 16-month tour of various locations in Scotland. The tour was partly funded by the Scottish Government, and Mike Russell, the Minister for Culture and External Affairs, stated that the Government and the British Museum had \"agreed to disagree\" on their eventual fate. Bonnie Greer, the museum's deputy chairman, said that she \"absolutely\" believed the main collection should remain in London.\n\n\n"}

The organization was founded by Gary Hickling, a musician and expert on Lehmann. Hickling was also the founder of the Lotte Lehmann League, which currently exists as a website.\n\nFounder Gary Hickling had met Lotte Lehmann in the early 1960s when he was a double bass player at university, observing the private voice lessons Lehmann gave at Orplid, her home in Santa Barbara. He later observed her master classes at the Music Academy of the West, which she had helped found in 1947.\n\nHickling became a noted expert on Lehmann's career and work, compiling a Lehmann discography in 1987. He continued to compile and collect material and memorabilia relating to her career, which now forms a significant part of the Lotte Lehmann Archive in Santa Barbara. The foundation's precursor, the Lotte Lehmann League, published a newsletter from 1989 to 1994; the league was later re-established as a website in 2011.\n\nHickling founded the Lotte Lehmann Foundation in 1999. In the early years of its existence, he was solely responsible for maintaining it.\n\nOperations of the foundation were transferred from Hawaii, where Hickling lived, to New York City in 2003. The composer Daron Hagen was chosen as the newly configured foundation's president, and an entirely new board of directors was chosen at that time. Mezzo soprano Linn Maxwell was elected president in 2007. Larry Smith was president beginning in 2010. Hickling retired from the foundation in 2005 and became an emeritus member of the Board of Directors.\n\nAs of 2016, the foundation is in hiatus. Since 1988, Hickling has hosted a weekly program on art songs on Hawaii Public Radio, initially titled \"Great Songs\", and from 2011 titled \"Singing and Other Sins\". Information and listenable archives of the program are hosted on the Lotte Lehmann League website.\n\nThe Lehmann Foundation was a respected non-profit musical foundation in the United States. Its activities included two competitions, the first of which, the internet-based CyberSing vocal competition occurred every two years and solicited recordings from singers the world over. Entrants submitted recordings of appropriate literature, including a song written expressly for the competition by a distinguished composer. These songs were commissioned from composers such as Ned Rorem, Libby Larsen and Dan Welcher. Winners were chosen solely on the basis of their recorded submissions. Laureates of the 2006 competition included sopranos Debra Stanley and Danielle Talamantes and baritone Andrew Garland.\n\nThe ASCAP/Lotte Lehmann Foundation Song Cycle Competition, which occurred in alternating years with CyberSing, solicited compositions by young composers resident in or native of the United States; winners received commissions to compose individual songs or, in the case of the First Prize recipient, a song cycle. Winners of the 2005 competition included Scott Gendel and Mark Buntag. Gendel's prize-winning commission, the song cycle \"The Space Between\" was published by E. C. Schirmer and premiered by soprano Martha Guth and pianist Bradley Moore on 24 February 2007 at the Bruno Walter Auditorium in New York under the auspices of the Joy in Singing Foundation.\n\nVoxNova Media was another aspect of the foundation's activities. The mission of this division was to produce media in a variety of forms, including audio recordings, video recordings, printed materials. VNM plan was to reissue historical audio recordings by Lehmann and her colleagues, present new recordings of contemporary vocal repertoire and of the vocal art of contemporary interpreters.\n\nIn addition to these programs and activities, the foundation presented an annual World of Song Award which alternated among composers, singers, and collaborative pianists and served to recognize those who have devoted their creative lives to this enriching form of music. Recipients include pianist and educator John Wustman, composers Dominick Argento and Ned Rorem, pianists Dalton Baldwin and Graham Johnson, tenor Hugues Cuénod, mezzo soprano Janet Baker, and baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. The foundation also published \"SongScape\", a biannual newsletter edited by board member Craig Urquhart and featuring news of the foundation's activities.\n\n"}

The company got its start developing Inkodye, a photo-reactive vat dye that develops its color through exposure to UV or sunlight.\n\nJesse Genet began experimenting with different printing techniques as a teenager in 2004, attempting to print photographs on cotton T-shirts. Unsatisfied with the results of screen printing and dye-sublimation she pursued her research and found what became a precursor to Inkodye, a chemical formula from the 1950s owned by a retired engineer. After meeting Stephan Ango while studying at Art Center College of Design, the pair acquired the chemical formula and began modernizing it.\n\nLumi launched a Kickstarter campaign in December 2009 to fund R&D of the technology. The company raised $13,597 and rewarded its backers with wallets, bags and other products printed using the process. The project was an early success for the Kickstarter platform and went on to win Kickstarter's Best Design Project of 2010. In June 2012, Lumi launched a second Kickstarter campaign with an initial fundraising target of $50,000 to commercialize its printing process, Inkodye. The project was successfully funded, reaching over 500% of the initial target and raising a total of $268,437. Rewards included Inkodye printing kits allowing users to create personalized photographic prints on cotton and other natural materials. In February 2015, Lumi appeared on ABC's Shark Tank and received 2 offers, but Genet did not accept either of the offers.\n\nIn March 2015, Lumi announced its new software platform, Lumi.com, for designing and ordering custom-made packaging and branding tools such as rubber stamps. The service was funded by seed capital firm Y Combinator. Lumi's platform was inspired by the challenges the company had faced in producing packaging for Inkodye. The platform was compared to other services such as \"Blackbox\" by Cards Against Humanity and \"Make That Thing!\" by TopatoCo, provided by companies that also found success via Kickstarter and looked to simplify fulfillment and manufacturing for others.\n\nThe process of printing with Inkodye resembles that of other alternative photographic processes though its chemistry is related to vat dyes such as indigo rather than iron or silver-based chemicals used in cyanotype or Van dyke brown which have higher toxicity. Inkodye is available in several colors (red, orange, copper, blue, navy, magenta, plum, sepia and black) which can be mixed together and diluted with water.\n\nA monochromatic digital negative is first printed on transparency film generally using an inkjet printer with black ink only. The negative is made to be the same size as the final print. Inkodye is then applied to the desired T-shirt or fabric in its undeveloped state. The negative is placed on top of the sensitized fabric and exposed to sunlight or UV light. Exposure times vary from 3 to 15 minutes depending on the desired color and intensity of light. The exposure to sunlight develops the dye's color and binds it to the fabric. The final step is to wash out the unexposed dye using a washing machine and laundry detergent.\n\n"}

{"id": "19947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19947", "title": "Mannerism", "text": "Mannerism\n\nMannerism, also known as Late Renaissance, is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the Baroque style largely replaced it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century.\n\nStylistically, Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and early Michelangelo. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities. It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.\n\nThe definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late Gothic painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the Antwerp Mannerists—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the Silver Age of Latin literature.\n\nThe word \"mannerism\" derives from the Italian \"maniera\", meaning \"style\" or \"manner\". Like the English word \"style\", \"maniera\" can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone \"has style\"). In the second edition of his \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" (1568), Giorgio Vasari used \"maniera\" in three different contexts: to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term \"maniera greca\" to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the \"maniera\" of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality. Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as \"la maniera moderna\", or the \"modern style\". James V. Mirollo describes how \"bella maniera\" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch. This notion of \"bella maniera\" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, \"bella maniera\" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.\n\nAs a stylistic label, \"Mannerism\" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt and popularized by German art historians in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by John Shearman following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by Fritz Grossmann at Manchester City Art Gallery in 1965. The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.\nHowever, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, \"la maniera\" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s. From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.\n\nYet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.\n\nBy the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis: it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches. At this point Mannerism started to emerge. The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence, or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.\n\nThis period has been described as a \"natural extension\" of the art of Andrea del Sarto, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era. One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his \"terribilità\", a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it. Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His Sistine Chapel ceiling provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called \"ignudi\" and of the Libyan Sibyl, his vestibule to the Laurentian Library, the figures on his Medici tombs, and above all his \"Last Judgment\". The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism. Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him. In his book \"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\", Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: \"Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow\".\n\nThe competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.\n\nThe early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of Andrea del Sarto such as Jacopo da Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. Parmigianino (a student of Correggio) and Giulio Romano (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome. These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as \"anti-classical”, yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its \"anti-classical\" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550. Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book \"After Raphael\" that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.\n\nIn past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the Copernican model, the Sack of Rome, and the Protestant Reformation's increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art. This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's \"School of Athens\" no longer seemed to interest young artists.\n\nThe second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated from the earlier, so-called \"anti-classical\" phase.\nSubsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected \"manner\" (\"maniera\"). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between \"unseen, but felt, quotation marks\". The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. Agnolo Bronzino and Giorgio Vasari exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called \"stylish style\" or \"Maniera\" in its maturity.\n\nThe cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by Titian in his long career. A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the Sack of Rome in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe. The result was the first international artistic style since the Gothic. Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the Northern Mannerism. Francis I of France, for example, was presented with Bronzino's \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\". The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the Carracci brothers, Caravaggio and Cigoli, revived naturalism. Walter Friedlaender identified this period as \"anti-mannerism\", just as the early mannerists were \"anti-classical\" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.\n\nOutside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at Fontainebleau, it is known as the \"Henry II style\" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of Northern Mannerism include the court of Rudolf II in Prague, as well as Haarlem and Antwerp. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to English visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as \"Elizabethan\" and \"Jacobean\" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.\n\nOf particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the \"pittore vago,\" a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.\n\nAs in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the High Renaissance, which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, next to Michelangelo's \"David\". Baccio Bandinelli took over the project of \"Hercules and Cacus\" from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by Benvenuto Cellini to \"a sack of melons\", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the pedestal of statues. Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done. Cellini's bronze \"Perseus with the head of Medusa\" is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the \"David\"s of Michelangelo and Donatello. Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel Salt Cellar (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.\n\nSmall bronze figures for collector's cabinets, often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the \"figura serpentinata\", often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.\n\nGiorgio Vasari's opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume \"Lives of the Artists\": he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (\"invenzione\"), expressed through virtuoso technique (\"maniera\"), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's Medici patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of Vasari's \"Lives of the Artists\" would be called \"Jacobean\" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural \"architectural\" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.\n\nAnother literary figure from the period is Gian Paolo Lomazzo, who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His \"Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura\" (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of decorum, which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical \"Idea del tempio della pittura\" (\"The ideal temple of painting\", Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the \"four temperaments\" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.\n\nJacopo da Pontormo's \"Joseph in Egypt\" features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.\n\nRosso Fiorentino, who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of Andrea del Sarto, in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to Fontainebleau, where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the \"School of Fontainebleau\".\n\nThe examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of engravings, to Antwerp and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and allegory, and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.\n\nMannerist portraits by Agnolo Bronzino are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.\n\nAlessandro Allori's (1535–1607) \"Susanna and the Elders\" (\"below\") is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.\n\nTintoretto's \"Last Supper\" (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life. Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the angels looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that \"If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist.\"\n\nEl Greco attempted to express religious emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring \"acid\" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.\n\nBenvenuto Cellini created the Cellini Salt Cellar of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring Poseidon and Amphitrite (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.\n\nJoachim Wtewael (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working. His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of Pieter Aertsen, and mythological scenes, many small cabinet paintings beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.\n\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo (also spelled \"Arcimboldi\") is known for his portraits contrived from a still life composition\n\nMannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms. Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the Laurentian Library, was Michelangelo (1475–1564). He is credited with inventing the giant order, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade. He used this in his design for the Campidoglio in Rome.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, the term \"Mannerism\" had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms. Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence. Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author Robert Venturi wrote \"Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously.\" \n\nAn example of mannerist architecture is the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. in the rugged country side outside of Rome. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.\n\nDense with ornament of \"Roman\" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated \"set piece\" against unpretentious vernacular walling.\n\nFrom the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in Valletta, the new capital city of Malta, were designed by the architect Girolamo Cassar in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include St. John's Co-Cathedral, the Grandmaster's Palace and the seven original auberges. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the Baroque period. However, a few buildings, such as Auberge d'Aragon and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.\n\nIn English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the \"Metaphysical\" poets of whom the most famous is John Donne. The witty sally of a Baroque writer, John Dryden, against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:\n\nThe rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the madrigal, which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by Tim Carter:\n\nThe word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and contrapuntally complex polyphonic music made in France in the late 14th century. This period is now usually referred to as the \"ars subtilior\".\n\n\"The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context\" by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre. Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.\n\nThe preciosity in Jacques Callot's minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's \"Balli di Sfessania\" (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.\n\nImportant corollaries exist between the \"disegno interno\", which substituted for the \"disegno esterno\" (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist \"discordia concors\" (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.\n\nAccording to art critic Jerry Saltz, \"Neo-Mannerism\" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are \"squeezing the life out of the art world\". Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers \"have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary\".\n\n\n"}

He was one of the leading figures of the Irish Literary Revival.\n\nColum was born Patrick Columb in a County Longford workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb. When the father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the Colorado gold rush. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland. When the father returned in 1892, the family moved to Glasthule, near Dublin, where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at Sandycove and Glasthule railway station. His son attended the local national school.\n\nWhen Susan Columb died in 1897, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the Irish Railway Clearing House. He stayed in this job until 1903.\n\nDuring this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and Æ. He also joined the Gaelic League and was a member of the first board of the Abbey Theatre. He became a regular user of the National Library of Ireland, where he met James Joyce and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre's production of \"The Playboy of the Western World\", Padraic Colum's father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protestors. Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father's fine afterwards.\n\nHe collected Irish folk songs, and sometimes rewrote them almost in their entirety, including the famous \"She Moved Through the Fair\". Colum based his poem on one surviving line, while his collaborator, the musicologist Herbert Hughes noted the tune. He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly. He used it to read, study and write. He did not attend University College Dublin, or any other University as a student.\n\nHe was awarded a prize by Cumann na nGaedheal for his anti-enlistment play, \"The Saxon Shillin\"'. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the Abbey Theatre, writing several of its early productions. His first play, \"Broken Soil\" (revised as The Fiddler's House) (1903) was performed by W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company. \"The Land\" (1905), was one of that theatre's first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named \"Thomas Muskerry\" (1910).\n\nHis earliest published poems appeared in \"The United Irishman\", a paper edited by Arthur Griffith. His first book, \"Wild Earth\" (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to Æ. He published several poems in Arthur Griffith's paper, \"The United Irishman\" this time, with \"The Poor Scholar\" bringing him to the attention of WB Yeats. He became a friend of Yeats and Lady Gregory. In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the Everyman's Library edition of Edgar Allan Poe's \"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\".\n\nIn 1911, with Mary Gunning Maguire, a student from UCD, and David Houston and Thomas MacDonagh, he founded the short-lived literary journal \"The Irish Review\", which published work by Yeats, George Moore, Oliver St John Gogarty, and many other leading Revival figures.\n\nIn 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at Pádraig Pearse's experimental school, Scoil Éanna in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls' school, Scoil Íde or St. Ita's, which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil Éanna had moved to Rathfarnham. At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of Donnybrook, where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to Howth, a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most the rest of their lives.\n\nIn America, Colum took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with \"The King of Ireland's Son\" (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from Gaelic because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the New York Tribune, Hungarian Illustrator Willy Pogany suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story. Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the Newbery Honor. A contract for children's literature with Macmillan Publishers made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are \"The Adventure of Odysseus\" (1918) and \"The Children of Odin\" (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children.\n\nIn 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr Pádraic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (\"At the Gateways of the Day\") was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011. Colum also started writing novels. These include \"Castle Conquer\" (1923) and \"The Flying Swans\" (1937). The Colums spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and Nice, where Padraic renewed his friendship with James Joyce and became involved in the transcription of \"Finnegans Wake\".\n\nAfter their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at Columbia University and CCNY. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of Noh drama in his later plays.\n\nWhile in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film . It was his only screenplay. \n\nMary died in 1957 and Padraic finished \"Our Friend James Joyce\", which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the Regina Medal. He died in Enfield, Connecticut, age 90, and was buried in St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton.\n\nIn 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the Binghamton University Libraries. He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history.\n\nAsked how to say his name, he told \"The Literary Digest\" the last name was the same as the word \"column\". \"In my first name, the first \"a\" has the sound of \"au\". The ordinary pronunciation in Irish is \"pau'drig\".\"\n\n\nAs screenwriter:\n\nAs editor:\n\nPrint\n\nOnline\n\n"}

After Sonata had \"disappeared in a mysterious, corporate black hole, somewhere in eastern Canada in 1992,\" Jonathan Ingram and colleague Gerard Gartside then went on to develop Reflex, bought for $30 million by Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) in July 1996.\n\nPTC had identified the architecture, engineering and construction market as a target for its parametric modelling solutions, and bought Reflex to expand into the sector. However, the fit between Reflex and PTC's existing solutions was poor, and PTC's Pro/Reflex gained little market traction; PTC then sold the product to another US company, Beck Construction, in 1997, where it formed the kernel of a parametric estimating package called DESTINI.\n\nAround the same time, several people from PTC set up a new company, Charles River Software (renamed Revit Technology Corporation in 2000, later (2002) bought by Autodesk). Leonid Raiz and Irwin Jungreis obtained from PTC a non-exclusive, source code development license for Reflex as part of their severance package.

{"id": "26659481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26659481", "title": "Riding coat", "text": "Riding coat\n\nA riding coat or jacket is a garment originally designed as outerwear for horseback riding. It protects the wearer's upper clothes from dirt and wear and in some cases provide additional protection in the case of falls.\n\nThe Manchu \"horse jacket\" (\"magua\") was a dark blue riding coat worn by Manchurian horsemen before becoming a staple item of menswear across the Qing Empire. It subsequently developed into the Burmese taikpon and the Chinese tangzhuang.\n\nOriginal waterproof designs – similar to a mackintosh – generally comprised a full-length coat with wide skirt and leg straps to keep it in place. Other typical features included a belted waist, large patch pockets with protective flap, raglan sleeves with tab and wind cuff, fly front, throat tab and a broad collar.\n\nIn 1823 Charles Macintosh (1766–1843) patented his invention for waterproof rubberised cloth, pressing together two sheets of cotton material with dissolved India-rubber sandwiched in between. It was a brilliant idea for making any fabric weatherproof, and the very first macintosh coats were made at the family's dyestuffs factory, Charles Macintosh and Co of Glasgow.\n\nThe rubber processing pioneer Thomas Hancock (1786–1865) was aware of Macintosh’s work and in 1825 he took out a licence to manufacture the patented \"waterproof double textures\". For historical background, refer to the hardback \"The Hancocks of Marlborough\" and website \"Bouncing Balls\", author John Loadman\n\nUsing masticated scrap rubber instead, Hancock's solutions had a higher rubber content than those of Macintosh and so could more readily give a uniform film on the cloth, minimising water penetration and odour.\n\nEventually the two men co-operated, so that in 1831 Hancock became a partner in Charles Macintosh & Co and their two companies merged. One feature of the co-operation was the construction of an automated spreading machine to replace Macintosh’s original paint brushes. In 1834 Hancock's London factory burned down and Macintosh had already closed the Glasgow factory, hence all the work transferred to Manchester. See the \"Virtual Encyclopedia of Greater Manchester\"\n\nFrom then on, the manufacturing of \"proper\" raincoats or macs impervious to all weathers – constructed of two layers of rubber-coated cotton fabric or \"double textured\" – was concentrated, with all necessary expertise and experience, in Manchester or the Lancastrian cotton towns. There such rubber or rubberised products amounted to a \"cottage industry\", as confirmed by the abundance of company records in the National Archives at Kew, Surrey.\n\nClassic, belted, double-textured trench coats in off-white or fawn for riding or walking were fashionable prior to World War 2 until the end of the century as a specifically British fashion, flattering the human form and enhancing its magnetism. To see typical wartime usage, a good reference is Danger UXB (Anthony Andrews), Thames Television's acclaimed drama series first broadcast in the late 1970s, or the 1976 movie The Eagle Has Landed (film) (Donald Sutherland). The military flavour of rubberised raincoats continued with the 1997 programme Bodyguards (TV series) (as sported by John Shrapnel playing Commander MacIntyre of the elite protection team).\n\nA model pictured in the December 1944 issue of Vogue (magazine) showed the attractiveness and practicality of these macs for the fashion-conscious, whilst they appeared in favourite 1950s and 1960s feature films such as Genevieve (film) (1953) (worn by Dinah Sheridan), Me and the Colonel (1958) (Nicole Maurey) and Twice Round the Daffodils (1962) (Sheila Hancock), always sharp, clean, rustling and making a bold statement.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional gentlemen's outfitters such as Cordings, Hackett and Gieves & Hawkes continued to sell plenty of smart walking coats in thick rubberised cotton, very popular at the time. Common in Britain around 1960 were neat zipper jackets for young and old, frequently with pinched waist, and hooded anoraks in the same materials - the latter in dark green for scouting, hiking, climbing, canoeing and yet more of the great outdoors.\n\nDeveloping on from that, double-textured \"gangster\" macs were the must-have, trendy outerwear for girls with chutzpah around 1970, having originated with the Valstar \"Gangster\" brand designed by Maurice Attwood.\n\nFeaturing a signature yoke front and back, a belt and peplum, and wriststraps with buckles, these styles were sold in a range of colours, different lengths, and either cotton or viscose, at major high street stores like Debenhams (under their Debroyal brand) and C&A (Vivienne style) at prices from £10 to £20. The snazzy yoked design was all the rage among the younger set, even appearing in suitably small sizes for daughters proud to copy their mums.\n\nThis or a similar style of rainwear graced the foremost actors and actresses of the time. Cinema films included Country Dance (film) (1970) (Susannah York), Hoffman (film) (1970) (Sinéad Cusack), No Blade of Grass (1970) (Nigel Davenport, Jean Wallace, Lynne Frederick), The Ragman's Daughter (1972) (Victoria Tennant) and All Creatures Great and Small (film) (1974) (Lisa Harrow, Simon Ward). Examples of the many TV series in that period containing Valstar “Gangster” type double-textured rainwear were Take Three Girls (Liza Goddard), The Lotus Eaters (TV series) (Wanda Ventham) and Man About the House (Paula Wilcox).\n\nSince they provided effective insulation against the cold, the garments were later called “winter macs” by females, who would wear them buttoned, with upturned short collar and - to complete the look - a neckerchief giving a bright, contrasting slash of colour.\n\nThe retro \"gangster\" style has been revived as the \"Chorlton\" in a choice of five colours by Lakeland Elements of Lancaster, since Chorlton-upon-Medlock, now part of Greater Manchester, was the location of one of the early macintosh factories.\n\nOther design initiatives and variants over the years included the introduction of “light double-textured” and “single-textured” rubberised macs, again in many hues. There were ponchos, military-style capes and more recently the short, navy blue Margaret Howell hoody. Then, on the Continent of Europe, you would see the green hooded anorak or slicker, with yellow rubber lining, as worn by Anne-Laure Meury in the classic French relationship movie The Aviator's Wife (1981) and the similarly unisex Friesennerz reversible hooded anorak in yellow rubber with blue (sometimes fawn) lining, sold on Germany’s high streets and sported by Glenda Jackson in her 1978 film The Class of Miss MacMichael. Certainly the latter mac was beloved by young tourists of German nationality making pilgrimage to the fashion mecca of the Swinging Sixties, Carnaby Street in London W1.\n"}

A trained architect and a presence on the science fiction scene during the 1970s, he became a professional in the comics genre with albums such as \"Galbar\", and was allegedly the only artist to have obtained a steady income in this way during the communist period. A prolific contributor to Romanian children's magazines, Florea had his activity curbed by communist censorship when he first publicized his intention of emigrating to the United States. He eventually left the country shortly after the 1989 Revolution, and soon after began collaborating with Marvel, DC Comics and other leading enterprises in the field of comic book publishing. He became especially noted for his activities as an inker, with contributions on series such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"The Executioner\", \"\", \"Batman R.I.P.\" and \"\".\n\nFlorea has maintained enduring contacts with his native country, and has taken an initiative in popularizing the American comic book style in Romania. He has been described as one of the most successful among his colleagues, and claimed to be one of the most recognizable Romanians in his field.\n\nBorn in Ghelari, Hunedoara County, Sandu Florea first became interested in comics while in fifth grade, his first contact with the medium being through a copy of the French youth magazine \"Pif Vaillant\". This encounter, he recalled in a 2004 interview, left him with \"an impression that cannot be erased\", and \"the wish that I myself could draw such appealing and interesting characters.\"\n\nSandu Florea published his first comic strip in 1968, with \"Luminiţa\" children's magazine. It was a series centered on the anecdotal hero classic \"Păcală\". In 1971, Florea graduated from Bucharest's Architectural College, and subsequently worked for a building design institute in his adoptive city of Timişoara. Before graduation, he had also published his first work in the comics genre, inspired by the folkloric tale of \"Păcală\", and featured in a 1968 issue of \"Luminiţa\" magazine.\n\nAfter moving to Timişoara, he became a noted presence among the local science fiction fan base, joining the H. G. Wells Literary Club founded by writer Ovidiu Şurianu. Their collaboration produced the 1973 \"Galbar\", reportedly the first Romanian science fiction comic book. In 1975, he and Timişoara native Marcel Luca published what is thought to be the first-ever Romanian coloring book with a science fiction subject, \"Vreau să fiu cosmonaut\" (\"I Want to be a Cosmonaut\"), which reputedly sold 45,000 copies. By then, having received offers of collaboration from two publishing houses (Editura Ion Creangă and Editura Facla), Florea settled back in Bucharest and focused exclusively on his work in comics and illustration. Said to have been the most prolific comic book author active during the communist period, he had his work featured in almost all of the children's periodicals in print at the time.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was creating and publishing comic books dedicated to popular legends, such as a retake on Ion Creangă's fantasy story \"Harap Alb\", or recounting episodes in Romanian history (involving Dacian rulers Burebista and Decebalus, Roman Emperor Trajan, and Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave). Several single-issue albums in this category were based on texts by historical fiction author Radu Theodoru, forming part of the series \"Strămoşii\" (\"The Ancestors\"). The full list includes: \"Cavalerul alb\" (\"The White Knight\"; Editura Facla, 1976), \"Călugăreni\" (referencing the Battle of Călugăreni; Editura Ion Creangă, 1977), \"Misiune de sacrificiu\" (\"Suicidal Mission\"; Editura Ion Creangă, 1979), \"În lumea lui Harap Alb\" (\"Inside Harap Alb's World\"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1979), \"Burebista, regele dacilor\" (\"Burebista, King of the Dacians\"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1980), ' (\"Decebalus and Trajan\"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1981), ' (\"Carousel\"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1982), \"Sarmizegetusa eroică\" (\"Heroic Sarmizegetusa\"; Editura Sport-Turism, 1983). Florea was also involved in creating Romania's own Western comics, adapted from stories by Nicolae Frînculescu.\n\nThese works received critical attention, both in Romania and abroad. \"În lumea lui Harap Alb\" earned him the a Eurocon award (1980). This, literary critic Michael Hăulică notes, made Florea one in a final wave of Romanian Eurocon laureates to have emerged under communism (also including writers Vladimir Colin, Ion Hobana and Gheorghe Săsărman).\n\nFlorea also received attention from celebrated poet Nichita Stănescu, who discovered in ' an unclassifiable and imaginative work. The writer argued: \"[Florea] introduces mystery where we usually had happy-endings, imagination where there was lyricism and an indecisive epic where there was nothing. The book he calls ' [...] is without precedent, in Romania and everywhere else.\" In 1982, Stănescu began working with him on the album \"Semne şi desemne\" (\"Signs and Designs\"). Florea printed the lithographs to go with the poems, but the project was cut short when Stănescu died (December 1983).\n\nThe 1984-1989 interval was described by Florea as \"one of the most difficult periods in my life.\" Having unsuccessfully demanded from communist authorities the right of leaving for the United States, where two of his siblings had already settled, Florea was exposed to political persecution, and the censorship apparatus lifted his right to publish, prompting him to contribute several comic strips under various pseudonyms. He returned to public attention after the 1989 Revolution, when he was briefly editor in chief of the new children's magazine \"\". With Frînculescu, he also founded another such publication, called \"Proteus\".\n\nSandu Florea, his wife and two children eventually left for the United States in 1991, moving to New York City and afterward settling in Long Island. Although initially discouraged by the competition among comic book artists, Florea recounts, he decided to contact Marvel recruiters within three months of his arrival, submitting a sample of his take on \"Conan the Barbarian\". According to his own statement, Conan proved compatible with his talents: \"[he was] the only Marvel character who did not fly, did not breathe fire and did not use psychic waves to defeat his enemies, being instead armed with a giant sword and axe. Since I had been drawing many historical tales back in the old country, Conan was a character whom I could depict in drawing with relative ease.\"\n\nHe was accepted by Marvel soon after this, specialized as an inker, and began working on several of its main releases, including, alongside \"Conan\", \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" and the various spin-offs of \"Avengers\", \"Blackwulf\", \"Elektra\", \"Mighty Thor\", \"Captain America\", \"Doctor Strange\", \"Fantastic Four\" and \"X-Men\". He also worked with DC Comics (on \"Superman Second Series\", \"Batman\", \"Justice Society of America\", \"Nightwing\") and Dark Horse Comics, signing additional collaborations with Innovation Publishing, Vivid Comics (on \"The Executioner\") and Chaos! Comics (\"Lady Death\", \"Undertaker\"). Among the significant miniseries to which he contributed as an inker are \"\" (2004–2006), \"Batman R.I.P.\" (2008), and \"\" (2009). His work with Dark Horse included \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Angel\". His artistic production also touched other media: Florea created storyboards and other graphics for the motion picture producers Full Moon, as well as book illustrations for \"The Princeton Review\".\n\nFlorea was selected honorary president of the Romanian Association of Comic Book Fans in 2001. Speaking in 2004, he expressed interest in relaunching the native comic book genre in his native country, and in publishing a new children's periodical with original content. In 2006, he participated in the relaunch of \"\", in a version argued by Hăulică to have been \"professional under any definition.\"\n\nThe publication, which went out of print after only two issues due to distribution problems, included Romanian-language reprints of American comics such as \"Conan the Barbarian\" and \"Aliens\", alongside original collaborations between Florea and his Romanian colleagues: \"Două paloşe\" (\"Two Backswords\", with Florea as artist and György Györfi-Deák as writer), \"Ultima frontieră\" (\"The Final Frontier\", text by Florea, Marian Mirescu and Eddie Pandele, drawings by Daniel Rizea and Cătălin Gospodin), \"Toxic\" (text by Florea, drawings by Tudor Popa), \"Leviathan\" (written by Cristian Lăzărescu, illustrated by Florea). The magazine also featured \"Borderland\", a comic series conceived especially for a Romanian public by writer John Warner and illustrated by Florea, depicting the confrontation between three worlds: of the Mortals, of Magic and of the Demons. Around the same time, Sandu Florea also began contributing to various Romanian webzines, such as \"Pro-Scris\", \"Imagikon\" and \"Paradox\"—the latter of which published his strip \"Fortăreaţa\", based on a short story by Ovidiu Bufnilă. Several aspects related to the artist's new Romanian ventures were however criticized by Michael Hăulică. He argued that \"Toxic\" in particular was \"weak and obvious\", and noted that, in its featured edition, the text of \"Borderland\" evidenced its translator's poor command of the Romanian language.\n\nThese initiatives helped cement the artist's reputation in Romania. Sandu Florea claims to be \"The only Romanian professional graphic artist who has managed to make a living exclusively out of his drawings, in the old country as well as [...] in America.\" Dodo Niţă, a historiographer of Romanian comics and Florea's colleague at \"\", placed \"În lumea lui Harap Alb\" as fifth among an all-time chart of original Romanian works in the genre. According to a 2008 piece in the Romanian daily \"Evenimentul Zilei\", Florea shares the distinction of \"best known Romanian comic book artist\" with Mircea Arapu, the latter being known for his contribution in Francophone comics.\n\nAn annual Romanian comic book fan convention in Constanţa awards the Sandu Florea Prize to artists with a long contribution in their field. In 2010, Florea was guest of honor at the European Comic Strip Salon, organized by the Romanian Cultural Institute (ICR) at the National Theater Bucharest. He exhibited his work, including the never before seen \"Semne şi desemne\" collection, at the Bucharest \"Comic Book Museum\" exhibit, jointly organized by the ICR and the Belgian Comic Strip Center in 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "15298590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15298590", "title": "Spintria", "text": "Spintria\n\nA spintria (plural, \"spintriae\") is a small bronze or brass Roman token, possibly for use in brothels, although none of the literature on the \"spintriae\" contains any evidence to support this assertion. The tokens usually depict on the obverse a motif of sexual acts or symbols and a numeral in the range I - XVI on the reverse.\n\n\"Spintria\" was used by Suetonius to refer to young male prostitutes, from Greek σφιγκτήρ (sphinktḗr, \"[anal] sphincter\"). In the 16th century, the name passed from the ancient sense of the persons committing outrageous acts--in other words, sexual and/or sensual acts outside what was considered the norm--(or the place where outrageous acts occurred, such as Tiberius' gardens on the isle of Capri) to the tokens themselves. Bette Talvacchia identifies the first usage of the term \"spintriae\" to refer to the tokens as occurring in Sebastiano Errizo's 1559 treatise, \"Discourse Concerning Ancient Medals\" (\"Sopra le Medaglie Antiche\", Venice, 1559).\n\nSome scholars, following Friedlander's (1886) suggestion that the tokens were used \"auf die man in Bordelle Einlass erheilt\" (\"to obtain entry to brothels\") have argued that \"spintriae\" were used to pay prostitutes, although none offer any supporting evidence. Buttrey is dismissive of the brothel token idea, asserting \"there is no evidence for any of this\" (Buttrey 1973, p. 53). Currently, only Simonetta and Riva are supporters of the brothel token hypothesis, which is also popular with the media (see Duggan 2016); other scholars pursue alternate lines of enquiry (Buttrey; Campana; Duggan; Fishburn; etc.). Under Caracalla, an equestrian was sentenced to death for bringing a coin with the emperor's likeness into a brothel; he was spared only by the emperor's own death. There is no direct ancient evidence, however, to support the theory that \"spintriae\" were created as tokens for exchange in place of official coinage. Numismatist Theodore V. Buttrey suggests that they were used as game pieces. although Duggan (2016) notes there are no archaeological finds to confirm the \"spintriae\" were gaming pieces. Economist Geoffrey Fishburn, following Jacobelli, suggests they may have been used as locker tokens.\n\nIt is doubtful these tokens were used to gain entry to brothels or to pay for the services of prostitutes. Duggan concludes, after Fishburn and Jacobelli, that the most convincing explanation is that they functioned as locker tokens. They seem to have been produced for only a short period, mostly in the 1st century AD.\n\nThey were usually struck from brass or bronze, and were little smaller than a U.S. quarter. Some commentators suggest some of the tokens depicted homosexual acts between men, but this is not widely accepted in the literature, as some authors (Buttrey; Jacobelli; Talvacchia) assert the erotic scenes are exclusively heterosexual.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "744036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744036", "title": "Sublime (philosophy)", "text": "Sublime (philosophy)\n\nIn aesthetics, the sublime (from the Latin \"sublīmis\") is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.\n\nThe first known study of the \"sublime\" is ascribed to Longinus: Peri Hupsous/Hypsous or \"On the Sublime\". This is thought to have been written in the 1st century AD though its origin and authorship are uncertain. For Longinus, the sublime is an adjective that describes great, elevated, or lofty thought or language, particularly in the context of rhetoric. As such, the sublime inspires awe and veneration, with greater persuasive powers. Longinus' treatise is also notable for referring not only to Greek authors such as Homer, but also to biblical sources such as Genesis.\n\nThis treatise was rediscovered in the 16th century, and its subsequent impact on aesthetics is usually attributed to its translation into French by linguist Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux in 1674. Later the treatise was translated into English by John Pultney in 1680, Leonard Welsted in 1712, and William Smith in 1739 whose translation had its fifth edition in 1800.\n\nThe development of the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality in nature distinct from beauty was first brought into prominence in the 18th century in the writings of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, third earl of Shaftesbury, and John Dennis, in expressing an appreciation of the fearful and irregular forms of external nature, and Joseph Addison's synthesis of concepts of the sublime in his \"The Spectator\", and later the \"Pleasures of the Imagination\". All three Englishmen had, within the span of several years, made the journey across the Alps and commented in their writings of the horrors and harmony of the experience, expressing a contrast of aesthetic qualities.\n\nJohn Dennis was the first to publish his comments in a journal letter published as \"Miscellanies\" in 1693, giving an account of crossing the Alps where, contrary to his prior feelings for the beauty of nature as a \"delight that is consistent with reason\", the experience of the journey was at once a pleasure to the eye as music is to the ear, but \"mingled with Horrours, and sometimes almost with despair\". Shaftesbury had made the journey two years prior to Dennis but did not publish his comments until 1709 in the \"Moralists\". His comments on the experience also reflected pleasure and repulsion, citing a \"wasted mountain\" that showed itself to the world as a \"noble ruin\" (Part III, Sec. 1, 390–91), but his concept of the sublime in relation to beauty was one of degree rather than the sharp contradistinction that Dennis developed into a new form of literary criticism. Shaftesbury's writings reflect more of a regard for the awe of the infinity of space (\"Space astonishes\" referring to the Alps), where the sublime was not an aesthetic quality in opposition to beauty, but a quality of a grander and higher importance than beauty. In referring to the Earth as a \"Mansion-Globe\" and \"Man-Container\" Shaftsbury writes \"How narrow then must it appear compar'd with the capacious System of its own Sun...tho animated with a sublime Celestial Spirit...\" (Part III, sec. 1, 373).\n\nJoseph Addison embarked on the Grand Tour in 1699 and commented in \"Remarks on Several Parts of Italy etc.\" that \"The Alps fill the mind with an agreeable kind of horror\". The significance of Addison's concept of the sublime is that the three pleasures of the imagination that he identified; greatness, uncommonness, and beauty, \"arise from visible objects\" (that is, from sight rather than from rhetoric). It is also notable that in writing on the \"Sublime in external Nature\", he does not use the term \"sublime\" but uses semi-synonymous terms: \"unbounded\", \"unlimited\", \"spacious\", \"greatness\", and on occasion terms denoting excess.\n\nAddison's notion of greatness was integral to the concept of sublimity. An object of art could be beautiful yet it could not possess greatness. His \"Pleasures of the Imagination\", as well as Mark Akenside's \"Pleasures of the Imagination\" of 1744 and Edward Young's poem \"Night Thoughts\" of 1745 are generally considered the starting points for Edmund Burke's analysis of sublimity.\n\nEdmund Burke developed his conception of sublimity in \"A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\" of 1756. Burke was the first philosopher to argue that sublimity and beauty are \"mutually exclusive\". The dichotomy that Burke articulated is not as simple as Dennis' opposition, and is antithetical in the same degree as light and darkness. Light may accentuate beauty, but either great light or darkness, i. e., the absence of light, is sublime to the extent that it can annihilate vision of the object in question. What is \"dark, uncertain, and confused\" moves the imagination to awe and a degree of horror. While the relationship of sublimity and beauty is one of mutual exclusivity, either can provide pleasure. Sublimity may evoke horror, but knowledge that the perception is a fiction is pleasureful.\n\nBurke's concept of sublimity was an antithetical contrast to the classical conception of the aesthetic quality of beauty being the pleasurable experience that Plato described in several of his dialogues, e. g. \"Philebus\", \"Ion\", \"Hippias Major\", and \"Symposium\", and suggested that ugliness is an aesthetic quality in its capacity to instill intense emotions, ultimately providing pleasure. For Aristotle, the function of artistic forms was to instill pleasure, and he first pondered the problem that an object of art representing ugliness produces \"pain.\" Aristotle's detailed analysis of this problem involved his study of tragic literature and its paradoxical nature as both shocking and having poetic value. The classical notion of ugliness prior to Edmund Burke, most notably described in the works of Saint Augustine of Hippo, denoted it as the absence of form and therefore as a degree of non-existence. For St. Augustine, beauty is the result of the benevolence and goodness of God in His creation, and as a category it had no opposite. Because ugliness lacks any attributive value, it is formless due to the absence of beauty.\n\nBurke's treatise is also notable for focusing on the physiological effects of sublimity, in particular the dual emotional quality of fear and attraction that other authors noted. Burke described the sensation attributed to sublimity as a \"negative pain\", which he denominated \"delight\" and which is distinct from positive pleasure. \"Delight\" is thought to result from the removal of pain, caused by confronting a sublime object, and supposedly is more intense than positive pleasure. Though Burke's explanations for the physiological effects of sublimity, e. g. tension resulting from eye strain, were not seriously considered by later authors, his empirical method of reporting his own psychological experience was more influential, especially in contrast to the analysis of Immanuel Kant. Burke is also distinguished from Kant in his emphasis on the subject's realization of his physical limitations rather than any supposed sense of moral or spiritual transcendence.\n\nImmanuel Kant, in 1764, made an attempt to record his thoughts on the observing subject's mental state in \"Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\". He held that the sublime was of three kinds: the noble, the splendid, and the terrifying.\n\nIn his \"Critique of Judgment\" (1790), Kant officially says that there are two forms of the sublime, the mathematical and the dynamical, although some commentators hold that there is a third form, the moral sublime, a layover from the earlier \"noble\" sublime. Kant claims, \"We call that sublime which is absolutely great\"(§ 25). He distinguishes between the \"remarkable differences\" of the Beautiful and the Sublime, noting that beauty \"is connected with the form of the object\", having \"boundaries\", while the sublime \"is to be found in a formless object\", represented by a \"boundlessness\" (§ 23). Kant evidently divides the sublime into the mathematical and the dynamical, where in the mathematical \"aesthetical comprehension\" is not a consciousness of a mere greater unit, but the notion of absolute greatness not inhibited with ideas of limitations (§ 27). The dynamically sublime is \"nature considered in an aesthetic judgment as might that has no dominion over us\", and an object can create a fearfulness \"without being afraid \"of\" it\" (§ 28). He considers both the beautiful and the sublime as \"indefinite\" concepts, but where beauty relates to the \"Understanding\", sublime is a concept belonging to \"Reason\", and \"shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense\" (§ 25). For Kant, one's inability to grasp the magnitude of a sublime event such as an earthquake demonstrates inadequacy of one's sensibility and imagination. Simultaneously, one's ability to subsequently identify such an event as singular and whole indicates the superiority of one's cognitive, supersensible powers. Ultimately, it is this \"supersensible substrate,\" underlying both nature and thought, on which true sublimity is located.\n\nTo clarify the concept of the feeling of the sublime, Arthur Schopenhauer listed examples of its transition from the beautiful to the most sublime. This can be found in the first volume of his \"The World as Will and Representation\", § 39.\n\nFor him, the feeling of the beautiful is in seeing an object that invites the observer to transcend individuality, and simply observe the idea underlying the object. The feeling of the sublime, however, is when the object does not invite such contemplation but instead is an overpowering or vast malignant object of great magnitude, one that could destroy the observer.\n\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel considered the sublime a marker of cultural difference and a characteristic feature of oriental art. His teleological view of history meant that he considered \"oriental\" cultures as less developed, more autocratic in terms of their political structures and more fearful of divine law. According to his reasoning, this meant that oriental artists were more inclined towards the aesthetic and the sublime: they could engage God only through \"sublated\" means. He believed that the excess of intricate detail that is characteristic of Chinese art, or the dazzling metrical patterns characteristic of Islamic art, were typical examples of the sublime and argued that the disembodiment and formlessness of these art forms inspired the viewer with an overwhelming aesthetic sense of awe.\n\nRudolf Otto compared the sublime with his newly coined concept of the numinous. The numinous comprises terror, \"Tremendum\", but also a strange fascination, \"Fascinans\".\n\nThe last decades of the 19th century saw the rise of \"Kunstwissenschaft\", or the \"science of art\"—a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics Max Dessoir founded the \"Zeitschrift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft\", which he edited for many years, and published the work \"Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft\" in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic.\n\nThe experience of the sublime involves a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might, and is similar to the experience of the tragic. The \"tragic consciousness\" is the capacity to gain an exalted state of consciousness from the realization of the unavoidable suffering destined for all men and that there are oppositions in life that can never be resolved, most notably that of the \"forgiving generosity of deity\" subsumed to \"inexorable fate\".\n\nThomas Weiskel re-examined Kant's aesthetics and the Romantic conception of the sublime through the prism of semiotic theory and psychoanalysis. He argued that Kant's \"mathematical sublime\" could be seen in semiotic terms as the presence of an excess of signifiers, a monotonous infinity threatens to dissolve all oppositions and distinctions. The \"dynamic sublime\", on the other hand, was an excess of signifieds: meaning was always overdetermined.\n\nAccording to Jean-François Lyotard, the sublime, as a theme in aesthetics, was the founding move of the Modernist period. Lyotard argued that the modernists attempted to replace the beautiful with the release of the perceiver from the constraints of the human condition. For him, the sublime's significance is in the way it points to an \"aporia\" (impassable doubt) in human reason; it expresses the edge of our conceptual powers and reveals the multiplicity and instability of the postmodern world.\n\nAccording to Mario Costa, the concept of the sublime should be examined first of all in relation to the epochal novelty of digital technologies, and technological artistic production: new media art, computer-based generative art, networking, telecommunication art. For him, the new technologies are creating conditions for a new kind of sublime: the \"technological sublime\". The traditional categories of aesthetics (beauty, meaning, expression, feeling) are being replaced by the notion of the sublime, which after being \"natural\" in the 18th century, and \"metropolitan-industrial\" in the modern era, has now become technological.\n\nThere has also been some resurgence of interest in the sublime in analytic philosophy since the early 1990s, with occasional articles in \"The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism\" and \"The British Journal of Aesthetics\", as well as monographs by writers such as Malcolm Budd, James Kirwan and Kirk Pillow. As in the postmodern or critical theory tradition, analytic philosophical studies often begin with accounts of Kant or other philosophers of the 18th or early 19th centuries. Noteworthy is a general theory of the sublime, in the tradition of Longinus, Burke and Kant, in which Tsang Lap Chuen takes the notion of limit-situations in human life as central to the experience.\n\nJadranka Skorin-Kapov in \"The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity\" argues for sublimity as the common root to aesthetics and ethics, \"The origin of surprise is the break (the pause, the rupture) between one's sensibility and one's powers of representation... The recuperation that follows the break between one's sensibility and one's representational capability leads to sublimity and the subsequent feelings of admiration and/or responsibility, allowing for the intertwining of aesthetics and ethics... The roles of aesthetics and ethics—that is, the roles of artistic and moral judgments, are very relevant to contemporary society and business practices, especially in light of the technological advances that have resulted in the explosion of visual culture and in the mixture of awe and apprehension as we consider the future of humanity.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Among their examples is the island city of Nan Madol. The book claims that its construction, with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials, necessitates a high degree of technical competency. Since no such society exists in the modern record or even, in legend, the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means.\n\nWhile other explanations beside a global meteorological event are possible, a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth. Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs, these animals must have been killed quickly, in otherwise normal conditions. They were preserved so well by quick freezing, which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event.\n\nInterspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios, written in italics, describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur.

It was the first of its kind in the history of the animated television line-up on Fox. Kevin Reilly, the entertainment president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, originally pitched the idea for the crossover, which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s. MacFarlane described the crossover event to be an \"enormous challenge\" and a \"substantial undertaking\"; he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters. \nHe was also willing to do another crossover event if this one receives successful ratings.\n\nIn April 2011, the executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company officially announced that the episode would air on May 1 as part of the \"Night of the Hurricane\" crossover, alongside the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Seahorse Seashell Party\" and the \"American Dad!\" episode \"Hurricane!\". However, on April 29, it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule, in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. The crossover was subsequently replaced by repeats of \"I Am the Walrus\" from \"American Dad!\", \"Brian Writes a Bestseller\" from \"Family Guy\", and \"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\" from \"The Cleveland Show\". MacFarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of Fox, and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episode would air the succeeding season.\n\n\"The Hurricane!\" first aired in the United States on October 2, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox. It was preceded by episodes of \"The Simpsons\", and its sister shows \"American Dad!\" and \"Family Guy\". It was viewed by 4.73 million viewers upon its initial airing, despite simultaneously airing with \"Desperate Housewives\" on ABC, \"Amazing Race\" on CBS, and a match between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets on NBC. \"The Hurricane!\" garnered a 2.6/6 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielsen ratings.\n\n\n"}

On August 31, 2015, TV Land renewed the series for a 12-episode second season, which premiered on June 19, 2016.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan announced that the series would not be returning for a third season so they could spend more time with their kids.\n\n\nComedians Chris Rock, Dave Attell, Bill Burr, Hannibal Buress, John Mulaney, Whitney Cummings, Jim Norton, Will Ferrell and political personality Joe Scarborough make guest appearances as fictional versions of themselves, as do TV personality Jimmy Fallon and actors Steve Buscemi, Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane and Alec Baldwin. Macaulay Culkin makes multiple cameo appearances as himself holding different low-income jobs and appearing on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\".\n\nNBC first showed interest in the show, but eventually passed. CBS previously tried twice to develop Jim Gaffigan's semi-autobiographical series. While still in talks with NBC, Jeannie would have played herself in the show, however CBS decided to cast someone—a decision she agreed with—and she joined in casting the role. The network ordered a pilot episode in January 2013, at which time Mira Sorvino was attached to play Gaffigan's wife, with Christian Barillas and Tongayi Chirisa in supporting roles. CBS passed on the series in May 2013 and instead planned to redevelop it for the 2014-15 television season. The series was recast with new cast members Williams, Goldberg and Black. CBS passed on the series in May 2014, and Sony Pictures Television began shopping it to other networks. It was announced in July 2014 that TV Land had ordered the series and, unlike previous networks, granted the Gaffigans full creative control. Jim Gaffigan said of the announcement: \"I am thrilled that TV Land is giving us this opportunity to do this show that Peter, Jeannie and I have been fine-tuning for three years.\" TV Land president Larry W. Jones said the series was perfect for its target audience of Generation Xers who are raising families. Jones said: \"We love Jim Gaffigan's brand of humor. The second we saw this show we knew we wanted it on TV Land.\"\n\nThe series is partially based on the real lives of Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, who have five children and live in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City. The age differences between the children were shortened for the television show, and Jeannie said, \"The TV kids are sort of a snapshot of an earlier time in our lives when they were all younger\". Episodes are built around actual incidents they've experienced. Other regular topics of Jim Gaffigan's stand-up comedy are part of the series, particularly his love of food. Jeannie said the list of props for the show is \"almost 90 percent food ... which I thought was pretty funny\".\n\nAlthough Jim will play a comedian, a conscious decision was made not to regularly intersperse the narrative with his stand-up comedy, like in such popular shows as \"Seinfeld\" and \"Louie\". He said of this decision: \"I want this to be more about what happens off the stage. ... 'Stand-up comedian' is an occupation and, like our pilot, we're evolving into a much more mature show.\" Jim Gaffigan and Peter Tolan wrote the pilot together. The rest of the series is written by Jim and his wife Jeannie.\n\nJeff Lowell was the showrunner for Season 1 \"The Jim Gaffigan Show\", and served as an executive producer along with Jim and Jeannie Gaffigan, Jim's real-life wife, a fictional version of whom will also appear in the show. Jeannie took over the showrunner position for Season 2. Alex Murray and Sandy Wernick will also be executive producers.\n\nProduction on the single-camera series began in 2015. Filming occurred at such New York City locations as Katz's Delicatessen and the Gotham Comedy Club. The set is an exact replica of their former apartment, set on a soundstage.\n\nComedy Central, a cable network owned by TV Land parent company Viacom, will air episodes of the series one week after they debut. New episodes are simulcast on Nick at Nite. Episodes are available on video on demand on cable outlets and for streaming on Hulu (with a paid subscription) three weeks after airing on TV Land.\n\nIn Canada, \"The Jim Gaffigan Show\" airs on The Comedy Network. The show debuted on the network on December 1, 2015.\n\nEarly critical reviews were largely positive, with mixed comparisons to the show \"Louie\". Grading the show with an \"A\", Diane Werts with \"Newsday\" called the show \"This summer's must-see comedy smash,\" adding, \"I can't remember laughing out loud so consistently at a situation comedy maybe, um, ever.\" In an overall favorable review, \"The New York Times\" called the show \"quite funny.\" TV critic Ken Tucker said the show \"gets better with each episode.\" Some critics found the show too sterile. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said \"Gaffigan's good-naturedness is pleasant, if not particularly interesting.\" \"Entertainment Weekly\", giving the show a \"B-\", said it was mostly \"stray one-liners and stilted semi-riffs. Imagine a less nourishing \"Louie\" or \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\".\" \"The Washington Post\" remarked that, while \"Gaffigan has perfected his shtick...It works as a stage presence, but not so much as a TV character.\"\n\nDespite an overall positive critical reception, Jim and Jeannie decided not to pursue a third season. In a statement released on Jim Gaffigan's Twitter, he announced that \"the time commitment to make the quality of show we wanted was taking us away from our most important project, our five children.\" \n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n"}

{"id": "39177297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39177297", "title": "Translation criticism", "text": "Translation criticism\n\nTranslation criticism is the systematic study, evaluation, and interpretation of different aspects of translated works. It is an interdisciplinary academic field closely related to literary criticism and translation theory. It includes marking of student translations, and reviews of published translations.\n\nThe concept itself of \"translation criticism\" has the following meanings:\n\nOne of the goals of translation criticism is to raise awareness of the delicacy involved in translation and to explore whether the translator has achieved their goals or not. Whether or not translation criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from translation theory is a matter of some controversy.\n\nThe translation professionals and laymen who engage in literary translation inevitably face the issue of translation quality. Translation criticism has several open issues, such as the name for the practice of evaluating translations, and the criteria for evaluation, each of which merits a detailed study.\n\nA literary text may be explored as a translation, not primarily to judge it, but to understand where the text stands in relation to its original by examining the interpretative potential that results from the translational choices that have been made. When comparing different translations from a same original text, the results of the analyses should be used to construct a hypothesis about each translation: criteria such as \"divergent similarity\", \"relative divergence\", \"radical divergence\" and \"adaptation\" are important for such an analysis.\n\nA very influential author in the field was Antoine Berman, who claimed that there may be many different methods for translation criticism as there are many translation theories; therefore he entitled a model of his own as an analytical path, which can be modulated according to the specific objectives of each analyst and adapted to all standardized text types. He further insists that every translator shall develop first a translation project, prior to the translation process itself.\n\nAlthough a debatable subject it can be said that translation criticism is required. For instance, in Turkey, since the establishment of the Translation Bureau in 1940, the Turkish literary system has been extensively enriched by translations from various languages and the translation activity has been evaluated by writers, translators and critics.A methodology for descriptive translation studies was put forward by Gideon Toury. In it he suggests that translators should constantly take decisions during the translation process. In short, scholars working within this paradigm have claimed that translations should be described in accordance with the target norms that are valid at a specific time and place and compared with their original ones in order to produce an objective translation criticism supported by translation theories (Toury 1980: 73).\n\n\n\n"}

The film was released in cinemas in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan on 30 January 2014, in the United States on 22 May 2015 and in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2015.\nThe film is directed by Oleg Stepchenko, based on the first manuscript of Nikolai Gogol. The film has been in production since December 2005 and stopped several times due to lack of funding. In October 2012, the filming was completed. \"Viy\" was a huge commercial success, even breaking a record for opening weekend in Russia, but was met with mixed reviews in media.\n\nEarly-18th-century cartographer Jonathan Green undertakes a scientific voyage from Western Europe to the East. Having passed through Transylvania and crossed the Carpathian Mountains, he finds himself in a small village lost in impassable woods of Ukraine. Nothing but chance and heavy fog could bring him to this cursed place. People who live here do not resemble any other people which the traveler saw before that. The villagers, having dug a deep moat to fend themselves from the rest of the world, share a naive belief that they could save themselves from evil, failing to understand that evil has made its nest in their souls and is waiting for an opportunity to gush out upon the world.\n\n\nIn 2006, Russian producer Alexey Petrukhin and Russian director Oleg Stepchenko decided that they wanted to make a film based on the horror story of \"Viy\" by Nikolai Gogol. By then, two other projects based on Gogol's tale were in production, such as \"Taras Bulba\" film from 2009 and \"The Witch\" from 2006.\n\nIn order to secure the title, they needed without any further delay to release the information on the forthcoming project. In the course of three days, they filmed a teaser trailer where the role of Khoma Brutus was played by Petrukhin himself. Only after that did the active production of the film begin. When the teaser was shown in theaters, the script was not yet written and the actors were not cast. The story kept growing and changing until it turned from a simple screen version into a big-budget fantasy thriller.\n\nThe authors understood that the new times set new rules, so in 2011 they made a difficult but very important decision: they decided re-shoot the picture in 3D, even though half of the footage was already filmed. Conversion was out of the question. The decision to re-shoot was not just a PR trick. The re-shooting was taken seriously—the producers developed an innovative technology that had no parallels in the world.\n\n\"Viy\" is an intersection of two storylines. One is the narrative from Nikolai Gogol's horror story. The writers used the first edition of the story still untouched by Belinskiy's proofs. The original version has quite different motifs and the whole narrative focuses on a different kind of drama. What's more important, this version abounds in secrets and riddles. Thus, Gogol's immortal story will be screened without cuts. The second storyline is centered on a real person—Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan (1595–1685)—a French traveler and cartographer who was the first to study the Ukrainian territories and their people and culture. His research is included in the book \"From Transylvania to Muscovy\". The producers chose his figure because he was also the first to collect and systematize under one cover Slavic myths and legends. De Beauplan was a prototype of the film's main character—Jonathan Green.\n\n\"Viy\" was shot in Prague at the Gatteo, Barrandov, and Letnyany studios.\n\nThe castle in England where Green sets out on his journey is doubled in the film by the Czech Sychrov Castle. Despite being a few hundred years old—it was built in 1693—it is the newest castle in the Czech Republic. The legend goes that somewhere in the dungeons of the castle is hidden a treasure guarded by a \"Black Lady\", a woman dressed in a black gown of mourning. In order to make her figure even scarier, some storytellers began calling the lady of the castle \"the Black Widow\".\n\nThe name became so popular that it turned into a cliché and is used every time a female ghost is depicted. It found its way into hundreds of legends around the world. But the locals take the story quite seriously. In order to not shock the tourists staying in the castle overnight, it is forbidden to move any furniture—by morning all of it will be in its original place. The castle guardians explain that \"the lady of the house is putting things in order\". Zamek Sychrov serves as a film location for the second time already: in 1972 it was the set for Three Wishes for Cinderella.\n\nMost of filming sets were built in Czech Republic.\n\nFor the location shooting, a life-sized Cossack hamlet, with every historical detail thoroughly reproduced, was built. It included 21 households, a marketplace, a church, a tavern, a mill, a house of pray, and watch towers. Some props were even donated later to historical museums as they were so realistic. The church—the setting for the three notorious nights—was also built for the film from scratch. During the filming of the three nights, the decorators burned over twelve thousand wax candles manufactured according to a special historical design.\n\nThe carriage in which the protagonist travels was also designed and built at one of the most famous German automobile manufacturers. The vehicle was designed to be mechanically modern, while its outside appearance was that of a piece of transport from the 18th century. The carriage cost $75,000. A second carriage worth $23,000 was also constructed to double for the interior scenes.\n\nBesides the carriage, the protagonist was equipped with other elaborate technical gadgets—cartographic tools, cryptographic equipment, and even a tablet computer. Costumes were designed by a legend in the Czech movie industry Yarmila Koneczna. She made almost 200 costumes. The main character alone owns six original suits, another seven were made for his doubles and stuntmen.\n\nSeveral actors were cast for the lead role of Jonathan Green: Vincent Cassel, Christian Slater, Tim Roth, Sean Bean, Keanu Reeves, Pierce Brosnan, and Jason Statham. The producers had official negotiations with each of the actors. It was Jason Statham who recommended his best friend Jason Flemyng for the lead. Flemyng was soon approved by the director and the producers. Christian Slater, after seeing the footage of the film, regretted that he did not appear in the film.\n\nAll the stunts and fighting scenes were choreographed by Irzi Kuba.\n\nThere are three categories of monsters in the film: made-up artists, animatronics—puppet monsters animated by machines and stunt actors—and virtual 3D ogres. Special make-up artist Petr Gorshenin, who worked on \"Vysotskiy\": Thanks for living on... and other films, said that his work on \"Viy\" was the most complicated and important.\n\nThe film is shot in real 3D. Stereoscopic design of the film was done by the German company Stereotec. Special proprietary technology was developed for the film's 3D effects: rfg_BTS (Beyond The Screen), also called Touch3D.\n\nThe producer, Alexei Petrukhin, said that originally the film was supposed to be stereoscopic. The scenes that were filmed during the first shooting period (about 20 minutes) were filmed in 2D and postconverted to 3D (in particular, episodes of Pannochka's funeral in the church were filmed that way). In 2011 the production decided to cooperate with Stereotec for the rest of the movie, a worldwide-operating, Munich-based 3D company. The rest of the picture (the remaining 2 hours) was shot with special 3D rigs from Stereotec and Cameras from ARRI in native 3D.\n\nThe live-action 3D shooting was led by director of stereography Florian Maier and stereographer Michael Laakmann, both from Stereotec. The native 3D shooting took 60 days and was performed in Czech Republic in 2011 and 2012.\n\nAntón García has composed and conducted the official score, which include the following tracks:\n\nInitially, in order to show that the picture is in production, Alexey Petrukhin and Oleg Stepchenko filmed a teaser trailer, which took them 18 hours to make, where the role of Homa Brutus (character with a bald head) was played by Petrukhin himself. The teaser was shown in cinemas although the script was not yet written and the production of the film actually began a year later.\n\nThe announced release date was 12 March 2009 which was timed for the 200th anniversary of Nikolai Gogol, but it was postponed indefinitely since then. After they finished shooting the first film of the trilogy, the producers decided to postpone the premiere until the work on the second film, \"Viy 2\" («Вий-2. Проклятое место»), is complete.\n\nOn 16 June 2010, a sneak preview of some of the finished episodes was held. The show, held in 3D, was organised by the creators of the film for their American guests, who considered distributing the picture in 80 countries around the world.\n\nIn April 2012, according to the official website of the trilogy, a new estimated release date was set as 2013. On 15 May 2013, as part of the Cannes Film Festival, RFG representatives has signed an agreement with Universal Pictures, to take part in production as Distribution Company. The film finally appeared in theatres on 30 January 2014.\n\nOn 22 May 2015, the film appeared in theatres in United States and on 1 June 2015 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first weekend take was 605.2 million rubles (some $17+ million), which is the all-time record for a Russian movie. It has grossed in Russia.\n\nReception of the film was mixed. According to Russian reviews aggregator Kritikanstvo, \"Viy\" holds an approval rating of 57%, based on 39 reviews.\n\nYury Gladilshchikov in \"The Moscow News\" gave a positive review, although he noted that the film lacks target audience, since it is too intellectual for mass production and too simple for educated audience. He also unfavorably compared it with the \"Sleepy Hollow\" by Tim Burton.\n\nMir Fantastiki magazine was more positive about the movie and even named it the best Russian science fiction/fantasy movie of 2014.\n\n\"Viy\" was released on VHS and DVD on June 2014.\n\nThe theatrical Blu-ray version of \"Viy\" dubbed to English was released in the United States in May 2015.\n\nOn 5 April 2015, a press conference was held in InterContinental Hotel in Moscow with producers Alexey Petrukhin and Sergei Selyanov, actors Jason Flemyng, Rutger Hauer, and Anna Yo. During the conference, it was confirmed that the filming of the sequel, titled \"\", has been started. The movie was partially shot in China and received help from the Jackie Chan Stunt Team, stunt coordinator He Jun, and operator Man-Ching Ng. The film is scheduled to open in 2019.\n\n\n"}
