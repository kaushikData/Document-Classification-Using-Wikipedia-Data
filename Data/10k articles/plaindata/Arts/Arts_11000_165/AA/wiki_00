It was founded in 1985 at the University of Salerno. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists, and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of media, the aesthetics of networks, and their ethical and anthropological implications.\n\nSince the late 1970s, a permanent \"Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication\" has been directed by its founder Mario Costa at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983. A conference on \"Technological Imaginary\", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in Benevento, discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that \"all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary\".\n\nThe comprehensive relationship between art and technoscience, technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international \"Artmedia\" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the Ecole Normale Supérieure, the Bibliotheque Nationale de France (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Société Française d'Esthétique, the Université du Québec à Montréal, the University of Toronto, the Universidade de São Paulo, the Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne, and the U.S. magazine Leonardo.\n\nArtmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.\n\nTheorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included Bernard Stiegler, René Berger, Abraham Moles, Derrick De Kerckhove, Pierre Levy, Gillo Dorfles, Paul Virilio, Frank Popper, Roger Malina, Daniel Charles, José Jiménez, Anne Cauquelin, Edgar Morin, Thierry de Duve, Catherine Millet, Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, Edmond Couchot, Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.\n\nArtists included Fred Forest, Roy Ascott, Takahiko Iimura, Maurizio Bolognini, Tom Klinkowstein, Tom Sherman, Eduardo Kac, Enzo Minarelli, James Dashow, Peter D'Agostino, Mit Mitropoulos, Shawn Brixey, Bruno Di Bello, Antoni Muntadas, Orlan, Kit Galloway, David Rokeby, Miguel Chevalier, Norman White, Richard Kriesche, Olivier Auber, Caterina Davinio and Casey Reas.\n\nThe questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including \"Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future\" (1985), \"Global aesthetic communication\" (1986), \"Electronic performativity and the art system\" (1990), \"Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication\" (1992), \"Aesthetic research and technology\" (1995), \"Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation?\" (1999), \"From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art\" (2002), and \"Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning\" (2008).\n\nAll Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the Institut National de l'Audiovisuel.\n\nAn assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on \"The aesthetic object of the future\", held at the University of Salerno in 2009.

The terms \"Big Beautiful Women\" and \"BBW\" were coined by Carole Shaw in 1979, when she launched \"BBW Magazine\", a fashion and lifestyle magazine for \"plus-size\" women. \n\nThe term is a subjective, visually determined concept that does not have an explicit lower or upper weight limitation, and may denote women who may be considered barely overweight to those who are morbidly obese. A 2009 study found that male fat admirers preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted more positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes \"these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that FAs are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness\".\n\nThe term has several near-synonyms with varying shades of meaning:\n\nAlthough \"BBW\" may have been first used in the context of BBW Magazine, the term's usage spread over the years, to the point that even women who had never heard of the magazine began to refer to themselves as \"BBWs\".\n\nSome women may adopt the term as a personal preference over the term \"Rubenesque\", or \"full-figured\", because they may not necessarily have large breasts or hips. Such terms, and others such as \"queen-sized\", \"plus-sized\", or \"fat\" may lead to feelings of marginalization or non-inclusion for some women. However, some strongly prefer the term \"fat\" over other words which they consider unnecessary euphemisms.\n\nThe abbreviation BBW can often be found used in personal ads (and online dating services) denoting an identification with (or preference for) such women, and is also used to denote events specifically targeted to such women, and persons interested in them, such as specific gathering nights in dance clubs, restaurants, and fashion stores and shows.\n\nThe term is also commonly used as a positive euphemism by those involved with the fat acceptance movement.\n\nThere are a wide range of websites dedicated to the topic of big beautiful woman, including sites which are dedicated to sending out a size-positive message towards larger women, some of which denounce the dieting industry as encouraging women to lose weight to conform to what is considered the ideal by mainstream society. Big beautiful women are also on a number of pornographic websites which may include content which is sexually fetishistic in nature (including fat fetishism and feederism).\n\nThe acronym BBBW refers to Big Beautiful Black Woman. Another variant is SSBBW: Super-Size Big Beautiful Woman. There is much debate on a definition for a Super-Size Big Beautiful Woman.\n\nWhile \"Big Beautiful Woman\" may be prevalent in the Americas and Europe, in Asian countries where obesity may be considered uncommon or deemed unhealthy, other terms are used. For example, in Japan the term \"debu\" (\"katakana\" デブ, \"hiragana\" でぶ) is used, but usually with a pejorative meaning, whereas \"debusen\" is the most common term used for sexual attraction to obese individuals. \"Plumper\", on the other hand, is a fetish in the popular \"bakunyū\" market of the pornographic scene.\n\n\"Big Handsome Man\" (BHM), or \"Big Hulking Men\", or sometimes \"Big Beautiful Man\" (BBM), refers to a physically or sexually attractive fat man. These men are large to extremely large. There are many subcategories of BHMs. Some are men who just happen to be large, while others attempt to become fatter. Some of these men are insecure about their size, while others embrace their obesity and feel confident. Women who are attracted to BHMs are called \"Female Fat Admirers\" (FFA). In the gay community, BHMs are called Chubs, and men who are attracted to BHMs are known as Chubby chasers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7975239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7975239", "title": "Chicago film industry", "text": "Chicago film industry\n\nThe Chicago film industry is a central hub for motion picture production and exhibition that was established before Hollywood became the undisputed capital of film making. In the early 1900s, Chicago boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers. Essanay Studios founded by George K. Spoor was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson. Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios, Broncho Billy Anderson gave birth to the western genre. Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public. This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the Great Depression. However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment. As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene. Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company. The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making. Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival. Blockbusters, such as \"Blues Brothers\", \"Sixteen Candles\", and \"The Dark Knight\", have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene. In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.\n\nEssanay Studios was a Chicago pioneer film company established in 1907 by George K. Spoor and Broncho Billy Anderson. Originally named the Peerless Film Manufacturing Company, Spoor and Anderson changed the name to Essanay by combining the first two letters of their surnames. Located on the north side on Argyle Street in Chicago, the firm grew to one of the largest film companies in the world before the rise of Hollywood.\n\nThe success of Essanay Studio was based on Spoor's and Anderson's appetite for innovation. Spoor was intrigued by Edison's Kinetoscope at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition but thought the invention could be improved. Armed with a vision, Spoor created the Magniscope, which allowed films to be projected onto flat surfaces. Spoor and Anderson installed, operated, and rented the Magniscope to many theaters around Chicago. The Magniscope innovation would eventually create legal battles between Essanay and the Edison Company and end up with the creation of the Motion Picture Patents Company. Anderson's film prowess came from on-screen achievement. He acted in the production of \"The Great Train Robbery\",and became one of the first western stars. His nickname became, \"Broncho Billy\", for his involvement with western films. Due to his love for westerns, Anderson convinced Spoor to establish Essanay branches in Boulder, Colorado and Fremont California. These locations were perfect, especially the California location, because of the steady climate and mountainous landscape.\n\nEssanay Studios in Chicago was the capital of Chicago film in the first decades of the 1900s. Charlie Chaplin started his career in 1915 at Essanay Studios. He was hired in 1915 and paid $1,250.00 per week. Chaplin improvised the scripts that were given to him by adding slapstick humor. Ben Turpin, fellow actor for Essanay, and Chaplin worked together on slapstick projects. Turpin was cross-eyed which made him a natural sidekick to the antics of Chaplin. Chaplin's only full feature production at Essanay was called \"His New Job\". Another notable actress who found a beginning at Essanay Studio was Gloria Swanson. Swanson would later star in many television and film productions including the smash hit Sunset Boulevard.\n\nDespite booming success under Charlie Chaplin, Essanay Studios soon faced a downturn. Chaplin did not like Chicago due to unpredictable weather conditions. After only one month of work, Chaplin left Chicago to head west. Spoor and Anderson soon hired French comedian, Max Linder, to take the role of Chaplin. Linder's rye humor was not appreciated by the Chicago audiences. The company suffered economically due to the inability to produce a popular film. In 1918 George Kleine purchased the studio to form a merger between Vitagraph, Lubin, Selig, and Essanay known as V-L-S-E, Incorporated which would eventually absorbed by Warner Brothers. The Essanay location would eventually be taken over by industrial film producer, Norman Wilding. Currently, the remnants of the studio are part of St. Augustine's College which built a Charlie Chaplin memorial theater on site.\n\nThe rise of the Chicago film industry in the early 1900s was a product of technological advancement marked by political strategy. In 1889, Thomas Edison and William Dickson patented the Kinetoscope. The Kinetoscope allowed a single viewer to watch a film reel through a small window. At this time, Edison did not see any practical value to the Kinetoscope and dismissed the invention as a toy. However, aspiring filmmakers began designing and patenting similar projection machines around the Kinetoscope that allowed a film to be shown to a large audience. William Selig and George K. Spoor of Essanay Studios in Chicago, the Biograph Company, and Vitagraph Company all improvised Edison's work. Film companies of this time period customarily both created movies and established a means of viewing.\n\nDespite initial ignorance to the Kinetoscope, the Edison Manufacturing Company responded to this innovation with legal action. According to the company, film outfits were showing motion pictures illegally because each of the improvised projectors violated the Kinetoscope patent. However, each film outfit had its own patent protection connected with individual innovations. Concurrent formation of a black market for projection equipment exacerbated legal issues. Following legal proceedings, the Motion Picture Patents Company was established on January 1, 1909. This coalition established a trust of the major film outfits in the United States. Firms from Chicago included in the Motion Picture Patents Company were the Vitagraph Company, the Selig Polyscope Company, the Kleine Company, and Essanay Studios. Provisions restricted movie making to these licensed firms. The trust also required outfits to pay the Edison Company royalties for use of the improvised projection equipment. To snuff out competitors, a rental system was put in place. Individuals operating theaters were now required to pay a $2 per week rental for films and projection equipment.\n\nExhibitors and filmmakers who refused to pay the newly instituted fees were not stopped by this new legislation. Independent companies were formed outside of this trust almost immediately. Max Lewis, president of the Chicago Film Exchange, announced he would not comply with the $10 monthly licensing fee on projectors. Within 48 hours of the formation of the MPPC, a Chicago-based combine of independents, the International Projecting and Producing Company (IPPC), formed to counter the MPPC's stranglehold. The IPPC, headed by the John J. Murdoch, general manager of the Western Vaudeville Managers' Association, dramatically announced the firm's formation with a $2 million base in the Feb. 6, 1909, issue of \"Show World\" magazine.\n\nIndividuals risked their own livelihood by operating independently. The major companies in the trust could sue any of these firms for violation of patent rights.\n\nChicago became a leader in motion pictures with innovative trailblazers and an interested public. In 1907, Chicago had more theaters per capita than any other city in the United States. Nickelodeons or five-cent theaters became extremely popular with the number of venues growing each year until the Great Depression. These theaters quenched the public's thirst for film and created solid neighborhood relations.\n\nRevolutionary in Chicago's film industry was the establishment of rental houses or film exchanges; in 1907, Chicago had more than 15 film exchange houses, such as The Stereopticon & Film Exchange, William Swanson & Company, Chicago Projecting Company, and the International Projecting and Producing Company, formed by JJ Murdoch as an independent Chicago-based exchange. These rental houses allowed exhibitors to borrow films at a reduced cost than actually purchasing them. This movement revolutionized motion picture viewership. It allowed patrons access to a wide array of films. The average viewer could now experience a variety of film disciplines for a small consumer cost. Rental houses also enabled theaters to change films frequently, keeping the film consumer interested. Chicago quickly became the leading film distribution market in the entire United States with control of 80% of the market in the early 1900s.\n\nMovie production also boomed. Production companies, like the Essanay Studios and the Selig Polyscope Company, dominated the film landscape. These two firms employed hundreds of people and churned out hundreds of films every year. Filmmakers shot their films outdoors due to the need for ample lighting with the primitive camera equipment. Sets took up entire city blocks at a time. The banks of the Chicago River were often used as a set for the westerns Anderson trademarked. Motion pictures were valued differently in the early era of film. Modern films are highly valued with vast amounts of resources being poured into the production value. In the early 1900s, films were viewed as products with a studio releasing multiple films per week.\n\nThe Chicago film industry met decline for a combination of reasons. The Motion Picture Patents Company, established to protect the major players in the industry, actually promoted the birth of independent ventures. These ventures sought to circumvent payment to the companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company trust. Independent firms granted creative license to the actor and often competed with the major firms despite the significantly lower budget. To avoid litigation by the Motion Picture Patents Company for patent violation, many independent firms moved west, literally out of the reach of the major production companies.\n\nIn addition to the avoidance of legal trouble, California was perfect for film making in other respects as well. Weather was notably milder compared to the unpredictability of Chicago's climate. This enabled production to move at a steady pace with greater consistency. The scenery of the west also attracted many production companies. California is made up of a diverse landscape of natural settings while Chicago offered a monotone set of plains. Filmmakers followed in the footsteps of G.M. Anderson with the desire to film westerns within the natural mountainous habitat.\n\nDespite the transition from Chicago to Hollywood in the 1920s, Chicago remained on the map. Citizens retained an insatiable appetite for motion pictures, even though production had left the city. Chicago boasted the largest chain of theaters during the studio era (1919–1952). The Balaban and Katz chain, once small west-side exhibitors, bloomed their business into a citywide phenomena. Balaban and Katz owned movie and stage palaces such as the Chicago Theatre, Ford Center for the Performing Arts Oriental Theatre, and Balaban and Katz Uptown Theatre. High-profile film companies such as MGM, Columbia Pictures, Warner Brothers, Republic, Universal, RKO, and Paramount all held offices in Chicago.\n\nMovie production again entered Chicago in the 1980 with the state of Illinois becoming a leader in money spent on film production. Notable films from the 1980s include \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Color of Money, Risky Business, The Untouchables, Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", and \"When Harry Met Sally.\" Feature film directors returned to the city including Dan Aykroyd and the Belushi family (\"Blues Brothers, About Last Night\", and \"Blues Brothers 2000\"), John Hughes (\"Sixteen Candles\" and \"The Breakfast Club\"), and Andrew Davis (\"The Fugitive\" and \"Chain Reaction\").\n\nChicago further fostered its new production boom with the passage of an Illinois bill in 2009. This bill provides a 30% tax credit on all production costs within the state of Illinois. Since instituting this law in 2009, many filmmakers have committed to Chicago for production. Recent films with Chicago as a filming location include \"\", \"Contagion\", and \"Source Code\". The new bill is supposed to benefit Chicago with increased tax revenue from $70 million in 2009 to $100 million in 2010.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1170169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1170169", "title": "Chirality (physics)", "text": "Chirality (physics)\n\nA chiral phenomenon is one that is not identical to its mirror image (see the article on mathematical chirality). The spin of a particle may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A symmetry transformation between the two is called parity transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a Dirac fermion is called chiral symmetry.\n\nAn experiment on the weak decay of cobalt-60 nuclei carried out by Chien-Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 demonstrated that parity is not a symmetry of the universe.\n\nThe helicity of a particle is \"right-handed\" if the direction of its spin is the same as the direction of its motion. It is \"left-handed\" if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard clock, with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, tossed with its face directed forwards, has left-handed helicity.\n\nMathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the spin vector onto the momentum vector: “left” is negative, “right” is positive.\nThe \"chirality\" of a particle is more abstract: It is determined by whether the particle transforms in a right- or left-handed representation of the Poincaré group.\n\nFor massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to spin in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n\nFor massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as “apparent chirality”) will be reversed.\n\nA \"massless\" particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of viewpoint (Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a “\"relativistic invariant\"” (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particles' chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the only observed massless particle is the photon. The gluon is also expected to be massless, although the assumption that it is has not been conclusively tested. Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only one of them has been confirmed by measurement. All other observed particles have mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames. It is still possible that as-yet unobserved particles, like the graviton, might be massless, and hence have invariant helicity that matches their chirality, like the photon.\n\nOnly left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions interact with the weak interaction.\nIn most circumstances, two left-handed fermions interact more strongly than right-handed or opposite-handed fermions, implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality, which violates a symmetry of the other forces of nature.\n\nChirality for a Dirac fermion is defined through the operator , which has eigenvalues ±1. \nAny Dirac field can thus be projected into its left- or right-handed component by acting with the projection operators or on .\n\nThe coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n\nA common source of confusion is due to conflating this operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this false paradox is that \"the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only\", for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, \"chirality is not the same as helicity\", so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples the weak force in one frame, does so in every frame.\n\nA theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a \"chiral theory\", while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a \"vector theory\". Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a \"vector theory\", since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n\nThe electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a \"chiral theory\". Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and only assumed the existence of left-handed neutrinos (along with their complementary right-handed antineutrinos). After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive like all other fermions, the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n\nThe exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nVector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:\nor\n\nWith flavors, we have unitary rotations instead: .\n\nMore generally, we write the right-handed and left-handed states as a projection operator acting on a spinor. The right-handed and left-handed projection operators are\nand\n\nMassive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry, as the mass term in the Lagrangian, , breaks chiral symmetry explicitly.\n\nSpontaneous chiral symmetry breaking may also occur in some theories, as it most notably does in quantum chromodynamics.\n\nThe chiral symmetry transformation can be divided into a component that treats the left-handed and the right-handed parts equally, known as vector symmetry, and a component that actually treats them differently, known as axial symmetry. (cf. Current algebra.) A scalar field model encoding chiral symmetry and its breaking is the chiral model.\n\nThe most common application is expressed as equal treatment of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations from a fixed frame of reference.\n\nThe general principle is often referred to by the name chiral symmetry. The rule is absolutely valid in the classical mechanics of Newton and Einstein, but results from quantum mechanical experiments show a difference in the behavior of left-chiral versus right-chiral subatomic particles.\n\nConsider quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with two \"massless\" quarks and (massive fermions do not exhibit chiral symmetry). The Lagrangian reads\n\nIn terms of left-handed and right-handed spinors, it reads\n\nDefining\nit can be written as\n\nThe Lagrangian is unchanged under a rotation of \"q\" by any 2×2 unitary matrix , and \"q\" by any 2×2 unitary matrix .\n\nThis symmetry of the Lagrangian is called \"flavor chiral symmetry\", and denoted as . It decomposes into\n\nThe singlet vector symmetry, , acts as\nand corresponds to baryon number conservation.\n\nThe singlet axial group acts as\nand it does not correspond to a conserved quantity, because it is explicitly violated by a quantum anomaly.\n\nThe remaining chiral symmetry turns out to be spontaneously broken by a quark condensate \nformula_15 formed through nonperturbative action of QCD gluons, \ninto the diagonal vector subgroup \"SU(2)\" known as isospin. The Goldstone bosons corresponding to the three broken generators are the three pions. \nAs a consequence, the effective theory of QCD bound states like the baryons, must now include mass terms for them, ostensibly disallowed by unbroken chiral symmetry. Thus, this chiral symmetry breaking induces the bulk of hadron masses, such as those for the nucleons — in effect, the bulk of the mass of all visible matter.\n\nIn the real world, because of the nonvanishing and differing masses of the quarks, \"SU(2)×SU(2)\" is only an approximate symmetry to begin with, and therefore the pions are not massless, but have small masses: they are pseudo-Goldstone bosons.\n\nFor more \"light\" quark species, flavors in general, the corresponding chiral symmetries are \"U(N)×U(N)\", decomposing into\nand exhibiting a very analogous chiral symmetry breaking pattern.\n\nMost usually,  = 3 is taken, the \"u, d\", and \"s\" quarks taken to be light (the Eightfold way (physics)), so then approximately massless for the symmetry to be meaningful to a lowest order, while the other three quarks are sufficiently heavy to barely have a residual chiral symmetry be visible for practical purposes.\n\nIn theoretical physics, the electroweak model breaks parity maximally. All its fermions are chiral Weyl fermions, which means that the charged weak gauge bosons only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons. (Note that the neutral electroweak Z boson couples to left \"and\" right-handed fermions.)\n\nSome theorists found this objectionable, and so conjectured a GUT extension of the weak force which has new, high energy W' and Z' bosons, which now couple with right handed quarks and leptons:\nto\n\nHere, SU(2) (pronounced SU(2) left) is none other than the above SU(2), while B−L is the baryon number minus the lepton number. The electric charge formula in this model is given by\nwhere formula_20 are the weak isospin values of the fields in the theory.\n\nThere is also the chromodynamic SU(3). The idea was to restore parity by introducing a left-right symmetry. This is a group extension of Z (the left-right symmetry) by\nto the semidirect product\n\nThis has two connected components where Z acts as an automorphism, which is the composition of an involutive outer automorphism of SU(3) with the interchange of the left and right copies of SU(2) with the reversal of U(1). It was shown by Rabindra N. Mohapatra and Goran Senjanovic in 1975 that left-right symmetry can be spontaneously broken to give a chiral low energy theory, which is the Standard Model of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam and it also connects the small observed neutrino masses to the breaking of left-right symmetry via the seesaw mechanism.\n\nIn this setting, the chiral quarks\nand\nare unified into an irreducible representation (“irrep”)\n\nThe leptons are also unified into an irreducible representation\n\nThe Higgs bosons needed to implement the breaking of left-right symmetry down to the Standard Model\nare\n\nThis then predicts three sterile neutrinos, which is perfectly consistent with neutrino oscillation data. Within the seesaw mechanism, the sterile neutrinos become superheavy without affecting physics at low energies.\n\nBecause the left-right symmetry is spontaneously broken, left-right models predict domain walls.\nThis left-right symmetry idea first appeared in the Pati–Salam model (1974), Mohapatra–Pati models (1975).\n\n\n\n"}

The \"Cato\" was the most popular medieval schoolbook for teaching Latin, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass. Cato was in common use as a Latin teaching aid as late as the 18th century, used by Benjamin Franklin. It was one of the best-known books in the Middle Ages and was translated into many languages.\n\nCato was the most popular Latin textbook during the Middle Ages, prized not only as a Latin textbook, but as a moral compass for impressionable students. It was translated into many languages, including Norse. \n\nGeoffrey Chaucer referred to Cato in \"Canterbury Tales\", through which modern students, less versed in Latin, often first come upon it. \n\nThe \"Distichs of Cato\" was most commonly referred to as simply \"Cato\". In the Middle Ages it was assumed the work had been written by Cato the Elder, or even Cato the Younger. Cato the Elder was assumed to have included tracts of the prose in his \"Carmen de Moribus\", but this was found to be a later addition. It was eventually attributed to the anonymous author Dionysius Cato (also known as Catunculus) from the 3rd or 4th century AD, based upon evidence in a manuscript discussed by Julius Caesar Scaliger (1484–1558). This manuscript no longer exists, though Scaliger found it authoritative.\n\nThe Roman jurist Licinianus, son of Cato the Younger, wrote \"Liber Catonianus\", describing Cato as an honest man who opposed Caesar's excesses. It has been argued that Licinianus might be the original author of the \"Distichs of Cato\". \n\nIn 1513 Erasmus corrected and commented on the text in a new edition of his own. \n\nCorderius made the French translation, enriching it with commentaries on classical authors. His work was aimed at children with a summary, verses and an analysis of the structure. It was actually a grammatical treatise.\n\nThere were several Spanish translations of the work of Corderius. From the first one in 1490 down to 1964, there are records of 6 Spanish translations. An authority on Michael Servetus, González Echeverría presented at the ISHM the thesis that Servetus was actually the author of the anonymous Spanish translation of 1543 of this work of Corderius.\n\nThere were several English translations, one being that of John Kingston in 1584.\n\nBenjamin Franklin probably studied Cato when he was at Boston Latin School. He cites Cato in \"Poor Richard's Almanac\" and believed in the moral advice with such fervor he was troubled to print James Logan's translation called \"Cato's Moral Distichs Englished in Couplets\" in 1735, the first in the Colonies. Of its limited need in the morally puritan New England colonies, Franklin says:\n\n\"Distich\" means closed couplets, a style of writing with two-liners. It is a collection of moral advice, each consisting of hexameters, in four books. Cato is not particularly Christian in character, but it is monotheistic.\n\n2.1.

They originate with Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye, one of the most illustrious lamas of recent history, known for his central role in the rimé or non-sectarian movement in 19th Century Tibet. Jigme Namgyel (b. 1964) is the present Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche. He is the second or third incarnation, depending on whether Lodro Thaye is counted (he was not known as \"Dzigar Kongtrul\"—that lineage is one of five distinct subsequent variants beginning after his death).\n\nThe second Dzigar Kongtrul, Lodrö Rabpel, was recognized by his root guru the 15th Karmapa, Khakyab Dorje, along with Karsey Kongtrul. He was the younger brother of Dzigar Chogtrül, a Drukpa Kagyü of a long incarnate lineage.\n\nHis bases of activity were Palpung Monastery, Tsanda Rinchen Drag and Dzong Shö, and later he founded a monastery known as Rango Tsokha near Neten Gön, the monastery of the 2nd Neten Chokling Rinpoche to whom he was very close. According to Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a contemporary master who died in 1996, Lodro Rabpel was renowned throughout Derge for his eloquence.\n\nThe present Dzigar Kongtrul was born in the Northern Indian province of Himachal Pradesh to Tibetan refugee parents; his father was the third Neten Chokling Rinpoche and his mother, Mayum Tsewang Palden, practiced all her life, even in the midst of raising five children. Rinpoche grew up in a monastic environment. He was trained in the Longchen Nyingtik lineage of the Nyingma school as well as the Khyen-Kong Chok-Sum lineages (those of Jamgon Kongtrul, Khyentse Wangpo and Chokgyur Lingpa—the three primary figures in the rimé movement) by his root guru H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Rinpoche also studied extensively under Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche and the great scholar Khenpo Rinchen. He moved to the United States in 1989 with his family and began a five-year tenure as a professor of Buddhist philosophy at Naropa University (then Institute) in 1990.\n\nNot long after arriving in the United States, Rinpoche founded Mangala Shri Bhuti, an organization established to further the practice of the Longchen Nyingtik and Khyen-Kong Chok-sum lineages. He established a mountain retreat center, Longchen Jigme Samten Ling, in southern Colorado, where he spends much of his time in retreat and guides students in long-term retreat practice. When not in retreat, Rinpoche travels widely throughout the world teaching and furthering his own education.\n\nHis most well-known student in the Western world is Pema Chödrön, who took him as her primary teacher in 1994, years after the death of her root guru, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.\n\nMangala Shri Bhuti, Rinpoche's organization, has a total of five centers. Three are study and practice centers -- Phuntsok Choling in Boulder, Colorado, Pema Osel Do Ngak Choling in Vershire, Vermont, and the Guna Institute in Bir, India. The remaining two are retreat centers -- Longchen Jigme Samten Ling in Crestone, Colorado, and Guna Norling in Salvador, Bahia - Brazil.\n\nDzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche is also an abstract expressionist painter. Kongtrul Rinpoche views creativity as \"something very large - the essence of everything\". His training in the arts began at an early age with the practice of calligraphy, music, ritual dance and other traditional Tibetan arts. After his introduction to Western culture, Rinpoche became increasingly interested in modern art, particularly abstract painting and the work of Pablo Picasso and Wassily Kandinsky. He began painting under the guidance of his teacher, Yahne Le Toumelin in the mid-1990s. Mrs. Le Toumelin, who is based in Dordogne, France, is herself a renowned abstract expressionist painter who was introduced by André Breton in the 1960 as one of the few women painters to make a mark in her generation. Mrs. Le Toumelin teaches a unique style of oil paint mixed with glue applied with special palettes. She regards Rinpoche as her most significant student and an artist whose fearlessness and brilliance are incomparable.\n\nIn his book \"Natural Vitality\", Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche speaks about how the creative process and meditation can merge. The outcome is not only profound works of art, but an added dimension for our spiritual growth.\nThe essential practice of meditation is to allow the mind to express itself freely without fear or judgment. In each moment of awareness we encounter impressions of the outer world through our sense perception as well as our inner world of thoughts, feelings and emotions. When, through the process of meditation, we are able to let this incredible array of experience be, without trying to reject what we fear or pull in what we feel attracted to - when we relax into experience without trying to manipulate it in any way - we have a complete experience of mind, naked and unaltered. Art, when it is free of such notions of beauty and ugliness, ‘shoulds’ and ‘shouldn’ts’ can be used to express this complete experience of mind. When art evolves from this understanding it provides the possibility for those who see it to also experience the natural and unfabricated nature of their own awareness. –Dzigar Kongtrul Rinpoche\n\n"}

Fiske and Harry Meginnis in Lincoln, Nebraska. Twelve of the buildings they designed are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) list. They have additional buildings on the list with other partnerships or individually credited.\n\nFerdinand C. Fiske was born in New York and raised in Iowa. He was educated at Cornell University and moved to Lincoln during the building boom of 1887 and practiced there the rest of his life. He was a founding partner of firms including Fiske & Dieman (1898-1912); Fiske & Miller (1912-1924); and Fiske, Meginnis, & Schaumberg (1924-1925).\n\nHarry Meginnis did not receive an education in architecture but learned through the construction business. He worked under Fiske at Fiske & Dieman (1901-1909) in their Lincoln office as a draftsman. He had brief stints at several firms in Indianapolis including DuPont & Hunter (1907-1909); H.L. Bass Co. (1909-1914); and Broakie & Meginnis (1914-1915). In 1915, Meginnis returned to Lincoln to start Fiske & Meginnis (1915-1924) and Fiske, Meginnis, & Schaumberg (1924-1925). Meginnis went on to establish Meginnis & Schaumberg (1925-1943) with Edward G. Schaumberg. It lasted until Meginnis died in 1943.\n\nWhile Fiske and his partners worked under many different styles, Fiske & Meginnis mostly worked within the English Revival realm (Elizabethan, Georgian, and Tudor among others) combined with the Prairie style that Frank Lloyd Wright was concerned with at the time. They were also involved in a significant number of industrial warehouse projects in Lincoln, namely in the Haymarket District.\n\nLocated within the Mount Emerald and Capitol Additions District, the Reese House was designed by Fiske and Meginnis in 1907. The Reese House was designed with false-timber work and stucco and large overhanging eaves over the porches placing it into the Tudor-Revival/Prairie-Style category that Fiske & Meginnis were known for especially in their residential projects. This residence was designed for Manoah Bostic Reese and his family who was the chief justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court and also the Dean for the College of Law at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nThough it currently stands as an apartment building, Fiske and Meginnis’ A Street landmark was originally built as the Lincoln Municipal Lighting and Waterworks Plant. Much like many of their other public works together, Fiske and Meginnis designed a building easily classified as neoclassical revival. Three, large, and light blue smoke stacks protrude through the flat roof, while the large structure and exterior facade of the building consists of a slightly darker red brick, trimmed with limestone and buff bricks on the cornices. The focal east and north facades are punctured with what appears to be two stories of large glass windows with round heads. But behind this deceptive façade lies a factory-like interior, renovated into apartments. The large first floor and first floor windows leave room for an attic floor above.\n\nBuilt in 1922, Antelope grocery was constructed as a mixed use (commercial and apartment) building. The two-story brick and stucco structure makes use of architectural elements common to period houses. The store includes a visual usage of Tudor revival-styled elements within the construction and has undergone multiple renovations while retaining a high degree of architectural integrity. This includes the current existence of its original metal framed store-front windows. The lower level of the building remains business, while the upper level is mainly residential apartments. As far as the exterior is concerned, stucco and half-timber form the cladding which traces up to a truncated steeply pitched roof capped with a flat decking. The main modifications to the building's exterior include re roofing and addition of protective glazing over the transoms.\nFiske & Meginnis practiced many styles of architecture, which lead to a wide variety of commissions. The firm designed residences, public works buildings, libraries, schools for all levels of education, and warehouses.\n"}

A news photograph by Sam Nzima of the mortally wounded Pieterson being carried by another Soweto resident while his sister ran next to them was published around the world. The anniversary of his death is designated Youth Day, when South Africans honour young people and bring attention to their needs.\n\nOn 16 June 1976, school children protested the implementation of Afrikaans and English as dual medium of instruction in secondary schools in a 50:50 basis. This was implemented throughout South Africa regardless of the locally-spoken language and some exams were also written in Afrikaans. Students gathered to peacefully demonstrate, but the crowd soon became intimidated when the police arrived, they then started to throw stones.\n\nA group of 30 students gathered outside the Phefeni Junior Secondary School singing the traditional Sotho anthem 'Morena Boloka Sechaba Sa Heso'. The police arrived and fired tear gas into the crowd in order to disperse them. \nThere are conflicting accounts of who gave the first command to shoot, but soon children were turning and running in all directions, leaving some children lying wounded on the road.\n\nAlthough the media often named Hector as the first child to die that fateful day, another boy, Hastings Ndlovu, was actually the first child to be shot. But in the case of Hastings, there were no photographers on the scene, and his name was not immediately known.\n\nWhen Hector was shot, he fell on the corner of Moema and Vilakazi Streets, he was picked up by Mbuyisa Makhubo who together with Hector's sister, Antoinette (then 17 years old), ran towards Sam Nzima's car. They bundled him in, and the journalist Sophie Tema drove him to a nearby clinic where he was pronounced dead. Mbuyisa and Nzima were harassed by the police after the incident and both went into hiding. Mbuyisa's mother told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that she received a letter from Mbuyisa in 1978 from Nigeria but she has not heard from him since. Hector and Hastings Ndlovu are buried at the Avalon Cemetery, Soweto.\n\nSince June 1976, Hector's surname has been spelled \"Peterson\" and \"Pietersen\" by the press but the family insists that the correct spelling is \"Pieterson.\" \n\nOn 9 August 2002 U.S. lawyer Ed Fagan led a $50bn class action suit by apartheid-era victims against international firms and banks who profited from dealings with the Apartheid regime. Among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit was Dorothy Molefi, Hector's mother. The South African government as well as Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Desmond Tutu distanced themselves from the lawsuit. Fagan had filed a string of lawsuits over human-rights issues brought in order to force companies to settle. The cases were thrown out in 2004.\n\nOn 16 June 2002 the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum was opened near the place he was shot in Orlando West, Soweto to honour Hector and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising. Funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (R16 million) and the Johannesburg City Council (R7,2 million), it has become a major tourist attraction.

{"id": "2269053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2269053", "title": "La Révolution surréaliste", "text": "La Révolution surréaliste\n\nLa Révolution surréaliste (English: \"The Surrealist Revolution\") was a publication by the Surrealists in Paris. Twelve issues were published between 1924 and 1929.\n\nShortly after releasing the first \"Surrealist Manifesto\", André Breton published the inaugural issue of \"La Révolution surréaliste\" on December 1, 1924.\n\nPierre Naville and Benjamin Péret were the initial directors of the publication and modeled the format of the journal on the conservative scientific review \"La Nature.\" The format was deceiving, and to the Surrealists' delight, \"La Révolution surréaliste\" was consistently scandalous and revolutionary. The journal focused on writing with most pages densely packed with columns of text, but also included reproductions of art, among them works by Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, André Masson and Man Ray.\n\nIssue 1 (December 1924): The cover of the initial issue announced the revolutionary agenda of \"La Révolution surréaliste\" with, \"It is necessary to start work on a new declaration of the rights of man.\"\n\nIn a mock scientific fashion the journal explored issues related to the darker sides of the human psyche with articles focused on violence, death and suicide. Detached descriptions of violent crime taken from police reports, and an impartial survey on suicide were included.\n\nIssue 3 (April 1925): The cover of the third issue announced, \"End of the Christian Era.\" Inside articles convey a blasphemous and anticlerical tone. Writer and actor Antonin Artaud wrote an open letter, \"Address to the Pope,\" and expresses the revolt against what Surrealists saw as oppressive religious values: \"The world is the soul's abyss, warped Pope, Pope foreign to the soul. Let us swim in our own bodies, leave our souls within our souls; we have no need of your knife-blade of enlightenment.\" Such anticlerical remarks are found throughout and reflect the group's relentless campaign against oppression and bourgeois morality.\n\nIssue 4: Breton announced in the fourth issue that he was taking over the publication. His concern about disruptive factions that had developed in the Surrealist group brought him to assert his power and restate the Surrealist principles as he conceived them.\n\nThereafter, each issue became more political with articles and declarations that have a Communist slant.\n\nIssue 8 (December 1926): The growing fascination with sexual perversion is revealed in an article by Paul Éluard which celebrates the writings of the Marquis de Sade, who was imprisoned for much of his life because of his deviant writings about sexual cruelty. According to Éluard, the Marquis \"wished to give back to civilized man the strength of his primitive instincts.\" Writing and imagery, influenced by de Sade, by Breton, Man Ray, and Salvador Dalí was also included.\n\nIssues 9 and 10 (October 1927): Introduce Exquisite corpse (Le Cadavre exquis)—a game the Surrealists enjoyed that involves folding a sheet of paper so that several people contribute to the drawing of a figure or writing text without seeing the preceding portions. The issue includes some exquisite corpse results.\n\nIssue 11 (): The interest in sex continues in the eleventh issue with \"Research into Sexuality,\" an account of a debate that took place in January 1928. In the frank discussion, more than a dozen Surrealists openly expressed their opinions on sexual matters, including a variety of perversions.\n\nIssue 12 (December 1929): Contains Breton's \"Second Surrealist Manifesto\". The declaration marks the end of the group's most cohesive and focused years, and signals the start of disagreements within the group. Breton celebrated his faithful supporters, and denounced those who had defected and betrayed his doctrine. Also contains the full script of \"Un Chien Andalou\" with Luis Buñuel's preface.\n\nSome of the dissidents voiced their views in the periodical \"Documents\" beginning in April 1929. Writings by ethnographers, archaeologists, and art historians, and poets Georges Bataille and Michel Leiris emerged as the main contributors. Some of the \"Documents\" contributors went later formed another group, Acéphale.\n\nBreton's successor to \"La Révolution surréaliste\" was a more politically engaged publication, \"Le Surrealisme au service de la revolution (Surrealism in the service of the revolution),\" which appeared sporadically between 1930 and 1933.\n\nIn 1933, publisher Albert Skira contacted Breton about a new journal, which he planned to be the most luxurious art and literary review the Surrealists had seen, featuring a slick format with many color illustrations. Skira's restriction was that Breton was not allowed to use the magazine to express his social and political views. Later that year \"Minotaure\" began publication, and continued publication until 1939.\n\n\n"}

The manuscript was created in the region of Lorraine and has been dated to around 816.\n\nThere are 99 extant folios measuring ; four were lost before 1600; this apart, the manuscript is apparently complete. The work contains 39 miniatures including some of the first artistic depictions on paper of the Greek constellations. The artist has made no effort to place the stars correctly according to their positions in the sky so the images cannot be considered true star charts.\n\nThe Leiden Aratea was created for a wealthy patron, possibly Louis the Pious or his wife Judith. Two copies were made of the manuscript in northern France around the year 1000. Jacob Susius acquired the manuscript in Ghent in 1573. It was owned by Hugo Grotius in 1600 and was used as a source for his edition of \"Syntagma Arateorum\". It was later in the library of Christina of Sweden and was subsequently in the possession of Isaac Vossius. It was acquired by the Leiden University Library along with the rest of Vossius's collection around 1690.\n\nA facsimile was published in 1989. That same year the book was rebound by Lucie Gimbrére. A digital reproduction of this manuscript can be found on \"Digital Special Collections\" (DISC) of University Library Leiden: \n\nConstellations, planets and the seasons are depicted in 39 full-page miniatures, all on the verso pages, with corresponding poetical descriptions on the recto. At least five miniatures are lost, including those of the Sun and Moon, Jupiter, and the constellations of Centaurus and Virgo. \nThe illustrations are probably copied from a Late Antique version of Germanicus' treatise; the subjects modeled in a \"lively, illusionistic\" manner typical of ancient painting.\n\nThe text is written in the \"capitalis rustica\" script used by the Romans for literary manuscripts and kept by the Carolingians for secular works. An exception is folio 93v, the planetarium, where the routes of the planets are inscribed with quotes from Pliny's \"Natural History\" in Carolingian minuscule.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9704095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9704095", "title": "Medium specificity", "text": "Medium specificity\n\nMedium specificity is a consideration in aesthetics and art criticism. It is most closely associated with modernism, but it predates it. \n\nAccording to Clement Greenberg, who helped popularize the term, medium specificity holds that \"the unique and proper area of competence\" for a form of art corresponds with the ability of an artist to manipulate those features that are \"unique to the nature\" of a particular medium. For example, in painting, literal flatness and abstraction are emphasised rather than illusionism and figuration.\n\nMedium specific can be seen to mean that \"the artwork is constituted by the characteristic qualities of the raw material.\" This would probably include the techniques used to manipulate the materials. \"Medium-specificity is based on the distinct materiality of artistic media.\" As early as 1776 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing \"contends that an artwork, in order to be successful, needs to adhere to the specific stylistic properties of its own medium.\"\n\nToday, the term is used both to describe artistic practices and as a way to analyze artwork. Critic N. Katherine Hayles, for example, speaks of \"media specific analysis.\" As discussed by critic Marshall Soules, medium specificity and media specific analysis are playing an important role in the emergence of new media art forms, such as Internet art. Medium specificity suggests that a work of art can be said to be successful if it fulfills the promise contained in the medium used to bring the artwork into existence. Much debate can remain as to what a given medium best lends itself to. \n\nArt dialogue in the post-modern period has tended to steer away from medium specificity as a particularly relevant principle. \n\n\n"}

It was released posthumously following the death of the actor and became immensely popular for its cynical tone and candid depiction of the world of filmmaking in Hollywood. \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\" has sold over one million copies. The book has never been out of print.\n\nThe original publisher, Putnam paid an advance of $9,000 to Flynn for the rights of his autobiography. Ghostwriter Earl Conrad was sent to Flynn's home in Jamaica to collaborate with the actor throughout the writing period. According to Beverly Aadland, Flynn's teenage girlfriend, Conrad was usually drunk and spent most of his time chasing Jamaican women. Aadland also claims that she and Flynn had difficulty removing him, saying \"He was basically a doorstop with paid vacation\". Jeffrey Meyers' introduction in the Aurum edition of \"My Wicked, Wicked Ways\" claims that Flynn dictated the book to Conrad from August to October 1958, and that he was a \"literary stand in\".\n\nConrad would eventually publish his own book, \"Errol Flynn: A Memoir\" in 1979 depicting Flynn's final year, their literary collaboration, and hearing the news of the actor's early death.\nThe book is known for its depictions of major figures from the Classic Hollywood period including Jack L. Warner, John Barrymore, Bruce Cabot, Flynn's first wife Lili Damita and director Michael Curtiz. Flynn also writes of falling in love with co-star Olivia de Havilland.\n\n\"This is a major autobiography in the tradition of Cellini, Casanova, and Frank Harris.\"\n– \"The Guardian\"\n\n\"Flynn set the record straight and is brutally honest in his posthumously published self-portrait. This restored version of the 1959 original contains numerous passages deleted from earlier editions for fear of lawsuits—he was equally brutal in his portrayal of many Hollywood big shots—plus eight pages of photos and a new introduction by biographer Jeffrey Meyers.\"\n– \"Library Journal\"\n\n\"A document on Hollywood life far beyond its fan magazine fascination… . [Flynn] delivers footnotes to film history that are hard to come by.\"\n– \"San Francisco Chronicle\"\n\n\"The Tasmanian-actor portrays himself not as a debonair swashbuckler but as a chronically unhappy soul whose luck, talent and high spirits vaulted him to fame, even as he remained unfulfilled until the end.\"\n– \"Indiana Gazette\"\n\n\"...the confessions of a rake, unsparing of himself or anyone else...\"\n– \"Newsweek\"\n\n\"Incredibly absorbing… . Just as in life, Flynn spares himself nothing—and from his book emerges the same roguish charm that endeared his celluloid incarnation to millions.\"\n– \"Saturday Review\"\n\n\"Flynn writes cleverly, as he talked. He has left us a good book.\" \n– \"The New York Times\"\n\nA TV movie adaptation called My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn directed by Don Taylor and starring Duncan Regehr as Flynn was released in 1985.\n\nDoris Keating, daughter of Barry Mahon, Flynn's one time business manager, optioned the book in 1977. It took her several years to find finance.\n\n\"Some people at the networks felt maybe he just wasn't likable enough,\" Miss Keating said, \"But I persisted. I felt I owed it to him to present his story the way he wrote it. The film is my valentine to him.\"\n\nShe managed to get up the film as a TV movie for CBS. The film focuses on the years 1935 to 1943, ending with the rape trial. Keating said if the film was successful she wanted to do a prequel about Flynn's life in New Guinea, but this did not eventuate.\n"}

The ensemble was founded in 1921 in Naarden to perform Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\" on Good Friday and has performed the work annually since then in the Grote of Sint-Vituskerk (Great Church or St Vitus Church). From 1983 until 2018, Jos van Veldhoven was artistic director and conductor. On May 11 in 2017, Shunsuke Sato was appointed as artistic director of the Netherlands Bach Society, beginning from June 1, 2018.<br>\n\nIn 2021 the ensemble will be 100 years old. In preparation the Society is publishing a new and freely accessible recording every week, including HD video of all 1080 works of Johann Sebastian Bach, performed by members of the ensemble and guest musicians under the title \"All of Bach\".\n\n\"De Nederlandse Bachvereniging\" was officially founded on 13 September 1921. Johan Schoonderbeek was one of the founding members and the first conductor. He had already conducted the \"St Matthew Passion\" with the Koninklijke Oratorium Vereniging Excelsior (Royal Oratorio Society Excelsior) in The Hague. The Netherlands Bach Society performed the \"St Matthew Passion\" first on Good Friday, 14 April 1922. Following the praxis of the period, the work was not performed completely. Performances of the work became a tradition which has been kept since.\n\nAfter Schoonderbeek's death in 1927, Evert Cornelis, conductor of the Utrechts Symfonie Orkest, took over and was the first to conduct the complete work. He died in 1931.\n\nHis successor was Anthon van der Horst, who also was the organist of the church. He established regular performances of the \"St Matthew Passion\" and the \"Mass in B minor\" from 1931 until shortly before his death in 1965, attracting listeners from the Nederlands and abroad. He studied facsimiles and tried to keep close to the composer's intentions. In great contrast Willem Mengelberg conducted regularly on Palm Sunday in the Concertgebouw a shortened version of the \"St Matthew Passion\", in a romantic approach with choirs of 450 singers. Nevertheless the performances in Naarden and Amsterdam were similar at first, because orchestra players of the Concertgebouworkest and soloists were the same.\n\nCharles de Wolff was the successor of Van der Horst in 1965. During this period the Concertgebouw tradition was continued by Eugen Jochum. The historically informed performance, initiated by Nikolaus Harnoncourt among others, won friends within the Netherlands Bach Society, who pursued performances with smaller ensembles on period instruments. Therefore De Wolff left the Bach Society in 1983, to work with the \"Bachkoor Holland\".\n\nSince 1983 the Netherlands Bach Society has a group of instrumentalists and singers specialized on music of the 17th and 18th century. The Bach Society performs about 50 concerts a year, concentrating on works of Bach and his family, his contemporaries and predecessors, such as Buxtehude, Carissimi, Charpentier, Grandi, Handel, De Koninck, Kuhnau, Mazzocchi, Monteverdi, Padbrué, Ritter, Scheidt, Schein, Schütz, Sweelinck, Telemann and Weckmann.\n\nThe artistic director since 1983 has been Jos van Veldhoven, who conducts about half of the concerts. Guest conductors have included Gustav Leonhardt, Paul McCreesh, Philippe Herreweghe, Frans Brüggen, Iván Fischer and Masaaki Suzuki. To keep the experience of the \"St Matthew Passion\" \"fresh not only for himself but also for the players and for audiences\", guest conductors have been invited every other year.

{"id": "2174489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174489", "title": "Plan of Saint Gall", "text": "Plan of Saint Gall\n\nThe Plan of Saint Gall is a famous medieval architectural drawing of a monastic compound dating from the early 9th century. It is preserved in the Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen, Ms 1092. \n\nIt is the only surviving major architectural drawing from the roughly 700-year period between the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the 13th century. It is considered a national treasure of Switzerland and remains an object of intense interest among modern scholars, architects, artists and draftsmen for its uniqueness, its beauty, and the insights it provides into medieval culture.\n\nThe Plan depicts an entire Benedictine monastic compound including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and even a special house for bloodletting. The Plan was never actually built, and was so named because it was kept at the famous medieval monastery library of the Abbey of St. Gall, where it remains to this day. It was drawn in a scriptorium in Reichenau in the third decade of the 9th century, dedicated to Abbot Gozbert (816–836) of Saint Gall.\n\nThe Plan was created from five parchments sewn together measuring 45 inches by 31 inches (113 cm by 78 cm) and drawn in red ink lines for the buildings, and brown ink for lettered inscriptions. It is drawn to an \"unusual\" scale of 1:192 (although as explained in detail in \"The Plan of St. Gall in brief\" by Lorna Price, this is 1/16\" to the foot, which would not be so surprising as necessary to place the overall plan onto this size piece of parchment). The reverse of the Plan was inscribed in the 12th century, after it had been folded into book form, with the \"Life of Saint Martin\" by Sulpicius Severus. About 350 partly rhyming appendices in the handwritings of two different scribes describe the functions of the buildings. The dedication to Abbot Gozbert is written in the margin.\n\nBecause the plan does not correspond to any place that was actually built, just about every aspect of the Plan is disputed by modern scholars. Debates continue on things such as which system of measurement was used; whether the scale is a single scale for the entire plan or varied for different elements; if the plan is a copy from a lost prototype or the original; if it is reflective of a single individual's ideas, or those of monastic council. \n\nDespite the unknowns, much has been learned about medieval life from the Plan. The absence of heating in the dining hall, for instance, may not have been an oversight but was meant to discourage excessive enjoyment of meals. In the quarters for the 120–150 monks, their guests, and visitors, the ratio of toilet seats was better than what modern hygienic codes would prescribe.\n\nThe plan was dedicated to Gozbertus, the Abbot of St Gall from 816–36. The text reads [as translated by Horn into English]For thee, my sweetest son Gozbertus, have I drawn this briefly annotated copy of the layout of the monastic buildings, with which you may exercise your ingenuity and recognize my devotion, whereby I trust you do not find me slow to satisfy your wishes. Do not imagine that I have undertaken this task supposing you to stand in need of our instruction, but rather believe that out of love of God and in the friendly zeal of brotherhood I have depicted this for you alone to scrutinise. Farewell in Christ, always mindful of us, Amen.The Latin reads:Haec tibi dulcissime fili cozb(er)te de posicione officinarum paucis examplata direxi, quibus sollertiam exerceas tuam, meamq(ue) devotione(m) utcumq(ue) cognoscas, qua tuae bonae voluntari satisfacere me segnem non inveniri confido. Ne suspiceris autem me haic ideo elaborasse, quod vos putemus n(ost)ris indigere magisteriis, sed potius ob amore(m) dei tibi soli p(er) scrutinanda pinxisse amicabili fr(ater)nitatis intuitu crede. Vale in Chr(ist)o semp(er) memor n(ost)ri ame(n).\n\nWalter Horn and Ernest Born in 1979 published a 3-volume \"The Plan of St. Gall\" (Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press), which is widely considered to be the definitive work in English. A single-volume condensed edition was published in 1982 as \"The Plan of St. Gall - In Brief\".\n\nAccording to Horn, the Plan was a copy of an original blueprint of an ideal monastery created at two Carolingian reform synods held at Aachen in 816 and 817. The purpose of the synods was to establish Benedictine monasteries throughout the Carolingian Empire as a bulwark against encroaching Christian monastic missionaries from Britain and Ireland who were bringing Celtic lifestyle influences to the Continent (see Celtic art).\n\nAccording to Earl Anderson (Cleveland State University), it is likely that Umberto Eco references the Plan in his novel \"The Name of the Rose\":\n\n\nThe Plan has a tradition of model making. In 1965 Ernest Born and others created a scale model of the Plan for the \"Age of Charlemagne\" exhibition in Aachen, Germany. This became the inspiration for the 1979 book, but was also the first in a tradition of modeling the plan. More recently the Plan has been modeled on computers using CAD software.\n\nCampus Galli is a Carolingian monastic community under construction in Meßkirch, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The construction project includes plans to build a medieval monastery according to the early ninth-century Plan of Saint Gall using techniques from that era. The long-term financing of the project is to come from revenue generated from the site's operation as a tourist attraction. The construction site has been open for visitors since June 2013.\n\nThe St. Gall Project was founded to produce a digital online presence for the Plan including models and an extensive online database on early medieval monastic culture. The project is directed by Patrick Geary (UCLA) and Bernard Frischer (University of Virginia) with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The website was released to the public in December 2007. Future resources will include intellectual and textual aspects of the Plan and monasticism; space for publication of new papers and research, lesson plans and teaching aides, blogs and chat rooms.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}
{"id": "24597769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24597769", "title": "Potbelly sculpture", "text": "Potbelly sculpture\n\nPotbelly sculptures, (Spanish barrigones pl. or barrigón sing.), are in-the-round sculptures of obese human figures carved from boulders. They are a distinctive element of the sculptural tradition in the southern Maya area of Mesoamerica. The precise purpose of potbelly sculptures is unknown, although they appear to have been the focus of public veneration and ritual directed by the ruling elite. Although this sculptural tradition is found within the southern Maya area, it has been recognized that the sculptures themselves are non-Maya.\n\nPotbelly monuments are generally crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; they are usually seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs gripped in the figure's arms and legs. The heads are round and normally have the eyes closed and possess puffy eyelids and prominent lips. The monuments are generally of indeterminate gender and are usually carved from porphyritic basalt, a kind of rock with a combination of large and small grains of mineral that is common along the foothills of Central America. There are occasional examples of potbelly figures crafted from other materials, such as pottery or from other types of rock.\n\nThere are variations on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, headless potbellies, some of which may be deliberately headless, and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style even though they have no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.\n\nPotbelly sculptures vary enormously in size and weight, from the smallest examples that can weigh as little as a few grams and measure to monuments that weigh 12 tons and measure .\n\nThe dating of potbelly sculptures has been problematic with few of the earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 using a combination of radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.\n\nThe dating of the monuments to the Late Preclassic indicate that the potbelly style may be a later derivative of earlier Olmec colossal heads, although it does not answer the question of the ethnicity of the sculptors. Potbelly monuments were sometimes reused by later peoples in the region, such as at Sin Cabezas, Copán and Teopán. Arguing against the theory of potbelly sculpture being an Olmec influenced art form is that the direction of diffusion of the style appears to have been from south to north, while the Olmec heartland lies to the north, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, which would indicate an expected diffusion from north to south if the Olmecs were indeed the origin of the style.\n\nPotbelly sculptures have been interpreted in a variety of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they have been associated with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic hearth. A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.\n\nOne theory is that the sculptures represent deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although it has been suggested that the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.\nAn alternative interpretation of potbelly monuments is that they were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del Quiché, Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.\n\nThe diversity of monuments falling within the potbelly sculptural tradition and the individuality of the monuments support the argument that the monuments represent individual rulers. The monuments may have been viewed by the ancient peoples of the region as a depiction of both rulership and their ancestors.\n\nPotbelly sculptures are distributed along the Pacific slope of southern Mesoamerica from Chiapas in Mexico, through Guatemala to El Salvador, as well as in the Guatemalan highlands. A few examples have been found further afield in the Maya lowlands of Guatemala and Honduras. A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880–600 BC, in the Middle Preclassic.\n\nThe core of the distribution area falls within a humid piedmont zone with the land consisting of volcanic soil and rubble carried down from the mountains, with naturally occurring basalt boulders of varying sizes that provided a practical raw material for sculpture. Potbelly sculptures are found in prominent ceremonial centres.\n\nExamples have been found at many sites on the Pacific coast of Guatemala including Takalik Abaj, Monte Alto, Bilbao and El Baúl. The earliest examples of potbellied monuments have been dated to the Middle Preclassic, with the majority dating to the Late Preclassic.\n\nWell-preserved examples of Late Preclassic potbelly sculptures have been found at Bilbao, on the coastal plain, and at Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemalan highlands. A small potbelly monument has been found at the major Maya city of Tikal in the lowlands of Petén in Guatemala.\n\nThere is some variation in the exact features, those at Kaminaljuyu have fat bodies with short, thick necks and large heads, sometimes wearing a wide collar. The faces are depicted with incised lines and are heavy and coarse. The legs curve around the body parallel to the ground and the arms are clasped against the torso with the elbows bent. Kaminaljuyu has the greatest concentration of potbelly sculptures in any site, with several of them found concentrated in the Palangana monument plaza.\n\nLarge potbelly monuments have been found at Giralda, a site from the Pacific coastline.\n\nPotbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas are stylistically related to Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill dating to the Late Classic period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.\n\nAt Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all date to the Late Preclassic. Stylistically, the monuments are very similar to those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these represent complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is a colossal head in potbelly style (Monument 99).\n\nOne potbelly sculpture was found in Chocolá, Guatemala.\n\nAt Copán in Honduras, another important Maya site, archaeologists found a potbelly sculpture on top of the Northwest Platform, to the west of the Great Plaza. Another was found in a cache under Stela 4. Further potbelly monuments have been found in caches under Late Classic stelae in the Great Plaza itself and throughout the Copán valley.\n\nA small example excavated from underneath the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic. Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in securely dating the potbelly style of sculpture. The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.\n\nIn Chalchuapa, potbelly monuments were grouped in the El Trapiche ceremonial centre.\n\nSanta Leticia Monument 1 is a nearly spherical potbelly sculpture and the smallest of the three potbelly monuments at the site, measuring high. Monument 2 is a massive high potbelly that has been split in half down the middle. Monument 3 is a finely carved potbelly figure with stylistic affinities to some of the sculptures found at Monte Alto in Guatemala, it measures high. All three sculptures measured in height and diameter. The monuments were arranged in a north-south line on a wide terrace projecting from a hill, Cerrito de Apaneca.\n\nThe Teopán potbelly clearly represents a female figure and has been interpreted as the sculpture of a Late Preclassic earth goddess. Teopán itself is a small site located on an island in Lake Coatepeque in western El Salvador. The site has been identified as that of Late Preclassic Maya settlement. Although the Teopán sculpture has typical Monte Alto-style traits such as closed puffy eyes, no neck, wrap-around arms, a clearly marked naval and grooves forming portions of the nose and mouth, it also includes some unusual features such as clearly indicated breasts, wide hips, buttocks and a concavity below the legs. The closed eyelids were later re-carved with the addition of two irregular oval concavities in order to represent open eyes, probably in the Postclassic Period. The Teopán potbelly is likely to be the idol mentioned by Spanish Colonial official Diego García de Palacio in a letter written in 1576, in which he mentions that the Pipil natives on the island worshipped \"a large stone idol in the form of a woman\".\n\n"}

The stele is seven feet high, made of highly polished granite, with a lightly incised design which is almost unnoticeable on the sculpture. For this reason, the design is best studied from a drawing. It is housed in the courtyard of the \"Museo Nacional de Arqueología Antropología e Historia del Perú\" in Lima. \n\nChavin artists frequently used the technique of contour rivalry in their art forms, and this indigenous deity is considered one of the finest known examples of this technique. Contour rivalry means that the lines in an image can be read in multiple ways, depending on which way the object is being viewed. When the Raimondi Stela is viewed one way, the image depicts a fearsome deity holding two Huachuma cactus. His eyes look upward toward his large, elaborate headdress of snakes and volutes. When flipped upside-down, the same image can be seen differently. The headdress can be \"read\" as a stacked row of smiling, fanged faces, while the deity's face has turned into the face of a smiling reptile. The deity's staffs also appear to be rows of stacked faces.\n\nThis technique speaks to larger Andean concerns of the duality and reciprocal nature of nature, life, and society. This theme is found in the art of many other Andean indigenous civilizations.\n\nMuseum of Italian Art\n\n"}
{"id": "1770684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1770684", "title": "Real Canadian Superstore", "text": "Real Canadian Superstore\n\nReal Canadian Superstore is a chain of supermarkets owned by Canadian food retailing giant Loblaw Companies. Its name is often shortened to Superstore.\n\nOriginating in Western Canada in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the banner expanded into Ontario in the early 2000s as Loblaw attempts to fend off competition from department stores including U.S.-based Walmart.\n\nLoblaw has tested alternative banners at some locations in Ontario, with some labelled as \"Loblaw Superstore\", and a few others as simply \"Superstore\"; for a time this was reflected in the chain's marketing which used a separate logo to advertise all of these banners. The company has since reverted to marketing the entire chain as Real Canadian Superstore, although some locations might retain other signage.\n\nThe stores carry a variety of goods, but the vast majority of space is devoted to groceries and about a third of each store is set aside for electronics, housewares, and clothing. Items in the latter two categories are mainly from Loblaw's private labels, such as President's Choice, Life at Home, or Joe Fresh. As with many Loblaw stores, they offer corporate-branded services such as PhotoLab photo finishing and DrugStore pharmacies. Many outlets also boast a GoodLife Fitness club, drive-through pharmacies, Mobil gas bars, photo studios, community rooms, as well as walk-in medical clinics managed by Primacy Medical.\n\nLoblaws is working to cut costs and compete effectively with this multi-format store. Each store has a similar layout, useful for both cost efficiency and shopper ease. Also, in an effort to cater to individual customer segments, Superstore buys specific products for different regions. Superstore locations now top .\n\nIn the west, Superstores are operated by Loblaw subsidiary Westfair Foods Ltd. Ontario stores are operated as part of Loblaw's other banners, including Loblaws and Zehrs, although Superstore is considered a separate chain, and prices at one chain may not apply at the other. Loblaw is centralizing its head office operations, which includes the relocation of the General Merchandise personnel from Calgary, Alberta to Brampton, Ontario to consolidate operations.\n\nIn Alberta, where private liquor retailing is permitted, a chain of 30 Real Canadian Liquorstores operate, mostly in proximity to Real Canadian Superstore locations in the province.\n\nEmployees of Loblaws and the Real Canadian Superstore are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union.\n\nThe first Real Canadian Superstore location opened in March 1979 in a former Loblaws location in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan under the name SuperValu. Numerous other SuperValu locations opened across Western Canada before most gradually expanded into Superstore sites; the SuperValu name is still in use in British Columbia and the Maritimes, the latter branded as Atlantic SuperValu.\n\nThe similarly named \"The Real Superstore\" was used in the United States from the 1970s up until the mid-1990s by the Loblaws-owned National Supermarkets chain until the chain was purchased by competitor Schnucks.\n\nSuperstore marks the return of Loblaw's superstore format in the Greater Toronto Area after the unsuccessful launch of the SuperCentre format in the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 21st century, Loblaw brought the Superstore banner to Ontario as a response to the introduction of large grocery sections in most Canadian Wal-Mart stores and other department stores, and as a pre-emptive strike against any plans by Wal-Mart to bring its \"Supercenter\" format to Canada. Originally, Ontario stores were co-branded with the local Loblaw banner (i.e., \"Loblaws - The Real Canadian Superstore\"), but most shortened their name to reduce confusion and allow separate weekly specials for each chain.\n\nNew Ontario locations began to open under the name Loblaw Superstore in late 2007. Since December 2008, Ontario stores have used common flyers displaying a combined \"Superstore: Loblaw / Real Canadian\" logo. However, Loblaw has not yet said whether one banner will eventually replace the other.\n\nThere are no Superstore locations as such in Atlantic Canada or Quebec. However, in recent years, and particularly since 2008, Atlantic Superstore in the Maritimes and Dominion in Newfoundland and Labrador, both also owned by Loblaw, have adopted similar store formats and a similar marketing approach to RCSS. In Quebec, Maxi and Co. and some larger Provigo (previously Loblaws) locations fill the void. It is not clear whether Loblaw intends to eventually rebrand these stores to create a national \"Superstore\" chain.\n\nAs well, there are a handful of large-format Loblaws and Zehrs stores in Ontario – including certain locations in Markham, Ottawa, and Kitchener – which closely replicate the selection of food and general merchandise available at Superstores. Most of these locations were built around the same time as the first Ontario Superstores, but nevertheless chose to use older brand names.\n\n2018 - \"Truly Super\"\n\n2017 - \"We’re not just a store, we’re Superstore.

It is considered to be the second most important historical artefact in the Czech territory after the Czech Crown Jewels. \n\nThe reliquary was created for Florennes Abbey in Belgium in the first quarter of the 13th century to hold the purported skeletal remains of St. Maurus, St. John the Baptist, and St. Timothy. The wooden core is covered with gilded silver plate with many statuettes, reliefs, filigree decorations and gems. After the sacking of Florennes the reliquary was placed in the local church and later bought by Duke Alfred de Beaufort-Spontin in 1838. The Duke restored the damaged artifact and loaned it to the Brussels Exhibition of 1885. By 1888, the Beauforts transported it to their castle estate in Bečov. \n\nThe house of Beaufort cooperated with the Nazi Party during World War II and was forced to leave the country in 1945. Shortly before the end of the war, the reliquary was buried beneath the floor in the chapel and effectively forgotten. In 1984, American businessman Danny Douglas approached Czechoslovak authorities (via the embassy in Vienna) with an offer to pay 250,000 USD for the right to excavate and export abroad an otherwise unidentified object “\"which nobody here misses anyway\"”. From the fragments of information provided, the authorities initiated a search operation to verify the nature of the \"object\" and find it. This operation was led by JUDr. František Maryška, the head of Federal investigation bureau at that time. From the fragments of information provided his team was able to narrow the investigation to 5 possible locations and 3 weeks before the business was to be performed they were able to identify that the \"object\" must be located in Bečov Castle or surrounding area. Police officers arrived to the location with a large team of men and with metal detectors and were searching all the surroundings, digging several holes in garden and outside the castle. Since the weather was bad and Douglas was not worried about snow or frozen earth they concluded that the object must be inside. So they started with the search inside on places where a hidden room was anticipated or where such an object might fit. When searching the floor in the old castle chapel they identified that a large metallic object was below and after removing the wooden boards they discovered the St. Maurus reliquary on 5 November 1985. \n\nThe reliquary had decayed significantly after its decades of burial. The Czech authorities, after refusing to allow the relic's export and working to resolve ownership disputes, began an extensive restoration which lasted from 1991 by restorers from Prague's Museum of Applied Arts and preservation experts from the German town of Aachen. The restoration was complete in 2002 and the artifact was then returned to Bečov. The shrine has since been on public display in both the Bečov Castle and Prague Castle.\n\nThe reliquiary is a large chasse, or house-shaped casket, with a wooden structure covered by silver-gilt plates, with 12 small statues of saints, elaborate romanesque metalwork ornamentation, and a number of gems, including engraved gems from earlier periods. \n\nThe golden vessel is presumed to house some remains attributed to St. John the Baptist, Saint Timothy, with remains of Saint Maurus added later. \n\n"}

Their work has been described as \"seriously funny,\" \"Dadaist\" and \"physical theatre.\" Theatre critic Ian Shuttleworth said that Ridiculusmus is \"not so much rough theatre as completely dishevelled.\" Since 1996, the company has been led by Haynes and Woods as co-directors, and although the majority of their stage works in recent years have been two-handers, they additionally work with a large pool of collaborators.\n\nTheir first few productions were adaptations of novels, but, apart from a two-man version of \"The Importance of Being Earnest,\" produced in 2005, since 1997 Haynes and Woods have devised and written all Ridiculusmus' plays. Some of these have been published by Oberon Books and commissioned by the Barbican, London.\n\nThe founding members met as students at London's Poor School and while there they began busking on the London underground and doing comedy club open spots. They called themselves Mel, Pat & Harm, and performed comic songs from the 1920s and 1930s to the accompaniment of Barr's ukulele. They also opened a Dadaist comedy club called The Tomato Club above a couscous restaurant in Kentish Town. The highlight of the evening was the \"tomato spot,\" in which comics were invited to perform deliberately bad material to an audience armed with over-ripe tomatoes. The listing in \"Time Out\" said \"Don't come,\" to which the magazine added \"probably advice worth taking.\"\n\nOn graduating from The Poor School, Ridiculusmus filled a cancelled slot at London's Canal Cafe Theatre with a hastily produced adaptation of Jerome K. Jerome's \"Three Men in a Boat.\" It played to mixed reviews and encouraged the troupe to produce more adaptations; their next production was a promenade version of Flann O'Brien's cult classic novel \"The Third Policeman.\" Opening at Aras na Gael, the show, with free pints of The Wrastler stout given to any audience member bringing a bicycle part, became an instant small scale hit. Adding fellow Poor School graduates Kevin Henshall and Lucy Cuthbertson, the company grew to five members. Finding it difficult to survive in London, Ridiculusmus began to tour, and jumped at an offer to be in residence at The Playhouse in Derry, Northern Ireland.

It is created by telling a story in a way which creates a certain perception of events which is then revealed to be false often in exact opposition to original perception. The term most often refers to its use in many forms of humour which provides the audience with the twist or punch line, intended to elicit amusement. However it can also be used to elicit a tragic reaction, rather than a comic one. \n\nIt has been theorised that the essence of humour lies in two elements or factors, the \"relevance factor\", and the \"surprise factor\". First, it is necessary to present something familiar or relevant to the audience. This accounts for gaining the involvement and scrutiny of the audience, who may believe they know the natural follow-through thoughts or conclusion. Next, the actual amusement results from the presentation of some twist on what the audience expected, or else from interpreting the original situation in an unexpected way. These twists and unexpected interpretations may be summarized as the surprise factor.\n\nFor this reason, knowing a punch line in advance, or some situation which would flub the delivery of the punchline, can destroy the surprise factor, and in turn destroy the entertainment value or amusement the joke may have otherwise provided; such information is known in some contexts as a spoiler. On the other hand, a person previously holding the same unexpected conclusions or secret perspectives as the comedian could derive amusement from hearing those same thoughts expressed and elaborated. That there is commonality, unity of thought, and an ability to openly analyze and express these (where secrecy and inhibited exploration was previously thought necessary) can be the surprise factor in these situations. This phenomenon explains much of the success of comedians who deal with same-gender and same-culture audiences on gender conflicts and cultural topics, respectively.\n"}

It was originally named the Teatro della Concordia when it was the rival to the original 1732 opera house in the city, the Teatro del Leone. That theatre was active until 1791, but it was destroyed by fire in 1892.\n\nThe concept of the Concordia began in 1790 with a request to the city government to allow construction of a new opera house on the Plaza della Morte (now the Plaza della Republica), an area in need of re-development and revival. The city agreed on the basis of holding two boxes for itself and, with some interruptions for a variety of reasons, completion was achieved in time for the opening during the Carnival of 1798 with Portogallo's \"Lo spazzacamino principe\". The house consisted of four tiers of boxes, 100 in total, all sold to wealthy subscribers.\n\nModifications took place in 1835 to create a gallery by removing the fourth tier of boxes and creating a better entrance to the orchestra level. The 170th anniversary of the composer local-born composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi caused the renaming in his honour, although as is noted, it took a further three years for this to come into effect.\n\nBy 1925 the need for repairs had grown acute and the surviving heirs of the original construction, the Società Teatrale, were unable to continue to support the theatre, which in March 1929 was acquired by the city.\n\nThe theatre is still in use today, \"one of the few opera houses in Italy from the late 1700s that has never been destroyed by fire or bombs\" It was completely renovated in 1995 and is currently managed by the Pergolesi Spontini Foundation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1019405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1019405", "title": "The Motorcycle Diaries (book)", "text": "The Motorcycle Diaries (book)\n\nThe Motorcycle Diaries () is a memoir that traces the early travels of Marxist revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, then a 23-year-old medical student, and his friend Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old biochemist. Leaving Buenos Aires, Argentina, in January 1952 on the back of a sputtering single cylinder 1939 Norton 500cc dubbed \"La Poderosa\" (\"The Mighty One\"), they desired to explore the South America they only knew from books. During the formative odyssey Guevara is transformed by witnessing the social injustices of exploited mine workers, persecuted communists, ostracized lepers, and the tattered descendants of a once-great Inca civilization. By journey's end, they had travelled for a symbolic nine months by motorcycle, steamship, raft, horse, bus, and hitchhiking, covering more than across places such as the Andes, Atacama Desert, and the Amazon River Basin. The diary ends with a declaration by Guevara, born into an upper-middle-class family, displaying his willingness to fight and die for the cause of the poor, and his dream of seeing a united Latin America.\n\nThe book has been described as a classic coming-of-age story: a voyage of adventure and self-discovery that is both political and personal. Originally marketed by Verso as \"\"Das Kapital\" meets \"Easy Rider\"\", \"The Motorcycle Diaries\" has been a \"New York Times\" bestseller several times.\n\nErnesto Guevara spent long periods traveling around Latin America during his studies of medicine, beginning in 1948, at the University of Buenos Aires. In January 1950, Guevara attempted his first voyage. He traversed through the northern provinces of Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small engine. He arrived at San Francisco del Chañar, near Córdoba, where his friend Alberto Granado ran the dispensary of the leper-centre. This experience allowed Guevara to have long conversations with the patients about their disease.\n\nThis pre-expedition gave Guevara a taste of what would be experienced in his more extensive South American travels. The journey broke new ground for him in activities that would become central to his life: travelling and writing a diary. His own father said that it was preparation for his subsequent long journeys across South America.\n\nGuevara relied upon the hospitality of strangers that he encountered, as he and Granado would throughout their later travels. For example, following a puncture, he flagged down a lorry to take him to his next destination. In another instance, in Loreto, he asked for hospitality from a local police officer when he had nowhere to stay. The trip encouraged Guevara's style of traveling that would be seen in the Motorcycle Diaries. By the time he reached Jujuy, he had decided that the best way to get to know and to understand a country was by visiting hospitals and meeting the patients that they housed. He was not interested in the sites for tourists, and preferred meeting the people in custody of the police or the strangers that he met en route with whom he struck up a conversation. Guevara had seen the parallel existence of the poverty and deprivation faced by the native populations. Guevara also noted 'turbulence' in the region under the Río Grande, but having not actually crossed this river, historian John Lee Anderson argues that Guevara used the Río Grande as a symbol of the United States, and this was an early glimmer of the notion of neocolonial exploitation that would obsess him in later life. For the young Guevara, the trip had been an education.\n\nIt was the success of his Argentinian 'raid', as he so put it, that awakened in him a desire to explore the world and prompted the commencing of new travel plans.\n\nUpon completion of his bicycle journey, \"El Gráfico\", a sports magazine in Argentina, published a picture of Guevara on the motorbike he used for the journey. The company that manufactured the engine Ernesto adapted to his bicycle tried to use it for advertising claiming it was very strong since Guevara had gone on such a long tour using its power.\n\nWhile he continued studying, he also worked as a nurse on trading and petroleum ships of the Argentine national shipping-company. This allowed Guevara to travel from the south of Argentina to Brazil, Venezuela and Trinidad.\n\nIn January 1952 Guevara's older friend, Alberto Granado, a biochemist, and Guevara, decided to take a year off from their medical studies to embark on a trip they had spoken of making for years: traversing South America on a motorcycle, which has metaphorically been compared to carbureted version of Don Quixote's Rocinante. Guevara and the 29-year-old Granado soon set off from Buenos Aires, Argentina, astride a 1939 Norton 500 cc motorcycle they named \"La Poderosa II\" (\"The Mighty II\") with the idea of eventually spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo Leper colony in Peru on the banks of the Amazon River. In total, the journey took Guevara through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and to Miami, before returning home to Buenos Aires.\n\nThe trip was carried out in the face of some opposition by Guevara's parents, who knew that their son was both a severe asthmatic and a medical student close to completing his studies. However, Granado, himself a doctor, assuaged their concerns by guaranteeing that Guevara would return to finish his degree (which he ultimately did).\n\nThe first stop: Miramar, Argentina, a small resort where Guevara's girlfriend, Chichina, was spending the summer with her upper-class family. Two days stretched into eight, and upon leaving, Chichina gave Guevara a gold bracelet. The two men crossed into Chile on February 14. At one point they introduced themselves as internationally renowned leprosy experts to a local newspaper, which wrote a glowing story about them. The travelers later used the press clipping as a way to score meals and other favors with locals along the way.\n\nIn reference to his experience in Chile, Guevara also writes: \"The most important effort that needs to be done is to get rid of the uncomfortable 'Yankee-friend'. It is especially at this moment an immense task, because of the great amount of dollars they have invested here and the convenience of using economical pressure whenever they believe their interests are being threatened.\"\n\nUnable to get a boat to Easter Island as they intended, they headed north, where Guevara's political consciousness began to stir as he and Granado moved into mining country. They visited Chuquicamata copper mine, the world's largest open-pit mine and the primary source of Chile's wealth. While getting a tour of the mine he asked how many men died in its creation. At the time it was run by U.S. mining monopolies of Anaconda and Kennecott and thus was viewed by many as a symbol of \"imperialist gringo domination\". A meeting with a homeless communist couple in search of mining work made a particularly strong impression on Guevara, who wrote: \"By the light of the single candle ... the contracted features of the worker gave off a mysterious and tragic air ... the couple, frozen stiff in the desert night, hugging one another, were a live representation of the proletariat of any part of the world,\"\n\nIn reference to the oppression against the Communist party in Chile, which at the time was outlawed, Guevara said: \"It's a great pity, that they repress people like this. Apart from whether collectivism, the ‘communist vermin,’ is a danger to decent life, the communism gnawing at his entrails was no more than a natural longing for something better, a protest against persistent hunger transformed into a love for this strange doctrine, whose essence he could never grasp but whose translation, 'bread for the poor,' was something he understood and, more importantly, that filled him with hope. Needless to say, workers at Chuquicamata were in a living Hell.\"\n\nIn Peru, Guevara was impressed by the old Inca civilization, forced to ride in trucks with Indians and animals after \"The Mighty One\" broke down. As a result, he began to develop a fraternity with the indigenous campesinos. In March 1952 they both arrived at the Peruvian Tacna. After a discussion about the poverty in the region, Guevara referred in his notes to the words of Cuban poet José Marti: \"I want to link my destiny to that of the poor of this world.\" In May they arrived in Lima, Peru and during this time Guevara met doctor Hugo Pesce, a Peruvian scientist, director of the national leprosy program, and an important local Marxist. They discussed several nights until the early morning and years later Che identified these conversations as being very important for his evolution in attitude towards life and society.\n\nIn May, Guevara and Granado left for the leper colony of San Pablo in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest, arriving there in June. During his stay Guevara complained about the miserable way the people and sick of that region had to live. Guevara also swam once from the side of the Amazon River where the doctors stayed, to the other side of the river where the leper patients lived, a considerable distance of . He describes how there were no clothes, almost no food, and no medication. However, Guevara was moved by his time with the lepers, remarking that\n\nAfter giving consultations and treating patients for a few weeks, Guevara and Granado left aboard the Mambo-Tango raft (shown) for Leticia, Colombia via the Amazon River.\n\nWhile visiting Bogotá, Colombia, he wrote a letter to his mother on July 6, 1952. In the letter he described the conditions under the right-wing government of Conservative Laureano Gómez as the following: \"There is more repression of individual freedom here than in any country we've been to, the police patrol the streets carrying rifles and demand your papers every few minutes\". He also goes on to describe the atmosphere as \"tense\" and \"suffocating\" even hypothesizing that \"a revolution may be brewing\". Guevara was correct in his prognostication, as a military coup in 1953 would take place, bringing General Gustavo Rojas to power.\n\nLater that month Guevara arrived in Caracas, Venezuela and from there decided to return to Buenos Aires to finish his studies in medical science. However, prior to his return, he travelled by cargo plane to Miami, where the airplane's technical problems delayed him one month. To survive, he worked as a waiter and washed dishes in a Miami bar.\n\nAlthough he admitted throughout that as a vagabond traveler he could only see things at surface level, he did attempt to delve beneath the sheen of the places he visited. On one occasion he went to see a woman dying of tuberculosis, leaving appalled by the failings of the public health system. This experience led him to ruminate the following reflection: \"How long this present order, based on the absurd idea of caste, will last is not within my means to answer, but it's time that those who govern spent less time publicizing their own virtues and more money, much more money, funding socially useful works.\"\n\nWitnessing the widespread endemic poverty, oppression and disenfranchisement throughout Latin America, and influenced by his readings of Marxist literature, Guevara later decided that the only solution for the region's structural inequalities was armed revolution. His travels and readings throughout this journey also led him to view Latin America not as a group of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide strategy for liberation from what he viewed as imperialist and neo-colonial domination. His conception of a borderless, united, Hispanic-America sharing a common 'mestizo' bond, was a theme that would prominently recur during his later activities and transformation from Ernesto the traveler, into Che Guevara the iconic revolutionary.\n\nAlthough it is considered to be formative, scholars have largely ignored this period of Guevara's life. However, historians and biographers now agree that the experience had a profound impact on Guevara, who later became one of the most famous guerrilla leaders in history. \"His political and social awakening has very much to do with this face-to-face contact with poverty, exploitation, illness, and suffering\", said Carlos M. Vilas, a history professor at the Universidad Nacional de Lanús in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nIn May 2005, Alberto Granado described their journey to the BBC, stating: \"The most important thing was to realise that we had a common sensibility for the things that were wrong and unjust.\" According to Granado, their time at the leper colony of San Pablo in the Amazon also proved pivotal. Recalling that they shared everything with the sick people and describing Guevara's wave on departure as follows: \"I got the impression that Che was saying goodbye to institutional medicine and becoming a doctor of the people.\" Granado later observed that by the end of their journey, \"We were just a pair of vagabonds with knapsacks on our backs, the dust of the road covering us, mere shadows of our old aristocratic egos.\"\n\nAccording to his daughter Aleida Guevara in a 2004 article, throughout the book we can see how Guevara became aware that what poor people needed was not his scientific knowledge as a doctor, but his strength and persistence to bring social change.\n\nGuevara's experience of the South American continent also helped to shape his revolutionary sensibilities. When discussing the plight of the downtrodden Indians of Peru, Granado discussed the formation of an Indian political party to begin a Túpac Amaru Indian Revolution. Guevara allegedly replied \"Revolution without firing a shot? You're crazy?'. The journey was also formative in his political beliefs, for example historian Paulo Drinot notes that the journey stimulated his sentiments of Pan-Americanism that would later shape his revolutionary behaviors.\n\nScholar Lucía Álvarez De Toledo argues that it was on these motorcycle travels that he \"disregarded his social class and his white European racial ancestry\" and retained the view of himself as an Argentine, as a member of the United America he had encountered during his travels. Having said this, with the exception of Guatemala, Guevara showed little concern with the policies of the countries he encountered. In total however, Guevara's travels in the 1950s played an important role in determining his view on the world \"and his later revolutionary trajectory.\"\n\nIn 2004, Che Guevara's daughter, Aleida Guevara, explained that her father had not intended his diary to be published, and that it had the state of \"a sheaf of typewritten pages\". But already in the 1980s, his family worked on his unpublished manuscripts, and a Cuban publishing house brought out \"The Motorcycle Diaries\" for the first time in 1993.\n\nThe director of Ocean Press insists that the book had been legally published in Cuba and that any rumors of a conspiracy to prohibit its publication there are false. He also points out that the Union of Young Communists brought out an edition, with another to be published by the Che Guevara Studies Center. Furthermore, he has given an assurance that its publication has the support of many people including Fidel Castro.\n\n\"The Motorcycle Diaries: Notes on a Latin American Journey\" was published by Ocean Press and the Che Guevara Studies Center, Havana, in 2003. The book has a preface by Aleida Guevara March and an introduction by Cintio Vitier. This edition is edited and translated by Alexandra Keeble.\n\nSome observers have questioned the full veracity of the work based on its editing. Michael Casey wrote that, \"\"Diaries\" is not a diary at all but rather a deliberately constructed memoir that the young Ernesto fashioned and embellished.\" Casey argues that revisions such as these cause Guevara to blur the line between fiction and nonfiction in his writings. Other scholars have taken this claim even further. Frans Weiser argues that Guevara was not the only person that was editing and reshaping his notes. While Paulo Drinot contends that the Cuban government, as well as others, reworked the texts for self-fashioning or political benefits. However, Drinot also points out that Guevara's introduction explicitly mentions how the notes are \"reorganized\" and \"polished\", and that such a practicality should in no way undermine its utility as a historical source.\n\n\n\n"}
