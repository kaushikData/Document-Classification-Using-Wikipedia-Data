Since Aarhus had grown to become Jutland's biggest city during the 19th century, the old theatre had become too small to serve the public demand. A new building was designed by the Danish architect Hack Kampmann (1856–1920), and the construction began on 12 August 1898. Only two years later, Aarhus Theatre stood completed and was inaugurated on 15 September 1900.\n\nThe architectural style of the building is Art Nouveau, with the national romantic emphasis on natural materials, and the interior design was completed by artists Hansen Reistrup and Hans Tegner.\n\nIn 2007, the Aarhus Theatre received an audio make-over.\n\nThe Aarhus Theater offers two 4-year programs for students to train in acting or play writing.\n\n"}
{"id": "151912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151912", "title": "All horses are the same color", "text": "All horses are the same color\n\nThe horse paradox is a falsidical paradox that arises from flawed demonstrations, which purport to use mathematical induction, of the statement \"All horses are the same color\". There is no actual contradiction, as these arguments have a crucial flaw that makes them incorrect. This example was originally raised by George Pólya. The paradox was also used by Joel E. Cohen as an example of the subtle errors that can occur in attempts to prove statements by induction.\n\nThe argument is proof by induction. First we establish a base case for one horse (formula_1). We then prove that if formula_2 horses have the same color, then formula_3 horses must also have the same color.\n\nThe case with just one horse is trivial. If there is only one horse in the \"group\", then clearly all horses in that group have the same color.\n\nAssume that formula_2 horses always are the same color. Let us consider a group consisting of formula_3 horses.\n\nFirst, exclude the last horse and look only at the first formula_2 horses; all these are the same color since formula_2 horses always are the same color. Likewise, exclude the first horse and look only at the last formula_2 horses. By the same reasoning, these too, must also be of the same color. Therefore, the first horse in the group is of the same color as the horses in the middle, who in turn are of the same color as the last horse. Hence the first horse, middle horses, and last horse are all of the same color, and we have proven that:\n\nThus, by the principle of mathematical induction, in any group of horses, all horses must be the same color.\n\nThe argument above makes the implicit assumption that the two subsets of horses to which the induction assumption is applied have a common element. This is not true when the original set (prior to either removal) only contains two horses.\n\nLet the two horses be horse A and horse B. When horse A is removed, it is true that the remaining horses in the set are the same color (only horse B remains). The same is true when horse B is removed. However the statement \"the first horse in the group is of the same color as the horses in the middle\" is meaningless, because there are no \"horses in the middle\" (common elements (horses) in the two sets). Therefore the above proof has a logical link broken. The proof forms a falsidical paradox; it seems to show by valid reasoning something that is manifestly false, but in fact the reasoning is flawed.\n\n\n"}

According to their mission statement, their goal is to support and expand the vibrant Minneapolis arts community by hosting exhibitions, creating and sponsoring various art programs, and participating in community art events.\n\nAltered Esthetics was originally conceived as an exhibition venue where the focus would be on \"art for art's sake\" as opposed to art for monetary profit. Founded by Jamie Schumacher, the gallery first opened in April 2004 in Minneapolis with their inaugural exhibition, \"The Art of War\", which featured the work of 15 local artists. \n\nThe organization has grown significantly since 2004. Altered Esthetics still retains no paid staff and is staffed by approximately 100 volunteers. Their board of directors is a working, role-based board with eighteen active members. Due to the growth of the organization since 2004, they relocated in late 2006 to the Q'arma Building in Northeast Minneapolis' arts district. In May 2007, they were awarded 501(c)3 non-profit status. In addition to their brick-and-mortar gallery, they also maintain an active online gallery with the purpose of serving those artists who are not able to participate in shows at the Q'arma Building gallery.\n\nOver the past six years, Altered Esthetics has hosted over 50 group exhibitions which focus on fine art, music, poetry, performance art, and film. Altered Esthetics has presented the work of over 1,000 national and international artists and has shown the work of such notable artists as Manuel Ocampo and J.M. Culver. Exhibitions have addressed such diverse themes as banned books, comic art, gender, and activism in the arts.\n\nIn 2007, Altered Esthetics began a curatorial internship program designed to offer artists, students, and community members hands-on experience in the arts. In 2008, a Gallery Director internship program was created. The goal of this program is to provide participants with experience is grant writing, fundraising, and other aspects of running a non-profit arts organization.\n\nIn 2009, Altered Esthetics drew over 2,000 people into the Minneapolis arts district to attend 14 different exhibits. Altered Esthetics is also a participant in Art-A-Whirl, the country's largest open-studio tour, during which over 20,000 people flooded the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District.\n\n"}
{"id": "4411818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4411818", "title": "Aniconism in Judaism", "text": "Aniconism in Judaism\n\nAniconism in Judaism covers a number of areas. The portrayal of YHWH in any kind of human or concrete form is not encouraged.\nA number of verses in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) refer to prohibitions against the creation of various forms of images, invariably linked directly with idolatry. The strongest over-all source is based on what Judaism counts as the second of the Ten Commandments:\n\nThis prohibition is widespread. For instance, Leviticus 26:1 reads:\n\nSimilar injunctions appear in Numbers 33:52, Deuteronomy 4:16, and 27:15; in all cases, the creation of the image is associated with idolatry, and indeed, the words commonly translated as \"image\" or some variant thereof (פסל \"pesel\", שקוץ \"shikuts\") are generally used interchangeably with words typically translated as \"idol\" (e.g., אליל \"elil\"). (An important exception is צלם \"tselem\", used in such verses as Genesis 1:26: \"let us make man in our image\"; this word was not associated with idols.)\n\nBased on these prohibitions, the Hebrew prophets, such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, and others, preached very strongly against idolatry. In many of their sermons, as recorded in the biblical books bearing their names, the prophets regarded the use of religious images as a negative sign of assimilation into the surrounding pagan cultures of the time. The Torah permits drawing of humans as long as they are not used for idolatry.\n\nDespite the semantic association with idols, Halakha (\"Jewish law\") as taught by the Shulkhan Arukh (\"Code of Jewish Law\") and practiced and applied by Conservative Judaism and Orthodox Judaism today, interprets the verses as prohibiting the creation of certain types of graven images of people, angels, or astronomical bodies, whether or not they are actually used as idols. The Shulkhan Arukh states: \"It is forbidden to make complete solid or raised images of people or angels, or any images of heavenly bodies except for purposes of study\". (\"Heavenly bodies\" are included here because the stars and planets were worshipped by some religions in human forms. Astronomical models for scientific purposes are permitted under the category of \"study.\")\nAn authoritative breakdown can be found in the \"Shulkhan Arukh,\" section \"yoreh deah\" which takes the literal meaning of פסל \"pesel\" as \"graven image\" (from the root פסל P-S-L, \"to engrave.\" See Exodus 34:1, 4; Deuteronomy 10:1, 3.) The prohibition is therefore seen as applying specifically to certain forms of sculpture and depictions of the human face. In keeping with this prohibition, some illustrations from the Middle Ages feature fantastic creatures—usually animal-headed humanoids, even when the depictions are quite clearly meant to be those of historical or mythological humans. The most well-known is the Birds' Head Haggadah (Germany, circa 1300). Because such creatures as gryphons, harpies, sphinxes, and the phoenix do not actually exist, no violation of the prohibition is perceived in such depictions. This is based on the fact that the Second Commandment, as stated in Exodus, refers specifically to \"anything in the heaven above, on the earth below, or in the water below the land.\" However, it is forbidden to make the four faces on the Divine Chariot (Ezekiel× I) or the ministering angels, because these are believed to be real beings that actually exist \"in the heaven above.\" (\"Kitzur Shulkhan Arukh\" 168:1)\n\nAlthough the prohibition applies mainly to sculpture, there are some authorities who prohibit two-dimensional full-face depictions. Some base this upon their understanding of the Talmud, and others based it upon Kabbalah. Of note is the portrait of Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi (known as \"the Hakham Tzvi\"), which is housed in the Jewish Museum in London. Based his interpretation of this prohibition, the Hakham Tzvi refused to sit for his portrait. However, the London Jewish Community wanted a portrait, so they commissioned the portrait to be done without the Hakham Tzvi's knowledge. The Hakham Tzvi's son, Rabbi Jacob Emden, says it was a perfect likeness.\n\nAdditionally, there is one type of representation, namely, bas-relief or raised representation on a flat surface, that is particularly problematic. Rabbi Jacob Emden discusses a medal struck in honor of Rabbi Eliezer Horowitz that features Horowitz's portrait. Emden ruled this violated the injunction against depictions. Furthermore, many hold that such representations in the synagogue either violate this injunction or are not permitted, as they give the appearance of violating this injunction. Most notably, Rabbi David ibn Zimra and Rabbi Joseph Karo hold that carvings of lions (e.g., representing the Lion of Judah) are inappropriate in synagogues.\n\nOn the other hand, some authorities hold that Judaism has no objection to photography or other forms of two-dimensional art, and depictions of humans can be seen in religious books such as the Passover Haggadah, as well as children's books about biblical and historical personages. Although most Hasidic Jews object to having televisions in their homes, this is not related to prohibitions against idolatry, but, rather, to the content of network and cable programming. Hasidim of all groups regularly display portraits of their Rebbes, and, in some communities, the children trade \"rabbi cards\" that are similar to baseball cards. In both Hasidic and Orthodox Judaism, taking photographs or filming are forbidden on the Sabbath and Jewish holy days, but this prohibition has nothing to do with idolatry. Rather, it is related to the prohibition against working or creating on these days.\n\nIn practice, many Jews throughout history have either accepted more permissive interpretations of the prohibition, or partly ignored it. Many art historians have long believed that there was a tradition in antiquity, with no surviving examples, of luxury illuminated manuscript scrolls of books from the Tanakh among Hellenized Jews. The evidence for this is Christian works of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods whose iconography is thought to derive from works in this tradition. Examples of the later works include the Joshua Roll and, more controversially, the Utrecht Psalter.\n\nNonetheless, the discovery in 1932 of the 3rd century Dura-Europos synagogue in Syria came as a considerable surprise, as it has large areas of wall-paintings with figures of the prophets and others, and narrative scenes. There are several representations of the Hand of God, suggesting that this motif reached Christian art from Judaism. A virtually unique Christian mosaic depiction of the \"Ark of the Covenant\" (806) at Germigny-des-Prés, which includes the hand, is believed also to be derived from Jewish iconography; the Ark also appears at Dura-Europos. Several ancient synagogues in Israel have also been excavated, revealing large floor-mosaics with figurative elements, especially animals and Hellenistic representations of the Zodiac. However, some of these, notably that at Naaran in the West Bank, have had the living figures removed, leaving inanimate symbols such as the menorah intact. It has been proposed that this was done by the Jewish community in the 6th or early 7th century, as part of a controversy within Judaism over images that paralleled that within Christianity leading to the Byzantine iconoclasm, leading to a stricter attitude towards images, at least in synagogues. There is also evidence that from about 570 new synagogue mosaics were aniconic. An alternative explanation for the removals is that they were done after the Muslim Conquest, and related to the decree of Caliph Yazid II in 721 (although this referred to Christian images). The decoration of the cave walls and sarcophagi at the Jewish cemetery at Beit She'arim also uses images, some drawn from Hellenistic pagan mythology, in the 2nd to 4th centuries CE.\n\nThere are many later Jewish illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages, and some other works with human figures. The \"Birds Head Haggadah\" (German, now in Jerusalem) gives all the human figures the heads of birds, presumably in an attempt to mitigate any breach of the prohibition.\n\nAlthough, in biblical times, Jews were actively iconoclasts, physically tearing down and destroying idols of other religions located within their political jurisdiction, today there is more tolerance for other cultures. In the state of Israel, all religious sites, Jewish and non-Jewish alike, are protected by law. Even though Jewish Law teaches that idolatry is forbidden to all of humanity as one of the seven Noahide Laws, Jews today combat it through discussion, debate, and education, rather than the physical destruction of statues and shrines. However, most traditional Jews still follow the prohibitions against entering places of idolatry, and will not attend functions held in buildings where there are religious statues.\n\nIn a refutation of the belief in an aniconic Judaism, and more generally in an underestimation of Jewish visual arts, the historian of ideas Kalman Bland recently proposed that the phenomenon is a modern construction, and that \"Jewish aniconism crystallized simultaneously with the construction of modern Jewish identities\". Others have also argued that the notion of a total prohibition of figural representation in the Biblical and Hellenistic-Roman periods is untenable.\n\nUntil the 20th century, Judaism was believed always to have been aniconic. The view was probably first challenged by Dávid Kaufmann, who marshalled a large and comprehensive corpus of data in order to prove it untenable. He was the first to use the term “Jewish art” in an article published in 1878, and is regarded as the founder of the scholarly discipline of Jewish art history. His disciple Dr. Samuel Krauss wrote in 1901:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4120340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4120340", "title": "Arts District, Los Angeles", "text": "Arts District, Los Angeles\n\nThe Arts District is a neighborhood on the eastern edge of Downtown Los Angeles, California, United States. The gritty area has given new life to old industrial buildings whose history often dates to the early 20th century. While much of the early creative art was done behind closed doors, the street scene has slowly been activated in the early years of the 21st century as more and more factories are creatively reused with some new construction interspersed. Art galleries have opened and given recognition to the area amidst the entire downtown where Art museums and additional galleries can be found. The city community planning boundaries are Alameda Street on the west which blends into Little Tokyo, First Street on the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and Violet Street on the south.\n\nSpanish Father Juan Crespi founded what is now known as the Arts District in 1796 during an expedition going to Alta California. During his journey he discovered a body of water that was surrounded by rich soil, this then inspired a passage into his observation journal that states: \"Should a town be needed in this location, this site shall be called Our Lady Queen of the Angels.\" The small pueblo was declared a new territory for the Spanish and was officially founded on September 4, 1781.\n\nVignes Street winds through the northeastern edge of the Arts District, parallel to and a couple of blocks west of the broad cement trench that memorializes the L.A. River. It is named for Jean-Louis Vignes, an aging adventurer and vintner who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 by way of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) and Bordeaux. He planted grapes on 104 acres where Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc vines imported from the south of France thrived, and by 1849 El Aliso - what the Vignes vineyard was entitled, called so after the sacred local sycamore tree of the same name - was the largest producer of wine in California. The grapes are gone, but the San Antonio Winery just north of the community is a reminder of the area’s past.\n\nBy the late 19th century, oranges and grapefruit had replaced grapes as the principal agricultural products of the area and the property west of the riverbank was thick with citrus groves. The groves provided a location for filmmaker DW Griffith who filmed parts of Hollywood’s first feature film (\"In Old California\") there in 1909. A single grapefruit tree remains, towering over the Japanese American Plaza off San Pedro Street and Azusa. Somewhere near Third Street and Alameda, a print shop became the area’s first commercial arts enterprise, employing artists from around the region designing labels for the boxes of citrus fruit shipped across the country.\n\nThe growing Santa Fe Freight Depot and warehouses created to serve the citrus industry’s shipping needs determined the area’s economic character for most of the next century and were responsible for the architectural flavor of the Arts District structures that have survived earthquakes, flood and fire. The single room hotels for rail workers to the northwest and the growth of Little Tokyo to the west and Chinatown to the north created a mix that was working class and cosmopolitan.\n\nBy World War II, the citrus groves had been replaced by factories and the rail freight business was giving way to the trucking industry. The area had taken on an industrial character that was growing seedy around the edges. Over the next twenty years, many of the independent small manufacturers had either been absorbed by larger competitors, grown too big for their quarters – or simply failed—and an increasing number of vacant warehouse and former factory spaces contributed to a dingy, decaying urban environment typical of many aging big American cities of the era.\n\nIn the 1950's many manufacturing companies fled oversees or were overtaken by larger manufacturing companies, resulting in vacant buildings and bringing property values down. Artists who were struggling to pay rent in the city started moving to the Arts District in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Before 1979 the Arts District buildings had been zoned for industrial use only. It wasn't until 1979 that the State of California passed a live/work legislation and in 1981 Los Angeles passed the bill Artist-In-Residence (AIR) . This new bill AIR would allow artists to live legally in the areas that could no longer be used for industrial use as long as they attained a business license. To make the living standards more comfortable the building code was lifted.New regulations had been created and the AIR legislation required the lofts to have a room to sleep, fire alarm, and other requirements for them to live legally.\n\nIn 1969, Allen Ruppersberg presented \"Al's Cafe\" at 1913 West Sixth Street. \nIn the mid-'70s, a handful of artists, including Joel Bass, Dan Citron, Woods Davy, Marc Kreisel, Jon Peterson, Stephen Seemayer, Maura Sheehan, Coleen Sterritt, Sydney Littenberg, Peter Zecher, and others saw opportunity in the empty buildings and began colonizing the area, converting former industrial and commercial spaces into working studios, sometimes renting space for as little as a three cents a square foot and carving out living quarters. This resulted in a surge of artistic activity, culminating in the highly controversial \"Downtown L.A. in Santa Barbara\" exhibition, organized by Betty Klausner for the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, which is now known as the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara. By the mid 1980s, the following artists were also living downtown: Linda Frye Burman, James Croak, Merion Estes, Joe Fay, George Herms, Mary Jones, Constance Mallinson, Paul McCarthy, Margaret Nielson, Richard Newton, Margit Omar, Lari Pittman, John Schroeder, Judy Simonian, Andy Wilf, and Takako Yamaguchi. Stephen Seemayer's film \"The Young Turks\"(2012) documents the 1979–1981 years.\n\nIn 1979, Marc Kreisel opened Al's Bar opened in the American Hotel on Hewitt just off Traction. This legendary punk rock venue was the training ground for Sonic Youth, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beck, the Fall, the Residents, introducing generations of Angelenos to dozens of emerging groups. The popular sound band \"Party Boys\" played the bars and art events.Also known as the downtown artists' central meeting place, Al's Bar occasionally hosted art exhibitions. Al's Bar, the west coast's oldest punk club, finally closed in 2001, and the American Hotel received a facelift in 2012 and was renamed the American Apartments.\n\nLA Artcore, founded in 1976 by Lydia Takeshita with the purpose of exhibiting local artists, exists today in locations at the Brewery Art Colony and in Little Tokyo. The Atomic Cafe on 1st Street at Alameda was an artists and musicians haunt in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) created exhibitions at its gallery space, located in the late 70s on Broadway St before moving to Industrial Street in the 1980s. Several commercial art galleries, including Oranges and Sardines, Kirk DeGoyer Gallery, the Downtown Gallery, Vanguard Gallery, Exile, and Galleria by the Water opened in the late seventies, only to close in the early eighties. Cirrus Editions, the first gallery to open downtown, remains open.\n\nAround 1980, Jon Peterson and Stephen Seemayer opened “DTLA,\" a club that had exactly one show before it closed, adjacent the Atomic Cafe. High Performance Magazine used DTLA as its performance space until its one-year lease was up. During that year, Paul McCarthy performed \"Monkey Man\" during the Public Spirit Performance Festival, Part 1. The name DTLA was later adopted by the neighboring coffee house where Beck got his start.\n\nIn 1981, the City of Los Angeles passed its \"Artist in Residence\" or \"AIR\" ordinance, which allowed residential use of formerly industrial and commercially zoned buildings; artists had long used such spaces as living quarters illegally, and the AIR law sought to bring this practice into legality and regulation. Art galleries, cafes and performance venues opened as the live/work population grew. \nDuring the '80s, Bedlam, created by artist Jim Fittipaldi, on 6th Street (and later, briefly, in the former premises of Al’s bar) was a salon with drawing workshops, art installations, theater, live music and a speakeasy. Dangerous Curve, on a dangerous curve of 4th Place between Mateo and Molino, put on exhibitions of artists whose work was often difficult to categorize. The Spanish Kitchen, a warehouse space on Third near Traction, was home to series of happenings, events, raves, installations and blowout parties. It now houses the 3rd Steakhouse and Lounge, an eatery that hosts community events and exhibitions of works by local artists. Cocola (later known as the 410 Boyd St. Bar and Grill), the legendary artists’ bar just west of the Arts District, lives on as Escondite.\n\nIn 1985, Fritz Frauchiger curated \"Off the Street,\" a \"one-time art exhibition\" sponsored by the Cultural Affairs Department in the Old City Print Shop, which featured paintings, sculptures, photographs and installations by 48 Los Angeles artists, most of whom lived downtown.\n\nIn 1994, the nonprofit group Downtown Arts Development Association (DADA) was formed as a spinoff of LARABA by several artist members of the LARABA board of directors in order to provide a platform for the burgeoning downtown art scene; DADA hosted exhibits of more than 400 downtown artists in 1994–1998. After 1994, the heart of the Arts District was Bloom’s General Store, presided over by Joel Bloom, a veteran of Chicago’s Second City, who became an advocate for the community and who is remembered as The Arts District’s once and only unofficial mayor. Bloom died in 2007, but his memory is honored with a plaque from the city declaring the triangle around Third, Traction and Rose to be Joel Bloom Square. Cornerstone Theater, an enterprise that brings community theater to locations all around the country, resided on Traction Avenue for 20 years. Around the corner, on Hewitt at 4th Pl., the non-profit ArtShare offers lessons in art, dance, theater and music to urban youth and features a small theater once used by Padua Playwrights. Padua stages plays around the city, often in non-traditional environments, and hosts play-writing workshops.\n\nThe Arts District is strategically located near the center of Downtown LA making it easier accessible for alternate forms of transportation. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) Gold Line station is located along Alameda St. The cross section streets are along East First St. and East Temple St. The small neighborhood is also serviced by the Los Angeles Department of Transportations (LADOT) DASH bus making several stops on Hewitt St. Additionally, Metro offers a bike share program in many neighborhoods around the Arts District area. The following five stations currently available to pick up or leave a bike are listed below. There are a total of sixteen parking lots scattered around the Arts District. As the area became a social hub for Angelinos, parking became an issue to the local resident. Public and private lots/ structures including on street parking offer a variety of parking options for visitors. \n\nLos Angeles Conservancy has provided information regarding the registered landmarks in the Arts District neighborhood. The nodes offers economic stability and revitalization for the community. \nThe real estate history of the Arts District in Los Angeles doesn't fit the usual definition of \"gentrification.\" In the 1970s there were millions of square feet of empty commercial and industrial space in downtown LA. Around 1970, artists began to colonize these spaces illegally and use them for live in studios. In 1980, in order to legalize these ad-hoc and unsafe residences, the City of Los Angeles created the \"Artist in Residence\" zoning variation ordinance. The ordinance necessarily included mandated upgrades to the artists spaces, many of which had fire/safety/health issues endangering the (artist) occupants. It also enabled developers who wished to rehab or create new or old studios that were now legal. These developments, with their increased building and safety requirements, raised the retail rental rates from 10–30 cents per square foot to about 65 cents per square foot in the early to mid-1980s.\n\nIn the late 1980s and through the 1990s several (about 20) large artist loft projects were developed from empty industrial buildings, including The Brewery, 900 East 1st St, Citizens Warehouse, 2101 E. 7th St., and Long Beach Ave Lofts, with rents ranging from 65 to 75 cents/ sq ft.\n\nAfter 2000, developers started converting large office buildings in the area west of the arts district under a new \"Live/Work\" ordinance. These apartments were marketed as lofts, although they bore little resemblance to the much larger lofts in the industrial district east of Alameda St. Rents in these live/work spaces started in the early 2000s at about $1.10 / sq ft, and over the next 15 years climbed to about $2.50/sq ft, due mainly to the high demand for the apartments and the increasing purchase price for the undeveloped buildings.\n\nThe rapid \"loft\" development west of Alameda, in which hundreds of thousands of sq ft of heretofore unused commercial space has been converted to live/work apartments, has led to a renaissance in downtown Los Angeles, an area long considered uninhabitable by middle class Angelenos. The increased popularity for downtown residences has continued to put upward pressure on loft rent in the Arts District, pushing rents in some of the older, more authentic artists loft buildings upwards towards $1.50- $2.00/ sq ft., pushing many longtime artist/tenants out of their lofts.\n\nThe city community planning boundaries today are Alameda Street on the west, First Street on the north, the Los Angeles River to the east, and Violet Street on the south. Challenges facing the Arts District today include the loss of affordable live/work lofts, loss of artists, and loss of historically significant buildings. Community leaders are struggling to create balance amidst the economic issues brought about by gentrification and the need to preserve the character of the Arts District as a creative community that has made contributions to the cultural and economic well-being of Los Angeles for decades. In 2014, the average annual income for neighborhood residents was $120,000. While the initial decades saw the conversion to residential and commercial uses of low-slung warehouses and industrial spaces, downtown zoning laws could be rewritten to permit the heights of buildings to double, allowing up to 1,500 new residential units to be built in 8-story, edifices.\n\nThe Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), resides in a quarter-mile-long () former Santa Fe Freight Depot built in 1907 that has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Across the street is a 438-unit apartment complex, \"One Santa Fe,\" that opened in 2014 and was designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture (MMA).\n\nThe century-old Coca-Cola manufacturing plant at 4th and Merrick streets, just around the corner from the enormous Santa Fe railroad dock that houses SCI-Arc, is the latest in adaptive reuse into creative spaces. The three-story brick-clad building was described as the \"headquarters for the company's Pacific Coast business and for its export trade in the Hawaiian Islands and Old Mexico\" when it was built in 1915.<ref name=\"LAT 3-7/2015\"></ref> The complex has been renamed Fourth & Traction after Traction Avenue. The Hauser Wirth & Schimmel complex opened in 2016 in buildings that date from the 1890s to the 1940s that occupy an entire city block on East 3rd Street.\n\nThe district continues to be a popular location for filming due to the historic vibe. In 2016, the head of the neighborhood’s business improvement district commented that “There’s not one day where there’s not shooting.” The popular TV sitcom New Girl takes place largely in their apartment loft located in the Arts District. Filming has become complicated due to the development of the retail sector, coffee shops, and residents who will be disturbed by filming at night. Also many formerly empty lots and desolate streets are now under development where crews used the space to park trucks and trailers.\n\nIn 2017 developer Suncal will proposed a 2 billion 1.95 million sq. ft mixed use project which includes two 58 story buildings designed by Hezorg and de Meuron. The project called 6 am will be located along 6th street between Mills and Alameda .The live/work space, will include 1,700 apartments and condos, shops, offices, hotels, charter school, and underground garage. Condos average price will be 1,000 per sq. ft. New developments have displaced artists since they can no longer afford the price hike in the Arts District. In 2016 the median price for property was $714,500. It's a huge increase from 2013 when open lofts were priced at 370 per sq ft.\n\nIn April 11, 2017 the district received a 15 million award from the Active Transportation Program which will enhance the Arts District with new bike lanes, enhancement of sidewalks,and street lighting.

The earliest use of a color photo on a cover is the February 1939 issue of \"True\" magazine, with the February 1940 edition apparently the first to feature a gag worn by a damsel in distress.\nThe peak era for these was the era from roughly 1959 until 1986, when, due to the Meese Commission (a contribution by Park Dietz), and the end of a few of the publishers of Detective (or \"True Crime\") magazines, the main era of the bondage cover ended, though there were a few issues of \"Detective Dragnet\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and a brief revival from about 1994 until 2000, though even then they were few and far between (unlike the late 1960s, when at least 2 such covers could be seen monthly).\nAlso, the use of over-the-mouth gags was common enough that the slang term \"detective gag\" is used for it.\n"}

{"id": "174255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174255", "title": "Chine-collé", "text": "Chine-collé\n\nChine-collé is a special technique in printmaking, in which the image is transferred to a surface that is bonded to a heavier support in the printing process. One purpose is to allow the printmaker to print on a much more delicate surface, such as Japanese paper or linen, that pulls finer details off the plate. Another purpose is to provide a background colour behind the image that is different from the surrounding backing sheet.\n\nThe final image will depend on the design and ink color of the printed image, the color and opacity of the paper to which the image is directly printed (plus any inclusions such as petals or fibers in that paper), and the color of the backing sheet.\n\n\"Chine-collé\" roughly translates from French \"chine\" = China, and \"collé\", meaning glued or pasted. The word \"chine\" is used because the thin paper traditionally used in the process was imported to Europe from China, India and/or Japan.\n\n\"Chine-collé\" is sometimes mistakenly used to refer to any type of collage.\n\nIn the typical \"direct print\" method, the plate is inked; thin paper (such as rice paper) is dampened, placed on the inked plate and trimmed to size; paste is applied to the thin paper; and the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet. This is then run through a printing press. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thin paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is trimmed to size and then quickly affixed in place.\n\nAnother way of printing the direct method is to have the thin paper already cut to size before preparing the plate to print. The heavier print paper has been put in the bath and dampened according to the printmaker's preference, then set aside. If the thin paper was painted on, it has been dried and is also set aside, ready. The plate is inked and wiped then placed on the press face up. Thin paste is brushed on the back of the rice paper and it is placed face down on the plate and registered. The paste is put on just enough to coat but not saturate, which dampens the thin paper appropriately. If one tries to brush paste on a damp piece of rice paper, it will tear. The print paper is then placed on top of the pasted side of the thin paper, a sheet of newsprint added on top of the stack, and the felts then covering the stack. It is then run through the press. This process is less tricky to maneuver than the first method, is cleaner, and more accurate in registration.\n\nIn the typical \"pre-pasted\" method, the thin paper (dry) is trimmed to the size of the plate, then paste is applied and allowed to dry. When the printmaker is ready to print, the paper is dampened to activate the paste and placed, paste-side up, on an inked plate. Then, the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet and run through a press as described above. An advantage of the pre-pasted method is that once dried, the paste-applied papers can be stored indefinitely, just like a lick-and-stick postage stamp. A disadvantage of this method is that because the paper is trimmed dry, the artist must take into account how much in each direction the paper will expand when it is dampened prior to printing.\n\nSome artists have moved away from precise trimming of a single sheet of paper to the size of the printing plate when using this method. For example, some experiment with pre-cut shapes for a collage effect, or simultaneously adhere multiple overlapping pieces of paper under the printed image.\n\nA more traditional paper choice would be a fine paper made from gampi fiber. Some artists experiment with non-traditional papers, using such things as newspaper, ephemera, dress patterns, and book pages as the sheet to be printed on.\n\nThere is some variation in adhesives used for \"Chine-collé\". Some artists are reported to use a dusting of flour right before pressing rather than paste. Some have tried using no adhesive at all, simply relying on the high pressure of the printing press and properties of the paper (fibers, sizing) to fuse the papers together similar to paper-making; however, this method may be variable and unreliable. More recently, some artists have turned to adhesives such as PVA glue or gel medium, rather than paste.\n\nIn traditional paste-making for \"Chine-collé\", wheat or rice starch is separated from gluten and other elements of wheat or rice flour. Pure starch is then cooked with distilled water to form a congealed gel. Finally the gel is passed through a fine sieve such as a piece of silk to form the paste. Starch-based pastes are considered archival, and are sometimes used in other paper-based applications, such as book binding, book repair and collage.\n\n"}

Its distinguishing characteristics are stylized open mouthed fish with indented fins and curving tails, often made of translucent glass and applied wavy colored threads, and affixed to the outer surface of the cup to produce its three-dimensional aspect. The most common type appears to have stylized fish swimming to the left. These vases could be entirely free-blown or their cup shape mold-blown, and the fish, or other sea creatures, free-blown onto it. The only four intact conchylia cups were found in Cologne, Trier, and Rome. Both Cologne and Trier have been suggested as manufacturing centers. Fish appliqués have been found throughout the Mediterranean, and provide no good clues for provenance. These cups were possibly used either as oil lamps, drinking vessels or for holding garum sauce. The most current thinking is that they were oil lamps, based on stylistic comparison with a 'cage' cup from Szekszard, Hungary, but may not be an entirely satisfactory answer, given that there seems to be no practical way of placing a wick in the cup. The only cup stemming from a datable context is from Cologne, and dated to the fourth century A.D. It is preserved in the Römisch-Germanisches Museum, Cologne.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1503269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1503269", "title": "Criterion Theatre", "text": "Criterion Theatre\n\nThe Criterion Theatre is a West End theatre at Piccadilly Circus in the City of Westminster, and is a Grade II* listed building. It has a seating capacity of 588.\n\nIn 1870, the caterers Spiers and Pond began development of the site of the White Bear, a seventeenth-century posting inn. The inn was located on sloping ground stretching between Jermyn Street and Piccadilly Circus, known as Regent Circus. A competition was held for the design of a concert hall complex, with Thomas Verity winning out of 15 entries. He was commissioned to design a large restaurant, dining rooms, ballroom, and galleried concert hall in the basement. The frontage, which was the façade of the restaurant, showed a French Renaissance influence using Portland stone.\n\nAfter the building work began, it was decided to change the concert hall into a theatre. The composers' names, which line the tiled staircases, were retained and can still be seen. The redesign placed the large Criterion Restaurant and dining rooms above the theatre, with a ballroom on the top floor.\n\nWhen Spiers and Pond applied for a licence to operate, the authorities were unhappy because the theatre was underground and lit by gas, creating the risk of toxic fumes. The Metropolitan Board of Works had to vote twice before the necessary licence was issued, and fresh air had to be pumped into the auditorium to prevent the audience from being asphyxiated. It was not until October 1881, at the Savoy, that the first theatre was lit electrically.\n\nThe building was completed in 1873 with the interior decoration carried out by Simpson and Son.\n\nThe first production opened on 21 March 1874 under the management of Henry J. Byron & EP Hingston. The programme consisted of \"An American Lady\" written and performed by Byron and a piece by W. S. Gilbert, with music by Alfred Cellier, entitled \"Topsyturveydom\". The event apparently did not make much of an impression on Gilbert. In a 1903 letter to Thomas Edgar Pemberton, author of the book on The Criterion, Gilbert wrote: \"I am sorry to say that in my mind is an absolute blank to the opening of The Criterion. I never saw \"Topseyturveydom\". If you happen to have a copy of it and could lend it to me for a few hours it might suggest some reminiscences: as it is I don't even know what the piece was about!\" Gilbert had, however, been back at the theatre in 1877 with his farce, \"On Bail\" (a revised version of his 1874 work, \"Committed for Trial\"); in 1881, with another farce, \"Foggerty's Fairy\"; and in 1892, with a comic opera, \"Haste to the Wedding\", with music by George Grossmith (an operatic version of Gilbert's 1873 play, \"The Wedding March\"). \"Haste to the Wedding\" was a flop, but it introduced the 18-year-old George Grossmith, Jr., the composer's son, to the London stage. The younger Grossmith would go on to become a major star in Edwardian musical comedies.\n\nCharles Wyndham became the manager and lessee in 1875, and under his management the Criterion became one of the leading light comedy houses in London. The first production under the manager was \"The Great Divorce Case\", opening on 15 April 1876. When Wyndham left in 1899 to open his own theatre, The Wyndham's Theatre (and then the New Theatre, now called the Noël Coward Theatre, in 1903) he remained the lessee bringing in various managements and their companies.\n\nIn March 1883 the theatre closed for alterations demanded by the Metropolitan Board of Works. The pumping of fresh air into the ten-year-old auditorium, some thirty feet below street level, was deemed unsatisfactory. Thomas Verity supervised the alterations (Verity by now had also designed the Comedy Theatre in 1881 and the Empire Theatre in 1882). The new direct access ventilation shaft meant cutting off a considerable portion of the adjoining Criterion Restaurant. New corridors were built, with several new exits. The auditorium was reconstructed and the stage re-equipped. The old dressing rooms were demolished and new ones built. Most importantly, electricity was installed. \"Dramatic Notes\" (1884) states \"The Criterion Theatre, transformed from a stuffy band-box to a convenient, handsome, and well ventilated house, reopened on April 16\". Further alterations and redecorations took place in 1902–03, when the theatre was closed for seven months.\n\nBetween the world wars productions included \"Musical Chairs\" with John Gielgud and in 1936, \"French Without Tears\" which ran for 1,039 performances and launched the writing career of Terence Rattigan.\n\nDuring World War II, the Criterion was requisitioned by the BBC – as an underground theatre it made an ideal studio safe from the London blitz – and light entertainment programmes were both recorded and broadcast live.\n\nAfter the war, the Criterion repertoire included avant-garde works such as Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\". The early part of 1956 saw the arrival of Anouilh's popular comedy, \"The Waltz of the Toreadors\", with impressive performances by Hugh Griffith and Beatrix Lehmann.\n\nIn the 1970s the Criterion site was proposed for redevelopment, which caused protest, as people feared the theatre would be lost. In February 1975 the GLC Planning Committee approved the development on the condition that the theatre continued in \"full, continuous and uninterrupted use\" while the redevelopments took place. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s the argument increased, and the Equity Save London's Theatre Committee organised high-profile demonstrations (campaigners included John Gielgud, Edward Woodward, Diana Rigg, Robert Morley and Prunella Scales) as they feared that the theatre would still be lost.\n\nIn the 1980s, the theatre building was purchased by Robert Bourne, a property tycoon and patron of the arts, and his wife, theatre impresario Sally Greene. The couple set up the Criterion Theatre Trust, a registered charity created to protect the Criterion's future. From 1989 to 1992 the theatre was renovated both in the back and front of the house. During that time, the block that exists today was built around it. After the refurbishment, the Criterion retains a well-preserved Victorian auditorium with an intimate atmosphere. Major productions in the last two decades of the century included \"Tom Foolery\" (1980–1981), \"Can't Pay? Won't Pay!\" (1981–1983), and the long-running \"Run for Your Wife\" (1983–1989).\n\nFrom 1996 to 2005, the theatre was home to productions of the Reduced Shakespeare Company, notably \"The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)\". The theatre hosted the first round of recalls for successful auditionees in ITV's \"Pop Idol\". The theatre is also used by leading drama institutions as a venue for their graduating students' annual showcases.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2015, the Criterion hosted the long-running melodrama \"The 39 Steps\", adapted for the stage by Patrick Barlow from John Buchan's 1915 novel, which was adapted for film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1935. \"Peppa Pig's Party\" transferred to the Criterion Theatre for the 2010 Christmas period to play alongside \"The 39 Steps\" and returned for the following 4 Christmas periods up to 2014.\n\nCriterion Presents, launched in October 2011, is an ancillary programme of shows, events and platforms that run alongside the main production, taking place at lunchtimes, early evenings and late nights.\n\n\n"}

A \"dangler\", or \"dangling plotline\", is a plot device in fiction where a plotline is forgotten, phased out and eventually dropped, thus a resolution is never achieved. Although dangling plotlines can occur in all forms of media, they typically appear in comic books, movies and book sequels, where the original writer or creative team can be replaced.\n\nTypically, a writer will pepper the main story with smaller back-stories. It then becomes evident to the reader that these smaller back-stories have the potential to build up into a bigger story and reach a conclusion of some sort.\n\nEditorial mandate can also force a writer to drop a building plotline due to fan backlash or an editor's lack of interest to pursue such a plot.\n\nIn television, when a creative team fears that their show may not be picked up for another season, they will end the season finale with a cliffhanger in order to conjure a fan outcry and interest to continue the series. When the series is not picked up for another season, the cliffhanger creates a dangling plotline. Usually the original writer, fan of the series, or the company who produced the series, will look to another form of media to continue the story. \"Twin Peaks\" was able to resolve some dangling plotlines due to the release of the . \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" got its own comic book series appropriately named \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight\", which was written by series creator Joss Whedon. In an extremely rare occasion, \"Futurama\" was continued six years later through direct-to-DVD films, which eventually led to the resurrection of the series in its original television format.\n\nIn comic books, it is a common practice for writers to resolve their own dangling plotlines in other comic books within the shared universe. A good example is Frank Tieri, who started a Weapon X story in Wolverine, who then later became the writer of his own Weapon X series and as the series ended abruptly, was forced to continue some of his side-stories in a miniseries called \"Weapon X: Days of Future Now\". One lingering plotline left a character in limbo from the \"Weapon X\" series until Frank Tieri took the reins of \"New Excalibur\", where he proceeded to close this character's storyline, five years later. Chris Claremont and Warren Ellis are also known for continuing their own stories throughout other books they write for. In a similar fashion, Mark Millar has continued the story of an ever-dangling character, Clyde Wyncham, all throughout his runs on \"Marvel 1985\", \"Kick-Ass\", \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Old Man Logan\".\n\nBecause of the unsatisfying nature of having a plotline dangle, fans sometimes take matters into their own hands. One famous example of this, the numerous directors and writers in the \"Halloween\" series each had different directions for their story of Michael Myers. This left many plot holes and dangling storylines after each movie. Seemingly unconnected, the movies would end with a cliffhanger and continue with absolutely no mention of the previous movie's occurrences. To remedy this mess of continuity, Chaos Comics published a comic book series to bridge the gaps between all the movies into one continuous canon.\n\n"}

The theatre opened in 1831, and closed in about 1881. The theatre was named for the actor, David Garrick, who had made his début at the nearby Goodman's Fields Theatre on 9 October 1741, playing the role of \"Richard III\".\n\nThe performance on 11 May 1840 was \"Marie!\" and \"Virginius the Rum’un!\", from an existent playbill. The plays were probably melodramas and some indication of the fare available at the time.\n\nThe first theatre burned down in 1846, and was rebuilt to open as \"The Albert and Garrick Royal Amphitheatre\". During rebuilding from 1852-1854, the neighbour, a gun manufacturer, obtained an injunction against the proprietor, Lawrence Levy, to restrict the height of the adjacent wall so as not to impede light to his premises. The theatre was managed by Lawrence Levy from 1854 until 1864. He returned to manage the theatre between 1867 and 1868. In 1856 E.B. Gaston was Stage Manager. The second theatre had a capacity of 462, although when Lawrence Levy put the theatre up for sale in 1866-1868, he claimed it \"will hold 1,600 persons\" and \"can be made to hold 2,500\", and then in 1868 was claiming \"Was built for a circus\" and \"Holds 1,700 persons; can be made for 8,000\".\n\nA young Barney Barnato is reputed to have begged pass outs from theatre leavers, to sell them on to others for a halfpenny\n\nAfter actor-manager J. B. Howe's bankruptcy in 1875, the theatre remained empty until 1879. Actress-manageress May Bulmer then ran the theatre until it was demolished, having a personal success in the light opera \"A Cruise to China\". Although Lawrence Levy had died in 1873, the theatre was still part of his estate in 1882 when his trustee testified at the Old Bailey in the trial of two men called Culver and Jacobs. They had been claiming to hold the lease of the theatre, and had fraudulently been taking payments from actors on the promise of providing them with engagements. The site of the theatre is today occupied by the old Leman Street Police Station, built in 1891.\n"}

She was described by William Hazlitt as \"perhaps the most tender and the most artless\" of all Shakespeare's women.\n\nAccording to some modern editions of Shakespeare's plays, notably the 1986 \"Oxford Edition\", the correct name is in fact \"Innogen\", and the spelling \"Imogen\" is an error which arose when the manuscripts were first committed to print. The name Innogen is mentioned as a ghost character in early editions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" as the wife of the Leonato character. Imogen in \"Cymbeline\" is paired with a character with the epithet \"Leonatus\".\n\nImogen is princess of Britain, and the virtuous wife of the exiled Posthumus, whose praise of her moral purity incites Posthumus's acquaintance Iachimo to bet Posthumus that he can seduce her. When he fails, Iachimo hides in her bedchamber and uncovers her body while she sleeps, observing details of a mole on her breast which he then describes to Posthumus as proof that he had slept with her. Posthumus plots to kill his wife, but the designated killer reveals the plot to Imogen and advises her to hide; she escapes to the woods dressed as a man and falls in with a family who help her. Taking a drug, she falls into a coma and is presumed dead by the family, who cover her body and sing a song over her. When she wakes she finds the headless body of Cloten, a brutish character who had planned to rape her while wearing Posthumus's clothes, but had been killed in a fight with one of the men who took her in. She mistakes the headless body for that of her husband. After the battle at the climax of the play she confronts Iachimo who confesses his lies. She is reunited with Posthumus, and her father (King Cymbeline), and discovers two of the men who took her in are actually her long lost brothers.\n\nOscar Wilde alludes to Imogen in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" when Dorian describes Sibyl Vane, the actress he is infatuated with.\n\n'It must be, if you say it. And now I am off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about tomorrow. Good-bye.'(Ch. IV)\n\nStephen Dedalus alludes to Imogen in \"Ulysses\", referring to the episode in which Iachomo observes the mole on her breast: \"Ravisher and ravished, what he would, but would not, go with him from Lucrece's bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen's breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted.\"\n\nE. M. Forster alludes to Imogen in \"Where Angels Fear to Tread\" when describing Lilia's sadness in her marriage: \"Not Cordelia nor Imogen more deserves our tears.\"\n\nA character in Anthony Trollope's \"Barchester Towers\" mentions Imogen: \"Imogen was true, but how was she rewarded? Her lord believed her to be the paramour of the first he who came near her in his absence.\"\n\nJohn Keats, a great admirer of Shakespeare, in a famous letter to Richard Woodhouse, contrasts Imogen to one of Shakespeare's most notoriously immoral characters, Iago, in order to describe the character of the poet: \"The poetical character has no self—it is everything and nothing—it has no character and enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated—it has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous philosopher delights the chameleon poet... A poet is the most unpoetical of anything in existence because he has no identity, he is continually filling some other body.\"\n\nImogen is also alluded to in Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story \"The Antique Ring\": \"Or, who knows, but it is the very ring which Posthumus received from Imogen?\"\n\nIn George Bernard Shaw's rewrite of the last act of \"Cymbeline\", \"Cymbeline Refinished\", Imogen becomes a much more assertive figure in line with Shaw's feminist views. She continually questions both Iachimo and Postumus at the end, refusing to forgive them before finally saying that she will \"go home and make the best of it, as other women must\".\n"}

Critic Tom Ewing described three criteria for defining an artist's imperial phase: \"command, permission, and self-definition\". He defined \"command\" as an artist's ability to push the boundaries of their medium in a way that produces lasting change. \"Permission\" is the public's goodwill toward and interest in the artist's work. Finally, \"self-definition\" is the concept that the imperial phase defines the rest of the artist's career; future works will be compared to those from the imperial phase.\n\n\n"}

The company has written and performed scores of full-length puppet plays, performed throughout the US, Canada, Korea, and Haiti and toured the Mississippi River from end to end. The theatre is best known for sponsoring the annual May Day Parade and Ceremony that is seen by as many as 50,000 people each year.\n\nHOBT began in 1973 as Powderhorn Puppet Theatre, named for a neighborhood park and lake in Minneapolis. In 1975, the theatre organized their first May Day procession and event. About 50-60 people and a few puppets marched, raised a maypole in the park, and had some speeches. In the next years, the event grew and evolved into a way to celebrate community builders.\n\nIn 1979, the theatre changed its name based on a suggestion by poet and theatre member Steven Lisner. In 1987, they moved into the Avalon Theater, a former cinema originally built in 1909 as the Royal Theatre. HOBT purchased the Avalon Theater in 1990 for the building and staging of productions.\n\nIn 1999, the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota exhibited \"Theatre of Wonder: Twenty-five Years In the Heart of the Beast\", celebrating the works and productions by the theatre.\n\nIn 2017, the theatre received $275,000 from the will of Sarah Bowman, a performer and longtime supporter of the theatre. The funds are planned to be used in upgrading the theatre building. In 2018, the organization was awarded a grant by The Jerome Foundation.\n\nOver the years, productions have used various styles of puppet and mask performances, including \"bunraku\" and larger-than-life puppets. These include:\n\nThe annual parade hosted by In the Heart of the Beast Theatre draws large crowds and showcases large puppets and floats and entertainment by performers. Each year's parade/festival has a theme, ranging from Spring and environmental topics to social topics like peace and racial justice. The event also features a festival in Powderhorn Park and a Tree of Life Ceremony involving more than 300 performers.\n\n\n\n"}

Though eventually incorporated into a number of disciplines, it was most famously adapted, and thoroughly analysed and discussed by the great Noh playwright Zeami, who viewed it as a universal concept applying to the patterns of movement of all things.\n\nIt is perhaps in the theatre that \"jo-ha-kyū\" is used the most extensively, on the most levels. Following the writings of Zeami, all major forms of Japanese traditional drama (Noh, kabuki, and \"jōruri\") utilize the concept of \"jo-ha-kyū\", from the choice and arrangement of plays across a day, to the composition and pacing of acts within a play, down to the individual actions of the actors.\n\nZeami, in his work \"Sandō\" (The Three Paths), originally described a five-part (five \"dan\") Noh play as the ideal form. It begins slowly and auspiciously in the first part (\"jo\"), building up the drama and tension in the second, third, and fourth parts (\"ha\"), with the greatest climax in the third \"dan\", and rapidly concluding with a return to peace and auspiciousness in the fifth \"dan\" (\"kyū\").\n\nThis same concept was later adapted into \"jōruri\" and kabuki, where the plays are often arranged into five acts with \"jo-ha-kyū\" in mind. Takemoto Gidayū, the great \"jōruri\" chanter, was the first to describe the patterns or logic behind the five acts, which parallel as well the five categories of Noh which would be performed across a day.\n\nHe described the first act as \"Love\"; the play opens auspiciously, using gentle themes and pleasant music to draw in the attention of the audience. The second act is described as \"Warriors and Battles\" (\"shura\"). Though it need not contain actual battle, it is generally typified by heightened tempo and intensity of plot. The third act, the climax of the entire play, is typified by pathos and tragedy. The plot achieves its dramatic climax. Takemoto describes the fourth act as a \"michiyuki\" (journey), which eases out of the intense drama of the climactic act, and often consists primarily of song and dance rather than dialogue and plot. The fifth act, then, is a rapid conclusion. All loose ends are tied up, and the play returns to an auspicious setting.\n\nIn 1356, it was Nijō Yoshimoto who established the sequential pattern of renga, haikai and noh by requiring jo-ha-kyū for renga in his \n\n"}

There is some disagreement among scholars as to which poems included in the surviving \"Man'yōshū\" originally came from the \"Hitomaro Kashū\", but it is between 364 and 370. Scholars have speculated on the nature of the original \"Hitomaro Kashū\" based on the surviving fragmentary and disjointed evidence.\n\nThe compiler of the \"Kakinomoto no Ason Hitomaro Kashū\", (hereafter the \"Hitomaro Kashū\") as well as its date and number of books are all unknown.

The term may also refer to such stories if planted by fake journalists, as well as the false story thereby published. A media prank is a form of culture jamming generally done as performance art or a practical joke for purposes of a humorous critique of mass media.\n\nIn May 1927, Jean-Paul Sartre, who was known as one of the fiercest pranksters at the \"École Normale Superieure\" organized with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland, a media prank following Charles Lindbergh's successful New York-Paris flight. Sartre & Co. called newspapers telling them that Lindbergh would be awarded an honorary degree by the \"École\". Many newspapers including \"Le Petit Parisien\" announced the event on May 25 and thousands showed up, unaware that they were witnessing a stunt with a look-alike. A scandal followed resulting in the resignation of the \"École\" director Gustave Lanson.\n\nOne well-known 1967 prank, orchestrated by Abbie Hoffman and Allen Ginsberg and chronicled in Norman Mailer's \"Armies of the Night\", involved a mock gathering protesting the Vietnam War (that many media took as a serious but misguided effort) intended to levitate the Pentagon.\n\nJoey Skaggs is one of the most prolific creators of media pranks in the United States, often using actors to stage outlandish public events that are then covered by news media as real stories. Among his many pranks, he convinced United Press International to report that cockroach hormones had been identified as a cure for arthritis, and tricked WABC-TV in New York city to create a news segment (which was nominated for an Emmy Award despite being untrue) about a supposed \"cathouse for dogs\".\n\nThe band Negativland is (according to Time Magazine) \"better known for media pranks than records\". The band, as an excuse for cancelling an upcoming tour, issued a press release claiming that a teenager who had committed a multiple ax murder did so after arguing with his parents over the meaning of its song, \"Christianity Is Stupid\". The story was picked up and reprinted as true by mass media, and the band wrote later songs about having perpetrated the hoax. In 2003 the band issued a series of press releases accusing Seattle, Washington radio station KJR-FM of playing 1980s music despite claiming it only played \"the best of the 60s and 70s\" then, after the radio station changed its format, issued more press releases announcing that it had all been a prank.\n\nBeginning in 1999 with the fake campaign-oriented website gwbush.com, the Yes Men have impersonated famous celebrities, politicians, and business officials at appearances, interviews, websites, and other media to make political points.\n\nIn December, 2009 an Argentina news station fell victim to a media prank. Acting on a Facebook link, an investigative reporter believed that the latest trend in underage drinking was tied to a new cocktail mix called Grog XD. Unbeknown to the reporter, the \nrecipe was from the video game \"The Secret of Monkey Island\".\n\nAlthough media pranks may serve as legitimate criticism of the press, and artistic creations in their own right, they are often criticized not only for the disruption they cause but as simple publicity stunts that take advantage of the very failures of mass media that they ostensibly oppose. Skaggs has criticized the Flash mob movement, as being frivolous and lacking the countercultural element of more serious protest art.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21938624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21938624", "title": "Oral storytelling", "text": "Oral storytelling\n\nOral storytelling is an ancient and intimate tradition between the storyteller and their audience. The storyteller and the listeners are physically close, often seated together in a circular fashion. Through the telling of the story people become psychically close, developing a connection to one another through the communal experience. The storyteller reveals, and thus shares, him/her self through his/her telling and the listeners reveal and share themselves through their reception of the story. The intimacy and connection is deepened by the flexibility of oral storytelling which allows the tale to be moulded according to the needs of the audience and/or the location or environment of the telling. Listeners also experience the urgency of a creative process taking place in their presence and they experience the empowerment of being a part of that creative process. Storytelling creates a personal bond with the teller and the audience.\n\nThe flexibility of oral storytelling extends to the teller. Each teller will incorporate their own personality and may choose to add characters into the story. As a result, there will be numerous variations of a single story. Some tellers consider anything outside the narrative as extraneous while other storytellers choose to enhance their telling of the tale with the addition of visual and audio tools, specific actions and creative strategies and devices.\n\nStorytelling may be performed in many forms: in prose, in poetic form, as a song, accompanied with dance or some kind of theatrical performance, etc.\n\nIt is likely that oral storytelling has been around as long as human language. Storytelling fulfills the need for human beings to cast their experiences in narrative form. Our ancestors probably gathered around the evening fires and expressed their fears, their beliefs and their heroism through oral narratives. This long tradition of storytelling is evident in ancient cultures such as the Australian Aborigines. Community storytelling offered the security of explanation; how life and its many forms began and why things happen, as well as entertainment and enchantment. Communities were strengthened and maintained through stories that connected the present, the past and the future.\n\nTelling stories is a nurturing act for the listener, who is connected to the storyteller through the story, as well as for the storyteller who is connected to the listeners through the story.\n\nEarly storytelling probably originates in simple chants . People sang chants as they worked at grinding corn or sharpening tools. Our early ancestors created myths to explain natural occurrences. They assigned superhuman qualities to ordinary people, thus originating the hero tale.\n\nEarly storytelling combined stories, poetry, music, and dance. Those who excelled at storytelling became entertainers, educators, cultural advisors, and historians for the community. Through storytellers, the history of a culture was handed down from generation to generation.\n\nThe importance of stories and storytellers throughout human history can be seen in the respect afforded to professional storytellers.\n\nThe 9th century fictional storyteller Scheherazade of \"One Thousand and One Nights\", who saves herself from execution by telling tales, is one example illustrating the value placed on storytelling in days of old. Centuries before Scheherazade, the power of storytelling is reflected by Vyasa at the beginning of the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\". Vyasa says, \"If you listen carefully, at the end you'll be someone else.\"\n\nIn the Middle Ages storytellers, also called a troubadour or a minstrel, could be seen in the market places and were honored as members of royal courts. Medieval storytellers were expected to know all the current tales and in the words of American storyteller Ruth Sawyer, ‘to repeat all the noteworthy theses from the universities, to be well informed on court scandal, to know the healing power of herbs and simples (medicines), to be able to compose verses to a lord or lady at a moment's notice, and to play on at least two of the instruments then in favor at court.’ According to some writers there were 426 minstrels employed at the wedding of Princess Margaret of England in 1290. Two of the storytellers of the court of King Edward I were two women who performed under the names of Matill Makejoye and Pearl in the Egg.\n\nJourneying from land to land, storytellers would learn various regions's stories while also gathering news to bring back with them. Through exchanging stories with other storytellers, stories changed, making it difficult to trace the origins of many stories.\n\nIn the 1800s Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm collected and published stories that had been told orally in Germany. They did not publish them as they found them however, but edited them in accordance with their own values. Like the Grimm brothers in Germany, Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jorgen Moe collected Norwegian folk tales. In Denmark Hans Christian Andersen adapted folktales he heard from oral storytellers. In England, Joseph Jacobs recorded collections of folktales of England, Scotland, Wales.\n\nIn the 1900s the importance of oral storytelling was recognised by storytellers such as Marie Shedlock, a retired English schoolteacher. She made several tours to the United States to lecture on the art of storytelling emphasising the importance of storytelling as a natural way to introduce literature to children.\n\n\nIn the 20th century oral storytelling has undergone a revival of interest and focus. Including the establishment of a number of storytelling festivals beginning with the National Storytelling Festival (USA) in Jonesborough, TN. \n\nRegional storytelling festivals bring tellers of a certain state or region together for entertaining, telling and education in the art.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV as the , and shortly thereafter was placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the ', but continued to be known more simply as the . Classical ballet as it is known today arose within the Paris Opera as the Paris Opera Ballet and has remained an integral and important part of the company. Currently called the ', it mainly produces operas at its modern 2700-seat theatre Opéra Bastille which opened in 1989, and ballets and some classical operas at the older 1970-seat Palais Garnier which opened in 1875. Small scale and contemporary works are also staged in the 500-seat Amphitheatre under the Opéra Bastille.\n\nThe company's annual budget is in the order of 200 million euros, of which 100 million come from the French state and 70 million from box office receipts. With this money, the company runs the two houses and supports a large permanent staff, which includes the orchestra of 170, a chorus of 110 and the \"corps de ballet\" of 150.\n\nEach year, the Opéra presents about 380 performances of opera, ballet and other concerts, to a total audience of about 800,000 people (of whom 17% come from abroad), which is a very good average seat occupancy rate of 94%. In the 2012/13 season, the Opéra presented 18 opera titles (two in a double bill), 13 ballets, 5 symphonic concerts and two vocal recitals, plus 15 other programmes. The company's training bodies are also active, with 7 concerts from the Atelier Lyrique and 4 programmes from the École de Danse.\n\nThe poet Pierre Perrin began thinking and writing about the possibility of French opera in 1655, more than a decade before the official founding of the Paris Opera as an institution. He believed that the prevailing opinion of the time that the French language was fundamentally unmusical was completely incorrect. Seventeenth-century France offered Perrin essentially two types of organization for realizing his vision: a royal academy or a public theater. In 1666 he proposed to the minister Colbert that \"the king decree 'the establishment of an Academy of Poetry and Music' whose goal would be to synthesize the French language and French music into an entirely new lyric form.\" \n\nEven though Perrin's original concept was of an academy devoted to discussions of French opera, the king's intention was in fact a unique hybrid of royal academy and public theatre, with an emphasis on the latter as an institution for performance. On 28 June 1669, Louis XIV signed the \"Privilège accordé au Sieur Perrin pour l'établissement d'une Académie d'Opéra en musique, & Vers François\" (Privilege granted to Sir Perrin for the establishment of an Academy of Opera in music, & French Verse). The wording of the \"privilège\", based in part on Perrin's own writings, gave him the exclusive right for 12 years to found anywhere in France academies of opera dedicated to the performance of opera in French. He was free to select business partners of his choice and to set the price of tickets. No one was to have the right of free entry including members of the royal court, and no one else could set up a similar institution. Although it was to be a public theatre, it retained its status as royal academy in which the authority of the king as the primary stakeholder was decisive. The monopoly, originally intended to protect the enterprise from competition during its formative phase, was renewed for subsequent recipients of the privilege up to the early French Revolution. As Victoria Johnson points out, \"the Opera was an organization \"by nature\" so luxurious and expensive in its productions that its very survival depended on financial protection and privilege.\"\n\nPerrin converted the Bouteille tennis court, located on the Rue des Fossés de Nesles (now 42 Rue Mazarine), into a rectangular facility with provisions for stage machinery and scenery changes and a capacity of about 1200 spectators. His first opera \"Pomone\" with music by Robert Cambert opened on 3 March 1671 and ran for 146 performances. A second work, \"Les peines et les plaisirs de l'amour\", with a libretto by Gabriel Gilbert and music by Cambert, was performed in 1672.\n\nDespite this early success, Cambert and two other associates did not hesitate to swindle Perrin, who was imprisoned for debt and forced to concede his privilege on 13 March 1672 to the \"surintendant\" of the king's music Jean-Baptiste Lully. The institution was renamed the Académie Royale de Musique and came to be known in France simply as the Opéra. Within one month Lully had convinced the king to expand the privilege by restricting the French and Italian comedians to using two singers rather than six, and six instrumentalists, rather than twelve. Because of legal difficulties Lully could not use the Salle de la Bouteille, and a new theatre was built by Carlo Vigarani at the Bel-Air tennis court on the Rue de Vaugirard. Later, Lully and his successors bitterly negotiated the concession of the privilege, in whole or in part, from the entrepreneurs in the provinces: in 1684 Pierre Gautier bought the authorisation to open a music academy in Marseille, then the towns of Lyon, Rouen, Lille and Bordeaux followed suit in the following years.\n\nDuring Lully's tenure, the only works performed were his own. The first productions were the pastorale \"Les fêtes de l'Amour et de Bacchus\" (November 1672) and his first \"tragedie lyrique\" called \"Cadmus et Hermione\" (27 April 1673).\nAfter Molière's death in 1673, his troupe merged with the players at the Théâtre du Marais to form the Théâtre Guénégaud (at the same theatre that had been used by the Académie d'Opéra), and no longer needed the theatre built by Richelieu at his residence the Palais-Royal, near the Louvre. (In 1680 the troupe at the Guénégaud merged again with the players from the Hôtel de Bourgogne forming the Comédie-Française.) Richelieu's theatre had been designed by Jacques Le Mercier and had opened in 1641, and unlike the huge theatre at the Tuileries Palace, which could accommodate 6,000 to 8,000 spectators, was of a size consistent with good acoustics. Lully greatly desired a better theatre and persuaded the king to let him use the one at the Palais-Royal free of charge. The Théâtre du Palais-Royal had been altered in 1660 and 1671, but Lully, with 3,000 \"livres\" received from the king, had further changes made by Vigarani in 1674.\n\nThe first production in the new theatre was \"Alceste\" on 19 January 1674. The opera was bitterly attacked by those enraged at the restrictions that Lully had caused to be placed on the French and Italian comedians. To mitigate the damage, Louis XIV arranged for new works to be premiered at the court, usually at the Chateau Vieux of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. This had the further advantage of subsidizing the cost of rehearsals, as well as most of the machinery, sets, and costumes, which were donated to the Opéra for use in Paris. During Lully's time at the Opéra, performances were given all year, except for three weeks at Easter. Regular performances were on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. The premieres presented at court were usually during Carnival and were moved to the Palais-Royal after Easter, where the openings were on Thursdays. About two to three new works were mounted each year. In all, thirteen of Lully's \"tragédie en musique\" were performed there (see the list of compositions by Jean-Baptiste Lully).\n\nAfter Lully died (in 1687), the number of new works per year almost doubled, since his successors (Pascal Collasse, Henri Desmarets, André Campra, André Cardinal Destouches, and Marin Marais) had greater difficulty sustaining the interest of the public. Revivals of Lully's works were common. French composers at the Opéra generally wrote music to new librettos, which had to be approved by the directors of the company. The Italian practice of preparing new settings of existing librettos was considered controversial and did not become the norm in Paris until around 1760. One of the most important of the new works during this period was an \"opéra-ballet\" by Campra called \"L'Europe galante\" presented in 1697.\n\nIn 1661 Louis XIV, who was a dancer himself and one of the great architects of baroque ballet (the art form which would one day evolve into classical ballet), established the Académie Royale de Danse, intended to codify court and character dances and to certify dance teachers by examination. From 1680 until Lully's death, it was under the direction of the great dancing master Pierre Beauchamp, the man who codified the five positions of the feet. When Lully took over the Opéra in 1672, he and Beauchamp made theatrical ballet an important part of the company's productions. The ballet of that time was merely an extension of the opera, having yet to evolve into an independent form of theatrical art. As it became more important, however, the dance component of the company began to be referred to as the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1713 an associated ballet school was opened, today known as the Paris Opera Ballet School. The Académie Royale de Danse remained separate, and with the fall of the monarchy in 1789 it disappeared.\n\nWith the French Revolution and the founding of the Republic, the company changed names several times, dropping its association with the royal family (see the List of official company names for details), and in 1794, moved into the Théâtre National de la rue de la Loi (capacity 2800) where it took the name Théâtre des Arts. In 1797, it was renamed the Théâtre de la République et des Arts.\n\nNapoleon took control of the company in 1802 and with the declaration of the French Empire in 1804, renamed the company the Académie Impériale de Musique. With the Restoration in 1814, the company was renamed the Académie Royale de Musique. It became part of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1816. In 1821, the company moved to the Salle Le Peletier, which had a capacity of 1900 spectators and where it remained until the building was destroyed by fire in 1873. \n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, with the ascension of Napoleon III in 1851, the name Académie Impériale de Musique was reinstated and after 1870 with the formation of the Third Republic, was changed to Théâtre National de l'Opéra. In 1875, the institution occupied a new home, the Palais Garnier. Between 1908 and 1914 Henri Benjamin Rabaud conducted at Palais Garnier. Rabaud also composed several works which first premiered at Opéra-Comique, but were later also performed at Palais Garnier.\n\nIn 1939, the Opéra was merged with the Opéra-Comique and the company name became Réunion des Théâtres Lyriques Nationaux. The Opéra-Comique was closed in 1972 with the appointment of Rolf Liebermann as general administrator of the Théâtre National de l'Opéra de Paris (1973–1980), but in 1976, the Opéra-Comique was restored.\n\nIn 1990 the Opéra moved its primary venue to the new Opéra-Bastille, becoming the Opéra de Paris, although it continued to mount productions, primarily ballet, at the Palais Garnier; and the Opéra-Comique regained its autonomy. In 1994 the Opéra de Paris became the Opéra National de Paris. Regardless of all the changes in its \"official\" name, the company and its theatres were commonly referred to as the Opéra.\n\nIn the period from 1725 to 1791 there were essentially four public theatres which were permitted in Paris:\nIn 1762, the Opéra-Comique merged with the Comédie-Italienne.\n\nIn 1791, the laws were changed allowing almost anyone to open a public theatre. This led to rapid growth in the number of theatres and companies and complexities in their naming. Theatres might burn down and be rebuilt using the name of an old or new company or patron. Some of the new theatres that appeared during this period include:\n\n\nAfter about 1870, the situation was simpler with regard to opera, with primarily the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique in operation. The naming situation became somewhat confusing after the Opéra-Comique's theater (the second Salle Favart) burned on 25 May 1887, since the company began performing in other locations. Companies other than the Opéra producing operas or operettas at various theatres in this period included:\n\n\nNotes\nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

It runs between Blackfriars Road to the west and Borough High Street to the east. It also connects the access routes for London Bridge, Southwark Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. At the eastern end to the north is Borough Market. \n\nThe road forms part of the A3200, which continues with Stamford Street to the west. \n\nIn April 1856, the St Saviour's District Board petitioned the Metropolitan Board of Works to create a new street to run between the South Eastern Railway terminus at London Bridge station and the West End. The street was the first to be made by the Board and was completed in 1864. It was driven across a densely occupied part of the parish and crosses older roads and streets which created oddly shaped plots for redevelopment. Its junction with Borough High Street is so gently curved that the transition between the streets leads to confusion and imprecision as to which is which and the street numbering and lack of a street name plate compounds this, the break between them occurs at the junction with Bedale Street on the north-side but at the south-side the street does not begin until after the 'fork' opposite Stoney Street, some 130 metres to the west. Under the street, a tunnel was constructed with side passages to carry utilities such as gas, water, and drainage pipes, together with telegraph wires for communication. This was an advanced feature for the time. \nDuring the first decade of the street's existence, many large commercial buildings were built along the street. The Hop Exchange, of 1874, is the most notable building at the northern side filling most of the quadrant formed by the street and the railway viaduct. Built in the 1870s, the former Menier Chocolate Factory factory on Southwark Street was converted to an arts complex that incorporates an art gallery, restaurant, and theatre, opening in 2004. In 1932 Borough Market built a formal gateway with administrative offices at Nos 6 and 8. In 1958 the Trustees erected a small office building at the junction with Stoney Street 'St Margaret's House'. At No 110, the western-end of the street, is the headquarters of IPC Media at the 'Blue Fin Building' completed in 2007.\n\nUnder the railway bridge carrying trains to Blackfriars Station from the south some urban art work has been placed on the south-side, whilst on the north-side the word 'Bankside' has been placed in very large lettering occupying most of the wall against the pavement. This is part of the area and tourist branding as the relationship with the ancient district of Bankside is tenuous, the most that can be said is that Southwark Street defines the southernmost limit of Bankside.\n\nThe building on the south-west corner of the junction with Great Guildford Street is, unusually, numbered 59½.\n\nIan Davenports' 2006 painting \"Poured Lines\" is displayed under the rail bridge at the western end of Southwark Street.

{"id": "29454281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29454281", "title": "The Help (film)", "text": "The Help (film)\n\nThe Help is a 2011 American period drama film written and directed by Tate Taylor and adapted from Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name. The film features an ensemble cast, including Jessica Chastain, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Allison Janney, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone. The film and novel recount the story of young white woman and aspiring journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan. The story focuses on her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the Civil Rights Movement in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. In an attempt to become a legitimate journalist and writer, Skeeter decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids—referred to as \"the help\"— exposing the racism they are faced with as they work for white families.\n\nDreamWorks Pictures acquired the screen rights to Stockett's novel in March 2010 and quickly commissioned the film into production with Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Brunson Green as producers. The film's casting began later that month, with principal photography following four months after in Mississippi.\n\nTouchstone Pictures released \"The Help\" worldwide, with a general theatrical release in North America on August 10, 2011. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews and grossing $216 million in worldwide box office. \"The Help\" received four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Actress for Davis, and Best Supporting Actress for both Chastain and Spencer, with the latter winning the award. The film also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.\n\nIn 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in Jackson, Mississippi, and in intermittent voice overs she tells her \"career\" story to the aspiring writer Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, a recent graduate of Ole Miss and a friend of Aibileen's employer and fellow socialite Elizabeth Leefolt. Aibileen cares for the Leefolt's daughter, Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileen's best friend is the plain-spoken Minny Jackson, who works for Mrs. Walters, the mother of Hilly Holbrook, the leader of the women's socialite group.\n\nSkeeter is uncomfortable with the racist attitudes of her socialite friends towards their maids. She is shocked when Hilly forwards a letter to the Home Sanitation Initiative to install separate bathrooms for the help. Skeeter later learns that her mother Charlotte fired her childhood maid Constantine for unknown reasons.\n\nDuring a terrible storm, Minny refuses to go out to use the help's toilet and uses the guest's bathroom, resulting in her getting fired by Hilly, who then slanders her name with claims of theft, rendering her essentially unemployable.\n\nMinny eventually finds a job with Celia, wife of Johnny Foote, Hilly's former beau. The two become friends through Minny's cooking lessons, though they keep Minny's employment secret from Johnny. Celia suffers a miscarriage and reveals to Minny that she has suffered three previous miscarriages. Minny comes upon Skeeter's visiting Aibileen and joins in the book project effort. Skeeter is advised by her book editor at Harper & Row, Elaine Stein, that the stories of two maids are not enough, but potential retribution from the maid's employers hinders others from joining the project. Aibileen tells Skeeter about the pain she experiences about her son being fatally crushed while on the job. Aibileen has struggled to find closure from his death, and believes that helping with the book will enable her to find that closure.\n\nHilly refuses to lend more money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. One day, she discovers a discarded ring and pawns it. However, Yule May is brutally arrested after Hilly reports the theft. Following this and the assassination of Medgar Evers, more maids come forward with their stories, believing the book would help put an end to the brutality against African-Americans.\n\nFollowing the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear that the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny then reveals the \"terrible awful\" that she did to Hilly: following her termination, Minny baked her renowned chocolate pie and gave it to Hilly. Minny, however, prevented Mrs. Walters from having a slice, and revealed that she baked her own excrement into the pie. Its inclusion in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about Jackson.\n\nSkeeter confronts her mother Charlotte about Constantine's termination. Charlotte reveals that during a lunch with the local chapter of the Daughters of America, Constantine's daughter Rachel arrived. Rachel disobeyed Charlotte's orders of entering through the kitchen and embarrassed her. In order to save face, Charlotte fired Constantine and ordered them both to leave. Shortly afterward, Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died. Charlotte had every intention to bring Constantine back to Jackson.\nThe book is published anonymously, and it is a success. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" to Celia, who finally sees Hilly as the manipulative bully that she is. Celia lets on that she knows about the \"terrible awful\" by writing a check to one of Hilly's charity groups made out to \"Two Slice Hilly\". Incensed, Hilly confronts and attempts to intimidate Skeeter through threat of legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that \"that\" is in chapter 12. Charlotte then intervenes, lets on that she knows about the \"terrible awful\" and orders Hilly off the property. Charlotte and Skeeter reconcile when Charlotte tells her how proud she is about her courage, the book and the job offer in New York City.\n\nJohnny approaches Minny and reveals that he knew that she'd been working at his house, how appreciative he is about her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This act of kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children away from her abusive husband and never look back.\n\nIn an attempt to seek revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, with Hilly present and trying to frame Aibileen for theft. But Aibileen stands up to Hilly, calling her a godless woman, never satisfied until she gets what she wants. Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Elizabeth's daughter and pleads with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance, as Elizabeth begins to cry. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure. She looks to her future as a writer.\n\nIn December 2009, Variety reported that Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Mark Radcliffe would produce a film adaptation of The Help, under their production company 1492 Pictures. Brunson Green of Harbinger Productions also co-produced. The film was written and directed by Stockett's childhood friend, Tate Taylor, who optioned film rights to the book before its publication. DreamWorks acquired the film rights to the novel in March 2010. Reliance Entertainment and Participant Media co-produced the film.\n\nThe first casting news for the production came in March 2010, when it was reported that Stone was attached to play the role of Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan. Other actors were since cast, including Davis as Aibileen; Howard as Hilly Holbrook, Jackson's snooty town ringleader; Janney as Charlotte Phelan, Skeeter's mother; and Lowell as Stuart Whitworth, Skeeter's boyfriend and a senator's son. Leslie Jordan appears as the editor of the fictional local newspaper, \"The Jackson Journal\". Mike Vogel plays the character Johnny Foote. Octavia Spencer portrays Minny. A longtime friend of Stockett and Taylor, Spencer inspired the character of Minny in Stockett's novel and voiced her in the audiobook version.\n\nFilming began in July 2010 and extended through October. The town of Greenwood, Mississippi, was chosen to portray 1960s-era Jackson, and producer Green said he had expected to shoot \"95 percent\" of the film there. Parts of the film were also shot in the real-life Jackson, as well as in nearby Clarksdale and Greenville. One of the few locations that existed in 1963 Jackson, the book and the film is Jackson landmark Brent's Drugs, which dates to 1946. Other locations that can still be found in Jackson include the New Capitol Building and the Mayflower Cafe downtown. Scenes set at the \"Jackson Journal\" office were shot in Clarksdale at the building which formerly housed the \"Clarksdale Press Register\" for 40 years until April 2010.\n\n\"The Help\" was the most significant film production in Mississippi since \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\" (2000) \"Honestly, my heart would be broken if it were set anywhere but Mississippi\", Stockett wrote in an e-mail to reporters. In order to convince producers to shoot in Greenwood, Tate Taylor and others had previously come to the town and scouted out locations; at his first meeting with DreamWorks executives, he presented them with a photo album of potential filming spots in the area. The state's tax incentive program for filmmakers was also a key enticement in the decision.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributed \"The Help\" worldwide through the studio's Touchstone Pictures banner. On October 13, 2010, Disney gave the film a release date of August 12, 2011. On June 30, 2011, the film's release date was rescheduled two days earlier to August 10, 2011.\n\nThe film was released by Touchstone Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and digital download on December 6, 2011. The release was produced in three different physical packages: a three-disc combo pack (Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy); a two-disc combo pack (Blu-ray and DVD); and a single-disc DVD. It was also released as a digital download option in both standard and high definition. The DVD version includes two deleted scenes and \"The Living Proof\" music video by Mary J. Blige. The digital download version includes the same features as the DVD version, plus one additional deleted scene. Both the two-disc and three-disc combo packs include the same features as the DVD version, as well as \"The Making of 'The Help': From Friendship to Film\", \"In Their Own Words: A Tribute to the Maids of Mississippi\", and three deleted scenes with introductions by director Taylor.\n\n\"The Help\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 75% of 216 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Though arguably guilty of glossing over its racial themes, \"The Help\" rises on the strength of its cast—particularly Viola Davis, whose performance is powerful enough to carry the film on its own.\" Metacritic, a review aggregator which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 62 based on 41 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was an \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nTom Long from \"The Detroit News\" remarked about the film: \"Appealling, entertaining, touching and perhaps even a bit healing, \"The Help\" is an old-fashioned grand yarn of a film, the sort we rarely get these days.\" Connie Ogle of \"The Miami Herald\" gave the film three out of four stars and said it \"will make you laugh, yes, but it can also break your heart. In the dog days of August moviegoing, that's a powerful recommendation.\"\n\nA more mixed review from Karina Longworth of \"The Village Voice\" said: \"We get a fairly typical Hollywood flattening of history, with powerful villains and disenfranchised heroes.\" Rick Groen of \"The Globe and Mail\", giving the film two out of four stars, said: \"Typically, this sort of film is an earnest tear-jerker with moments of levity. Instead, what we have here is a raucous rib-tickler with occasional pauses for a little dramatic relief.\" Referring to the film as a \"big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum\", \"The New York Times\" noted that \"save for Ms. Davis's, however, the performances are almost all overly broad, sometimes excruciatingly so, characterized by loud laughs, bugging eyes and pumping limbs.\"\n\nSome of the negative reviews criticized the film for its inability to match the quality of the book. Chris Hewitt of the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\" said about the film: \"Some adaptations find a fresh, cinematic way to convey a book's spirit but \"The Help\" doesn't.\"\n\nMany critics praised the performances of Davis and Spencer. Wilson Morales of Blackfilm.com gave the movie three out of four stars and commented, \"With powerful performances given by Viola Davis and scene stealer Octavia Spencer, the film is an emotionally moving drama that remains highly entertaining.\" David Edelstein from \"New York\" magazine commented that, \"\"The Help\" belongs to Viola Davis.\"\n\nIda E. Jones, the national director of the Association of Black Women Historians, released an open statement criticizing the film, stating \"[d]espite efforts to market the book and the film as a progressive story of triumph over racial injustice, \"The Help\" distorts, ignores, and trivializes the experiences of black domestic workers.\" The ABWH accused both the book and the film of insensitive portrayals of African-American vernacular, a nearly uniform depiction of black men as cruel or absent, and a failure to acknowledge the sexual harassment that many black women endured in their white employers' homes. Jones concluded by saying that \"The Association of Black Women Historians finds it unacceptable for either this book or this film to strip black women's lives of historical accuracy for the sake of entertainment.\"\n\nRoxane Gay of literary web magazine \"The Rumpus\" argues the film might be offensive to African Americans, saying the film uses racial Hollywood tropes like the Magical Negro character. In 2014, the movie was one of several discussed by Keli Goff in \"The Daily Beast\" in an article concerning white savior narratives in film.\n\n\"The Help\" earned $169,708,112 in North America and $46,931,000 in other territories for a worldwide total of $216,639,112.\n\nIn North America, on its opening day (Wednesday, August 10, 2011), it topped the box office with $5.54 million. It then added $4.33 million on Thursday, declining only 21 percent, a two-day total to $9.87 million. On its first weekend, the film grossed $26.0 million, coming in second place behind \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\". However, during its second weekend, the film jumped to first place with $20.0 million, declining only 23 percent, the smallest drop among films playing nationwide. The film crossed the $100 million mark on its 21st day of release, becoming one of only two titles in August 2011 that achieved this. On its fourth weekend (Labor Day three-day weekend), it became the first film since \"Inception\" (2010), to top the box-office charts for three consecutive weekends. Its four-day weekend haul of $19.9 million was the fourth largest for a Labor-day weekend. Notably, \"The Help\" topped the box office for 25 days in a row. This was the longest uninterrupted streak since \"The Sixth Sense\" (35 days), which was also a late summer release, in 1999.\n\nTo promote the film, TakePart hosted a series of three writing contests. Rebecca Lubin, of Mill Valley, California, who has been a nanny for nearly two decades won the recipe contest. Darcy Pattison's \"11 Ways to Ruin a Photograph\" won \"The Help\" Children's Story Contest with her story about a tenacious young girl who refuses to take a good photograph while her father is away \"soldiering\". After being chosen by guest judge and children's-book author Lou Berger, the story was professionally illustrated. The final contest was about \"someone who inspired you\". Genoveva Islas-Hooker charmed guest judge Doc Hendley (founder of Wine to Water) with her story, A Heroine Named Confidential. A case manager for patients with HIV, Islas-Hooker was consistently inspired by one special individual who never gave up the fight to live.\n\nAt the 84th Academy Awards, Octavia Spencer won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film. The film also received three other Academy Award nominations: Academy Award for Best Picture, Academy Award for Best Actress for Viola Davis, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Jessica Chastain.\n\nThe original song is \"The Living Proof\" by Mary J. Blige. The soundtrack was released on July 26, 2011, through Geffen Records.\n\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman; Varèse Sarabande released a score album on September 13, 2011.\n\n\n"}

It is considered the best of several versions of a Rommelpot player by Frans Hals.\n\nFifteen versions of this painting were documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote:\n\"The Rommelpot- Player. In the centre is a man turned \nthree-quarters left. He faces the spectator and laughs heartily. He is in \ndark clothes with a broad brimmed felt hat. His left forearm encircles \nthe rommelpot (or bagpipes) ; in his right hand is a little stick with which \nhe plays on it. Six laughing children surround him. The biggest boy, \nbehind him to the right, claps his hands with delight. The other five \nchildren are to the left. Four of them are placed so that their heads make \na diagonal line down to the left. The second boy from the top has a \nslouch hat. The fifth child, a girl, stands to the left behind this boy. In \nthe background peasants look in at a door. \n\nVariants of this composition exist.

Young's essay uses ideas from philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty to examine how perceptions of the female body relate to task performance and confidence.\n\nYoung begins her essay with a critique of Erwin Straus, and his conclusion that the physical differences between men and women are biological. Straus studied the differences in how young boys and girls each threw a ball, and noted that the boys utilized more physical space and energy to exert their throw, concluding that the differences were due to a difference in biology. Young argues that because these children were pre-pubescent and were physically quite similar, their differing approaches were due to differing understandings of body comportment.\n\nTo elaborate, Young introduces Simone de Beauvoir’s account of women’s existence as constrained. Young asserts that de Beauvoir neglected several important aspects and, formulated to misconception that womens' anatomies that determine their being unfree. The female body then becomes something to transcend, or break free from, rather than something that people recognize is in fact conditioned to be the way it is.\n\nYoung explains this gap in understanding as her motivation in writing the essay; to examine further the functionality of women's' bodies in a given space. The society she focuses on is about women in a \"contemporary advanced industrial, urban, and commercial society\" specifically, with attention to how the modalities of the feminine body are restricted in attempt to achieve specific goals, such as throwing a ball.\n\nTo outline the framework of her essay, Young first defines what it means to be feminine as \"a set of structures and conditions which delimit the typical situation of being a woman in a particular society, as well as the typical way in which this situation is lived by the women themselves.\" Femininity is therefore not a characteristic or trait, but a quality of the female existence. Young argues women are \"Others\" in society, and are deprived of basic human qualities because of their sub-ordinance within the patriarchy. Women must therefore struggle to transcend this bodily comportment, Young argues.\n\nYoung returns to Straus's observations of women engaging in physical activity, and also incorporates her own experiences to make the argument that women are physically no less capable than men, but underperform due to psychological barriers. She claims that women engage in a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which they do not see themselves as capable, so they do not “summon the full possibilities of our muscular coordination, position, poise, and bearing” as men. This is partially contributed to the idea that a woman has a constricted space to move in, while a man does not feel these limitations. In addition to the fear of taking up too much space, women also have a stronger fear of getting hurt, and underestimate their bodily capacity. Young writes, \"We decide beforehand — usually mistakenly — that the task is beyond us, and thus give it less than our full effort.\" This concept results in the phrase, \"throwing like a girl;\" although women are physically capable to throw, or perform a task, successfully, it is their understanding of societal bodily comportment that prevents them from performing a task to the best of their ability.\n\nIn Section II, Young explains three modalities of feminine mobility that prevent a woman from engaging in the world to her body's full capacity. She cites Mzerleau-Ponty, Satre, and previous \"intellectual thinkers,\" whom argued that a person could transcend societal boundaries by consciousness alone. Young counters this idea, and says that the body in itself must be aware of its surroundings, in order to transcend. She identifies feminine transcendence as \"ambiguous transcendence\", explaining that \"all transcendence is ambiguous because the body as natural and material is immanence.\" Young refers to her previous observations that women only use parts of their body to perform a task, and thus concludes that while these parts move, the rest of the female body remains rooted in immanence. Because of this dysphoria, women simultaneously view their bodies as a burden, and as something that needs protected.\n\nYoung explains this existence as in an \"inhibited intentionality\". She writes, \"When the woman enters a task with inhibited intentionality, she projects the possibilities of that task — thus projects an \"I can\" — but projects them merely as the possibilities of \"someone,\" and not truly her possibilities — and thus projects an \"/ cannot.\" This again refers to her previously stated self-fulfilling prophecy, in which women do not succeed in tasks to the best of their ability, because they do not believe that they can do so; hence, why they \"throw like a girl.\"\n\nThe third modality of feminine mobility presented in Young's essay is \"discontinuous unity.\" Young theorizes that the female body sees its surrounding space as \"a continous extension of its own being,\" thus restricting its own movement. Additionally, the parts of a body moves when performing a task are isolated from the rest of her body, which remains immobile. Mzerleau-Ponty explains that women thus see their bodies as both the subject and object of an action; for example, \"women have a tendency to take up the motion of an object coming toward them as coming at them.\" When a woman views her body as the object of the action rather than the subject, it is even more difficult for her body to transcend and perform to its full capability.\n\nYoung concludes that women therefore have constrained bodily comportment and mobility, because she sees her body as an object rooted in an imminence she is unable to transcend.\n\nYoung next delves into the concept of female bodies in their respective spaces, and introduces Merleau-Ponty's distinction between lived space and objective space. These two concepts merge for men, but for women, their existence is confined in their living space and does not expand into all objective space. Young cites a study by Erik Erikson, in which Erikson asked several young male and female participants to construct a scene for a movie, given a set of props. He observed that the females set their scenes constricted inside, utilizing \"inner space,\" while the males set their scenes in the outdoors, utilizing \"outer space.\" Erikson concluded that this was an psychoanalytic expression, with respect to each gender's anatomies — the female subjects subconsciously projected the inner space of their wombs and vaginas, while the male subjects subconsciously projected the outer space their phalluses occupy. Young discredits this theory, and argues that women favored inner space, because that is where their bodies move in space.\n\nIn terms of limited mobility, Young writes that women often use and inhabit a smaller space than what is realistically available. For example, when a ball is thrown, a woman will \"stay in one place and react to the balls motion only when it has arrived within the space where she is.\" The female spatiality is limited based on her limited perception of what she is physically capable of, if she were to be able to transcend her body's discontinued unity.\n\nBecause women are seemingly stuck within their inner spaces, they experience a \"double spatiality,\" in which there is a perceived difference between space \"here\" and \"yonder.\" Young contends that women are positioned in space, while men can freely move through it. This further contributes to a woman viewing her own body as an object, because she does not have the autonomy to move her body freely to constitute actions, but rather she remains within her space and receives the action. Young demonstrates this assertion by referring back to her observations that women only use parts of their body to perform a task, while the rest remains immobile, stuck in its constricted space. This further proves her previous rejection of Erikson's conclusions; because a woman sees herself as rooted and enclosed in a space, \"then on the reversability assumption it would follow that visual space for feminine existence also has its closures of immobility and fixity.\"\n\nYoung concludes the paper with the assertion that these constraints are the result of living in a patriarchal, and sexist society. Women are not given the societal acceptance to take up as much space as men, and are taught from a young age to contain themselves in a small, enclosed, \"inner space.\" Young girls are taught, both implicitly and explicitly, to follow the precedent of limited female spatiality and consequentially grow into \"throwing like a girl.\" Once these girls have reached womanhood, they have embraced the conception that their bodies are fragile, and are both a subject and an object to be protected; women are aware that their bodies are seen as sexual objects by men, and that their bodies are objects receiving the male gaze. Young argues this further entrenches the discontinuity a woman has with her own body, as she fears that being outwardly direct will be perceived as an invitation to be objectified. She writes, \"The woman lives her space as confined and enclosed around her at least in part as projecting some small area in which she can exist as a free subject.\"\n\nWhile Young contends she has drawn sufficient conclusions on the modalities of feminine mobility, she introduces several questions that her paper raises. She questions how women perform differently than men in activities that do not require full-body movement, and in activities that do not have a clear goal, such as sex or dancing. Furthermore, Young questions how the constrained spatiality of the feminine body affects women's lives as a whole; she concludes with the suggestion that the lack of confidence women have about their physical abilities has resulted in their lack of confidence to be successful in cognitive or leadership abilities.\n\nThis essay has become a classic in feminist theory for its attention to female experiences and embodiment. It has been praised for breaking radical new ground in philosophy and providing a strong foundation for performance and corporeality studies. Because of its popularity, it has been reprinted in several book-length collections of essays and features in the title (see \"Throwing Like a Girl and Other Essays in Feminist Philosophy and Social Theory\" (1990) and \"On Female Body Experience: 'Throwing Like a Girl' and Other Essays\" (2005)).\n\n"}

She is considered one of the few leading female auteurs of Korean New Wave cinema.\n\nBorn in 1961 in Incheon, Yim Soon-rye graduated from Hanyang University in 1985 with a B.A. in English Literature and an M.A. in Theater and Film. She received her master's degree in Film Studies from Paris 8 University in 1992 with a thesis titled \"Study on Kenji Mizoguchi.\"\n\nUpon her return to Korea in 1993, she worked as an assistant director on Yeo Kyun-dong's \"Out to the World\". In 1994, she directed her first short film \"Promenade in the Rain\", which won the Grand Prize and the Press Award at the 1st Seoul International Short Film Festival.\n\nShe made her feature film debut with \"Three Friends\" (1996), which explored Korean masculinity and marginalization through the lives of three young men who have difficulty adjusting to the social system. It won the NETPAC Award at the 6th Pusan International Film Festival.\n\nHer second feature was \"Waikiki Brothers\" in 2001, a bittersweet drama about a struggling nightclub band that wanders from one small town to another for a gig. It was the opening film of the 2nd Jeonju International Film Festival. Despite low ticket sales, \"Waikiki Brothers\" drew critical acclaim, with film critic Shim Young-seop praising Yim's use of long takes as a manifestation of the director's deep love for her characters. Yim won Best Screenplay at the 9th Chunsa Film Art Awards and Best Director at the 21st Korean Association of Film Critics Awards in 2001, while \"Waikiki Brothers\" won Best Film at the 38th Baeksang Arts Awards in 2002. And with its cult following, the film was later adapted into the stage musical \"Go! Waikiki Brothers!\" in 2004.\n\nYim's follow-up was the documentary \"Keeping the Vision Alive: Women in Korean Filmmaking\" (2001), an homage to both pioneers such as Park Nam-ok and Hwang Hye-mi, and contemporary directors like Byun Young-joo and Jang Hee-sun. Through images and interviews, Yim's camera unobtrusively let the women filmmakers discuss their experiences, struggles and survival in the male-dominated, conservative and sexist Korean film industry.\n\nIn 2003, Yim was among six filmmakers who participated in \"If You Were Me\", an omnibus funded by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea (NHRCK) that deals with different human rights issues. Yim's short film \"The Weight of Her\" is a satirical take on female beauty and body image, as a high school girl feels pressured to undergo plastic surgery in order to get hired.\n\nYim then produced \"A Smile\", the feature directorial debut of fellow female Korean director Park Kyung-hee, and later made a cameo appearance in Park's short film \"Under a Big Tree\". She also appeared in Ryoo Seung-wan's 2006 short film \"Hey Man\" (which skewers Korean machismo), and was among the subjects of Hiroko Yamazaki's 2007 documentary \"Viva! Women Directors\".\n\nSeven years after \"Waikiki Brothers\", Yim directed her third feature film \"Forever the Moment\", titled in Korean \"The Best Moment of Our Lives.\" Based on the true story of the South Korean women's national handball team that won the silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, Yim struck a balance between genre conventions and her own arthouse style by combining the dynamism and fast pacing of a mainstream sports film with character beats of the female athletes experiencing discrimination and job insecurity in their field and divorce, debt, and infertility in their personal lives. With over 4 million tickets sold in 2008, the sports drama became a sleeper hit and Yim's most commercially successful film yet.\n\nYim received the Park Nam-ok Award for outstanding achievement (named after Korea's first female filmmaker) from the 10th International Women's Film's Festival in Seoul, and won Woman Filmmaker of the Year at the 9th Women in Film Korea Awards. \"Forever the Moment\" won Best Film at the 44th Baeksang Arts Awards and the 29th Blue Dragon Film Awards.\n\nIn 2009, Yim again collaborated with the NHRCK with her fourth feature \"Fly, Penguin\". The film is composed of four segments which tackle issues such as a mother's obsession with her son's English education, the ostracism at work of an office employee because he's a vegetarian and doesn't drink alcohol, the estrangement of a man from his family whom he financially supports overseas, and divorce between a couple in their sixties.\n\nHer fifth film \"Rolling Home with a Bull\" (2010) was adapted from Kim Do-yeon's novel about a failed poet who goes on a road trip across rural Korea with a recently widowed ex-girlfriend and his father's cow that he plans on selling. Yim said, \"Although the novel is based on a Buddhist pilgrimage, I thought it could be developed into an unconventional love story.\"\n\nIn 2011, Yim, an animal rights activist, produced the omnibus film \"Sorry, Thanks\" (also known as \"Thank You and I'm Sorry\"), in which four directors explored the relationship between humans and their pets. In Yim's short film \"Cat's Kiss\", a father is at odds with his daughter because of her propensity for collecting stray cats, until he finds himself growing to care for them.\n\nLater that year, she directed a Korean dubbed version of the 2002 Japanese film \"Oriume\", which depicts a family's struggle to cope with an elderly relative who is afflicted with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn 2012, Yim executive produced Lee Kwang-kuk's debut film \"Romance Joe\", and appeared in Heo Chul's documentary \"Ari Ari the Korean Cinema\".\n\nYim's next feature was \"South Bound\" (also known as \"Run to the South\") in 2013. Adapted from Okuda Hideo's novel, the protagonist is a man with an outspoken nature and disdain for mainstream society who decides to relocate his family to a remote island off the south coast of Korea. But their dream of a happy and sustainable life free from governmental authority is ruined when they clash with a powerful politician who has plans of developing their island into a holiday resort.\n\nThe film received criticism from some quarters that opined it was overly politicized with its anti-establishment and anti-capitalist tone as well as its parallels to the Jeju Naval Base, but Yim said she \"tried to deliver the story as joyfully as possible\" with a light-hearted approach despite its weighty themes of individual freedom, national duty, and familial separation. She said further, \"Our society is full of uncertainties and ferocious competition. \"The South\" here means an ideal land. Every one dreams of an ideal place, but only a few manage to fulfill their dream. The family in \"South Bound\" is willing to step ahead and achieve what they want by breaking away from social norms and traditions.\"\n\nIn 2014, Yim directed \"Whistle Blower\", based on the real-life events surrounding Hwang Woo-suk, then a biotechnology professor at Seoul National University who gained international renown in 2004 after claiming that he had successfully carried out experiments cloning human embryonic stem cells. After a whistleblower anonymously tipped off a local investigative journalism program, it was revealed that Hwang's research had been fabricated and unethical, in one of the biggest scientific frauds in recent history.\n\nIn her fictionalized version, Yim said that one of the challenges was portraying the scientist as multidimensional, but that her focus was on the image of a journalist who rightfully battles for the truth, despite political pressure and public condemnation.\n\nAfter a short hiatus, Yim directed \"Little Forest\", in 2018. It was adapted from a manga series of the same name by Daisuke Igarashi. It was first published in 2002. Little Forest is a story of a young woman who returns to her childhood home, in a traditional Korean village, after leaving for the big city in pursuit of what turned out to be an elusive dream. When she gets home, her mother isn't there - but her mother's \"Little Forest\", the many ways in which a single mother successfully made a home for her much loved child, unfurl with a long succession of lovingly sketched details involving mostly food preparation.The unfurling moments are lightly but lovingly shared with two childhood friends, one of whom also abandoned their elusive dream of success in the big city (Seoul) and the other who is still pursuing the small-town equivalent of that elusive dream -- without ever leaving home.\nIn an interview with View of Korean Cinema, Yim said that she wanted to make Little Forest because it deviated from the mainstream Korean cinema that was over-saturated with very violent and big-budgeted films. She said, “I wanted to make a small film, a film which can heal and soothe the young generation of Korea, who is currently going through hard times. \n\nYim Soon-rye is most known for making films that focus on South Korean society. Most notably, women empowerment and women in film. Yim, who is also an animal rights activist, has worked on films that focus on human relationships with animals. Yim creates films that have personal stories and narratives that deviate from the big-budget blockbusters of the Korean film industry. They are usually light-hearted and heart-warming. Yim tends to make films that are slower paced. She utilizes long dialogue takes, slow camera movement, slow cuts, and medium-close up shots. \n\nYim lives in a small town called Yangpyoung; a one-hour drive from central Seoul. She has been living there since 2005. She has one dog and wanted to give the dog a bigger space to run around. Yim is a nature lover and is more acquainted with the country-side lifestyle, despite working in the city. \n\n\n\n"}

It was active from 1841 to 1842. An old building of the customs house near Belgrade docks in the neighborhood of Savamala was adapted into a theater, as a first regular Belgrade theater house.\n\nThe Đumrukana building (from Turkish \"gümrük\"), was the very first administrative building built in the newly autonomous Principality of Serbia from the Ottoman Empire. It was a symbol of the liberated country.\n\nThe building was designed by modern Serbian building pioneer Nikola Živković (known as Hadži-Neimar), perhaps under the guide of Franz Janke, the first state engineer of the Principality of Serbia. It was built around 1835, and it was 52 m long, with large arches standing on Tuscan Doric columns. The main facade was of monumental composition with 11 arcades and ceiling with cruciform cove.\n\nĐumrukana was later the location of the first Belgrade's regular theatre in 1841, as prior to that only travelling acting troops existed. Main people behind theatre's establishment were comedy writer Jovan Sterija Popović and educator . They both were teachers at the Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia in Kragujevac, capital of Serbia at that time. They founded a theatre in Kragujevac 1840, but a year later, both capital and the Lyceum were transferred to Belgrade. Original idea for the new theatre was Nikolić's and Sterija joined him. They were backed by the prince Mihailo Obrenović who agreed to partially support the theatre financially thru state subsidy. He also ordered for the storage hall in Đumurkana, at the time one of the largest buildings in Belgrade, to be adapted to suite the theatre. The hall had 250 seats and was officially opened on the 4 December 1841 with the first performance being \"Death of Stefan Dečanski\" by Sterija. Performances were held regularly on Thursdays and Sundays. Until late August 1842, 55 plays, both Serbian and foreign, were performed. In September 1842 prince Mihailo Obrenović was dethroned and went into exile, and the theatre held no further productions. The building itself was damaged during the bombing of Belgrade in World War II and later destroyed.\n\n"}
