It shows seven women sitting on grass in a churchyard waiting for a ceremony to begin. The painting is composed from somber tones and the women have a serene calmness and a demeanour described as the embodiedness of \"simplicity and piety\". \n\nThe women are dressed in traditional Breton costume which in the late 19th century would have been reserved for such an event; various starched white headdresses and collars, worn over long plain dark dresses. They are huddled in conversation while two men stand to their left with heads bowed, looking coyly at the women. The men have round black hats and are similarly dressed in black with while collars.\nThis work is the culumation of a series of Breton paintings and follows directly from the similar 1886 \"The Pardon in Brittany\". It has a photorealistic look; Dagnan-Bouveret often used photographs as well as drawings and oil sketches when preparing for a finished canvas. There are many known photographic studies and drawings both for the Breton series in general, and this work in particular. One photograph shows a grassy area in which the artist had a friend pose, another a view of the church seen here in the background, complete with the festival flags protruding from the lower spire. \n\nThe vertical framing and almost uncomfortable proximity of the women add to its 'snapshot' aspect. From the photographs, the painting is known to have been posed at the Pardon de Rumengol, Finistère, Brittany.\n\"Breton Women at a Pardon\" was first exhibited at the Salon in 1889, where it drew acclaim and won the Grand Prise. It is often compared to Paul Gauguin's at the time controversial 1888 \"Vision After the Sermon\" and Émile Bernard's 1888 \"Breton Women in the Meadow\" (clearly inspired by Dagnan-Bouveret), as much for contrast in approach and in critical reaction, as for their thematic and compositional similarities. Gauguin and Bernard were seen as radicals at the time, and disdained at the Salon.\n\n"}

She won five Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for her ten seasons as the title character on the CBS sitcom \"Murphy Brown\" (1988–98, 2018–present). She is also known for her role as Shirley Schmidt on the ABC drama \"Boston Legal\" (2005–08). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for \"Starting Over\" (1979), and for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for \"Gandhi\" (1982).\n\nBergen began her career as a fashion model and appeared on the front cover of \"Vogue\" before she made her screen debut in the 1966 film \"The Group\". She went on to star in \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966), \"Soldier Blue\" (1970), \"Carnal Knowledge\" (1971), and \"The Wind and the Lion\" (1975). She made her Broadway debut in the 1984 play \"Hurlyburly\", and went on to star in the revivals of \"The Best Man\" (2012) and \"Love Letters\" (2014). From 2002 to 2004, she appeared in three episodes of the HBO series \"Sex and the City\". Her other film roles include \"Miss Congeniality\" (2000), \"Sweet Home Alabama\" (2002), \"The Women\" (2008), \"Bride Wars\" (2009), and \"Book Club\" (2018).\n\nBergen was born in Beverly Hills, California. Her mother, Frances Bergen (née Westerman), was a Powers model who was known professionally as Frances Westcott. Her father, Edgar Bergen, was a famous ventriloquist, comedian, and actor. Her paternal grandparents were Swedish-born immigrants who anglicized their surname, which was originally Berggren (\"mountain branch\").\n\nAs a child, Candice was irritated at being described as \"Charlie McCarthy's little sister\" (referring to her father's star dummy).\n\nShe began appearing on her father's radio program at a young age, and in 1958, at age 11, with her father on Groucho Marx's quiz show \"You Bet Your Life\", as Candy Bergen. She said that when she grew up, she wanted to design clothes.\n\nShe later attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she was elected both Homecoming Queen and Miss University, but, as Bergen later acknowledged, she failed to take her education seriously and after failing two courses in art and opera, she was asked to leave at the end of her sophomore year. She ultimately received an honorary doctorate from Penn in May 1992.\n\nShe worked as a fashion model before she took up acting, featured on the covers of \"Vogue\".\n\nIn 1966, Bergen made her screen debut playing a university student in \"The Group\", directed by Sidney Lumet, who knew Bergen's family. The film delicately touched on the subject of lesbianism.\n\nShe did it while studying college and elected not to return, instead playing the role of Shirley Eckert, an assistant school teacher in \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966) with Steve McQueen. The movie was nominated for several Academy Awards and was a big financial success. It was made for 20th Century Fox.\n\nShe guest starred on an episode of \"Coronet Blue\", whose director Sam Wanamaker recommended her for a part in \"The Day the Fish Came Out\" (1967) directed by Michael Cacoyannis, distributed by Fox but a huge flop. Fox signed her to a long-term contract.\n\nShe was announced for the role of Anne in \"The Valley of the Dolls\" but did not appear in the film.\n\nBergen went to France to appear in Claude Lelouch's \"Live for Life\" (1967) opposite Yves Montand, popular in France but not the US.\n\nIn 1968, she played the leading female role in \"The Magus\", a British mystery film for Fox starring Michael Caine and Anthony Quinn, that was almost universally ridiculed on its release and another flop.\n\nShe was featured in a 1970 political satire, \"The Adventurers\", based on a novel by Harold Robbins, playing a frustrated socialite. Her fee was $200,000. Reviews were terrible but the film made money. Bergen called it a \"movie out of the 1940s.\"\n\nBergen played the girlfriend of Elliott Gould in \"Getting Straight\" (1970), a counter-culture movie which was commercially popular. She said it took her career in \"a new direction... my first experience with democratic, communal movie making.\"\n\nShe also starred in the controversial Western \"Soldier Blue\" (1970), a worldwide hit but a failure in its homeland, perhaps because of its unflattering portrayal of the U.S. Cavalry. The film's European success led to Bergen's being voted by British exhibitors as the seventh-most popular star at the British box office in 1971.\n\nBergen received some strong reviews for her support role in \"Carnal Knowledge\" (1971), directed by Mike Nichols. Bergen did a Western with Oliver Reed, \"The Hunting Party\" (1971), then had the lead role in a drama \"T.R. Baskin\" (1971). She described the latter as the first role \"that is really sort of a vehicle, where I have to act and not just be a sort of decoration\" saying she'd decided \"it was time for me to ge serious about acting.\"\n\nBergen was absent from screens for a number of years. She returned with a support part in a British heist film, \"11 Harrowhouse\" (1974), then did a Western with Gene Hackman and James Coburn, \"Bite the Bullet\" (1975).\n\nIn 1975, she replaced Faye Dunaway at the last minute to co-star with Sean Connery in \"The Wind and the Lion\", as a strong-willed American widow kidnapped in the Moroccan desert.\n\nBergen was reunited with Hackman in \"The Domino Killings\" (1977) for Stanley Kramer and hosted \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nShe did \"A Night Full of Rain\" (1978) for Lina Wertmüller and was the love interest of Ryan O'Neal in the \"Love Story\" sequel, \"Oliver's Story\" (1978). She had taken photographs for many years and around this time starting exhibiting them in galleries.\n\nBergen's father died in 1979. She later said:\nHis death left a space for me [...] I was able much more to live according to my own expectations. I always felt my fame was ill-gotten, sort of borrowed from his, and that perhaps I tried to keep some kind of rein on it. Even when he was in retirement I felt I was poaching on his territory. He'd joke and say he was 'the father of Candice Bergen,' and that was only partially a joke. It was very hard on him.\nBergen appeared in the Burt Reynolds romantic comedy \"Starting Over\" (1979), for which she received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for best supporting actress.\n\nShe portrayed a best-selling author in \"Rich and Famous\" (1981) with Jacqueline Bisset.\n\nIn 1982, Bergen appeared in the Oscar-winning film \"Gandhi\" in which she portrayed documentary photographer Margaret Bourke-White. Bergen was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.\n\nIn 1984 she joined the Broadway cast of \"Hurlyburly\".\n\nOn television, Bergen appeared as Morgan Le Fay in \"Arthur the King\" (1985) and in the miniseries \"Hollywood Wives\" (1985). She was Burt Reynolds' romantic interest in \"Stick\" (1985), and for TV appeared in \"\" (1985) and \"Mayflower Madam\" (1987).\n\nIn addition to acting, Bergen has written articles, a play, and a memoir, \"Knock Wood\" (1984). She has also studied photography and worked as a photojournalist.\n\nIn 1988, she took the lead role in the sitcom \"Murphy Brown\", in which she played a tough television reporter. The series provided her with the opportunity to show her little-seen comic talent, and although primarily a conventional sit-com, the show did tackle important issues. Murphy Brown, a recovering alcoholic, became a single mother and later battled breast cancer. In 1992, Vice President Dan Quayle criticized prime-time TV for showing the Murphy Brown character \"mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice.\"\n\nQuayle's disparaging remarks were subsequently written into the show, with Murphy shown watching Quayle's speech in disbelief at his insensitivity and ignorance of the reality of the lives of single mothers. A subsequent episode explored the subject of family values within a diverse set of families. The Brown character arranges for a truckload of potatoes to be dumped in front of Quayle's residence, an allusion to an infamous incident in which Quayle erroneously directed a school child to spell the word \"potato\" as \"potatoe\". In reality, Bergen agreed with at least some of Quayle's observations, saying that while the particular remark was \"an arrogant and uninformed posture\", as a whole, it was \"a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did.\" Bergen's run on \"Murphy Brown\" was extremely successful. The show ran for ten seasons and between 1989 and 1998, Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times and won five. After her fifth win, she declined future nominations for the role.\n\nThroughout the same time frame as \"Murphy Brown\", Bergen also appeared as the main spokesperson for a Sprint telephone ad campaign.\n\nShe produced and starred in the TV movie \"Mary & Tim\" (1996).\n\nAfter playing the role of Murphy Brown, Bergen was offered a chance to work as a real-life journalist. After the run of \"Murphy Brown\" ended in 1998, CBS approached her to cover stories for \"60 Minutes\", an offer she declined, with the conviction that she didn't personally want to blur the lines between actor and journalist.\n\nAfter \"Murphy Brown\", Bergen hosted \"Exhale with Candice Bergen\" on the Oxygen network.\n\nShe also appeared in character roles in films, including \"Miss Congeniality\" (2000), where she played villainous pageant host Kathy Morningside; she also portrayed the mayor of New York in \"Sweet Home Alabama\" (2002) and appeared in the Gwyneth Paltrow flight-attendant comedy, \"View from the Top\" (2003).\n\nShe had roles in \"The In-Laws\" (2003), \"Footsteps\" (2003), a thriller, and a semi recurring role on \"Sex and the City\", where she played Enid Frick, Carrie Bradshaw's editor at \"Vogue\".\n\nIn January 2005, Bergen joined the cast of the television series \"Boston Legal\" as Shirley Schmidt, a founding partner in the law firm of Crane, Poole & Schmidt. She played the role for five seasons. In 2006 and 2008, she received Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nA frequent host on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\", she was the first woman to host the show and the first host to do a second show. She was also the first woman to join the Five-Timers Club, when she hosted for the fifth time in 1990. Bergen guest-starred on \"The Muppet Show\" in its first year, appearing in several skits, an episode now available in a DVD collection. She was also featured in a long-running \"Dime Lady\" ad campaign for the Sprint phone company.\n\nShe has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including \"Seinfeld\" (as herself playing Murphy Brown), \"Law & Order\", \"Family Guy\", and \"Will & Grace\" (playing herself).\n\nBergan could be seen in \"The Women\" (2008) and \"Bride Wars\" (2009) as Marion St. Claire, New York's most sought-after wedding planner, who also serves as the narrator of the story.\n\nFrom its launch in 2008, Candice Bergen was a contributor for wowOwow.com, a website for women to talk culture, politics and gossip. The website closed in 2010.\n\nShe was in \"The Romantics\" (2010) and had an occasional role on \"House\" as Lisa Cuddy's mother, starting in Season 7, including the 2011 episodes \"Larger Than Life\" and \"Family Practice\".\n\nIn 2010, she appeared in a one-night only concert semi staged reading of \"Evening Primrose\" by Stephen Sondheim. She has also appeared on Broadway in the 2012 revival of Gore Vidal's \"The Best Man\" and the 2014 revival of \"Love Letters\".\n\nLater performances included \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas\" (2014), \"Beautiful & Twisted\" (2015), \"Rules Don't Apply\" (2016),\"The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)\" (2017), \"Home Again\" (2017) and \"Book Club\" (2018).\n\nOn January 24, 2018, it was announced that Candice Bergen would be reprising her role as Murphy Brown for a series revival to be aired on CBS in the 2018-2019 season.\n\nIn 2016, Bergen began hand-painting, with paint pens, on handbags, with the business overseen by Chloe Malle, and the proceeds benefiting charity.\n\nA political activist, Bergen accepted a date with Henry Kissinger. During her activist days she participated in a Yippie prank when she, Abbie Hoffman, and others threw dollar bills onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 1967, leading to its temporary shutdown. In 1972, she served as a fundraiser and organizer for George McGovern's presidential campaign.\n\nBergen and former boyfriend Terry Melcher lived at 10050 Cielo Drive in Los Angeles, which was later occupied by Sharon Tate and her husband, Roman Polanski. Tate and four others were murdered in the home in August 9, 1969, by followers of Charles Manson. There was some initial speculation that Melcher may have been the intended victim, although Melcher, his former roommate Mark Lindsay, and Vincent Bugliosi have all indicated Manson was aware that Melcher was no longer living at that address at the time of the murders.\n\nOn September 27, 1980, she married French film director Louis Malle. They had one child, a daughter named Chloé Françoise, in 1985. The couple was married until Malle's death from cancer on Thanksgiving Day in 1995. Bergen has traveled extensively and speaks French fluently. She has been married to New York real estate magnate and philanthropist Marshall Rose since 2000.\n\n"}

It stars Mohanlal, Karthika, Shari and Urvashi in pivotal roles. The film tells the story of two school girls who eloped while on a school trip. It was critically well acclaimed, being one of the first Indian films that talked about womance.\n\nTwo young girls from a boarding school decide to elope while on a school picnic. They believe as troublemakers they are not wanted in the school or at home. They see the world's resentment personified in a mean teacher who is in charge of this particular picnic.\n\nThey manage to elope and find a convent to stay for the immediate night and a youth hostel soon after under the disguise that they are traveling college students. Meanwhile the teacher loses her job. \n\nAs they piece together a living doing odd jobs for the time being, they are befriended by a stranger towards whom one of them begins to develop love. The other initially tries to protect her friend but soon accedes, not wanting to be a hindrance to her friend's choice.\n\nAfter a while the former who is in love with this stranger tells him the truth about her situation. This is in return for him telling her the same. The stranger is a suspended bank manager. He lost his job because someone pretending to be the wife of a dead man tricked him into giving her the dead man's money in the bank. However, since his suspension he has been anonymously receiving a fixed sum every month through post. \n\nAs the girl shows him her photo album he realises that this swindler was the disciplinarian school teacher these girls hate.

Johnson III with co-founders David S. Johnson and Roderic R. Richardson.\n\nOriginally conceived as a digital effects and coding atelier and center for youth education, Eyebeam has become a center for the research, development, and curation of new media works of art and open source technology. Eyebeam annually hosts up to 20 residents and co-produces youth educational programs, exhibitions, performances, symposia, workshops, hackathons and other events with these residents as well as with partner organizations. Projects developed at Eyebeam have received awards and recognition including Webby Awards, Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Prix Ars Electronica.\n\nEyebeam, originally called Eyebeam Atelier, was first conceived as a collaboration between David S. Johnson, a digital artist, and John S. Johnson III, a filmmaker and philanthropist. The two were introduced by Roderic R. Richardson, a mutual friend who recognized their shared interests and helped establish the new venture in its early stages. The inspiration to name the project Eyebeam Atelier came partly from the sculpture atelier of John Johnson's father, John Seward Johnson II and the Experiments in Art and Technology collective. After observing new media as a growing genre, the co-founders were motivated to create a similar studio. They recognized a need to provide artists and digital film artists access to new technology and a shared workspace.\n\nIn addition to offering resources for new media artists, Johnson saw a need to provide middle and high school students with educational and artistic opportunities. Digital Day Camp, the first youth program which catered to new media education, was founded in 1998; in the pilot program, New York-based high school students learned web development and design. Future sessions included project-based learning around themes of bioart, urban interventionism, game design, and wearable technology.\n\nEyebeam’s first forum, “Interaction,” took place online in the summer of 1998 and was curated by UCSD professor Jordan Crandall. The forum, an email list called <eyebeam><blast>, was hosted by Brian Holmes, Olu Oguibe, and Gregory Ulmer, and included Lev Manovich, N. Katherine Hayles, Saskia Sassen, Matthew Slotover, Ken Goldberg, Geert Lovink, Knowbotic Research, Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, Mark Tribe, and Critical Art Ensemble among the participating artists, educators, new media and internet theorists, and technologists (cite). The discussions spurred by <eyebeam><blast> were compiled into a book titled “Interaction: Artistic Practice on the Network” and published in 2001.\n\nIn addition to funding artistic research, Johnson hoped to develop Eyebeam as a space that would also function as a museum devoted to new media works. In 2000, Eyebeam announced an international architectural competition to construct a space devoted to the dialog between art and technology, with the design firm Diller + Scofidio’s “Olympic class” design named the winner of the competition.\n\nEyebeam held its first open studios for artists in residence and fellows in 2002. Alexander R. Galloway, G. H. Hovagimyan, Tony Martin, Yael Kanarek, MTAA, John Klima, Jem Cohen, Cory Arcangel, and Michael Bell-Smith were among the inaugural exhibitors. Among the projects on display was Galloway’s Carnivore, a Processing library that allowed for the creative misuse of data surveillance created in tandem with other members of Radical Software Group. Carnivore takes its name and function from DCS1000, a surveillance system used by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigations. Carnivore was awarded the Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica the same year.\n\nResidents Yury Gitman and Carlos Gomez de Llarena's Noderunner, a scavenger hunt based on wifi sharing, received the 2003 Prix Ars Electronica Golden Nica. Fundrace.org, a site which allows visitors to track campaign contributions through geocoding, was developed by Jonah Peretti, then-director of Research and Development at Eyebeam, and later adapted into a permanent feature on the Huffington Post. Peretti, together with Alexander Galloway, collaborated on ReBlog, one of the first blogging platform which allows users to filter and publish content from many RSS feeds. Beginning in 2005, the Eyebeam ReBlog began to feature the Eyebeam Journal, a series of in-depth writings and interviews with resident artists, research fellows, and guest contributors. During their R&D Fellowships, Theo Watson and Zachary Lieberman continued to develop openFrameworks, a C/C++ library originally created at Parsons. Together with Processing, openFrameworks became one of the most popular platforms for creative coding.\n\nThe Eyebeam OpenLab served as the birthplace of the Graffiti Research Lab. Founded by James Powderly and Evan Roth during their OpenLab fellowships in 2005, the GRL was envisioned as a nonprofit design studio for creating experimental technologies with street art applications. While at Eyebeam, Powderly and Roth developed a method for creating graffiti messages in individual LED lights and a system for projecting shapes drawn with a handheld laser in real time. Powderly and Roth later founded the F.A.T. (Free Art and Technology) Lab, a collective dedicated to the merging of open source technology and popular culture, with Theo Watson, Chris Sugrue, and others.\n\nEyebeam expanded its programmatic lineup of exhibitions and workshops with MIXER, a series dedicated to showcasing leading performance artists in the field of live video and audio, in late 2007. The inaugural event, “Brother Islands (Places to Lose People),” was focused around an immersive experimental documentary of North Brother Island and Wards Island by media artist Benton C Bainbridge. MIXER events were organized around themes as disparate as the World's Fair, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and New York City’s underground and featured interactive installations alongside performances by musicians and performance artists including DāM-FunK, Extreme Animals, CHERYL, and D-Fuse AV. That same year, fellows and resident artists began organizing mobile workshops and talks. \nIn 2011, several Eyebeam residents, fellows, and alumni participated in \"Talk to Me: Design and the Communication between People and Objects\" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

It was directed by Angelina Maccarone and stars Jasmin Tabatabai, Anneke Kim Sarnau, and Navíd Akhavan. Its English title is Unveiled.\n\nWriters Maccarone and Judith Kaufmann conceived the idea for the film in 1998. In 2002, Maccarone sent a copy of the script to actress Tabatabai, who reviewed it. As an Iranian, Tabatabai worked with Maccarone and Kaufmann to rewrite the story to be more realistic. For example, the main character became \"more subtle, not as outspoken.\"\n\nThe translator Fariba Tabrizi (29, played by Jasmin Tabatabai) is living under the threat of the death penalty in her own country Iran after being revealed, by the vice squad, to be homosexual. With some support from a relative, Fariba is able to flee from her home country to Germany. When she is in the refugee detention centre at Frankfurt Airport her application for asylum is turned down. She lives hour by hour with the thought in mind that she may be deported. Her desperate prospects are dramatically improved by the suicide of a fellow-inmate also from Iran she assumes his identity and, as Siamak Mustafai, and using his temporary permit of sojourn, is re-located to the provinces of Swabia.\n\nFariba knows Germany only from literature and from her work as a translator which leave her in no way prepared for the likes of Sielmingen. The contrast to a metropolis such as Teheran could scarcely be greater. At first glance her survival seems to be assured. However, in the refugee home she is obliged to uphold her male disguise in cramped quarters and she is not permitted to leave the Regional District of Esslingen. A single word wrong, any attempt at contact is allied for her with the danger of her cover being blown.\n\nThe only way to escape from this predicament is by means of forged documents. To do this she is in urgent need of money. With a little help from her roommate Gasmut she comes into contact with Lächle (30), the local godfather. He is instrumental in procuring an illegal, seasonal job for her in a sauerkraut processing factory right in the middle of a complex hick town coterie. Anne (26) is manoeuvred by her workmates into taking on a bet. She will get a bike for her son if she can manage to get a date with the refugee chap. Uwe (29) finds it totally out of order that Anne is so solicitous about Siamak's well-being. His worries are not entirely unfounded, since Anne derives some kind of pleasure from the strange foreigner.\n\nUnder any other circumstances Fariba would have been only too glad to respond to Anne's advances, however she is afraid on account of the whole business of the Siamak facade. With great stubbornness Anne drags Siamak along to the boozy leisure activities of her little hick town clique. In the process they become dangerously close and Anne begins to get wind of Fariba's true identity.\n\nWhen Siamak's permit of sojourn runs out Fariba gets into arrears with the instalments for her documents. It becomes clear to her that she will never manage things on her own. She risks everything and takes Anne into her confidence. She wants at long last to be able to live as a woman again, to live out her profession, to enjoy big cities. To break away from the provinces would also be the fulfilment of a dream for Anne. She does not disappoint Fariba. Together they successfully go in for car theft. Fariba gets her new passport. The world is their oyster.\n\nJust as Fariba is changing out of her Siamak disguise Uwe and the clique turn up in Anne's flat. Uwe demands an explanation. The row escalates. The noisy dispute leads to Fariba's downfall. During the routine check on account of disturbance of the falsified passport falls into the hands of the police. The system which she believed she had outwitted takes its relentless grip. Fariba knows: this is the end, her hopes are shattered. Anne has to watch on helplessly as Fariba is put under arrest.\n\nThe term \"in orbit\" is officially used by the UN to refer to asylum-seekers who find themselves orbiting around planet Earth because they can actually find legal domicile nowhere at all.\n\nThe original German title translates as \"stranger's skin.\" Maccarone said,\n\nThe English title, \"Unveiled\", was conceived by the U.S. distributor of the film.\n\n\nIn 2006, Jasmin Tabatabai was nominated for the German Film Award as Best Actress.\n\n\n\n"}

The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi directly support the Uffizi Gallery by helping build awareness of the museum and its cultural heritage and by raising funds for acquisitions, preservation, restorations, temporary exhibitions, and educational programming.\n\nIn 1993 a terrorist bomb severely damaged the Uffizi Gallery and some of the artworks. In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions.\n\nIn 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States “sister” organization to the Amici degli Uffizi. Granted 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, its sole purpose is to support the activities of the Amici by helping to fund ongoing restoration projects and to bring these projects to fruition.\n\nLed by Executive Board President Contessa Maria Vittoria Colonna Rimbotti, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery in conjunction with the Amici degli Uffizi raises funds to support all of these activities through an international group of members and patrons. More than 30 restoration projects designated as priorities by the museum have been completed over the last several years and include renowned paintings, altarpieces, sculptures and tapestries.\n\nThe mission of both organizations is to support the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy, by raising awareness of the museum and its collections and by providing resources for acquisition, preservation, restoration and education.\nThe mission of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery is to support the Amici degli Uffizi in raising funds and resources for the acquisition, restoration, preservation and maintenance of the Uffizi Gallery's cultural heritage as prioritized by its Director, Antonio Natali.\n\nCreated by Sergio Bianco, the symbol represents the view of the Uffizi from the Arno arcade. The sky seen under the archway forms the shape of a horse head in the typical posture of the knight chess piece. Representing loyalty and the right cause, the horse symbolizes the commitment of the Associations Amici degli Uffizi and Friends of the Uffizi Gallery to the benefit of the Uffizi Gallery.\n\nEvery two years, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery organize the Florentine Weekend, which includes art-focused activities at the Uffizi Gallery and in nearby locations throughout the City of Florence that relate to both Renaissance art and Italian culture. It is a members-only event open to Friends of the Uffizi Gallery members at the Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo membership levels.\n\nMore than thirty restorations designated as a priority by the Uffizi Gallery have been completed with funds raised by both Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and Amici degli Uffizi.\n\nThe Michelangelo Room, which opened to the public on January 29, 2013, is an example of a completed project by this organization. The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re-installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. \nThe re-installation included Michelangelo’s \"Tondo Doni\" (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame. \nOther early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include Francesco Granacci, Fra Bartolomeo (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), Andrea del Sarto, Franciabigio, Giuliano Bugiardini, and Alonso Berruguete.\n\nLaocoön by Baccio Bandinelli (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by Poseidon. A previous restoration was done when the sculpture was broken into more than 40 pieces by a fire that caused a partial roof collapse at the Uffizi on August 12, 1762. The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture’s surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.\n\nThese two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.\n\nThe restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of Asclepius, the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure’s left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family.\n\nThis mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of Aphrodite & Eros is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture’s head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.\n\nWith this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art.\n\nThe 2014 project is a statue of Aphrodite (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as Venus to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head. The arms aned richly-draped lower part were added by Alessandro Algardi, an artist hired by the Medici in the 17th Century to integrate the fragments into a single sculpture. This restoration project involved removing thick layers of accumulated dust and greatly increased documentary information.\n"}
{"id": "1973221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973221", "title": "Functional design", "text": "Functional design\n\nFunctional Design is a paradigm used to simplify the design of hardware and software devices such as computer software and increasingly, 3D models. A functional design assures that each modular part of a device has only one responsibility and performs that responsibility with the minimum of side effects on other parts. Functionally designed modules tend to have low coupling.\n\nThe advantage for implementation is that if a software module has a single purpose, it will be simpler, and therefore easier and less expensive, to design and implement.\n\nSystems with functionally designed parts are easier to modify because each part does only what it claims to do.\n\nSince maintenance is more than 3/4 of a successful system's life, this feature is a crucial advantage. It also makes the system easier to understand and document, which simplifies training. The result is that the practical lifetime of a functional system is longer.\n\nIn a system of programs, a functional module will be easier to reuse because it is less likely to have side effects that appear in other parts of the system.\n\nThe standard way to assure functional design is to review the description of a module. If the description includes conjunctions such as \"and\" or \"or\", then the design has more than one responsibility, and is therefore likely to have side effects. The responsibilities need to be divided into several modules in order to achieve a functional design.\n\nEvery computer system has parts that cannot be functionally pure because they exist to distribute CPU cycles or other resources to different modules. For example, most systems have an \"initialization\" section that starts up the modules. Other well-known examples are the interrupt vector table and the main loop.\n\nSome functions inherently have mixed semantics. For example, a function \"move the car from the garage\" inherently has a side effect of changing the \"car position\". In some cases, the mixed semantics can extend over a large topological tree or graph of related concepts. In these unusual cases, functional design is not recommended by some authorities. Instead polymorphism, inheritance, or procedural methods may be preferred.\n\nRecently several software companies have introduced functional design as a concept to describe a Parametric feature based modeler for 3D modeling and simulation. In this context, they mean a parametric model of an object where the parameters are tied to real-world design criteria, such as an axle that will adjust its diameter based on the strength of the material and the amount of force being applied to it in the simulation. It is hoped that this will create efficiencies in the design process for mechanical and perhaps even architectural/structural assemblies by integrating the results of finite element analysis directly to the behavior of individual objects.\n\n"}

{"id": "22132133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22132133", "title": "Gaiety Theatre, Ayr", "text": "Gaiety Theatre, Ayr\n\nThe Gaiety Theatre is a category B listed performing arts venue in Ayr, Scotland. It is noted for its interior rococo features, its atmosphere and its acoustics.\n\nThe Ayr Gaiety was built in 1902, reconstructed after a fire in 1904, its façade remodeled in 1935, and further reinstated after a fire in 1955. In 1995, an annex was constructed, including a new café, box office, dressing rooms and studio space.\nAfter a faltering start, which saw several years as a cinema after World War I, the theatre was bought by Ben Popplewell, from Bradford who already had a track record of success running the Pavilion theatre on Ayr seafront. For fifty years the Popplewell family ran the theatre – latterly as part of the Glasgow Pavilion business. During this time the Gaiety developed a reputation as a variety theatre with a ‘summer’ variety show – the Gaiety Whirl – which ran for 26 weeks at its height. Many Scottish and UK stars appeared regularly on its stage, and several started their careers there. The programme offered more than a summer show however, with several weeks of Shakespeare and regular transfers from Glasgow Citizens theatre, being part of a varied offer. \nAfter seventy years in private ownership the local Council acquired the Gaiety theatre freehold in 1974. It then operated as a municipal theatre under direct local authority management. The programming had much in common with the Popplewell years, with the Gaiety Whirl still a feature and the, by now, popular panto at the core of the programme. But the scope of performances developed and, while the family oriented theme continued, a wider range of presentations developed, including controversial shows such as Borderline Theatres production of Dario Fo’s Mistero Buffo and a touring version of Oh Calcutta! After many years of successful operation the theatre began to lose audiences and the Council felt the revenue subsidy it provided and the requirement for capital investment required a new approach. In January 2009 the theatre closed, leaving Ayr without a theatre – as the Civic Theatre, which had mainly presented drama, had been closed and demolished a little earlier due to asbestos contamination problems.\n\nThe closure met with considerable opposition and dismay among many Ayr residents, particularly since it appeared that the required capital and revenue investment to reopen the theatre would not be available. A public meeting attracted over 400 attendees, the future of the theatre was a key issue in the local press, many Scottish performers expressed their dismay and there was extensive discussion on social media.\n\nIn early 2009 South Ayrshire Council invited tenders to take on the theatre management. Ayr Gaiety Partnership (AGP), a charity formed by local residents for the purpose in Summer 2009, secured preferred bidder status. Just over three years later, having secured financial backing from the Council and Scottish Government, as well as from local fundraising, AGP took on a 99-year lease of the theatre with a vision to do much more than simply re-open the building. Ayr Gaiety Partnerships vision is 'to re-energise the performing arts in South Ayrshire, with the Gaiety Theatre as the hub of a network of venues that will stimulate the cultural life and economic prosperity of the area ensuring that Ayr will once again be a key destination for all those interested in the performing arts.'\n\nFrom the start the organisation set ambitious social, economic and cultural goals. But the first priority was to re-open with a successful panto. On 11 December 2012, after many last minute challenges, the Gaiety re-opened for what turned out to be a sell-out run of over 40 performances of the panto Cinderella.\n\nThe Ayr Gaiety Partnership is a charitable body formed by local community figures, with membership open to local residents. The directors at present are: Ian Welsh, David Quayle, Chris Fremantle, Graham Peterkin, and Professor Gayle McPherson.\n\nMembership is open to local residents and others with an interest in the theatre. Ayr Gaiety Partnership's first General Meeting is set to take place on 13 October 2014.\n\nThe new Ayr Gaiety is unlike most theatres in the UK because it is largely run through voluntary effort. Most of the people undertaking front of house, technical, fundraising, marketing and maintenance are doing so on a voluntary basis. Although the volunteering effort overall is led by the Executive Director and Board- each volunteer team is supported and led by one of the staff team members.\n\nThe Gaiety's current full-time staff team consists of just nine employees led by Executive Director Jeremy Wyatt.\n\nThe School of Media, Culture & Society at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) and the Gaiety Theatre officially launched Scotland’s first Learning Theatre on Friday 19 September 2014. The launch event, which saw representatives from UWS, the Gaiety, as well as the National Theatre of Scotland in attendance, marks the first stage in the development of the partnership Learning Theatre, which will provide a centre for education, training and research in the area of performance and theatre craft.\n\nUWS enjoys close links with the Gaiety and the University’s new BA Technical Theatre degree, delivered in conjunction with the Theatre, had its first intake in September. The course, the only one of its kind in the country, offers thorough vocational training for those looking to work in stage management and theatre production. Students will gain professional knowledge of the industry and will be prepared for a variety of employment opportunities from small-scale theatres to large multi-media events, venues and festivals. The course is aimed at those with a range of theatre, performance, production and related HND qualifications to enable them to build to a degree award in Technical Theatre. Students from the University's undergraduate Performance programme also make regular use of the theatre's facilities.\n\n"}

The Studio also has two exhibition spaces hosting an exhibitions programme. It also runs a learning programme focused on teaching and developing understanding of fine art printmaking.\n\nAs well as providing subsidised printmaking facilities to artists, the Studio also supports its artist members by promoting and selling their art work in the gallery, on its web site and at international art fairs.\n\nThe Studio also has a print publishing programme, where an artist is invited to the studio to work with a master printmaker to make an edition of original prints. It has worked with a range of Scottish and international artists, including Elizabeth Blackadder, John Byrne, Peter Howson, Christine Borland, Alasdair Gray. These publications can be seen in the gallery and on the Studio's web site. \n\nHistory: \n\nIn 1972 a group of graduates from Glasgow School of Art set up Glasgow Print Studio in a flat in Finnieston. Finding nowhere that they could continue printmaking after graduation, they were supported by the Glasgow School of Art's Head of Printmaking, Philip Reeves, to establish their own workshop.\n\nAs membership of the organisation increased, the 1976 move to Ingram Street in the city centre provided a larger workshop plus a gallery. Here, artists had a space to sell their work and the programme ranged from contemporary print to the popular Scottish Cartoonists exhibition and a retrospective by LS Lowry. At Ingram Street, the Print Studio was at the centre of a social and artistic whirl. Bands played and plays were performed in the gallery, while the Print Studio Press published books by Scottish writers including Liz Lochead and Alasdair Gray. The Studio also organised an annual Midsummer Ball, which became a key event in Glasgow’s social calendar.\n\nFruitful relationships have developed with established artists such as Elizabeth Blackadder, Adrian Wiszniewski, Scott Myles, Jim Lambie, Claire Barclay, Ciara Philips and John Byrne, who work collaboratively with the Studio’s master printers. The Studio offers both traditional and digital printing facilities and uses its expertise to work with contemporary galleries like The Modern Institute. Over forty years after its establishment, Glasgow Print Studio continues to play a vital role in encouraging and supporting a vibrant artistic community.\n\nUnique to Scotland’s cultural landscape and central to the development of Glasgow’s Merchant City as the city's vibrant cultural quarter, the studio's workshop, galleries, archive, education space and other facilities now span three floors of Glasgow’s centre for art and creativity, Trongate 103. \n\n"}

He collaborated with Henry Irving, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Herbert Beerbohm Tree, producing stage sets of unprecedented realism. Craven's career lasted from 1853 to 1905, spanning the end of the era of gas lighting in theatres and the beginning of electrical lighting; he developed new techniques to co-ordinate the appearance of theatre settings during the transition from gas to electricity. He was regarded as the finest scene-painter of his day and was the last major scenic designer in the ultra-realistic tradition.\n\nCraven was born in Leeds, the son of theatrical parents. His father, James Green (d. 1881), was a comedian and pantomimist, who had previously been an innkeeper. His mother, Elizabeth, \"née\" Craven (1802 or 1803–1866), was an actress, who left the stage, and published several volumes of prose and verse. He performed with his father as a youth, shortening his name to Hawes Craven. However, his aptitude for painting led him to apply for a place at the Government School of Design at Marlborough House, London. He studied there from 1851 to 1853, winning many prizes. On leaving, he was a taken on as an apprentice by John Gray, scene-painter of the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton, London. When Gray moved to the Olympic Theatre, Craven moved with him. In 1857 he had his first success, when Gray was ill and Craven did the work on a set depicting the Eddystone lighthouse for Wilkie Collins's \"The Lighthouse\". He worked from a painting by a well-known seascape artist, Clarkson Stanfield, with such fidelity that Stanfield presented him with the original painting.\n\nIn the late 1850s and early 1860s, Craven worked at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on pantomimes, and at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on operas. His first post as chief scene-painter was at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, from 1862 to 1864. In London, during the rest of the 1860s, Craven was an assistant at the Lyceum, Olympic and Adelphi theatres. In June 1866 he married a dancer, Mary Elizabeth Watson Tees (1838–1891). There were three sons and three daughters of the marriage.\n\nIn 1871 Craven became principal scene-painter at the Lyceum Theatre, a role he held for the next thirty years, first as an employee and later as a freelance artist. At first he worked under the management of H. L. Bateman, and then Bateman's widow. Despite early success with his scenery for the melodrama \"The Bells\", in which Henry Irving made his name, Craven's opportunities were restricted until Irving became lessee and manager of the Lyceum in 1878. Craven, with Irving's support, carried scenic realism and stage illusion to new levels. \n\nFor some productions, Irving commissioned designs from well-known painters, which Craven would then re-create as scenery. These artists included Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. For other productions, Craven created the original designs as well as executing them. For his scenes in Irving's 1888 production of \"Faust\", he visited Nuremberg and the Harz mountains \"with admirable results.\" Irving became well known for his Shakespeare productions, for which Craven painted strongly naturalistic scenery, which won critical applause and occasionally threatened to outshine the performers. His productions included \"Hamlet\" (1874 and 1878), \"The Merchant of Venice\" (1879), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1882), \"Macbeth\" (1888), \"King Henry VIII\" (1892), \"King Lear\" (1892), \"Cymbeline\" (1895), and \"Coriolanus\" (1902). By the mid-1880s, Craven was recognised as among the élite of his art. The theatrical newspaper \"The Era\" wrote, \"In the art of scene painting England stands paramount. Neither Paris, not Germany, nor New York can commence to approach, let alone rival, the work of the men who furnish London with its stage scenery. Such men as … Hawes Craven … are artists in the truest and best sense of the word.\"\nFor Richard D'Oyly Carte, Craven painted the scenery for seven of the Savoy operas. Carte's new theatre, the Savoy, built in 1881, was lit by electricity, unlike the Lyceum, which remained gas-lit for some years. Craven adjusted his techniques to match the stronger light produced by electric bulbs. For the Savoy, Craven painted scenery for \"Princess Ida\" (1884), \"The Mikado\" (1885), \"Ruddigore\" (1887), a revival of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" (1887), \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" (1888), \"The Gondoliers\" (1890) and \"Utopia, Limited\" (1893). Settings for these works ranged from a mediaeval Hungarian castle to a Japanese garden, the interior of a picture gallery, a Royal Naval ship modelled on H.M.S. Victory, the Tower of London, the Piazzetta in Venice, and a South Sea island. Also for Carte, Craven designed and painted scenery for Arthur Sullivan's grand opera, \"Ivanhoe\", at the Royal English Opera House in 1891.\n\nThe pinnacle of theatrical realism was reached, with Craven's help, by Herbert Beerbohm Tree at Her Majesty's Theatre. Craven painted sets for stagings that famously included live rabbits running about in the forest scenes of \"As You Like It\". Craven's last substantial work was the scenery for Arthur Bourchier's revival of \"The Merchant of Venice\" at the Garrick Theatre in October 1905. In the same year he was elected president of the Scenic Artists' Association. Craven was the last great practitioner of stage realism. In its obituary notice, \"The Manchester Guardian\" wrote, \"The most gifted scene-painters of the coming generation will probably try to suggest more and state less, to give symbols rather than imitations of nature.\"\n\nCraven died of bronchitis at his home in south London on 22 July 1910, at the age of 73. Obituary tributes in the newspapers declared him to have been \"the greatest of English scene-painters, and perhaps the finest scene-painter who has ever lived\" (\"The Manchester Guardian\"), whose \"scenes were real pictures, with the atmosphere and charm of fine paintings\" (\"The Standard\").\n\n"}

{"id": "22771067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22771067", "title": "Jewish views on sin", "text": "Jewish views on sin\n\nJudaism regards the violation of any of the 613 commandments as a sin. Judaism teaches that to sin is a part of life, since there is no perfect man and everyone has an inclination to do evil \"from his youth\". Sin has many classifications and degrees. Some sins are punishable with death by the court, others with death by heaven, others with lashes, and others without such punishment, but no sins committed with willful intentions go without consequence. Sins committed out of lack of knowledge are not considered sins, since a sin can't be a sin if the one who did it didn't know it was wrong. Unintentional sins are considered less severe sins.\n\nSins between people are considered much more severe in Judaism than sins between man and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repentance in Judaism, can atone for sins between man and God, but not for sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend. Eleazar ben Azariah derived [this from the verse]: \"From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed\" (Book of Leviticus, 16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.\n\nWhen the Temple yet stood in Jerusalem, people would offer Karbanot (sacrifices) for their misdeeds. The atoning aspect of \"karbanot\" is carefully circumscribed. For the most part, \"karbanot\" only expiate unintentional sins, that is, sins committed because a person forgot that this thing was a sin or by error. No atonement is needed for violations committed under duress or through lack of knowledge, and for the most part, \"karbanot\" cannot atone for a malicious, deliberate sin. In addition, \"karbanot\" have no expiating effect unless the person making the offering sincerely repents of his or her actions before making the offering, and makes restitution to any person who was harmed by the violation.\n\nThe completely righteous (means a man who did nothing wrong in his life) enjoy in this life and in the life after. The not completely righteous or completely wicked suffer for their sins in this world in order to atone for their sins through the humiliation, poverty, and suffering that God sends them. If the repentance is not complete in this world, the suffering will continue in the life after (hell). After the repentance is complete they join the righteous. The completely wicked (a man who did nothing good in his life) cannot correct their sins in this world or in the other, and hence do not suffer for them here, but in \"gehinom\" (hell). The very evil do not repent even at the gates of hell. Such people prosper in this world to receive their reward for any good deed, but cannot be cleansed by and hence cannot leave \"gehinom\", because they don't or can't repent. This world can therefore seem unjust where the righteous suffer, while the wicked prosper. Many great thinkers have contemplated this, but God's justice is long, precise and just.\n\nThe first mention of sin as a noun is a zoomorphism, with sin (\"hattath\") crouching at Cain's door. The first as a verb is Abimelech being prevented from sinning (\"khata\") against God in a dream. In fact the whole Tanakh is full of references to sins committed by leading people. This is to teach us that no one is perfect, everyone standing in trials/tests, and the thing is to try your best to learn from their mistakes.\n\nPeople do have the ability to master this inclination () and choose good over evil (conscience)(). Judaism uses the term \"sin\" to include violations of Jewish law that are not necessarily a lapse in morality. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia: \"Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will (\"behirah\"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: \"For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth\" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed people to repent and be forgiven.\" Judaism holds that all people sin at various points in their lives, and hold that God tempers justice with mercy.\n\nHebrew has several other words for sin beyond \"hata\", each with its own specific meaning. The word \"pesha\", or \"trespass\", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word \"aveira\" means \"transgression\". And the word \"avone\", or \"iniquity\", means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as \"sin\", \"hata\", literally means \"to go astray.\" Just as Jewish law, \"halakha\", provides the proper \"way\" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path.\n\nJudaism teaches that humans are born with free will, and morally neutral, with both a \"yetzer hatov\", (literally, \"the good inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a \"yetzer hara\", (literally \"the evil inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). The yetzer hara in some forms of Judaism means that Satan is merely an idiom or parable, rather than the fallen angel of traditional Christianity.\n\nObadiah ben Jacob Sforno suggests that the verse about a leader begins with the term \"when,\" which implies that committing a sin is inevitable because powerful and wealthy people—the leaders—are also likely to sin. This Torah verse concludes with the words \"realizes his guilt\" (Leviticus 4:22) because it is essential that powerful people acknowledge and feel remorse for their sin, lest they sin again.\n\nThe generic Hebrew word for any kind of sin is \"avera\" (literally: transgression). Based on verses in the Hebrew Bible, Judaism describes three levels of sin. There are three categories of a person who commits an avera. The first one is someone who does an avera intentionally, or \"B'mezid.\" This is the most serious category. The second is one who did an avera by accident. This is called \"B'shogeg,\" and while the person is still responsible for their action it is considered less serious. The third category is someone who is a \"Tinok Shenishba\", which is a person who was raised in an environment that was assimilated or non-Jewish, and is not aware of the proper Jewish laws, or halacha. This person is not held accountable for his or her actions.\n\nJudaism holds that no human being is perfect, and all people have sinned many times. The Talmud says: \"Everyone is responsible to be as great as Moses\", But then the Torah tells us in Deuteronomy 34:10 that \"No one will ever be as great as Moses\". This is to clarify that Moses fulfilled his own personal potential, so too we are expected to fulfill ours. Each person is born with a unique set of talents and tools. Some are rich, others are poor. Some are tall and some are short. One person can sing, another can write, etc. But these qualities are not what determine your greatness. Rather, it's how you deal with your particular circumstances. That's why Judaism says: It's not important where you are on the ladder, but how many rungs you've climbed. The crucial concept is the effort.\n\nThe story is told of Zusha, the great Chassidic master, who lay crying on his deathbed. His students asked him, \"Rebbe, why are you so sad? After all the mitzvahs and good deeds you have done, you will surely get a great reward in heaven!\". \"I'm afraid!\" said Zusha. \"Because when I get to heaven, I know God's not going to ask me 'Why weren't you more like Moses?' or 'Why weren't you more like King David?' But I'm afraid that God will ask 'Zusha, why weren't you more like Zusha?' And then what will I say?!\" \n\nJoseph Hertz said that sin is not an evil power whose chains the children of flesh must helplessly drag towards a weary tomb. We can always shake off its yoke; and what is more, we need never assume its yoke. An ancient fable tells us of distant oceans with mountainous magnetic rocks of such terrific power that wreck and ruin would befall any ship venturing near them. Instantly the iron nails would fly out of the ship, bolts and fastenings would be torn away by that magnetic force, the vessel would become nothing more than so many planks of wood, and all on board fall a prey to the hungry waters. Sins there are that, likewise, unhinge all our stays of character, rob us of the restraints of past habits and education, and leave us helpless playthings on the billows of temptation and passion. Yet a man is the pilot of his life’s barque, and can at all times steer it so as never to come near those mountains of destruction, darkness, and death.\n\nBased on the views of Rabbeinu Tam in the Babylonian Talmud (tractate Rosh HaShanah 17b), God is said to have Thirteen Attributes of Mercy:\n\n\nAs Jews are commanded in \"imitatio Dei\", emulating God, rabbis take these attributes into account in deciding Jewish law and its contemporary application.\n\nJews recognize two kinds of sin, offenses against other people, and offenses against God. Offenses against God may be understood as violation of a contract (the covenant between God and the Children of Israel). Since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, Jews have believed that right action (as opposed to right belief) is the way for a person to atone for one's sins. Midrash \"Avot de Rabbi Natan\" states the following:\n\nIn Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible - only at times more difficult. There is almost always a \"way back\" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)\n\nSins between people are considered much more severe in Judaism than sins between man and God. Yom Kippur, the main day of repent in Judaism can atones for Sins between man and God, but not for Sins between man and his fellow, that is until he has appeased his friend.(Mishnah, Yoma,8:9). Eleazar ben Azariah derived [this from the verse]: \"From all your sins before God you shall be cleansed\" (Book of Leviticus,16:30) – for sins between man and God Yom Kippur atones, but for sins between man and his fellow Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases his fellow.\n\nThe Gemara (87a) continues: \"R. Yitzchak said: Whoever aggravates his fellow even through words is required to placate him… R. Yosi bar Chanina said: Whoever beseeches forgiveness from his friend should not beseech him more than three times. And if he died, [the offender] brings ten people and must stand them by his grave and he says, \"I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and so-and-so whom I wounded.\"\"\n\nTwo Jews came to a Chassidic Rabbi to ask advice about sins they had committed. One had committed a great sin for which he was sure God would never forgive him; the other was less worried, because he had never been guilty of anything so grave, but only of the normal collection of lesser sins. The Rabbi told them to go out to a field and select stones corresponding to the size and number of their sins, and later to return to the field and scatter the stones. This done, they came back to the Rabbi. “Now go to the field once more,” he told them both, “pick up the stones you scattered, and bring them to me.”\n\nHe who had committed the one big sin knew at once which was his stone, and brought it to the Rabbi. The other, however, had scattered so many little stones that he could not be certain of identifying them again. He had a most difficult time in finding his stones and bringing them to the Rabbi. The Rabbi then told them: “Your deeds are like your stones. You who brought one large stone, committed a grave sin. But you were conscious of what you had done, and with a determined effort at repentance you could be forgiven by God. But you, whose sins were many and small, like those of most human beings, have found how hard it is to catch up with one’s minor lapses. And no repentance of yours can possibly be effective until you realise that small things matter.”\n\nThe rabbis recognize a positive value to the \"yetzer hara\": one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was \"very good\" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as \"good\") and explain that without the \"yetzer ha'ra\" there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that \"yetzer ha'tov\" and \"yetzer ha'ra\" are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.\n\nOr as Hillel the Elder famously summarized the Jewish philosophy:\n\nAnother explanation is, without the existence of the \"yetzer ha'ra\", there would be no merit earned in following God's commandments; choice is only meaningful if there has indeed been a choice made. So whereas creation was \"good\" before, it became \"very good\" when the evil inclination was added, for then it became possible to truly say that man could make a true choice to obey God's \"mitzvot\" (commandments). This is because Judaism views the following of God's ways as a desirable end in and of itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud teaches that \"Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Eleazar both explain that as long as the Temple stood, the altar atoned for Israel, but now, one's table atones [when the poor are invited as guests].\" (Tractate Berachot, 55a.)\n\nRepentance in itself is also a means of atonement (See Ezekiel 33:11, 33:19, Jeremiah 36:3, etc.) The Hebrew word for repentance is \"teshuvah\" which literally means to \"return (to God).\" The prophet Hosea (14:3) said, \"Take with you words, and return to God.\"\n\nJudaism teaches that our personal relationship with God allows us to turn directly to Him at any time, as Malachi 3:7 says, \"Return to Me and I shall return to you,\" and Ezekiel 18:27, \"When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.\" Additionally, God is extremely compassionate and forgiving as is indicated in Daniel 9:18, \"We do not present our supplications before You because of our righteousness, but because of Your abundant mercy.\"\n\nThe traditional liturgy of the \"Days of Awe\" (the High Holy Days; i.e. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) states that prayer, repentance and tzedakah (charitable actions) are ways to repent for sin. In Judaism, sins committed against people (rather than against God or in the heart) must first be corrected and put right to the best of a person's ability; a sin which has not also been put right as best as possible cannot truly be said to be repented.\n\nTo a man who says “I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent,” the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness. For sins against God the Day of Atonement brings forgiveness; for sins against one’s fellowman, the Day of Atonement brings no forgiveness till he has become reconciled with the fellowman he wronged (Mishnah Yoma 8:9).\n\nAccording to Maimonides in order to achieve true repentance the sinner must abandon his sin and remove it from his thoughts and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, “Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts” (Isaiah 55:7). Likewise must he regret the past, as it is said: “Surely after I turned I repented” (Jer. 31:18). He must also call Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again.\n\nAtonement for sins is discussed in the Hebrew Bible, known to Christians as the Old Testament. Rituals for atonement occurred in the Temple in Jerusalem, and were performed by the \"Kohanim\", the Israelite priests. These services included song, prayer, offerings and animal sacrifices known as the \"korbanot\". The rites for Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, are prescribed in the book of Leviticus chapter 16. The ritual of the scapegoat, sent into the wilderness to be claimed by Azazel, was one of these observances (Lev. 16:20-22).\n\nThe liturgy of the Days of Awe (the High Holy Days; i.e. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) states that prayer, repentance and tzedakah (the dutiful giving of charity) atone for sin. But prayer cannot atone for wrongs done, without an honest sincere attempt to rectify any wrong done to the best of one's ability, and the sincere intention to avoid repetition. Atonement to Jews means to repent and set aside, and the word \"T'shuvah\" used for atonement actually means \"to return\". Judaism is optimistic in that it always sees a way that a determined person may return to what is good, and that God waits for that day too.\n\nA number of animal sacrifices were prescribed in the Torah (five books of Moses) to make atonement: a sin-offering for sins, and a guilt offering for religious trespasses. The significance of animal sacrifice is not expanded on at length in the Torah, though Genesis 9:4 and Leviticus 17 suggest that blood and vitality were linked. Conservative Jews and Christians argue at the present era that the Jews never believed that the aim of all sacrifice is to pay the debt for sins - only the sin offering and the guilt offering had this purpose; modern scholars of early Jewish history, however, often disagree and argue that this division came later.\n\nLater Biblical prophets occasionally make statements to the effect that the hearts of the people were more important than their sacrifices - \"Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams\" (I Samuel 15:22); \"For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgement of God rather than burnt offerings\" (Hosea 6:6); \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart\" (Psalm 51:17) (see also Isaiah 1:11, Psalm 40:6-8).\n\nAlthough the animal sacrifices were prescribed for atonement, there is no place where the Hebrew Bible says that animal sacrifice is the \"only\" means of atonement. Hebrew Bible teaches that it is possible to return to God through repentance and prayer alone. For example, in the books of Jonah and Esther, both Jews and gentiles repented, prayed to God and were forgiven for their sins, without having offered any sacrifices. Additionally, in modern times, most Jews do not even consider animal sacrifices.\n\nOn the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur - also known as the Day of Atonement-, and the ten-day period between these holidays, repentance of sins committed is based on specialized prayers and hymns, while some Jews continue the ancient methods of sacrifice. An example of a common method of \"sacrificing\" for the sake of repentance is simply to drop bread into a body of water (as in the ceremony of Tashlikh), to signify the passing of sins and the hope for one to be written into the Book of Life by God once again. This is especially emphasized on what is arguably the holiest Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur.\n\n"}

On advice of counsel, Quaker Oats set up and transferred the land to the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company to make the company the registered owner and manager of the deeds.\n\nStarting on January 1955, 93 newspapers across the United States ran advertisements that read \"Get a real deed to one square inch of land in the Yukon gold rush country\" and, \"You'll actually own one square inch of Yukon land\". The promotion was tied to the \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon\" radio show which Quaker Oats was sponsoring at the time.\n\nThe promotion instructed people to mail a form along with a box top from either Quaker Puffed Wheat, Quaker Puffed Rice or Muffets Shredded Wheat to the Quaker Oats company. In turn, a 5 by 8 inch deed to one square inch of land in the Klondike was sent back. In February 1955, Quaker Oats was blocked from trading the deed for a box top by the Ohio Securities Division until it received a state license for the \"sale\" of foreign land. To get around the injunction, the company stopped the trade-in offer and instead put one of the deeds in each box of cereal produced.\n\nSince none of the deeds were actually registered, the documents were never legally binding and owners of these deeds were never actual owners of any land. The deed excluded mineral rights on the property.\n\nDue to $37.20 in back taxes, the land was repossessed by the Canadian government in 1965, and the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company dissolved in 1966. The land is now part of the Dawson City Golf Course.\n\nTo this day, Yukon officials receive letters and phone calls about the deeds. The land office of the Yukon currently contains an 18-inch thick file folder of correspondence regarding the promotion.\n\n\n"}

Its cartoons repeatedly attacked King Louis Philippe, whom it typically depicted as a pear.\n\n\"La Caricature morale, politique et littéraire\" was published from 1830 to 1843. Auguste Audibert was editor and Charles Philipon (1800–61) was director and main author. Honoré de Balzac and Louis Desnoyers assisted Philipon in writing some of the magazines issues. Primary artists were Honoré Daumier and Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville with caricature contributions from many artists including Henry Monnier, Alexandre Decamps, Auguste Raffet, Paul Gavarni, Achille Devéria, Auguste Desperret, Eugène Forest, Benjamin Roubaud. The journal was founded after the censorship laws had been relaxed following the July Revolution of 1830 in which Louis Philippe came to power. It covered both politics and art. 251 issues appeared between 1830 and 1835, each of four pages, with two or three lithographs.\n\nPhilipon was the owner of the largest printing house in Paris equipped with lithographic presses, and used them to print \"La Caricature\" and \"Le Charivari\", another illustrated paper. He drew together a group of skilled artists who mostly worked for these two papers, through which they attacked the king and the system of government with growing violence. The major contributors were Honoré Daumier (1808–79) and Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville (1803–47), but there were many others. For example, a caricature by Jules David appeared in \"La Caricature\" of 31 May 1831. The king is depicted as an illusionist who uses the \"juste milieu\" and some \"poudre de non-intervention\" to make liberty and revolution vanish.\n\nIn 1830–31 there were revolutionary uprisings in Italy. The Austrians intervened to suppress the revolts, and the French did nothing to prevent them. The Pope broke his promise to grant the rebels in the Papal States an amnesty. \"La Caricature\" published a cartoon that showed the Pope on his throne surrounded by corpses. Similarly, Philipon published cartoons that associated the French government with that of Tsar Nicholas I when Russia suppressed a revolt in Poland. The fall of Warsaw was announced by Horace Sebastiani, the French foreign minister, as \"L'ordre règne à Varsovie\" (Order reigns in Warsaw). The phrase was used as a caption for one of the cartoons.\n\nThe journal became increasingly vocal in its opposition to Louis-Philippe, and was seized more than twelve times. The publishers were prosecuted, and Philipon was jailed for a year. In 1835 the government passed legislation that forced \"La Caricature\" to cease publication. The journal began publication again in 1838 and continued until 1843. Writing in 1840, William Makepeace Thackeray talked of the \"curious contest between the State and M. Philipon's little army.\" Thackery wrote,\n\nDrawings and lithographies were contributed by the following artists, among others:\n\nSome of the authors of articles were:\n\nCitations\nSources\n"}

She was the first female graduate of the AFI Conservatory, in 1973.\n\nLeder was born in New York City in 1952, the daughter of Etyl, a classical pianist, and Paul Leder, a director, producer, actor, writer, and editor of such films as \"My Friends Need Killing, Attack of the Giant Horny Gorilla,\" and \"Dismember Mama\". Leder was raised in Los Angeles, in a Jewish home. During childhood, her father, a low-budget independent filmmaker, introduced Mimi and her siblings to film production. Her father often dropped her off at the cinema to watch the latest films. Leder states that one of the first films that had an impact on her was Federico Fellini's 8 1/2. Having worked for the majority of her life in film gave her the skill and confidence to be the first woman accepted into the AFI Conservatory. She studied cinematography but enjoyed working with actors and telling stories.\n\nLeder began her career as a script supervisor on a string of films, including \"Spawn of the Slithis\" (1978), \"Dummy\" (1979), \"The Boy Who Drank Too Much\" (1980), and \"A Long Way Home\" (1980), before moving on to the TV series \"Hill Street Blues\" (1981). After making a short film, \"Short Order Dreams\", written and funded by her father Paul, she screened it for Steven Bochco, creator of Hill Street Blues, and his friend Gregory Hoblit who hired her to direct an episode of \"L.A. Law\".\n\nIn 1988 Leder went on to direct episodes of \"Crime Story\", \"The Bronx Zoo\", \"Midnight Caller\", before getting hired to direct several episodes of \"China Beach\" (1988–91) for which she was nominated for four Emmys. She decided to make a few made-for-TV films, \"Woman with a Past\" (1992), \"House of Secrets\" (1993), and \"Baby Brokers\" (1994) before getting hired as one of the core directors for \"ER\" (1994–2009). She made proficient use of her cinematography background and the Steadicam to create high energy scenes that moved around the corridors and rooms of the hospital. The show earned her Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series in 1995 and 1996. She returned to direct an episode of the series during its final season in 2009. She was receiving much attention and soon received a job offer from Steven Spielberg to direct the film \"The Peacemaker\" (1997), an action-adventure film that she has said she sees as a drama. Leder became one of only a handful of woman directors to break into the action genre, and her assignment to this film generated much press about the opportunities for women directors in Hollywood. She studied trains and other visual effects to prepare herself for the film and is proud of the results.\n\nContinuing to work for DreamWorks, she directed \"Deep Impact\" (1998) and \"Pay It Forward\" (2000) while simultaneously creating a personal love story about her parents, \"Sentimental Journey\" (1999). Leder went through a period after making \"Pay It Forward\" where she wasn’t being hired to direct any feature films.  This was due to the lack of success of the film. Leder felt as though she had been put into a ‘movie jail’ by Hollywood for the lack of success that is associated with \"Pay It Forward\".  Leder also attributed this reaction from the industry to her being a female. Even with Leder’s already privileged position of being a filmmakers daughter, it is still hard for her to keep her footing in the largely male industry. Leder doesn’t like being called a ‘woman’ director, and instead prefers to simply be called a director. Despite her challenges with being a woman in film, Leder still integrates distinctly female perspectives into her directing style. She has changed the way that her characters interact with stereotypes in some of her films such as \"Deep Impact\" so that female protagonists are stronger and shallow villains are deeper with interesting backstories.  Leder envisions a future in film that is not only shaped and changed by technological advancements, but also by more female voices. Leder has used her position to hire many women in times where not many women were being hired. Some of the women that she has hired over the years have been Bethany Rooney, Sharron Miller, Diane Keaton, and Michelle MacLaren. She tries to bring female directors onto shows that she produces as much as possible. \n\nLeder’s dry spell of feature films after the release of \"Pay It Forward\" drove her to work even harder with her other pursuits in television and film executive producing.  She shot nine pilots and produced six series including \"The Beast\" (2001), \"John Doe\" (2002), \"Johnny Zero\" (2005), and \"Vanished\" (2006).  Leder also made many made-for-TV movies such as \"Thick as Thieves\" (2009), \"U.S. Attorney\" (2009), and \"Heavenly\" (2011).  In 2015 Leder was brought on by HBO to direct a first-season episode of \"The Leftovers\" and was later hired as a co-showrunner.\n\nLeder’s new feature film \"On the Basis of Sex\", the story of Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s path to become a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, will be released in December of 2018.  It will be Leder’s first feature film in 18 years. Leder felt a strong connection to the story portrayed due to Ginsberg’s constant struggle to be a female voice in a male dominated field and the similarities that she saw between it and the film industry. \n\nLeder has one daughter, Hannah, with her husband actor Gary Werntz. Leder is a self-proclaimed feminist and avid protester.\n\nScott, Tobias. “Veteran TV Director Still Tries to Scale Film Barriers.” \"New York Times\" (10/13/2015): C2.

It was founded in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan in 1915 by Hyman Moscot, which makes it one of the oldest local businesses in New York City, as well as the 21st oldest eyewear company in the world still operating today.\n\nIn 1899, when he was in his 20s, Belarusian immigrant Hyman Mushcot arrived in New York City through Ellis Island, where his surname was shortened and changed to Moscot. He settled down in Manhattan’s Lower East Side neighborhood, and having already worked in the optical business in his home country, he began selling ready-made eyeglasses from a wooden pushcart on Orchard Street. He spoke only Yiddish, and served the many immigrants that poured into the Lower East Side at the turn of the century.\n\nIn 1910, Hyman married fellow immigrant Leba. Five years later, with a family rapidly growing, he opened his first retail store at 94 Rivington Street, filling its Windows with signs, posters, and drawings of giant eyes and glasses. (Because of this, some journalists have speculated that the shop, which sat close to the Williamsburg bridge, was F. Scott Fitzgerald’s inspiration for the Doctor T. J. Eckleburg billboard in \"The Great Gatsby\", which the novelist was writing during the same years.)\n\nHyman and Leba had six children. In 1925, at 15 years old, Hyman’s youngest son, Solomon, nicknamed “Sol,” took over the business, and in 1935, moved the shop to its location at 118 Orchard Street, where it would be located for nearly eight decades. The bright yellow sign with giant, black-rimmed glasses that adorned its storefront became synonymous with the brand, the neighborhood, and downtown New York, and while most of New York’s historical businesses fell during the Great Depression, the Moscots made it through the 1930s.\n\nSol’s son, Joel, began presiding over the House of Moscot in 1951. Charming, dedicated, and devoted to his customers, Joel would manage Moscot for over fifty years‚ overseeing the Shop’s activities, while conveying the family’s values to his sons, who would soon become the fourth generation of Moscots to take the helm. The oldest, Harvey, graduated from Boston New England College of Optometry in 1986, and began working as a doctor at 118 Orchard. The youngest, Kenny, entered the business in 1991 with a bachelor's degree in finance. In 1996, with father Joel still at the company, Moscot expanded, opening a second shop at 69 W. 14th Street, on the corner of Sixth Avenue, in downtown Manhattan, which remains the company’s flagship location.\n\nAfter Joel Moscot retired in 2003, the family company rebranded from Sol Moscot to Moscot. Together, the fourth generation Moscot siblings reinvented what was once a neighborhood optical shop into what is now a global brand. \n\nAfter the death of his brother in 2010, Harvey Moscot became president of the company. Due to gentrification in the Lower East Side, Moscot moved from 118 Orchard Street across Delancey Street to 108 Orchard Street where it remains today. The shop was eventually included in the Tenement Museum’s historical tour of the Lower East Side. In 2013, Moscot opened its third flagship store, this time in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, the façade of which is reminiscent of the family’s first shop at 94 Rivington Street. Moscot later opened shops in Seoul, South Korea, Tokyo, Japan, and London, England.\n\nHarvey's son, Zack Moscot studied industrial and product design at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and began working full time at Moscot in 2013. He is now the company’s chief eyewear designer, representing the fifth generation Moscot to join the brand.\n\nThe frames, eyeglasses and sunglasses together, are categorized under the Moscot Originals and Moscot Spirit Collections. Materials vary from acetate to metal and beta-titanium.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, the brand teamed up with fashion designer Chris Benz for a limited edition run of four special colors for its classic frame, the \"Nebb\"; only 200 were available, each numbered for supposed authenticity. The company has since engaged in eyewear collaborations with Simon Miller, Myles Kennedy, Tariq Trotter and Johan Lindeberg for BLK DNM.\n\nMoscot is popularly known for its collaborations and association with many American artists and celebrities.\n\nActor Justin Theroux, a longtime customer of the brand, has a frame named after him based on those his character wore in the 2001 movie \"Mulholland Drive\".\n\nIn 2011, the company released a limit edition (only 350 pairs were available) of the Terry Richardson original frame, called “Terry”.\n\nIn 2014, a limited edition “Grunya” frame designed with the collaboration of The Roots frontman Tariq Trotter was released.\n\nJohnny Depp made the “Lemtosh” frames famous back in 2004, when the psychological thriller movie Secret Window came out.\n\nCurrent customers include celebrities such as Damien Pichereau, Elvis Costello, Jeff Goldblum, Liev Schrieber, Daniel Craig, Andy Cohen (TV personality), Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Rudd, Morgan Neville, Forest Whitaker, Tim Burton, Tom Hanks, Sting, Lance Armstrong, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Kanye West, LeBron James, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kiefer Sutherland, Miley Cyrus, Ryan Gosling, Renée Zellweger, Lady GaGa, Denzel Washington, Offset (rapper), Mary-Kate Olsen, Harry Styles, Alex Rodriguez, 50 Cent, Jessica Alba, Aziz Ansari, Nick Jonas, Helena Bonham Carter, Conan O'Brien, Demi Moore, Michelle Williams, James Franco, Ruby Rose, Selena Gomez, Kate Hudson, Chris Hemsworth, Rachel Maddow, Anderson Cooper, Anne Hathaway, Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Rock, Jonah Hill, Bob Gunton, Josh Hartnett, Susan Sarandon and Zvi Hauser.\n"}

Perhaps Hilton's best-known work, it is a free composition depicting a naked white woman. The central figure is abstracted, with simple black outlines drawn in charcoal of a featureless face, breasts and pubic triangle, and upraised arms. All four limbs are cut off at the edges of the frame. The white body contrasts with bold segments of background colour in yellow and red, blue and black. The work is inscribed on the back \"Oi, yoi, yoi/Hilton/Dec 63\".\n\nAccording to Hilton, the painting was inspired by a drunken argument with his second wife, Rose Hilton, who was dancing on a verandah, nude, shouting \"oi yoi yoi\", an expression of frustration or exasperation. According to his wife, the argument took place in France in the summer of 1962, before they were married. Hilton has rejected the suggestion that he took conscious inspiration from paintings of dancers and bathers by Cézanne or Matisse, but admitted they were \"probably subconsciously\" important.\n\nThe painting was exhibited in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1964. It was also exhibited in a retrospective exhibition of Hilton's work at the Serpentine Gallery in 1974, along with a second version of the same subject, \"Dancing Woman\", which has as similar central figure but more muted background colours limited to blue, black and yellow. \"Oi Yoi Yoi\" was purchased from the artist by the Tate Gallery in 1974 through Waddington Galleries, and is displayed at Tate Britain in London. \"Dancing Woman\" was purchased by the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh in 1981. Both works measure by .\n\nThe paintings have similarities with the Dancing Beijing logo for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, designed by Guo Chunning, which was inspired by the Chinese character 京 (jīng, meaning \"capital\"), and also resembles a dancing figure with arms raised, or a runner crossing a finishing line. Hilton also may have taken inspiration from a Chinese character.\n\n"}

Paragon was noted for producing high quality teaware and tableware, and was granted royal warrants of appointment by several members of the British Royal Family.\n\nThe Star China company was founded in 1897 as a partnership between Herbert Aynsley (great-grandson of the founder of Aynsley China) and Hugh Irving, trading until 1919, and using \"Paragon\" as a trade name from about 1900. In 1919, after Aynsley's retirement the company name was changed to Paragon China Company Limited. Irving's two sons subsequently became managing directors of the business.\n\nIn its early history the firm manufactured tea and breakfast wares, exporting to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. However, in the 1930s, Paragon expanded both its market, to include the Americas, and its range of products to include dinnerware. Also at this time, Paragon began its move towards creating a smokeless factory, installing electric kilns.\n\nThe 1960s saw the company change hands several times, owned for a while by T.C.

The film was written and directed by Don Mancini, who created the series and has written all of the films. With this entry, Mancini made his directorial debut. The film is set six years after \"Child's Play 3\" and \"Bride of Chucky\" and follows a young doll named Glen, the son of Chucky and Tiffany, resurrecting his parents, causing chaos.\n\nThe film, shot in Romania, continues the series' evolution from the pure horror genre of the first movie to a hybrid horror-comedy. It was the last \"Child's Play\" film to be released in theaters, with all future installments to be released direct to DVD. The film was followed by another sequel, \"Curse of Chucky\", released on home video and Netflix in 2013.\n\nSix years after the previous film, Glen, the benevolent son of Chucky and Tiffany, has a nightmare in which he murders a little girl's parents. In reality, he is living a life of embarrassment and abuse as a ventriloquist's dummy. After being forced to perform, and then locked inside a cage, Glen sees Chucky and Tiffany on television and realizes that he is their son. \n\nDesperate to know his parents, Glen manages to escape his abusive owner and tracks Chucky and Tiffany to Hollywood.

Chucky faints, but Tiffany is overjoyed and hugs her child. When a puppeteer starts taking Tiffany apart, she and Chucky decapitate him with a piano wire. Jennifer finds the beheaded body and calls the police. Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen ride home with her in a limousine. \n\nHaving witnessed his parents kill the puppeteer, Glen asks them why they murder others, as he feels violence is bad. Chucky replies that it helps them to relax. On the other hand, Tiffany, feeling parental responsibility, agrees with Glen and forces Chucky to agree to stop killing people for the sake of their son.

Disgusted, Tiffany rejects Chucky and decides to take Glen with her. Enraged, Chucky throws a knife at Jennifer to stop Tiffany transferring her soul into her body and leaving him, but Stan jumps in the way to save her and tells Jennifer he loves her before dying. The police arrive, forcing the dolls to flee. Jennifer is rushed to the hospital, but claims she wants to see her babies. Tiffany drugs Jennifer and begins to possess her, but Chucky breaks in and kills Tiffany with an axe. Before Tiffany dies, she tells Glen not to make the same mistakes she and Chucky have.

{"id": "101483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101483", "title": "Stream of consciousness", "text": "Stream of consciousness\n\nIn literary criticism, stream of consciousness is a narrative mode or method that attempts to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind. The term was coined by William James in 1890 in his \"The Principles of Psychology\", and in 1918 the novelist May Sinclair (1863–1946) first applied the term stream of consciousness, in a literary context, when discussing Dorothy Richardson's (1873–1957) novels. \"Pointed Roofs\" (1915), the first work in Richardson's series of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled \"Pilgrimage\", is the first complete stream of consciousness novel published in English. However, in 1934, Richardson comments that \"Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf & D.R. ... were all using 'the new method', though very differently, simultaneously\". There were, however, many earlier precursors and the technique is still used by contemporary writers.\n\nStream of consciousness is a narrative device that attempts to give the written equivalent of the character's thought processes, either in a loose interior monologue (see below), or in connection to his or her actions. Stream of consciousness writing is usually regarded as a special form of interior monologue and is characterized by associative leaps in thought and lack of some or all punctuation. Stream of consciousness and interior monologue are distinguished from dramatic monologue and soliloquy, where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person, which are chiefly used in poetry or drama. In stream of consciousness the speaker's thought processes are more often depicted as overheard in the mind (or addressed to oneself); it is primarily a fictional device.\nThe term \"stream of consciousness\" was coined by philosopher and psychologist William James in \"The Principles of Psychology\" (1890):\n\nIn the following example of stream of consciousness from James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", Molly seeks sleep:\n\na quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office the alarmlock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so that I can get up early \nWhile many sources use the terms stream of consciousness and interior monologue as synonyms, the \"Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms\" suggests, that \"they can also be distinguished psychologically and literarily. In a psychological sense, stream of consciousness is the subject‐matter, while interior monologue is the technique for presenting it\". And for literature, \"while an interior monologue always presents a character's thoughts 'directly', without the apparent intervention of a summarizing and selecting narrator, it does not necessarily mingle them with impressions and perceptions, nor does it necessarily violate the norms of grammar, or logic- but the stream‐of‐consciousness technique also does one or both of these things.\" Similarly the \"Encyclopædia Britannica Online\", while agreeing that these terms are \"often used interchangeably\", suggests, that \"while an interior monologue may mirror all the half thoughts, impressions, and associations that impinge upon the character's consciousness, it may also be restricted to an organized presentation of that character's rational thoughts\".\n\nWhile the use of the narrative technique of stream of consciousness is usually associated with modernist novelists in the first part of the twentieth-century, a number of precursors have been suggested, including Laurence Sterne's psychological novel \"Tristram Shandy\" (1757). It has been suggested that Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" (1843) foreshadows this literary technique in the nineteenth-century. Poe's story is a first person narrative, told by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of his sanity, while describing a murder he committed. and it is often read as a dramatic monologue. George R. Clay notes that Leo Tolstoy \"when the occasion requires it ... applies Modernist stream of consciousness technique\" in both \"War and Peace\" (1869) and \"Anna Karenina\" (1878).\nThe short story \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" (1890) by another American author, Ambrose Bierce, also abandons strict linear time to record the internal consciousness of the protagonist. Because of his renunciation of chronology in favor of free association, Édouard Dujardin's \"Les Lauriers sont coupés\" (1887) is also an important precursor. Indeed, James Joyce \"picked up a copy of Dujardin's novel ... in Paris in 1903\" and \"acknowledged a certain borrowing from it\". \n\nThere are also those who point to Anton Chekhov's short stories and plays (1881-1904) and Knut Hamsun's \"Hunger\" (1890), and \"Mysteries\" (1892) as offering glimpses of the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative technique at the end of the nineteenth-century. While \"Hunger\" is widely seen as a classic of world literature and a groundbreaking modernist novel, \"Mysteries\" is also considered a pioneer work. It has been claimed that Hamsun was way ahead of his time with the use of stream of consciousness in two chapters in particular of this novel. British author Robert Ferguson said: “There’s a lot of dreamlike aspects of \"Mysteries\". In that book ... it is ... two chapters, where he actually invents stream of consciousness writing, in the early 1890s. This was long before Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.” Henry James has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as \"Portrait of a Lady\" (1881). It has been suggested that he influenced later stream of consciousness writers, including Virginia Woolf, who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them.\n\nHowever, it has also been argued that Arthur Schnitzler (1862-1931), in his short story '\"Leutnant Gustl\" (\"None but the Brave\", 1900), was in fact the first to make full use of the stream of consciousness technique.\n\nBut it is only in the twentieth-century that this technique is fully developed by modernists. Marcel Proust is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream of consciousness technique in his novel sequence \"À la recherche du temps perdu\" (1913–1927) (\"In Search of Lost Time\"), but Robert Humphrey comments, that Proust \"is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness\" and, that he \"was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of consciousness novel\". Novelist John Cowper Powys also argues that Proust did not use stream of consciousness: \"while we are told what the hero thinks or what Swann thinks we are told this rather by the author than either by the 'I' of the story or by Charles Swann.\"\nThe term was first applied in a literary context in \"The Egoist\", April 1918, by May Sinclair, in relation to the early volumes of Dorothy Richardson's novel sequence \"Pilgrimage\". Richardson, however, describes the term as an 'lamentably ill-chosen metaphor\".\n\nJames Joyce was a major pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness. Some hints of this technique, are already present in \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (1916), along with interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings. Joyce began writing \"A Portrait\" in 1907 and it was first serialised in the English literary magazine \"The Egoist\" in 1914 and 1915. Earlier in 1906 Joyce, when working on \"Dubliners\", considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom under the title \"Ulysses\". Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Serial publication of \"Ulysses\" in the magazine \"The Little Review\" began in March 1918. \"Ulysses\" was finally published in 1922. While \"Ulysses\" represents a major example of the use of stream of consciousness Joyce also uses \"authorial description\" and Free Indirect Style to register Bloom's inner thoughts. Furthermore the novel does not focus solely on interior experiences: \"Bloom is constantly shown \"from\" all round; from inside as well as out; from a variety of points of view which range from the objective to the subjective\". In his final work \"Finnegans Wake\" (1939) Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns.\n\nAnother early example is the use of interior monologue by T. S. Eliot in his poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1915), a dramatic monologue of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action,\" a work probably influenced by the narrative poetry of Robert Browning, including \"Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister\".\n\nProminent uses in the years that followed the publication of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", include Italo Svevo, \"La coscienza di Zeno\" (1923), Virginia Woolf, \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1925), \"To the Lighthouse\" (1927), and William Faulkner in \"The Sound and the Fury\" (1929). Though Randell Stevenson suggests, that \"interior monologue, rather than stream of consciousness, is the appropriate term for the style in which [subjective experience] is recorded, both in \"The Waves\" and in Woolf's writing generally. Throughout \"Mrs Dalloway\" Woolf blurs the distinction between direct and indirect speech, freely alternating her mode of narration between omniscient description, indirect interior monologue, and soliloquy. Malcolm Lowry's novel \"Under the Volcano\" (1947) resembles \"Ulysses\", \"both in its concentration almost entirely within a single day of [Its protagonist] Firmin's life ... and in the range of interior monologues and stream of consciousness employed to represent the minds of [the] characters\". Samuel Beckett, a friend of James Joyce, uses interior monologue in novels like \"Molloy\" (1951), \"Malone meurt\" (1951; \"Malone Dies\") and \"L'innommable\" (1953: \"The Unnamable\"). and the short story \"From an Abandoned Work\" (1957).\n\nThe technique continued to be used into the 1970s in a novel such as Robert Anton Wilson/Robert Shea collaborative \"Illuminatus!\" (1975), with regard to which \"The Fortean Times\" warns readers, to \"[b]e prepared for streams of consciousness in which not only identity but time and space no longer confine the narrative\".\n\nScottish writer James Kelman's novels are known for mixing stream of consciousness narrative with Glaswegian vernacular. Examples include \"The Busconductor Hines\", \"A Disaffection\" and \"How Late It Was, How Late\". With regard to Salman Rushdie one critic comments, that \"[a]ll Rushdie's novels follow an Indian/Islamic storytelling style, a stream-of-consciousness narrative told by a loquacious young Indian man\". Other writers who use this narrative device include Sylvia Plath in \"The Bell Jar\" (1963) and Irvine Welsh in \"Trainspotting\" (1993).\n\nStream of consciousness continues to appear in contemporary literature. Dave Eggers, author of \"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\" (2000), according to one reviewer, \"talks much as he writes – a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions\". Novelist John Banville describes Roberto Bolaño's novel \"Amulet\" (1999), as written in \"a fevered stream of consciousness\".\n\nThe twenty-first century brought further exploration, including Jonathan Safran Foer's \"Everything is Illuminated\" (2002) and many of the short stories of American author Brendan Connell.\n\n"}

It dates to 6th or 7th century. It is believed to have been made in northern Mesopotamia. The manuscript has 246 extant folios. Large sections of text and the accompanying illustrations are missing. The folios are 312 by 230 mm. For reasons of economy, the text is written in three columns. \n\nThe illumination consists of miniatures introducing each of the books of the Bible and set into one or two of the text columns. The miniature for the Book of Genesis which may have been the most sumptuous miniature is missing. Although most of the miniatures are full length author portraits, some depict scenes from the following book. For example, the miniature before the Book of Job depicts Job on the dung heap. This miniature combine several scenes from the Book of Job. Job is pictured lying naked on the dung heap, covered with sores. Below him his wife is talking to him. To the left are his three friends. One of them is seen rending his garments, while the other two are seated, and talking to him. The Book of Exodus also has a narrative miniature before it. It depicts Moses and Aaron requesting permission to depart from Pharaoh. It is hard to understand why this scene, rather than one of the many more popular scenes was chosen to be the sole illustration for Exodus. Other miniatures are allegorical groups. The miniature before the Book of Proverbs shows the Virgin and Child, flanked by Solomon, representing the wisdom of the Old Testament, and Ecclesia, a personification of the Christian Church. Only one New Testament miniature survives, that of James the Apostle. The miniatures show mixture of Hellenistic heritage and a native Syriac tradition. Some of the miniatures, especially the miniature before Exodus, show stylistic similarities to the miniatures in the Rabula Gospels. Based on this it is unlikely that this manuscript was made much later than the Rabula Gospels which were made in 586.\n\nThe manuscript is assumed to have come from the Episcopal library of Siirt near Lake Van, where it may have been produced. It has been in the Bibliothèque Nationale since 1909.\n\n\n\n\nScan of the complete manuscript - http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10527102b/f1.image.r=bible%20syriaque\n"}

One of the oldest theatres in Rome, it was constructed in 1731 and inaugurated on 31 January 1732 with \"Berenice\" by Domenico Sarro. It is built over part of the curia section of the Theatre of Pompey. This curia was the location of the assassination of Julius Caesar.\n\nThe house was commissioned by the Sforza-Cesarini family and designed by the architect Gerolamo Theodoli with the auditorium laid out in the traditional horseshoe shape. Duke Francesco Sforza-Cesarini, who ran the Argentina Theatre from 1807 to 1815, was a \"theatre fanatic\" who continued until his death to run up debts. Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\" was given its premiere on 20 February 1816, just after Duke Francesco's death and, in the 19th century, the premieres of many notable operas took place in the theatre, including Verdi's \"I due Foscari\" on 3 November 1844 and \"La battaglia di Legnano\" on 27 January 1849.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1944, more musical offerings than dramatic ones were presented, although the theatre premiered works by Luigi Pirandello, Henrik Ibsen and Maxim Gorky during this time. As well, a series of operas was presented in the winter of 1944-45 in honor of the American and British troops.\n\nThe venue was used for classical-music recordings by the Santa Cecilia orchestra in the 1950s. \n\nIn 1994, the theatre became the home of the Teatro Stabile company of Rome, currently directed by Mario Martone. It offers a variety of programmes, some being large-scale productions, although more plays than music or opera are presented today.\n\nThe inside of the theatre is constructed of wood with six levels of boxes characterizing the design, and has been restored many times. It seats 696 people, including 344 in the stalls and with 40 boxes on five levels seating an additional 352.\n\nPlantamura notes that the theatre's acoustics were regarded as being excellent and that the architect who designed the La Fenice opera house in Venice, Gianantonio Selva, modeled his design after the Argentina.\nIn the novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexandre Dumas, the Teatro Argentina was the setting for an important scene during a performance of \"Parisina\" by Gaetano Donizetti.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

Along the way in the film, professors, legal scholars, and other people of interest are interviewed and offer their knowledge of specific eugenic topics. Also, brief explanations of the theory of eugenics, IQ tests and their relation to eugenics, and a history of eugenics in Alberta and Germany are provided. \nLeilani Muir was born July 15, 1944, in Calgary, Alberta and grew up on a farm. She experienced a rough childhood as her mother often beat her and didn’t provide her with regular meals. As a result, Leilani often went hungry and began to steal classmates' lunches at school. The teachers were quick to notice this and would often bring lunches for her. Teachers also began to question Leilani’s parents but in order to avoid answering these questions, her family would move away. Many neighbors did not even know Leilani existed as she was often locked away on the farm, hidden for no one to see.\n\nJust before Leilani’s 11th birthday, July 12, 1955, Leilani was taken to the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives (also called the Michener Center) located in Red Deer, Alberta. Leilani, not knowing at the time why she was placed in the centre, believed that she had been taken to an orphanage, since her mother had told her that she had never wanted a girl. During the next couple years Leilani played with the other girls, received a clean bed and clean clothes, was fed three meals a day, went to school and “kicked butt if she felt like it.”\nDuring her time at the Michener Center, Leilani was given a single IQ test in which she scored a 64. She was termed a moron and brought up before the Alberta Eugenics Board. They had asked her questions such as “At what age does a baby begin to walk and talk?” for roughly 5 minutes. Leilani had known the answer to this question as she had had a younger brother growing up. However, she still was deemed a danger of transmitting mental defects to progeny and incapable of intelligent parenthood. In 1957, at the age of 14 years, Leilani was told that she was undergoing a surgery to have her appendix removed. The surgeons and staff did not mention that she was being sterilized by having her fallopian tubes removed.\n\nIn 1965, at the age of 21, Leilani left the Michener Centre and began to support herself. She got married at the age of 24 and wanted to have a family. After going to the doctor, it was revealed that Leilani had been sterilized and could no longer have children. She married again, not having told her husband of her past, and when an adoption fell through, quickly became depressed.\n\nOn June 12, 1995 with the Honorable Madame Joanne B. Viet presiding, Leilani, sued the Alberta Government for wrongful sterilization and damages, with her lawyers Jon Faulds and Sandra Anderson. On January 25, 1996, Viet ruled in favor of Muir and awarded her $750,000 CAD in damages. Leilani wishes her story to be made known so that what happened to her and many others may never happen in Canada again.\n\n\n\"The Sterilization of Leilani Muir\" was produced by Graydon McCrea under the National Film Board of Canada in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1996.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "430976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=430976", "title": "Uncanny valley", "text": "Uncanny valley\n\nIn aesthetics, the uncanny valley is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept of the uncanny valley suggests humanoid objects which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit uncanny, or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers. \"Valley\" denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.\n\nExamples can be found in robotics, 3D computer animations, and lifelike dolls among others. With the increasing prevalence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation, the 'valley' has been cited in the popular press in reaction to the verisimilitude of the creation as it approaches indistinguishability from reality. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts an entity appearing almost human risks eliciting cold, eerie feelings in viewers.\n\nThe concept was identified by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori as \"bukimi no tani genshō\" () in 1970. The term was first translated as \"uncanny valley\" in the 1978 book \"Robots: Fact, Fiction, and Prediction\", written by Jasia Reichardt, thus forging an unintended link to Ernst Jentsch's concept of the \"uncanny\", introduced in a 1906 essay entitled \"On the Psychology of the Uncanny.\" Jentsch's conception was elaborated by Sigmund Freud in a 1919 essay entitled \"The Uncanny\" (\"Das Unheimliche\").\n\nMori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.\n\nThis area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a \"barely human\" and \"fully human\" entity is the uncanny valley. The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly \"strange\" to some human beings, produces a feeling of uncanniness, and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive human–robot interaction.\n\nA number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon:\n\nA series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces. Mathur MB & Reichling DB used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to \"wager\" on a robot's trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly-rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.\n\nOne study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face. The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin.\n\nAs of 2011, researchers at University of California, San Diego and California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology are measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley. In one study using fMRI, a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in parietal cortex, on both sides of the brain, specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain’s visual cortex that processes bodily movements with the section of the motor cortex thought to contain mirror neurons. The researchers say they saw, in essence, evidence of mismatch or perceptual conflict. The brain \"lit up\" when the human-like appearance of the android and its robotic motion \"didn’t compute\". Ayşe Pınar Saygın, an assistant professor from UCSD, says \"The brain doesn’t seem selectively tuned to either biological appearance or biological motion per se. What it seems to be doing is looking for its expectations to be met – for appearance and motion to be congruent.\"\n\nViewer perception of facial expression and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic, human-like characters intended for video games and film is being investigated by Tinwell et al., 2011. Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al. (2010) as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games. Building on the body of work already undertaken in android science, this research intends to build a conceptual framework of the uncanny valley using 3D characters generated in a real-time gaming engine. The goal is to analyze how cross-modal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny. Tinwell et al., 2011 have also introduced the notion of an \"unscalable\" uncanny wall that suggests that a viewer’s discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism. A summary of Angela Tinwell's research on the uncanny valley, psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in human-like virtual characters is provided in her book, \"The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation\" by CRC Press.\n\nA number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:\n\nA number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:\n\nAn effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in 1839:\nA similar \"uncanny valley\" effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with transhuman enhancements (cf. body modification), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it eyesight, muscle strength, or cognition. So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior, a negative reaction is unlikely, but once individuals supplant normal human variety, revulsion can be expected. However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, \"transhuman\" individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed \"posthuman\"), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley. Another example comes from \"pageant retouching\" photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like.\n\nDue to rapid advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence and affective computing, cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an \"Uncanny Valley of Mind\". Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology. Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research.\n\nA number of films that use computer-generated imagery to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or \"creepiness\" as a result of the characters looking too realistic. Examples include the following:\n\n\nIn the 2008 \"30 Rock\" episode \"Succession\", Frank Rossitano explains the uncanny valley concept, using a graph and \"Star Wars\" examples, to try to convince Tracy Jordan that his dream of creating a pornographic video game is impossible. He also references the computer-animated film \"The Polar Express.\"\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Together with Erin Belieu and Ann Townsend, VIDA was founded to address this in 2009. Marvin, Belieu, and Townsend resigned from the Board in 2015.\n\nThe current executive committee includes Melissa Febos, Amy King, Krista Manrique, Lynn Melnick, and Camille Rankine. \n\nThe current advisory board includes Jennifer Baumgardner, Soraya Chemaly, Jodi Picoult, Corinne Segal, Cheryl Strayed, Jennifer Weiner, and Jamia Wilson. \n\nThe Count began as a yearly inventory documenting the number of women and men who were published in, or had their books reviewed by, notable literary magazines. The Count was first performed, and the results published, in 2010. The collected data showed significantly lower numbers of women than men had been published or had their books reviewed by notable literary magazines.\n\nThe VIDA Count has revealed major imbalances at premiere publications both in the US and abroad. For example, the inaugural count determined \"The New York Review of Books\" covered a total of 306 books by men in 2010 and only 59 books by women and that \"The New York Times Book Review\" covered 524 books by men compared to 283 books written by women.\n\nThe first VIDA Count encompassed fifteen major journals and publications, plus 81 editions of three \"Best American\" anthologies—including an overall Count for each of the series’ three separate anthology imprints from the years 1986–2010—for a total of 94 journals, publications, and presses. VIDA expanded the scope of the Count in 2013, adding a new Larger Literary Landscape Count that examined dozens of historically well-established literary magazines. The 2014 VIDA Count results included the first Women of Color Count. Then, the following year VIDA further expanded to the Intersectional Count which included self-reported demographic information regarding gender, race and ethnicity, sexuality identity, age, education, and disability.\n\nResponses to The Count have been widely varied, and VIDA's pie charts have been reproduced in many periodicals and journals. \nThe conversation spurred by VIDA's Count has been explained in the \"Mother Jones.\" \n\nSome magazines, such as \"Granta,\" \"Tin House,\" and \"Boston Review\" have responded to The Count by making a conscious effort to remedy the gender disparity within their journals. Not only do the editors of these publications say that they are making these efforts, but the numbers of The Count show this to be the case.\n\nThe Count has also inspired some activism by individuals, such as Lorraine Berry who, in response to \"Harper's\" highly disparate numbers for three years running, published her letter \"Why I’m Canceling My Subscription: An Open Letter to ‘Harper’s’ from a Loyal Reader.\" In this letter, Berry details her history as a \"Harper's\" subscriber, including how much she has enjoyed reading it and how much she has been inspired by it. She then goes on to say how disheartened she was to see that \"Harper's\" has failed to do anything to correct the gender disparity in their publication, and that she will be cancelling her subscription as a result.\n\nSome magazines, such as \"The Coffin Factory,\" have openly and bluntly criticized VIDA for The Count, claiming that the questions asked by VIDA, and that the methods used to come to the conclusion that there is gender disparity in the publishing world are flawed. The most common criticism of VIDA's methods is that the numbers don't include information on how many submissions are made to each magazine by men and women respectively. The assertion is that if there is a disparity in the number of submissions by men versus women, then the presence of a disparity between published work by men versus women makes sense and is not evidence of gender bias. VIDA contributor and poet Danielle Pafunda responded to this concern in her article \"Why the Submissions Numbers Don't Count.\" Here, she details seven reasons why submissions numbers are ultimately irrelevant.\n\nVIDA has been publishing original content on its website since it began. In May 2012, edited by Rosebud Ben-Oni and Arisa White, VIDA: Women in Literary Arts launched their online forum and blog \"Her Kind,\" taking its name from an Anne Sexton poem. Her Kind retired in 2014 and archived its articles and essays on the organization's website, which continues to publish up-to-date content. In 2016, VIDA announced the \"VIDA Review\", a formal name for its web content, which features original interviews, articles, and essays from an intersectional feminist and womanist perspective on the literary world, publishing, education, and the arts. \"VIDA Review\" is edited by Amy King and the managing editor is Marcelle Heath. Columns include Reports from the Field; which calls out sexism, harassment and misogyny in the literary community; Curating with Compassion; VIDA Reads with Writers; and VIDA \"Voices & Views\", a video and audio podcast produced and hosted by Melissa Studdard.\n\nIn 2018, VIDA launched the #saferLIT initiative to create awareness and action in the literary world around the issues of sexual harassment, coercion, and assault. VIDA will create guidelines and develop a pledge that address conduct at conferences, residencies, workshops, panels, literary events, and with organizations, presses, and writing programs.\n\nCanadian Women in Literary Arts (CWILA) is \"an inclusive national literary organization for people who share feminist values and see the importance of strong and active female perspectives and presences within the Canadian literary landscape.\" It was founded by the Canadian poet and essayist Gillian Jerome. \n\nFollowing VIDA's lead, in 2012, CWILA began publishing their own version of The Count focusing on Canadian literary magazines.\n\nAustralia’s Stella Count began in 2012, modeled after the VIDA Count. In 2015 they expanded their count to include a survey, also modeled after the VIDA Count survey, which included self-reported demographic information on gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, and disability.\n"}

It was published by Broadside Books, a HarperCollins imprint. \n\n\"What the (Bleep) Just Happened?\" was a New York Times bestseller. In 2013, the book was re-released with an afterword and the title \"What the (Bleep) Just Happened... Again?: The Happy Warrior's Guide to the Great American Comeback\".\n\nAccording to Crowley, the book's name came from a conversation she had with her friend about the Obama administration:\n\nKirkus Reviews panned the book, writing that Crowley's \"vitriol corrodes any basis for rational discussion.\" The review suggested that readers pass on the book unless they are Fox News junkies, saying it is \"just a restatement of similar xenophobic, snarkily presented sentiment.\" A review by Lauren Weiner in \"The Weekly Standard\" said that Crowley's arguments were overstated and employed doggerel. Weiner wrote further that after \"over 300 pages of cynical quips, Nixonian realism, and declarations that 'the romanticism of the Left is over',\" Crowley declared herself a \"happy warrior\".\n\nFollowing the announcement by the Donald Trump administration in December 2016 that Crowley would be appointed to the U.S. National Security Council, reports surfaced of plagiarism in \"What the (Bleep) Just Happened?\". A January 7, 2017 report from \"CNN Money\" alleged numerous instances of plagiarism in the book, including over fifty incidents of copying from published sources without giving attribution. \n\nThe Trump transition team responded that:\n\nTwo days later, on January 9, 2017, a \"Politico\" report alleged a dozen instances of plagiarism in her 2000 Ph.D. dissertation on international relations at Columbia University. Crowley had previously been accused of plagiarism in 1999 related to a column on Richard Nixon she wrote for \"The Wall Street Journal\" containing \"striking similarities\" (according to the \"Journal\") with a piece written eleven years earlier by Paul Johnson. The next day, HarperCollins announced that \"\"What the (Bleep) Just Happened?\", which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material.\"\n"}

At that time the brand produced 2 million watches per year.\n\nHaving been owned by Seiko Watch Corporation of Japan since 1988, Yema returns to French hands in 2004 through a buyout by Louis Eric Beckensteiner. \n\nIn 2009 Yema is acquired by the French watchmaker group Montres Ambre based in Morteau.\n\nHenry Louis Belmont, student of the National Watchmaking School of Besançon and major of his promotion in 1931, created 1948 his own watchmaking company under the name Yema. \n\nIn 1963 Yema launches the very first Yema Superman, a watch initially developed for diving professionals. \n\nMany variations were then produced by Yema for this model of French manufacture in order to reach a wider audience, as for example the famous 53.00.16 and its black dial or the 24.11.17 with its blue Iridescent dial and its second hand \"Pelle\".\n\nIn 1966, the first Yema Yachtingraf is launched, a watch especially designed for sailors. This automatic chronograph (Valjoux movement), waterproof to 200 meters, was very popular among French yachting amateurs in the 60's and the 70's. \n\nStart of 1970 Yema became official supplier of the French Sailing Federation (\"Fédération Française de Yachting à Voile\") and equipped the French National team who participated to 1972 Olympic Games. \n\nSix different versions of Yema Yachtingraf model were crafted over the years. \n\nThe first Yema Rallygraf model was also born in 1966, a watch appreciated by car racing amateurs. One of these chronographs was worn by Formula One Champion Mario Andretti.\n\nOn June 24, 1982, for the first time a French astronaut, Jean-Loup Chrétien, flew from the Baikonour base for a 10-day trip into space. On his wrist he wears the very first French watch to leave for the space: the Yema Spationaute I.\n\nOn June 17, 1985, the Discovery shuttle took off with Patrick Baudry and his Yema Spationaute II on mission STS-51G (First Franco-American Orbital Flight).\n\nOn November 26, 1988, Jean Loup Chrétien goes on a mission to MIR Space Station wering a Yema Spationaute III.\nIn May 1986, Yema joined forces with French physician and explorator Jean-Louis Etienne to cross the North Pole. The Yema North Pole watch, created especially for the occasion, accompanied the adventurer during his 800 km solo trip to the North Pole. Very resistant to cold thanks to its titanium case, this model also had a system avoiding the magnetic north. The four cardinal points were determined according to the position of the sun, with the local sun's time as a reference point.\n\nAfter 4 years of research & development, Yema designs a new proprietary watch movement: the MBP 1000. Equipped with a bidirectional oscillating mass mounted on ball bearings, they allow a fast reassembly and a power reserve of 40 hours. This resulted in a gain of efficiency but also precision, provided by a regulator whose balance beats at a frequency of 28,800 alternations per hour. Stacking a total of 31 rubies including 2 located at the ends of the axis of the barrel, this technical design effectively reduces the friction generally observed at this element following the mechanical movements.\n\nThe mission on which the 10th French astronaut went into the space was called Proxima, in tribute to the nearest star of our sun, which perpetuates the French tradition of baptising the missions of astronauts by the name of a star or a constellation. In 2017, Yema and CNES (the French Space Agency) worked once again together to create a brand new model in honour of this new space mission, the Yema Spacegraf.\n\n"}
