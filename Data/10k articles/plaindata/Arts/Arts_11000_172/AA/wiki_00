{"id": "39466082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39466082", "title": "Adina Bar-On", "text": "Adina Bar-On\n\nAdina Bar-On (), born December 19, 1951, in Kibbutz Kfar Blum, Israel, is a pioneer performance artist, considered to be the first performance artist in Israel.\n\nActive for four decades, Bar-On's work continuously explores the relationship between identity and presence, and most importantly \"conflict of identity and conflicting identities\". Her performances consist of unique use of human body and voice expression, close to modern dance and experimental sound techniques. Adina's work emphasizes strong connection of art and non-structural ethics of behavior, and introduces it by activating audience's high levels of attention and consciousness.\n\nBar-On began her first performances in the early 1973 as a third year student at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. Bar-On is now a performance art teacher at Bezalel Academy's Visual Arts Department. Bar-On studied to become a painter, although was deeply involved in conceptual art movement. Her early performances took place when the notion of \"performance\" as a medium of art expression was not yet known in Israel. Her first performances were still called \"shows\"and the invitations for these events were only saying her name, time and place of the event. Those days most art critics considered performance to be a junk-art, this genre of art was not understood nor acknowledged by art historians and critics.\n\nAfter the first performance at the courtyard of Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem, Bar-On was asked to stop doing this kind of things and academy professors called a school psychologist to examine the performer and to express professional opinion about the work. After the second performance, \"Birds\" (June–July 1973), Adina received a warning letter from the directors on te Academy, informing that if she wants to continue to study she has to go back to conventional mediums.\n\nBar-On's parents were Zionist American Jews who came to Israel at the beginning of this state, to set a country for a free nation to live in their own state (not in a ghetto in other nations' state). They did not come from Europe and did not escape from after-Holocaust Germany or Eastern Europe, but from free country of USA. Adina Bar-On was born in kibbutz, and after some years in Israel went to America to go to secondary school. She later conceptualized her identity status in a talk \"Is my Performance an Israeli Culture Manifestation?\" in 2011 at Dar al- Kalima College of Art, Bethlehem.\n\nAt the Bezalel Academy (then in the center of Jerusalem, now on the Mount Scopus) Adina was focused on painting and studied conceptual art, which was becoming the most important approach in contemporary practice. During the seventies she was interested mostly in new forms of communication art and her work was influenced by American happenings, Joseph Beuys, Tadeusz Kantor, Jerzy Grotowski, the new theater (as defined by Michael Kirby), Vito Acconci.\n\nBar-On found inspiration for her aesthetics in film, precisely in Giulietta Masina's actors work, as well as in the new manner introduced by Fellini, Antonioni and Godard of seeing film-life (art-life) relationship problem.\nShe studied dance for some time and experimented with mime (an episode in Swiss mime actor and clown Dimitri in 1976 at the Dimitri School of Theatre, Vercio, Switzerland).\n\nDuring these years Adina worked as therapeutist, social worker, gave courses for school art teachers, as well as performed in many different contexts: at the industry for workers, old people's houses, nurseries, private homes.\nHer work was described as \"strong\" and \"subtle\" at the same time (her name, \"Adina Bar-On\", in Hebrew means \"delicate with power\") and some people recognized her new aesthetics, exceptional way of creating art as a means of human communication.\n\nShe was 23 years old when she decided to complete her academic diploma at the Bezalel despite the professors' \"advice\" to quit making performances, and she prepared a special, highly conceptual photographic work (black and white photographs of her color, post-expressionist paintings hung on the walls of a middle class conservative Israeli living room of her mother's house). This work already signaled some of the subjects she will be exploring later: public and private, black-and-white and color, representation and performance.\n\nIn 1974 Adina Bar-On married Daniel Davis, a potter and author of Judaica art, with whom she later often worked on some of her performances (ex. A Woman of the Pots), and made her private life a subject of the art work. Their children, Shahar Davis and Yasmin Davis, were also engaged in the preparation of \"Woman of the Pots\". \nBar-On wrote in 2000 about a necessity and ethical motivation of her work: \"I felt that art was losing its connection with what characterizes the human being, the ability to connect intellect with emotions\".\n\nAdina's first performance took place in the plaza of old Bezalel Academy building, in early May 1973. Going beyond contemporary aesthetics, risking social position and artistic status, extending possibilities of communication - all these interpretations of Adina Bar-On's early performance places it on the border between avant-garde art and post-artistic performance art practice. An incident of being mistaken for a mentally ill by Academy professors (other artists, see: section \"Controversy\"), showed Bar-On that her performance was indeed touching a deep level of human psyche of the audience and caused an aesthetic shock of a certain kind. At the time, most of the interpretations of art history, even aware of anti-psychiatric movement in Europe, psychoanalytical writings about Antonin Artaud, experience with surrealism, counterculture movement, Beuys's idea of social sculpture etc., were only taken intellectually, and misunderstood. Adina's experiment was recognized by the audience: \"Very, very strong. (...) I am stired by the approach which I think should guide all of us - to touch the truth, and not in all kinds of formal, aesthetic, etc., pseudo-intellectiuallism. I don't know what art is, for I've heard from \"professional connoisseurs\" that this is not art. ( ... ) And I don't care if it is or it is not if art does touch upon these problems but in a different way that enables distance, form, material, causality, inner logic (formal as well).\" (Fragments of a letter Adina Bar-On received after the performance).\n\nIn this performance was prepared in collaboration with Ronit Land (Israeli dancer and choreographer, disciple of Merce Cunningham and Anna Halprin) as movement consultant. It was performed at The Israel Museum of Art, Jerusalem, as well as at the Tel-Hai '80, a contemporary art event.\n\nWorking in a collaboration with Ronit Land, this time Bar-On prepared a theatrical performance, moving on the edge of modern dance, theatre expression and performance art. Daniel Davis's environmental design was introduced. The premiere took place at Tel Hai, 83, Contemporary Art Event.\n\n\"Getting high\" as a goal of theater and ritual throughout the ages, the idea of inexpressible, were motifs of this six scenes of movement-play performance. Musical part of the performance involved early computer-based composition (using 3 connected synthesiser) composed by Yossi Marchaim and wordless vocalization of Adina and Robert Flantz.\n\nOne of Bar-On's masterpieces, combining image, movement/dance and voice interplay. Originally performed In 1990 performance was filmed by Naomi Perlov and screened at Israel Museum. Playing with an important Israeli iconographical motive, \"Woman of the Pots\" was a most important collaboration with Daniel Davis.\n\nAt this phase of Bar-On's development an important methodological change was: leaving art as conceptual art, and leading towards contextual art (everyday life questions raised to be subjects of the art). Saying that she left \"the Acconci Vito Acconci dilemma\" in performance art, Bar-On emphasised the need for new approach in performance art, where strong relations between art and life should be introduced when talking about live-art paradigm.\n\nPerformed in The Tel Aviv Museum of Art Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Video work for the performance was prepared by Alon Eilat.\nBased on an experimental voicework (recorded and mastered later in ToTamTo Studios, Warsaw), \"Sacrifice\" is a turning point in Bar-On's aesthetics and an example of highly sophisticated work using voice, body and image of the body. Voice is a leading creative element of not only expressing, but first of all transforming emotions (like pain) in the work of art.\n\nA documentary film was made from the performance in Quimper, France, witnessing Adina's visit at the Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper.\n\nSubtle level of communication is crucial for Bar-On's performances, working with \"quantum level\" of emotions. Laszlo Beke (director of Research Institute of Art History, Hungarian Academy of Science) wrote on \"Sacrifice\": \"At the beginning after an intensive internal meditation she faced the audience (or one of its members) and waited, doing nothing, until this nothing (\"tense nothing\") became nearly unendurable. This is a kind of address that prepares the audience mentally and spiritually for the reception of forthcoming events\".\n\n\"I'm engaged in tikkun, not from above, but in a language that everybody understands. Empathy to yourself. If you don't love and it's difficult for you now, at least have empathy.\"- wrote Bar-On in her autobiographical essay \"A Soliloquy\". \"Sacrificed was performed for ten years in places including the Kuhsthalle, Budapest, Catalyst Arts Gallery: Belfast, Para/Site Art Space: Hong-Kong, Chasama Arts Space: New York.\n\nAs Bar-On described it later: \"Rest is a paraphrase of a popular and old Israeli lullaby that has become mythological – \"Rest For The Weary\". In the Shopping Mall, Opera House Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center and Central Bus Station suspended in a vertical elevated bed, way above the heads of passers by, I move as if in a state of sleep. As in a dream, out of the subconscious, I create images by my movement and my own vocal adaptation of the old Jewish Pioneer’s song.\n\nPlacing myself in these locations I had become a provocation but more than that an image of a plea or a cry for time-out, for rest, detached from ideological idioms\".\n\nIn \"About Love\" (close to previous \"Vision\") the performer was the creator of the image, and at the same time emanating certain \"aura\", direct communication with the audience, often felt as intervention in an intimate level of viewer's psyche, although he/she was a stranger or a passer-by. This performance was described by Bar-On's biographer, Idit Porat, as \"transforming suffering into beauty\".\n\nIn discussing this phase of her performance history, Adina has said: \"II want to put questions of emotion on the pyre. I think this is an acute issue. I think it is what is lacking, not alienated discussions.\"\nThe form of Bar-On's performances always explored delicacy, subtlety of meaning, allusions, conxeptualism, intellectual poetry, intellectual and spiritual signals going beyond symbolic levels of interpretation. In 2005, after a work \"Dreamy\", As Bar-On described it: \"Emotions can be a material, it is my material. What do people usually do with emotions?\"\n\nThis site-specific performance is structured to be a journey or a walk through urban space, where Bar-On, dressed in red, is a guide or a leader. Playing with this motif of a woman leadership and multiple meanings of space when observed through artist's eyes, mostly the borders, no-mans land's, areas of former conflicts or places of \"hidden history\" to be reveiled.\n\n\"Dispositions\" were performed in Nachshon, Israel; Hong-Kong; Quimper, France; Helsinki, Finland; Toronto, Canada; Belfast, Northern Ireland, Oswiecim (city of Auschwitz) and Lublin, Poland.\n\nAfter Daniel Davis's death in 2010, the artist sharpened her massage and became more direct in performance art communication process. Making performances for no more than 30 people, she focused on building strong mental contact with each spectator/witness through all channels of human expression, but now transgressing symbolism and conceptual methods. This almost \"mystical strategy\", apophatic method is now extending existentialist implications of Bar-On's art and use of pre-expressive level in performance.\n\nTo create new performances in the mid-2010s, Bar-On merged everyday life situation with social symbolism, religious iconography, dream visions and mass media images. From this time Israeli and Palestinian dialogue is often a subject of the artist's work, as well as is Bar-On's own private life themes which are transported into performance art; ex. widows of the war on both sides of the conflict - Adina Bar-On's husband, Daniel Davis, died of brain tumour caused by military service in the Israeli Army. For five years he was able to express himself only by saying \"Lo!\" (\"No!\" in Hebrew).\n\nStarting from early performances shown at the time of Yom Kippur War in 1973, through 1989 when Bar-On conducted a workshop at \"The Peace Frontier. International Symposium for Sculpture and Painting\", the performer is active in transporting her main subject of art - \"conflict of identity and conflicting identities\" - into constant existential practice.\n\nEngaged in politics of the body, social role and gender from the very beginnings of her career in the 1970s, give Adina Bar-On a significant (although unconventional) role in feminist art.\n\nBar-On is a close friend of major performance artists and thinkers: Jan Swidzinski, Zbigniew Warpechowski, Boris Nieslony, Marlyn Arsem, with whom she is often meeting on art festivals and developed an informal group of performance artists who create contextual art in uncompromising way, with no support of the \"art world\" establishment, yet recognized and respected by its representatives. Her intent on working on a most fundamental level of human communication changed Bar-On's relationships with other artists and non-artists into live-art itself.\n\nAs a performer Bar-On presented her work on the most important performance art festivals in the world, including Blurr, Biennale of Performance Art: Jaffa/Tel-Aviv (many times under curatorship of Sergio Edelstein), Israel, In the Context of Art/ Differences: Warsaw, Interaction Festival: Piotrków Trybunalski, Asiatopia International Performance Festival; Bangkok, Social Art Forum: Paris, Epipederme / Performance Art event, Lisbon, Portugal, Tupada Action and Media Art, 2009/The 6th Tupada International Visual Performance Festival; Manila, Philippines, Asiatopia, International Performance Art Festival; Bangkok, Chiangmai, Thailand, Navinki 2001, Performance-Art Festival: Minsk, Belarus, International Performance Art Festival, \"Castle of Imagination\": Ustka-Slupsk, Poland, Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper, France, The 5th Asian Performance Art Series + Shinshu Summer Seminar 2000: Macau, Hong-Kong, and Negoya, Tokyo, Nagano in Japan, and many others.\n\nEarly in her career Adina Bar-On started to teach and worked on various art educational projects focused on the language of visual communication and live-art. She has been giving numerous workshops in Israel (including Tel Aviv University, Kalisher Art School, Camera Obscura School of Art, School of Visual Theater Jerusalem, el-Hai College, Omanut La'am Art Education Organization, Holon School For The Education of Technology, Dar al- Kalima College of Art, The Academy od Dance and Music Jerusalem, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Yasmin Goder Dance Group) as well as around the world as visiting professor: at the Wroclaw Art Academy, Oswiecim Jewish Center (at the Oświęcim Synagogue, Mobius Artists Group, Performance Art Conference: Essen, Braunschweig University/ Department of Fine Arts, Germany, and workshop leader: Arsenal Gallery in Bialystok, Wei Wei Dance Company, Hong Kong).\n\nOne of recent major projects, such as \"Aesthetics and Bias\" involve institutions such as Bezalel Academy, Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Fine Arts in Wrocław, University of Fine Arts in Poznań, Warsaw Academy, Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, to work together in a process of developing new aesthetics.\n\nStarting with the performance based film \"A Woman of the Pots\", Bar-On prepared a number of films and video installation which are important for understanding her approach to the art: \"Portrait\" (1999), \"View\" (2001) (as an aftermath of a performance under the same name), \"Room\" and \"Motherland\" (both in 2001). \nA relationship between live-art and film/video image was already explored in \"Breath\" (1994) and possibly this performance leaves a trace of what the artist thinks about film representation of live-art.\n\nBar-On played an important role in Amos Gitai 1990 film \"Birth of a Golem\" (Naissance d'un golem: Carnet de notes), giving an expressive improvised performance in the movie, and appearing on a screen in the moment when the story of a Golem is told. She also helped to direct Annie Lennox in her role as Golem's figure in the cave scene.\n\nAdina Bar-On's full documentation of work on film in now hosted by The Art of Action Archives, organization focused on anthropological research and preservation of performance art masterpieces.\n\nDuring the years of teaching about visual communication, Bar-On managed to contact young artists of different sensitivity and working on future aesthetics of a new era. Still not theoretically described nor defined aesthetics of Bar-On is an inspiration for new generation of artists.\n\n\nPublishers: Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishing House Ltd, Herzliya Museum of Art 2001. .\n\n\n\n"}

The film is explicit in its exploration of sexual relationships.\n\nIt is a co-production between Innocent Pictures and Lars von Trier's Zentropa Productions, and is the third of Zentropa's sex films for women, following \"Constance\" (1998) and \"Pink Prison\" (1999). All three films were based on the Puzzy Power Manifesto developed by Zentropa in 1997.\n\n\"All About Anna\" tells the story of Anna (Gry Bay), a single woman who seeks to maintain an active sex life while staying clear of emotional involvement, after having been jilted by the love of her life, Johan (Mark Stevens). She has a relationship with Frank (Thomas Raft), but refuses to let him move in with her. When Johan shows up again after five years absence, she starts wondering how much longer she can maintain her emotional independence, and if that is what she wants. She has sex with him, loses his telephone number and cannot contact him. She ends her affair with Frank and when she is offered a job as costume designer in a French theatre, she decides to move to Paris. She leaves her flat to her flatmate Camilla (Eileen Daly) who asks her permission to rent out the now empty room to a friend of hers. This friend turns out to be Johan, and Anna meets him as she leaves for Paris, where the local stage actors Pierre (Morten Schelbech) and Sophie (Ovidie) offer new amorous temptations, but she worries about Johan finding a new love. In the end she returns to Copenhagen and, after mistakenly thinking that Johan has been unfaithful to her, she faces her fears of commitment and is reunited with Johan.\n\nThe film was originally released in November 2005 on a Scandinavian 3-disc DVD.

{"id": "27316335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27316335", "title": "Anne Whateley", "text": "Anne Whateley\n\nAnne Whateley is the name given to a woman who is sometimes supposed to have been the intended wife of William Shakespeare before he married Anne Hathaway. Most scholars believe that Whateley never existed, and that her name in a document concerning Shakespeare's marriage is merely a clerical error. However, several writers on Shakespeare have taken the view that she was a real rival to Hathaway for Shakespeare's hand. She has also appeared in imaginative literature on Shakespeare and in Shakespeare authorship speculations. Shakespeare's biographer Russell A. Fraser describes her as \"a ghost\", \"haunting the edges of Shakespeare's story\". She has also been called \"the first of the Shakespearean Dark Ladies\".\n\nWhateley's existence has been deduced from an entry in the Episcopal register at Worcester which states in Latin \"Anno Domini 1582...Novembris...27 die eiusdem mensis. Item eodem die supradicto emanavit Licentia inter Wm Shaxpere et Annam Whateley de Temple Grafton.\" The entry states that a marriage licence has been issued to Shakespeare and Anne Whateley to marry in the village of Temple Grafton. The day afterwards, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from Stratford-upon-Avon, signed a surety of £40 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of \"William Shagspere and Anne Hathwey\".\n\nThe entry in the register was discovered in the late nineteenth century by Reverend T.P. Wadley. Various explanations were offered. Initially it was assumed that Whateley was an alternative surname for Anne Hathaway herself. Wadley believed that it was probably an alias, used by Hathaway in order to keep the date of the marriage secret to obscure the fact that she was already pregnant. Another suggestion was that Anne Hathaway might legitimately have used the name, either because her father Richard Hathaway was in fact her step-father, her mother having previously been married to a man called Whateley, or because Anne herself may have previously been married to a man named Whateley. None of these suggestions gained support, since they contradicted other existing evidence.\nThe Whateley note is discussed in Sidney Lee's 1898 book \"A Life of William Shakespeare\". Lee argues that the \"William Shakespeare\" who is engaged to Whateley is probably a different person from the playwright, as there were \"numerous William Shakespeares, who abounded in the diocese of Worcester\". In 1905 Joseph William Gray in \"Shakespeare's Marriage\" gave a detailed argument for clerical error due to the existence of lawsuits involving Whateleys that were being written up by the same scribe. However in 1909 Frank Harris in his book \"The Man Shakespeare\" ignored Gray's argument and dismissed Lee's suggestion that there were two William Shakespeares as wildly implausible. He insisted that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two separate women. He intended to marry Anne Whateley, but, when this became known, he was immediately forced by Anne Hathaway's family to marry their relative, since he had already made her pregnant. Harris believed that Shakespeare despised his wife, and that his forced marriage was the spur to his creative work:\n\nIf Shakespeare had married Anne Whately he might never have gone to London or written a play. Shakespeare's hatred of his wife and his regret for having married her were alike foolish. Our brains are seldom the wisest part of us. It was well that he made love to Anne Hathaway; well, too, that he was forced to marry her; well, finally, that he should desert her. I am sorry he treated her badly and left her unsupplied with money; that was needlessly cruel; but it is just the kindliest men who have these extraordinary lapses; Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless.\n\nSome biographers, notably Ivor Brown and Anthony Burgess, followed Harris' lead, portraying Whateley as Shakespeare's true love. Brown argued that she was the Dark Lady of the sonnets. In 1970 Burgess wrote,\nIt is reasonable to believe that Will wished to marry a girl named Anne Whateley. The name is common enough in the Midlands and is even attached to a four-star hotel in Horse Fair, Banbury. Her father may have been a friend of John Shakespeare's, he may have sold kidskin cheap, there are various reasons why the Shakespeares and the Whateleys, or their nubile children, might become friendly. Sent on skin-buying errands to Temple Grafton, Will could have fallen for a comely daughter, sweet as May and shy as a fawn. He was eighteen and highly susceptible. Knowing something about girls, he would know that this was the real thing. Something, perhaps, quite different from what he felt about Mistress Hathaway of Shottery. But why, attempting to marry Anne Whateley, had he put himself in the position of having to marry the other Anne? I suggest that, to use the crude but convenient properties of the old women's-magazine morality-stories, he was exercised by love for the one and lust for the other.\n\nAccording to Stanley Wells in the \"Oxford Companion to Shakespeare\", most modern scholars take the same view as Gray, that the name Whateley was \"almost certainly the result of clerical error\". It may have arisen because the clerk was also recording information about a tithe appeal by a vicar, which included a reference to a person named Whateley. Though there was a Whateley family in the area, no independent evidence has ever been found of the existence of an Anne Whateley in Temple Grafton or anywhere else nearby. As for Lee's claim that there were \"numerous\" other William Shakespeares in the diocese, later researchers have found no surviving records of any other William Shakespeares of marriageable age in the diocese of Worcester.\n\nAfter Harris's initial argument a number of imaginative claims were made about Anne Whateley, most dramatically that she was the true author of Shakespeare's works. This argument was made by William Ross in his book \"The Story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere\" (1939), in which he asserted that Whateley was a nun who was his \"lover and consort in their spiritual union\". She was born in 1561, the daughter of the well-known seafarer Anthony Jenkinson. She was living a secluded life among the nuns of the Order of St. Clare when she met Shakespeare. They fell in love, and Anne was about to leave the order to marry him when Hathaway revealed her pregnancy. Her authorship can be deduced from the sonnets, which she wrote as gifts to Shakespeare. They describe the history of her spiritual relationship with him. Hathaway is the Dark Lady of the sonnets, while Shakespeare himself is the Fair Youth. Their intimate friendship continued after his marriage to Hathaway; its deepening spirituality is explored in the later sonnets. Eventually the friendship was broken up by Hathaway's jealousy, and Shakespeare left for London. She wrote \"A Lover's Complaint\", which was appended to the sonnets, to express Anne Hathaway's point of view.\n\nWhateley wished to dedicate the sonnets to Shakespeare, but wrote the dedication to Mr W.H. instead of \"W.S\", so that the identity of her lost love should remain mysterious. \"W.H\" was preferred because it was the initials of both her own surname and Hathaway's, implying that Shakespeare was, in a sense, both their husbands: Mr W and Mr H. According to Ross, \"the initials therefore represent all three, and no better selection was possible\". She gave him the full collection when he left for London, which explains the dedication to the \"well-wishing adventurer in setting forth\". She later wrote \"The Phoenix and the Turtle\" to commemorate their spiritual union.\n\nRoss emphasises that his discovery removes all suggestion of homoeroticism from the sonnets, and thus \"the taint of perversion, so odious to all lovers of Shakespeare, has been dissipated\". He has very little to say about the plays, but states that Whateley probably wrote Shakespeare's plays to help him make a living. Nevertheless he describes the playwriting as a \"collaboration\", though Shakespeare's role was probably \"passive\". Ross portrays Shakespeare himself as a talented writer, a worthy assistant to Whateley's \"genius\". After Anne's death he wrote \"The Twenty-First and Last Book of the Ocean, to Cynthia\", hitherto attributed to Walter Raleigh.\n\nRoss argues that the sonnets reveal that Whateley also knew Edmund Spenser and helped him to write \"The Shepherd's Calendar\". She was also the sole author of \"The Faerie Queene\" and \"Amoretti\". In the 1580s she met and helped Michael Drayton and Philip Sidney, probably inspiring the sonnet revival of the period. The poem \"Hero and Leander\", usually attributed to Christopher Marlowe, describes her relationship with Shakespeare. She also wrote Marlowe's plays. After her death in 1600 her unpublished works were published in the book \"Poetical Rhapsody\", attributed to \"A.W.\"\n\nRoss's speculations were developed by his friend W.J. Fraser Hutcheson in his book \"Shakespeare's Other Anne\" (1950). He follows Ross's claim that Whateley's father was Jenkinson, adding that Whateley's real name was Elizabeth Anne Beck and that her mother was an Anne Beck who died in childbirth. She used the name Whateley because of the household in which she grew up. Falling in love with Shakespeare, she was broken-hearted when he married Hathaway. She fled to Italy, where she acquired the knowledge that would later be used in Shakespeare's Italian plays. Many of her works were published under the name \"Ignotus\". Hutcheson also claims to have identified a portrait of Whateley, the work of Sofonisba Anguissola, the several copies of which attest to the esteem in which she was held. Hutcheson suggests that Whateley is portrayed as Rosalind and other female characters in Shakespeare's plays. While insisting that she inspired the plays, he does not explicitly assert that she wrote them.\n\nNeither Ross nor Hutcheson provide documentary evidence to support their theories. Ross relies on his readings of the poems while Hutcheson finds coded messages in texts and images. The portrait he identifies as Whateley is generally believed to depict the courtier and poet Girolamo Casio. It is attributed to Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio, rather than Anguissola, and its likely depiction of Casio was accepted long before he wrote the book.\n\nProponents of other alternative authorship theories have also used Frank Harris' version of the Anne Whateley story, typically to portray Shakespeare as a duplicitous scapegrace, traits which are supposed to disqualify him as an author of great poetry. Robert Frazer, who believed that The Earl of Derby wrote the canon, argued that Shakespeare actually married Whateley, not Hathaway.\n\nAnne has also appeared in imaginative literature about Shakespeare, typically portrayed as Shakespeare's true love, in contrast to a less appealing Anne Hathaway. Anne appears in Hubert Osborne's play \"The Good Men Do\" (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne Hathaway and Anne Whateley. Hathaway is depicted as viciously shrewish and spiteful, in contrast to her noble-minded former rival. Both women portray Shakespeare's life as an actor and playwright as morally degrading, Whateley insisting that he would have been saved from this shameful profession had he married her. Ivor Brown also published a play, \"William's Other Anne\" (1947) in which Shakespeare returns from London to meet Anne Whateley eight years after their broken engagement, just as Anne is about to marry a priggish schoolmaster. Shakespeare and Anne are reconciled, and Shakespeare saves his father from bankruptcy at the hands of Anne's vengeful mother. The play was broadcast on BBC television in 1953 starring Irene Worth as Anne and John Gregson as Shakespeare.\n\nWhateley is mentioned in \"Late Mister Shakespeare\" (1998) by Robert Nye, a novel in which an elderly actor who knew Shakespeare in his youth reconstructs the poet's life. He speculates about whether or not she actually existed. She also appears in Graeme Johnstone's novel \"The Playmakers\" (2005), in which she is portrayed as an innocent girl with a \"sweet nature\", \"perfect figure, perfect teeth...perfectly shaped nose, clear blue eyes and creamy skin\". She is devastated by the discovery that her beloved William has made Hathaway pregnant. She and William are soulmates who plan to work together to improve William's father's leather-making business. Anne hangs herself with a leather rope after the manipulative Hathaway forces Shakespeare to abandon her. The image of his lost love haunts Shakespeare throughout his life. He leaves for London to become a front man for Christopher Marlowe's playwriting. He eventually finds a new love who is the mirror image of Whateley.\n\nLaurie Lawlor's novel \"The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare\" (2006) depicts a teenage Shakespeare who seduces willing girls with his wit and charm. He is asked by his friend Richard Field to help him woo the beautiful and devout Anne Whateley, but falls in love with her himself. He tries to reform his ways to become worthy of her, but cannot resist his sexual urges, getting Hathaway pregnant.\n\nIn Karen Harper's novel \"Mistress Shakespeare\" (2008) Anne Whateley is the central character. She is once more portrayed as Shakespeare's true love. She narrates the story of her life as the dusky-skinned daughter of a Stratford businessman and an Italian acrobat. She and Shakespeare are married in a \"handfast\" ceremony which is known only to them. In London she carries on a secret parallel marriage with him while Hathaway and her children stay in Stratford. She inspires many of his works and shares his feelings, triumphs and fears.\n"}

Sceptics, however, have accepted Julia Kristeva's warning about the Utopian, indeed narcissistic perils of attempting to circumvent society, and the cultural sphere, by regressing to a phantasisised merger with the archaic, undifferentiated mother.

{"id": "2438285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2438285", "title": "Crux gemmata", "text": "Crux gemmata\n\nA crux gemmata (Latin for: jewelled cross) is a form of cross typical of Early Christian and Early Medieval art, where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally decorated with jewels. In an actual cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the Crucifixion of Jesus or other subjects.\n\nExamples in metalwork are the Cross of Justin II (6th century, in the Vatican Museums), the 'crumpled cross' in the Staffordshire Hoard (8th century), the Cross of Lothair (10th century, Aachen Cathedral Treasury), the Iberian Cross of the Angels and Victory Cross, and the Cross of Cong (1120s?, National Museum of Ireland).\n\nIn the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods, many objects of great significance, such as reliquaries, were studded with jewels in a style that in recent centuries has been restricted to crowns and other coronation regalia and small pieces of jewellery. In the case of the cross, such decorative embellishment was especially common, and the jewelled cross is a specific type that was represented in paint, mosaic, carved ivory and other media. The cross very often has splayed ends to its arms, but the proportions of the vertical axis to the horizontal one depends entirely on the needs of the composition, and varies greatly. Pendilia, or hanging jewels or ornaments, may hang from the arms, especially the letters alpha and omega shaped in gold. The motif is first seen in a sarcophagus fragment from the late 4th century; the splayed ends of the arms are present from the earliest examples.\nIn depictions of the cross, such as that in the mosaic in Santa Pudenziana, Rome (384–9), the jewelled cross stands on a hill or mound with a backdrop of a panoramic view representing Jerusalem, with the cross itself representing the New Jerusalem or \"heavenly city\". The jewelled cross also served as a symbol of the Christian version of the Tree of Life, especially when the arms are shown putting out shoots from their corners. The Staffordshire Hoard 'crumpled cross' has vine leaves showing at the corners and represents Jesus the vine. It is sometimes shown on a mound representing paradise, with four rivers flowing down it (the four rivers were understood as representing the Four Gospels); a stepped base represents the hill in actual crosses or more confined depictions. The link of the cross generally with the Tree of Life appears frequently in the hymns of Venantius Fortunatus. Sharp (2016) has shown the interlace on the front of the Staffordshire Hoard cross corresponds with the river or tree of life described in Revelation 22. 1-2.\n\nFor much of the period, a large jewelled cross is recorded as decorating the presumed site of the Crucifixion, around which the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had been built. It was presented by the Eastern Emperor Theodosius II (reigned 408–450). The crux gemmata first appears after what was believed to be the finding of the True Cross by the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine in the early 4th century, when interest in the cross greatly increased. The paradox whereby the instrument of execution is rendered the vehicle of Christ's triumph in the Resurrection remains to the present day a central theme in Christian devotion, and the jewelled cross was one of its first visual manifestations.\n\nAlthough it is clear that the cross was associated with Christians from a very early period, and the sign of the cross was made by Christians, it is rarely seen in the earliest Christian art, such as that in the Catacombs of Rome, where there are only about 20 crosses, though the anchor, which appears more commonly, was a disguised cross symbol. There was resistance to representations of the cross with the body of Christ on it, a practice that did not begin until the 5th century, becoming more common in the 6th.\n\nOne of the earliest representations of a Crucifixion scene rather oddly shows the three crosses of the gospel accounts, with the two thieves hanging in place on theirs, but with Christ standing at the foot of his. The fierce Christological disputes of the period saw the Monophysites, who rejected the human nature of Christ, objecting to the depiction of his body on the cross, and this influenced the use of the empty cross, especially in Byzantine-controlled areas such as Ravenna, where several of the Emperors had Monophysite sympathies. It was the Nestorians, another heretical force of the opposite persuasion, who helped to popularize images of Christ on the cross.\n\nIn so-called \"mystical\" images, such as the apse mosaic at the Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna (549), the jewelled cross stands specifically as a symbol for Christ. A poem by St Paulinus of Nola allows a reconstruction of a mosaic apse he had (as bishop) commissioned in the basilica of St Felix of Nola at Cimitile in the early 5th century. The whole Trinity was shown, represented by a Hand of God for God the Father at the top, above a large crux gemmata with stars in a circular frame, so very similar to Sant' Apollinare in Classe, and below that a dove for the Holy Spirit. At the bottom of the semi-dome were twelve lambs, six on each side, with a haloed Lamb of God on a raised hillock in the centre, looking up. The bottom of the mosaic at Santa Pudenziana in Rome originally also had a bottom level with this.\n\nThe crux gemmata is commonly seen on coins, often held by a figure of Victory, especially in the Eastern Empire. Another common Byzantine coin type shows a cross with a stepped base, which should be understood as a \"crux gemmata\" even though scale does not normally allow any indication of gems.\n\nContrary to the assertion of Dan Brown in \"The Da Vinci Code\", it is not especially typical for a cross to have thirteen gems, though when one does, it probably does symbolize Christ and His twelve apostles. The apse mosaic in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls (c. 1220) has an example with thirteen jewels, but examples from the first millennium generally have more. It is not usual to use the term \"crux gemmata\" for crosses from more recent periods, especially for small crosses that fall under the category of jewellery.\n\n"}

On Sue's advice, Maud accepts Rivers' proposal of marriage as a way of gaining her freedom from her uncle. \n\nOnce married to Maud, Rivers' next plan is to get her admitted to the asylum. But in a dramatic twist, Sue is taken to the madhouse as \"Mrs Rivers\" and she realises that Maud has been in on the plan from the very beginning.\n\nHaving disposed of Sue, Rivers takes Maud to London to Mrs Sucksby's house. There Maud learns that Mrs Sucksby is the mastermind behind her escape and Sue's downfall. Maud is plagued by doubts over her treatment of Sue and the fake life that she presented.\n\nIn reality Maud was orphaned and brought up by her uncle, a cruel man, who hardened her heart. The nightly readings in his library were not as innocent as it appeared to Sue. Maud was forced to read pornography to her uncle and his friends. Tormented by the cruelty of her existence, Maud found in Rivers a way out.\n\nBy marrying him, she could escape the prison of her uncle's house. But what Maud hadn't expected was to be so affected by her friendship with Sue - or indeed that she would fall in love with her. In order to save herself from her uncle, Maud had to reconcile herself to hurting Sue.\n\nBut even Maud couldn't have imagined that her world would be further turned upside down. Mrs Sucksby reveals that through a series of twists and turns Maud and Sue were switched at birth — they have been living each other's lives. Mrs. Sucksby arranged the whole scheme. Marianne Lilly, before being incarcerated in the asylum by her evil brother, changed her will, leaving one half of her wealth to her own daughter, Susan, and the other half to Maud.\n\nMrs Sucksby explains to Maud that she has no choice but to comply with the rest of the plan. Maud is further devastated to learn that they have no intention of rescuing Sue from the asylum.\n\nAcknowledging the wrong she has done, Maud knows she must escape Mrs Sucksby if she is to rescue Sue. She manages to get out and finds her way to an old business associate of her uncle's, but he refuses to help and sends her away. Alone in the alleyways and streets of London and unaware of the dangers that lurk, Maud realises she has no choice but to return to Lant Street. Mrs Sucksby is overjoyed to see her and Maud discovers that she is in fact Mrs Sucksby's own daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, employing all the underhanded tricks that her childhood has taught her, Sue escapes from the asylum. She heads for London where she plans to get her revenge on Maud for what she sees as betrayal.\n\nAt Mrs Sucksby's, Sue confronts Maud, Mrs Sucksby and Rivers; a huge row ensues and in a struggle Rivers is killed. Despite Maud being guilty of Rivers' murder, Mrs Sucksby confesses to protect both girls and soon after is executed for the crime.\n\nMaud disappears and Sue, realising that Maud was just an innocent in Mrs Sucksby's scheme, sets off to find her. Acknowledging their feelings for one another, the two women are reunited.\n\n\nLondon, England, United Kingdom.

Such songs are known as \"reference songs.\" However, others have shown that such familiar-melody associations are quite limited in scope, applicable only to the specific scale-degrees found in each melody.\n\nHere are some examples for each interval:\n\nIn addition, there are various solmization systems (including solfeggio, sargam, and numerical sight-singing) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the scale. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.\n"}

She supports charities and animal welfare groups, such as Compassion in World Farming and Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals. She is also patron of the Farm Animal Sanctuary. She is also known as 'daughter of Nepal' in Nepal\n\nJoanna Lamond Lumley was born on 1 May 1946 in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, British India, to English mother Thyra Beatrice Rose (née Weir) and Scottish-English father, Major James Rutherford Lumley who had been born in Lahore, Pakistan, and who served as an officer in the British Indian Army's 6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles. They married in 1941.\n\nLumley was brought up in Kent, England, where she attended Mickledene School in Rolvenden as a boarder. The family spent time in Hong Kong and Malaya (now Malaysia). Lumley was educated at The Convent of Our Lady School in St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, and afterwards attended the Lucie Clayton Finishing School, after being turned down by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at the age of 16.\n\nLumley spent three years as a photographic model, notably for Brian Duffy, who photographed her with her son. In 1967 Lumley appeared on the BBC Two programme \"The Impresarios: For Appearance's Sake\", explaining Duffy's studio process and her joy in working with him.

In 2013, she appeared in the Martin Scorsese crime drama, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\".\n\nThroughout her career, she has specialised in playing upper class parts, and her distinctive voice has reinforced this. Lumley's first major role was as Purdey in \"The New Avengers\", a revival of the secret agent series \"The Avengers\". \n\nIn 1979 she appeared in another series which acquired a cult following: \"Sapphire & Steel\", with David McCallum. Conceived as ITV's answer to \"Doctor Who\", Lumley played a mysterious elemental being (\"Sapphire\") who, with her collaborator, \"Steel\", dealt with breaches in the fabric of time. In 1986, television producer Sydney Newman suggested Lumley for the role of the Doctor but his idea was dismissed. Over a decade later Lumley's career was boosted by her portrayal of the louche, selfish and frequently drunk fashion director Patsy Stone, companion to Jennifer Saunders' Edina Monsoon in the BBC comedy television series \"Absolutely Fabulous\" (1992–1996, 2001–2004, 2011–2012). \"\" was released in 2016.

She recorded the greetings \"Welcome to AOL\" and \"You have email\" and \"Goodbye\" for that company.\n\nHers was the voice behind the iconic Simple skincare commercial in which robotic arms sprayed and perfumed a pristine white lily. The commercial entitled 'Gilding the Lily' was created by art director Colin Underhay and copywriter Alex Pearl.\n\nAnd from 2005 to 2006 she appeared in adverts for insurance brokers Privilege.\n\nLumley has also appeared on the last run of ITV's \"Parkinson\" as a guest, on 27 October 2007, discussing the subject of young girls across the UK and how they need to behave better if they hope to be successful. She was asked to write the introduction to a re-edition in November 2007 of the book called \"The Magic Key To Charm\" written by the pioneering female journalist Eileen Ascroft. This is a book of tips to women, first written by Ascroft in 1938 about how to be glamorous. \"I thought it was absolutely enchanting, it's how young women were told how to behave in the old days and I think it might be just coming back for a bit of a revival\", she explained in the interview.\"Because, I have to say I adore our young ones and I think we have got some of the prettiest and loveliest girls in the world but I think sometimes the behaviour gets a bit bad and I think the girls let themselves down. They are so pretty and so lovely but they should behave better, I think, then they will be more successful.\"\n\nIn 1999 she appeared in the Comic Relief \"Doctor Who\" parody \"The Curse of Fatal Death\" as the final incarnation of the Doctor.

Playing herself and the character of Mrs. Danvers, she starred alongside others including Jennifer Saunders, Kim Cattrall, Victoria Wood, Harry Enfield, Patrick Barlow, Dale Winton, Olivia Colman and Tim Vine.\n\nIn recent years, Lumley has worked extensively with ITV, and in 2010 Lumley was executive producer and presenter of \"Joanna Lumley's Nile\", where she journeyed up the River Nile from sea to source in Rwanda, for ITV. This was broadcast in four parts on ITV beginning on 12 April 2010, and repeated in June 2013.\n\nLumley travelled again for ITV in 2011, this time visiting Greece for a four-part series titled \"Joanna Lumley’s Greek Odyssey\". The series aired on ITV beginning on 13 October. Once again, in 2012, Lumley travelled for ITV, now in search of Noah's Ark. The trip, which encompassed 3 continents and also involved an adventurous jaunt into Iran, aired in late 2012 as a single 90-minute documentary titled \"Joanna Lumley’s Ark\".\n\nIn March 2014 she appeared in a BBC One hour-long documentary featuring American musician Will.i.am.

Her father was a commanding officer of a troop of Gurkhas who fought in World War II.\n\nIn 2008, Lumley became the public face of a campaign to provide all Nepalese origin Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission, but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all-party group including Gurkhas starting from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the Gurkha Justice Campaign.\n\nOn 24 April 2009, she stated that she was \"ashamed\" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK and access to housing, social security and healthcare. Following the Government defeat, the Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July.\n\nOn 5 May 2009, Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from \"a senior member of the Royal Family\", and attended a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street the following day. Afterwards, she described the meeting as \"extremely positive\", and praised Mr Brown, saying, \"I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day.\"\n\nHowever, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected – many saw this as a betrayal, despite the fact that for the letters to have been received the day after the meeting they might have been sent before it (and certainly after the 29 April Commons vote). Lumley confronted Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after her pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which Woolas agreed to accept Gurkha Justice Campaign input in developing new guidelines by July while giving sympathetic treatment to Gurkhas not meeting the then current immigration guidelines before the development of new guidelines.\n\nFollowing a Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May, Gordon Brown announced to the House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day. Ms Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain.\n\nAs a result of her campaigning skills, there were calls for Joanna Lumley to stand as a Member of Parliament at the forthcoming general election. However, she has dismissed the suggestion. During an appearance on \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" on 29 May, she reiterated that she had no desire to run for election to the House of Commons.\n\nIn July 2009, Lumley went on a visit to Nepal. Upon her arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport, she was greeted by crowds of Gurkha supporters. Lumley said in a statement, \"I feel so humbled by the fact I'm going to meet so many ex-Gurkhas and their families, and see where they are and how they live.\" While there, Lumley was hailed 'Daughter of Nepal' by the crowds of fans at the airport.\n\nLumley has long been a supporter of Survival International and the cause of indigenous rights, and narrated Survival's documentary, \"Mine: story of a sacred mountain\". The film tells the story of the remote Dongria Kondha tribe in India and their battle to stop a vast bauxite mine from destroying their land and way of life. In defence of the Dongria, she has said, \"It greatly disturbs me that a British company will be responsible for the destruction of these wonderful people. I urge the public to support the Dongria, who simply want to be allowed to live in peace. Unlike so many of India's rural poor, the Dongria actually live very well in the Niyamgiri hills, and it's a terrible irony that what Vedanta is proposing to do in the name of 'development' will actually destroy this completely self-sufficient people.\" Lumley also contributed her writing for the book \"We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples\", released in October 2009 with profits going in support of Survival. A collection of photographs, statements from tribal people and essays from international authors, the book explores the richness of the cultures of indigenous peoples around the world and the risks to their existence. In her essay for the book, Lumley speaks of the Dongria way of life and the threats they face in the name of corporate interests, and calls for action to stop such decisions.\n\nIn May 2016, Joanna became a patron of Population Matters, an organisation campaigning for the achievement of a sustainable global population size.\n\nLumley has been a patron of the UK charity Tree Aid, since 1993. Tree Aid is a charity which enables communities in Africa's drylands to fight poverty and become self-reliant, while improving the environment.\n\nJoanna Lumley is also a patron of the Pastoral and Environmental Network in the Horn of Africa, or \"PENHA\". PENHA is an international NGO, founded in 1989 and based on the commitment of professionals and development workers from the Horn of Africa to address issues of pastoral concerns from a regional prospective. Lumley's commitment to support the pastoral communities of the Horn of Africa is of paramount importance to PENHA.\n\nLumley is patron of the Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust. Moat Brae was the favourite place for author J.M. Barrie to play as a child and the house and gardens are said to have inspired Barrie to create Peter Pan. The trust is undertaking a £4 million fundraising project to renovate the Georgian house and gardens to operate as an educational and cultural centre for local schools and JM Barrie enthusiasts and scholars.\n\nJoanna Lumley is patron of the UK charity \"Trust in Children\" which aims to help children from poor backgrounds to access education and opportunities for non-academic development. The charity (Charity Commission registered number 236625) had income of £2,318 in its financial year ending 5 April 2015, a turnover low enough for it not to have to file any accounts.\n\nLumley has been patron of The Friends of Kadzinuni since it was established in 2003, a small charity based in Keyworth, Nottinghamshire, UK which is enabling the village of Kadzinuni, ( north of Mombasa, near Kilifi) to be transformed into a self-sufficient wealth creating community by focussing on facilitating community-led developments for Healthcare, Education, and Agriculture.\n\nLumley has a long association and interest in Nepal and its people that grew out of her father’s service as an officer in 6th Gurkha Rifles. She agreed to become a Vice Patron of The Gurkha Welfare Trust in 2009.\n\nIn 1996, the Lumley Research Fellowship was established at Green College, University of Oxford. Sponsored by Friends Provident financial group, it was for a young researcher on \"major environmental or wildlife issues, with particular reference to Africa\". The candidates were interviewed by Lumley.\n\nIn February 2013, she was assessed as one of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.\n\nLumley's son, James, was born in 1967. James Lumley's father is the photographer Michael Claydon. Lumley was briefly married to actor Jeremy Lloyd during 1970, but that union ended with a no-fault divorce (\"dissolved\") after a few months. In 1986, she married the conductor Stephen Barlow; they live in London. They also own a house near the village of Penpont, Dumfries and Galloway in South West Scotland. Lumley's son, Jamie, has two daughters, Alice and Emily.\n\nLumley was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1995 New Year Honours. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (FRGS). She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (Hon. D.Litt.) by the University of Kent in July 1994. In 2002, she was awarded an honorary degree from Oxford Brookes University. In 2006, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters (Hon. D.Litt.) from the University of St. Andrews. and in July 2008, she was also awarded an honorary Doctor of the University (Hon DUniv) from Queen's University Belfast.\n\nLumley supports charities including Suffolk Family Carers, Child Rescue Nepal and Kids for Kids. She has been a vegetarian for 40 years. She has donated books to Book Aid International. She is patron of the Born Free Foundation and passionate about the Free Tibet campaign.\n\nOther charities supported include Mind, ActionAid, SANE, Kidasha (formerly CWS) which works on behalf of children in Nepal, and the Spike Milligan statue memorial fund, based in Finchley, north London. In 2017, Lumley became a Patron of the Finchley Society.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, Lumley supported the now-defunct proposals for a pedestrian \"Garden Bridge\" across the Thames in London, in collaboration with the designer Thomas Heatherwick and former Mayor of London Boris Johnson. The proposals foundered at a cost of over £40 million of public money.\n\nIn May 2009 she supported the Green Party during the 2009 European Elections campaign. For Lumley, the work of Green MEPs in the European Parliament in pursuing human rights and animal rights made the Green Party \"the obvious choice\" and urged UK voters \"to cast a positive vote for a better future by voting Green in the European Elections.\" Lumley also appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons in the Alternative Vote referendum in 2011.\n\nIn 2010 she donated £1,000 to Caroline Lucas's campaign to become the first Green MP during the 2010 General Election campaign. Lumley was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas at the 2015 general election.\n\nIn August 2015, Lumley backed children's fairytales app \"GivingTales\" in aid of UNICEF together with other celebrities including Roger Moore, Stephen Fry, Ewan McGregor, Joan Collins, Michael Caine, David Walliams, Charlotte Rampling, Paul McKenna and Michael Ball.\n\n\n\nShe has also narrated a number of audiobooks and provided forewords for works by other authors.\n\n\n\n"}

His father, Semon Bache [né Bach] (1826–1891), emigrated to the United States from his native Nuremberg Bavaria, settling in New York City where he started the glassmaking firm Semon Bache & Company.\n\nIn 1881, he started work as a cashier at Leopold Cahn & Co., a stockbrokerage firm founded by his uncle. In 1886, he was made a minority partner and in 1892 took full control of the business, renaming it J. S. Bache & Co. Jules Bache built the company into one of the top brokerage houses in the United States, outranked only by Merrill Lynch. In the process, he became an immensely wealthy individual, a patron of the arts, and a philanthropist.\n\nDuring World War I, Jules Bache donated money to the American Field Service in France and his wife was the honorary treasurer of the \"War Babies' Cradle,\" a charity that provided aid for mothers and children in distress in war-torn Northern France and Belgium to provide them with food, clothing, heating fuel and medical care.\n\nJules Bache was a shareholder of a number of prominent corporations and sat on the board of directors of many of them. Among his personal holdings, Bache had sizeable interests in Canadian mining companies. His equity in these companies were held by his Bahamas based corporation that allowed him to legally avoid some of the high personal U.S. surtaxes, a fact which he would be publicly criticized for as a result of the Federal investigations during the 1930s into the causes of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Bache however believed that high taxation was a hindrance to economic growth and published a booklet titled \"\"Release business from the slavery of taxation\".\" A major shareholder in Dome Mines Limited, Bache served as company president from 1919 until 1942 and was Chairman of the Board at the time of his passing. After the brokerage firm of Dillon, Read & Co. acquired the Dodge Brothers Automobile Company in 1923, Jules Bache acquired a substantial position in Chrysler Corporation.\n\nIn addition to his high profile in the business world, Jules Bache would also become well known for his art collecting that received much press attention in 1929 when he purchased the portrait of \"\"Giuliano de Medici\",\" then attributed to Raphael. He would acquire numerous other important works including those by or attributed to Rembrandt, Titian (including \"The Bache Madonna\"), Albrecht Dürer, Diego Velázquez, Gerard David, Giovanni Bellini, and Sandro Botticelli, amongst others. In 1937 he opened his magnificent art collection to the public, and in 1943 donated some of his works to the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\nBache was a major donor to the Department of Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the time of his death in 1944, most of his picture collection – up to that time gifted to the Jules Bache Foundation, was given to the Museum; the remaining works of art from his estate from his house at 814 Fifth Avenue were sold at auction. Presumably his portrait by Austrian artist Wilhelm Viktor Krausz (1878–1959) was retained by one of Bache's daughters.\nA supporter of American theatre and Broadway, in 1941 Jules Bache helped found the New York branch of the Escholier Club.\n\nIn 1927, his daughter, Kathryn Bache Miller, married the theatrical producer Gilbert Miller, in Paris, France.\n\nJules Bache died in 1944 in Palm Beach, Florida and was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.

Manda was introduced by executive producer Diederick Santer, and made her first appearance on 6 March 2009 and her last on 12 February 2010.\n\nThe character was given a backstory linking her to two characters already established in the serial; she is an ex-girlfriend of Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and an old friend of Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi), the latter whom Manda was paired romantically with. Her family was extended when her disabled son, Adam Best (David Proud), who suffers from spina bifida, was introduced. Adam's introduction was scripted to cause discontent in Manda and Minty's relationship, with Adam taking an instant dislike to Minty. It was announced in November 2009 that Lawrence had quit \"EastEnders\" as she wanted to pursue other projects, making her final appearance on 12 February 2010, after ending her relationship with Minty.\n\nLawrence revealed Manda's backstory in an interview on the official \"EastEnders\" website: \"Manda lived in the Square over 20 years ago—she went out with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and knew Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi). She got married and left the area, but she's been divorced for five years. I don't think it was a very happy marriage—he was a bit of a philanderer. After the divorce she decided to reinvent herself. She's taken a course in teaching pottery and art and she's made life better for herself by becoming more spiritual.\"\n\nManda first appears at Walford's community centre, where she is teaching a pottery class. There she meets her old acquaintance Minty Peterson. Minty reveals that while Manda was dating his friend Phil Mitchell years ago, he secretly used to hate her. However, they settle their differences and soon start dating. But the pace of the relationship is slow, and Minty wonders if Manda is really interested in him. In July 2009, Minty sees Manda kissing Phil. He reluctantly confronts her, and she explains that she was thanking Phil for allowing Minty a day off work (she was planning a secret trip to the theatre for Minty). Manda also assures him that she will never cheat on him. Manda's landlord evicts her from her flat, and after Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) and Dawn Swann (Kara Tointon) leave Walford, she moves into Minty's residence with her cat. Manda's son Adam Best (David Proud) comes to stay in September 2009, and he takes an instant dislike to Minty. After Adam returns to Oxford University, Manda tries to explain her son's hostility by saying he is over-protective. Minty responds by telling Manda that Adam is arrogant and rude, and he does not appreciate being treated like that in his own home. The pair make up, however, with Manda promising that Adam will be nicer in future. Manda discovers that Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins) is secretly the father of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison)'s baby George, but agrees to keep it to herself. When the secret is revealed, Minty is angry with her for not telling him, as he was once married to Heather. They make up, but then Manda finds out that Minty has been hiding Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), a fugitive, from the police. Adam tries to cause trouble, saying that Minty fantasises about Sam, but Manda accepts Minty's explanation that he and Sam are merely friends; Sam is imprisoned shortly after. When Minty starts disappearing regularly without saying where he is going, Manda suspects he is having an affair. Adam finds a letter Sam sent Minty from prison, and it transpires Minty is visiting Sam. When Manda confronts Minty about this, he admits to having feelings for Sam but wants to spend his future with Manda. Believing Minty does not love her, Manda pretends that she still has feelings for Phil and ends her relationship with Minty, leaving Walford. Several months later, Adam tells Minty that Manda is dating another man.\n\nIn January 2009, it was announced that comedian Lawrence would join \"EastEnders\" playing Manda Best, a character who had grown up in Walford and knew Phil and Minty over 20 years before moving back. She joined the show for a specific storyline involving Phil and Minty, however, a source at the BBC told entertainment website Digital Spy that \"there are plenty of potential storyline opportunities for her to able to stick around.\" \"EastEnders\" executive producer Diederick Santer said of Lawrence's casting, \"I'm so excited Josie's joining us. I've enjoyed her brilliant comic performances for over 20 years, and can't wait to see her in Walford.\" Lawrence said of her role, \"I'm so excited. Everyone at \"EastEnders\" has made me feel so at home. It's mind-boggling to walk into Albert Square after having watched the show for so many years! I can't wait to see how my character develops on screen.\" She made her first appearance on 6 March 2009. When asked about Manda's future, Lawrence said, \"It's weird playing a part when you don't know what happens to the character. I could ride off on my bike into the sunset, but grisly ends are much more fun.\" Later in June 2009, Manda's son Adam joined the show, played by David Proud. Adam has spina bifida and uses a wheelchair.\n\nLawrence decided to quit the show at the end of her initial contract, saying that she enjoyed her time on the show but asked to leave as she liked having variety in her career. She said, \"It has been an amazing year at \"EastEnders\" and I have made some fantastic friends among both the cast and crew. I am somebody who likes to do a variety of different projects, and now seems the right time to move on.\" She said that she wanted to leave \"EastEnders\" with a \"bang\", but writers did not have time to come up with a good exit storyline as they were busy working on the \"Who Killed Archie?\" storyline. She said, \"[Santer] understood—he called me a wandering minstrel! But they had been expecting me to stay on, so they admitted they didn't have much time to come up with a good storyline. They were all too busy with Archie's murder so my exit was much more low-key.\" Her exit storyline comes about when Manda discovers that Minty is hiding something from her, on which a spokesperson for the show said, \"The revelation then serves as the catalyst for Manda's exit.\" She made her last appearance on 12 February 2010.\n\nLawrence described Manda as \"Loving, strange (in a good way) and creative\". Lawrence based Manda's \"new age\" side on a couple of her friends who were into yoga and breathing relaxation techniques, saying, \"there's a couple of times when you see Manda take a deep breath when she is getting irate.\" The BBC described Manda as \"charismatic\"; the \"EastEnders\" website called her \"creative, vivacious and always up for a laugh\" and suggesting that \"underneath her merry exterior\", Manda might have been \"longing for love\". The website goes on to say: \"Bubbly, free-spirit Manda Best is well connected with her spiritual side and is a firm believer in solving life's problems through hugging. She is loving, creative and independent, but secretly yearns to meet that 'Mr Right'.\" \"The Sunday Mirror\" described Manda as \"crazed\" and \"mad\". Manda typically wore \"hippy dresses\" and large glasses.\n\nLawrence, who was born in West Midlands, came under criticism from a journalist of the \"Sunday Mercury\". According to the journalist, \"EastEnders\", a London-based soap opera, had too many actors from the Midlands at the time, and not enough from London. When Manda left the serial, Jane Simon from the \"Daily Mirror\" stated that she would not miss the character or her wardrobe, using the \"stupid flower\" Manda wore on her bicycle helmet as an example of this.\n\n"}
{"id": "56719991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56719991", "title": "Michael Clark (artist)", "text": "Michael Clark (artist)\n\nMichael Clark (born 1 April 1954) is a contemporary British artist. His work spans a broad range of media including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, photography, installation, video, performance and artist's books. Clark was born in Manchester and lives and works in London.\n\nIn 1977 Clark met Muriel Belcher and Francis Bacon in The Colony Room club in Soho. Clark's portrait of Belcher on her deathbed (\"Muriel Belcher Ill in bed\") was part of the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1981, and won the Charles Wollaston Award. At the suggestion of Valerie Beston, of Marlborough Fine Art, Clark made the first of a series of portraits of Bacon, one of which is in the British Museum's collection. \"Michael Clark's portraits of Bacon emphasise the sad preoccupation of his sagging face, with eyes deep in concussed hollows grimly contemplating mortality\".\n\n\"Vanitas\" (1990-1992), Clark's double-sided portrait of Lisa Stansfield, was part of \"The Portrait Now\" exhibition held from 1993–1994 at the National Portrait Gallery. \"Both the theme of the wound and the title 'Vanitas' make references to mortality. Clark was partly inspired by a Renaissance painting — also double-sided — by Barthel Bruyn the Elder.\" Since 1994, Clark's \"Five Wounds\" have been on permanent display at Chichester Cathedral, alongside works by Graham Sutherland, John Piper and Marc Chagall.\"In some the glaze is so heavy that their raised and gleaming beads of crimson appear to flow. In others pieces of yellow 'bone' seem to rise beneath the skin. Any initial revulsion soon gives way to enchantment. [...] In the Wounds the viewer comes face to face with the very real nature of Christ's suffering and consequently with our own mortality. 'These works are forms to meditate upon' explains the artist. 'A trigger-release mechanism; a way of opening up.'\"Maria Balshaw, director of the Tate, listed Clark's portrait of filmmaker Derek Jarman, \"The Gardener\" (1994), as one of her favourite works in the collection of the Whitworth Art Gallery. “Michael Clark drew the film-maker towards the end of his life, when he was a man facing sickness and death. The drawing has a distinct and immediate impact, foregrounding as it does the quality of personal courage of the sitter. You are powerfully drawn to the face, you have a sense that the sitter trusted the artist to see into the eyes, to do much more than observe …” After purchasing \"Seer\" (1993), a grisaille portrait of Derek Jarman, in 1995, the National Portrait Gallery commissioned Clark, in 1999, to make a portrait of the filmmaker Nicolas Roeg. Clark delivered \"Al-Jebr\", a kinetic assemblage made of mixed media portraying Roeg, which in Arabic means 'the bringing together of broken parts'.\n\nThe art collection of Valerie Beston was sold at Christie's in February 2006 and included ten works by Clark. The accompanying catalogue stated:\"Bacon’s influence threads through his [Clark's] works, reappearing even in his conceptual pieces. Be it in the appearance of wounds in his paintings, or in the location of a ‘sound sculpture’ outside a sex shop that Bacon used to frequent (only in part to cash his cheques), his ghostly spectre appears again and again, if only obliquely, in his figurative and conceptual works. For Clark is not a portraitist, although he has created many portraits of people ranging from film directors to the characters of Soho of yesterday to Royalty to Pop royalty. He is a conceptual artist, for whom the painstakingly accurate depiction of the human face is only one of his means or media, and conversation with him ranges from the diverse influences of Rimbaud and Nauman as well as Holbein and Rembrandt.\"\nIn his book, \"Francis Bacon in Your Blood,\" art historian Michael Peppiatt writes:\n\"A feature article came out a while ago in the \"Observer\" in which the author, Peter Conrad, interviewed three men who had been close to Francis Bacon in their youth. He described each of them as having been 'burnt' for life by their contact with the painter. The implication was that you did not survive the influence of a genius as dark and powerful as Bacon. The three men were the photographer Peter Beard, the artist Michael Clark, and myself.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53274441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53274441", "title": "Myanmar architecture", "text": "Myanmar architecture\n\nThe architecture of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), in Southeast Asia, includes architectural styles which reflect the influence of neighboring and Western nations and modernization. The country's most prominent buildings include Buddhist pagodas, stupas and temples, British colonial buildings, and modern renovations and structures. Myanmar's traditional architecture is primarily used for worship, pilgrimage, storage of Buddhist relics, political activism and tourism.\n\nMuch of Myanmar's architecture is tied to ancient Indian culture, and can be traced to the country's earliest known inhabitants. During the Pyu period, cylindrical stupas with four archways—often with a hti (umbrella) on top—were built. The Mon and Pyu people were the first two influential groups to migrated to Myanmar, and the first Indo-Chinese adherents of Theravada Buddhism. Beikthano, one of the first Pyu centers, contains urbanesque foundations which include a monastery and stupa-like structures. These Pyu stupas, the first Indian foundations in Myanmar, were built from 200 BC to 100 CE and were sometimes used for burial. Early stupas, temples and pagodas are topped with \"htis\" and finials or spires symbolizing Theravada Buddhist transcendence.\n\nBy the 9th century, the Bamar people had established a kingdom centered at Bagan. During the 11th century, King Anawrahta unified the Irrawaddy Valley region and founded the Pagan Empire. Bagan, with over 10,000 of Myanmar's red brick stupas and pagodas, had become a center of Buddhist architecture by the mid-12th century. During this period, the Pyu-style stupas were transformed into monuments reminiscent of alms bowls or gourd-shaped domes, unbaked brick, tapered and rising roofs, Buddha niches, polylobed arches and ornamental doorways influenced by India's Pala Empire and its monuments. Stucco was widely used in Bagan, especially by the Mon people. Stucco features of Bagan structures include garlands, flames or rays of the sun, peacock tail feathers and mythical creatures.\n\nThe Dhammayazika Pagoda has a plan similar to the Tantric Paharpur stupa in India. It does not have a square base like many Bagan stupas; instead, it has a pentagonal base with radial halls and low skirting.\n\nThe Ananda Temple (finished in 1090), one of the first temples erected in Bagan, was influenced by Indian architecture. The vaulted temple represents the Theravada branch of Buddhism, Bagan's official religion when it was built. Architectural features of the temple include brick vaulted halls, Buddha statues, tapered roofs and the absence of terraces. The temple has one of the first uses of the pyatthat, or tiered roof, which indicates the presence of a throne within. With both royal and religious symbolism, many of the temple's images depict the Buddha seated before an odd number of pyatthat tiers.\n\nMany of Bagan's historical monuments are well-preserved, due to the dry climate. Bagan, with one of the largest concentrations of temples in the world, is one of Myanmar's most important pilgrimage sites. Many of the temples' paintings and murals are still visible. Notable architectural sites in Bagan include the Bupaya Pagoda, the Dhammayangyi, Gawdawpalin and Htilominlo Temples, the Inn-hpaya Stupa, the Mahabodhi Temple, the Mingalazedi Pagoda, the Minochantha stupa group, the Taung Kyaung monastery, the Nathlaung Kyaung Temple, the Nga-kywe-na-daung Stupa, the Pahto Thamya and Shwegugyi Temples, the Shwezigon Pagoda and the Sulamani and Thatbyinnyu Temple.\n\nBurma was part of the British Empire by the end of the 1880s, and this ushered in a period of colonial architecture. Rangoon, now known as Yangon, became a multi-ethnic capital. As large, colonial buildings were built throughout the city, social disruption in Burma spawned nationalist rallies and anti-colonial protests.\n\nYangon's central business district, along the Yangon River, contains many colonial-era buildings. One example is the Ministers' Building, built as the Secretariat Building in 1902 to house the British administration. Other downtown structures are the Bogyoke Market (formerly Scott Market) and the Strand Hotel, built in 1896 by Aviet and Tigran Sarkie. Prominent buildings include Yangon City Hall, built between 1926 and 1936; the Customs House; the High Court Building (built in 1914 and converted to the High Court head office in 1962); the 1920 Inland Water Transport Authority Building, and the former Myanmar Railways headquarters.\n\nThe Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon is a stupa and a focal point of Buddhism in Myanmar. At 99.4 meters high, the stupa is covered with gold leaf and plate. It is surrounded by smaller shrines, and is topped with a gem-encrusted \"seinbu\" (diamond bud) and a seven-tiered \"hti\" representing Burmese spirituality. Every four or five years, its gold is repaired or replaced. The stupa, built by a Theravada Buddhist society, is said to contain strands of the Buddha's hair.\n\nBuilt to be walked around, visitors pass astrological representations of the eight days of a Burmese week. The platform includes devotional centres at the cardinal compass points and dozens of smaller stupas, including the Golden Elder. Bodhi trees, images of the Buddha and other spiritual figures, and the 16-ton Singu Min Bell (formerly known as the Maha Ganda Bell) decorate the exterior.\n\nThe pagoda has been a centre of Buddhist devotion and a forum for political activism. During the anti-colonial demonstrations of the nationalist Thakin Party in 1938 and 1939, \"strike centres\" were set up around the pagoda. In 1988, as the Burmese Socialist Programme Party was collapsing, Shwedagon was a platform for pro-democracy political demonstrations. On 26 August 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi spoke before a large audience about democracy at the pagoda's west gate.\n\nThe Mandalay Palace is an example of wooden architecture in Myanmar, which emphasizes exterior aesthetics rather than interior space. Built in the late 1850s, some characteristics of the palace (such as cardinally-placed gates and a central palace structure) can be traced back to the early Pyu period. The primary east-west axis was constructed from the palace buildings themselves. Illustrations from 11th century Pagan depict wooden buildings similar to those at the palace, and handiwork later found at Mandalay.\n\nOnly a section of the original palace remained after a 1945 fire, with examples of traditional stucco used in Burmese construction. The palace's Flower Distribution Centre contains several wooden, semicircular arches which may have been inspired by 19th-century European buildings. The stucco on these arches appears to represent rays of sunlight or lotus petals.\n\nIn addition to its wood carvings and stucco, tiered roofs (\"pyatthat\") are a feature of the palace. Inside, covered hallways lead to a small throne room which is topped by a \"pyatthat\". Many \"pyatthats\" on the palace, like those other Burmese structures, are parallel to monasteries and throne rooms. There is also a \"pyatthat\" over the Great Audience Hall. Due to the tropical climate, frequent renovations of the wood-and=stucco palace have been necessary; some of its original teak has been reinforced with concrete.\n\nStucco, introduced during the Bagan period, is strongly tied to Mon heritage. Wood carving in Myanmar is a traditional art which has survived for centuries. Due to its tropical climate (necessitating the reconstruction of many buildings), the craft has been passed down from generation to generation. Without these renovations, the art of wood carving would have been lost and it would have been impossible to reconstruct traditional features.\n\nGold cladding is a feature of traditional Burmese architecture, usually prominent in gilded or gold-plated exteriors. The Bupaya, Shwedagon, Shwezigon and Lawkananda Pagodas have gold features.\n\nDuring World War II, many historical structures were lost or damaged; much of the Mandalay Palace was destroyed in a fire near the end of the war. In 1962, on alleged orders from Ne Win, the Rangoon University Students' Union was demolished (although the main campus still contains lecture and residence halls from the colonial period). Since the late 1980s, many colonial structures (including a block of cinemas) have been razed for new construction.\n\nOnly a few colonial-era buildings and about 2,200 temples and pagodas remain in Myanmar. As a result of these losses, many groups have united to preserve the remaining structures.\n\nThe Yangon City Development Committee, established in 1990, has worked with the State Peace and Development Council to recondition many Buddhist monuments with plans for newer and more-challenging designs. Pagodas and temples have been renovated to promote \"monumental Buddhism\", a term used to describe the renewal of Buddhist architecture for a sense of authenticity. These newer Buddhist sites, a combination of modern and traditional Burmese style, are found throughout Myanmar and include monasteries, pagodas and the International Theravada Buddhist Missionary University. The crown umbrella atop the Shwedagon Pagoda, which was donated by King Mindon in 1871, was replaced in the spring of 1999.\n\nThe Yangon Heritage Trust, formed in 2012, is a non-governmental organization committed to preserving Yangon's historic architecture. The trust has had several preservation successes, due to its public-awareness campaigns. Agreements with government officials have saved the former Indian and U.S. Embassy buildings and Gandhi Hall.\n\n"}
{"id": "3564340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3564340", "title": "National College of Art and Design", "text": "National College of Art and Design\n\nThe National College of Art and Design (NCAD) is Ireland's oldest art institution, offering the largest range of art and design degrees at undergraduate and postgraduate level in the country. Originating as a drawing school in 1746, many of the most important Irish artists, designers and art educators have studied or taught in the college. NCAD has always been located in central Dublin, and in 1980 it relocated to the historic Liberties area. The College has around 950 full-time students and a further 600 pursuing part-time courses, and NCAD's students come from more than forty countries. NCAD is a Recognised College of University College Dublin. It is also a member of the European League of Institutes of the Arts.\n\nThe National College of Art and Design can trace its origins in an unbroken line back to the drawing school set up by Robert West in George's Lane, in 1746, and then sponsored by the Dublin Society. The institution has been influenced in turn by the French Enlightenment, the Victorian schools of design, including industrial design, the Arts and Crafts movement, the search for Irish national identity and innovations in British art education in the 1960s. The school has also played a role in Irish social and cultural developments - it had a significant influence on the eighteenth century Irish school of painting and sculpture and it also affected the standard of applied ornament in architecture and crafts. Most Irish artists of importance have spent some time in the college, and in the twentieth century the teaching staff has included Sir William Orpen, Oliver Sheppard, Oswald Reeves, Harry Clarke, Seán Keating, Maurice MacGonigal, Laurence Campbell and Bernardus Romein.\n\nThe opening up of Irish culture in the 1960s had a profound effect on the college, resulting in years of student disturbances and closures by the government. Central to this was the debate about Modernism versus traditional discipline and the control exercised by the Department of Education and its predecessors. There was also the pressure for industrial design reform in face of the new economic future of an independent Ireland, and again within the Common Market. The consequence of all this revolution was a statute of 1971 which re-established the college, granting it freedom to run its own affairs academically. The college was further restructured in 1975 and a wide range of degree courses developed.\n\nFollowing its relocation to Thomas Street in the early 1980s, the college expanded its offer of undergraduate courses and introduced a range of postgraduate courses and research based options up to PhD level.\n\n\n\nFor most of its history NCAD was located in Kildare Street, in a series of buildings adjoining the Dáil (Parliament) and the National Library of Ireland. With increasing student numbers and a requirement for additional space by the Dail, the College relocated to the Liberties in the early 1980s, to a site at 100 Thomas Street which was formerly the home of Power's Whiskey Distillery. \n\nThe six acre campus is located next door to the landmark Church of St Augustine and St John, by Gothic revivalist Edward Welby Pugin (begun 1862) which features stained glass by NCAD graduates, Michael Healy and Harry Clarke (and his studio).\n\nThe campus comprises a mixture of 19th, 20th and 21st century buildings. The largest of the original Powers Distillery buildings is the five-storey Granary, crowned by a cupola with weather vane bearing the date 1817. Other original buildings utilised by the college include the Counting House and Offices (now housing College Administration), designed by C. W. Caroe (c.1876), the Clock Building, and the Distiller's Residence. Distinguishing features associated with the manufacture of whiskey include three of the original giant pot stills, once enclosed but now located on the periphery of Red Square (part of the original kiln building is now integrated into the Library annex), along with two of the original five engine houses, including the most notable, Engine House No. 5 with its 250 horse power beam engine, and the smaller of the original two chimney stacks. The majority of full-time students have dedicated studio space in either the Granary or in the Design For Industry Building (built 1998). The student café, which was originally Power's staff canteen, is located in the vaulted basement of the Counting House and Offices.\n\nIn the 1998 the College acquired the old Thomas Street Fire Station, Dublin's first motorised fire station, which was designed by Charles J. McCarthy (1911). Renamed Harry Clarke House, it now houses a lecture theatre, seminar rooms and staff offices. Between it and the Counting House is the modernist NCAD Gallery (with staff room and studio space overhead) which was designed by Murray O'Laoire and opened in 2009.\n\nSince 2017 the College campus has featured in Dubline (Dublin Discovery Trail), the self-guided tour which introduces visitors to both the contemporary college and the history of the site and the buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCAD consists of four schools: Design, Fine Art, Visual Culture and Education which provide a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses, and research-based study up to PhD level.\n\nIn the Schools of Fine Art, Design, and Education, students enter a common First Year to undertake a three year BA (Honours) degree which includes an inter-disciplinary first semester. BA Degree specialisms are available in Ceramics & Glass, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interaction Design, Jewellery & Objects, Media, Print, Product Design, Sculpture & Expanded Practice, Textile Art & Artefact, and Textile & Surface Design. Additionally, in conjunction with School of Education, students may avail of a four year Joint Honours BA Degree (to qualify to teach at second level) in combination with any of the College's specialisms. Visual Culture is a component of all degree courses and the School of Visual Culture also offers a single (non studio-based) three year Degree pathway. There is also a Visual Culture Joint Honours option in combination with any of the College's specialisms.\nFrom the academic year 2018/19 NCAD has stated its intention to introduce Studio+ which will allow all Fine Art and Design students to take an extended four year degree which will provide options to study abroad through the Erasmus programme or to gain practical work experience in the form of industry placement on live commercial, social, or community projects in Ireland or abroad. Students will be awarded a BA in Design or Fine Art or a BA International.\n\nNCAD offers the widest range of specialist and interdisciplinary art and design Masters programmes in Ireland: MA Interaction Design; MSc Medical Device Design; MFA Design; MFA Fine Art; MA/MFA Art in the Contemporary World; MA Design History and Material Culture; Professional Master in Education (Art & Design); MA Socially Engaged Art and Further Education; \n\nCEAD offers part-time accredited (within the National Framework of Qualifications) courses and also non-credit art and design courses over a range of more than fifty options. The CEAD student body is over 500.\n\n"}

It was made into a television special, a book, and a compact disc, all with the same title. Leary's routine focuses on vegetarians, cigarette smoking, drug use, and political correctness.\n\nThe album was recorded live at Irving Plaza, New York City on October 10, 1992 and at Sorcerer Studios, New York City.\n\n\n\nThe television version of \"No Cure for Cancer\" was first broadcast by Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on February 3, 1993, followed by Showtime in the United States on February 20, then in Australia on the Nine Network on April 6, 1994.\n\nIn 2005, the DVD \"Complete Denis Leary\" was released. A collection of his most famous stand-up performances including: \"No Cure for Cancer\" and \"Lock 'n Load\". Special features include: the music videos for \"Asshole\" and \"Love Barge\", and the \"Making of No Cure for Cancer\", a documentary with Leary and others.\n\nAlthough Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks for many years, when Hicks heard \"No Cure For Cancer\", he felt that Leary had stolen his act. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.\nSeveral comedians have publicly stated they believe Leary stole Hicks' persona and attitude, in addition to his material. Jokes on the album about Keith Richards, Judas Priest, smoking and \"good men dying young\" are frequently cited as bearing similarities to Hicks' routines.\n\nIn the August 2006 \"Playboy\", an interviewer told Leary, \"Much has been written about you and comedian Bill Hicks...People have accused you of appropriating his persona and material.\" Leary replied:\n\nAccording to Cynthia True's biography \"American Scream: The Bill Hicks Story\", after listening to \"No Cure For Cancer\", Hicks was furious. \"All these years, aside from the occasional jibe, he had pretty much shrugged off Leary's lifting. Comedians borrowed, stole stuff and even bought bits from one another. Milton Berle and Robin Williams were famous for it. This was different. Leary had, practically line for line, taken huge chunks of Bill's act and \"recorded\" it.\"\n"}

The design resembles the Doge's Palace in Venice.\n\nThe foundation stone for the theater was laid September 3, 1894, a day after Odessa's one-hundred-year birthday. The building was intended as the new stock exchange, or \"New Exchange\" to replace the old stock exchange, and the vast hall was decorated with six panels by the artist Nikolai Nikolaevich Karazin (1842-1908) which depict commerce throughout various stages of history.\n\nLike the Odessa Opera Theater before it, a world competition was announced for a conceptual design of a new Odessa stock exchange. The design of Czech architect V.J. Prohaska was considered the best. But this design did not meet all of the requirements, therefore it was modified and improved by Alexander Osipovich Bernardacci.\n\nConstruction was completed in 1898. Since 1924 the building has housed the Odessa Philharmonic.\n\nThe theater can seat 1,000 people and is 15 meters high and 910 square meters. The large hall has no supporting columns, and because of this, it was one of the most expensive buildings in Odessa to build.\n\nThe main entrance is by a large open-sided, roofed gallery, called a loggia. The ceiling of this open entry is painted with the twelve symbols of the Zodiac.\n\nThe interior is paneled with dark Lebanese cedar, and the windows are set in white Carrara marble.\n\nThe theater serves as home for the Odessa Philharmonic Orchestra, which was founded in 1937. Since 1991, American Hobart Earle has conducted the orchestra.\n\nIt is an enduring myth that everyone in the city knows (and continues to promulgate) that since the building was originally designed as a Stock exchange rather than a concert hall it was made to be sound-resistant, rather than sound-conducting, in order to provide more privacy to visitors. This supposedly explains why the acoustics are rather poor, as compared with other theaters and concert halls, and performers must use microphones and amplifiers to be heard adequately. The precise and technical reasons for the acoustic problems at the hall were reported by world famous acoustics consultant Russell Johnson, the specifics of which can be found on the Philharmonic's website (http://www.odessaphilharmonic.org/pages.php?page=conc)\n\n"}

Many Pre-Columbian cultures did not have writing systems, so visual art expressed cosmologies, world views, religion, and philosophy of these cultures, as well as serving as mnemonic devices.\n\nDuring the period before and after European exploration and conquest of the Americas, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. For many of these cultures, the visual arts went beyond physical appearance and served as active extensions of their owners and indices of the divine. Artisans of the Ancient Americas drew upon a wide range of materials (obsidian, gold, spondylus shells), creating objects that included the meanings held to be inherent to the materials. These cultures often derived value from the physical qualities, rather than the imagery, of artworks, prizing aural and tactile features, the quality of workmanship, and the rarity of materials. Various works of art have been discovered large distances from their location of production, indicating that many Pre-Columbian civilizations collected items from other cultures or previous cultures. Moreover,\nmany societies used raw materials not available in the geographic location in which they were situated, suggesting difficulty of acquisition as a source of value. Unfortunately, many of the perishable surfaces, such as woven textiles, typically have not been preserved, but Precolumbian painting on ceramics, walls, and rocks have survived more frequently.\n\nThe Mesoamerican cultures are generally divided into three periods (see Mesoamerican chronology):\n\n\nThe Pre-classic period was dominated by the highly developed Olmec civilization, which flourished around 1200–400 BCE. The Olmecs produced jade figurines, and created heavy-featured, colossal heads, up to 2 meters (8 ft) high, that still stand mysteriously in the landscape. The Mesoamerican tradition of building large ceremonial centres appears to have begun under the Olmecs.\n\nDuring the Classic period the dominant Civilization was the Maya. Maya royalty commissioned artwork that commemorated their achievements and secured their place in time. Scenes depicting various rituals and historical events are embedded with hieroglyphic text to enable the viewer to identify the important figures, times and places instead of relying upon physical features that could be forgotten over time. The interpretation of the actions represented in the artwork goes hand in hand with understanding the decorative text that is woven into the picture. Unlocking this hieroglyphic text is vital as it removes anonymity and mystery from the scenes and reveals detailed records of those who held power throughout the timeline of the civilization. Like the Mississippian peoples of North America such as the Choctaw and Natchez, the Maya organized themselves into large, agricultural communities. They practised their own forms of hieroglyphic writing and even advanced astronomy. Mayan art consequently focuses on rain, agriculture, and fertility, expressing these images mainly in relief and surface decoration, as well as some sculpture. Glyphs and stylized figures were used to decorate architecture such as the pyramid temple of Chichén Itzá. Murals dating from about 750 CE were discovered when the city of Bonampak was excavated in 1946.\n\nThe Post-classic period (10th–12th centuries) was dominated by the Toltecs who made colossal, block-like sculptures such as those employed as free-standing columns at Tula, Mexico. The Mixtecs developed a style of painting known as Mixtec-Puebla, as seen in their murals and codices (manuscripts), in which all available space is covered by flat figures in geometric designs. The Aztec culture in Mexico produced some dramatically expressive examples of Aztec art, such as the decorated skulls of captives and stone sculpture, of which Tlazolteotl (Woods Bliss Collection, Washington), a goddess in childbirth, is a good example.\nIn the Andean region of South America (modern-day Peru), the Chavín civilization flourished from around 1000 BCE to 300 BCE. The Chavín produced small-scale pottery, often human in shape but with animal features such as bird feet, reptilian eyes, or feline fangs. Representations of jaguar are a common theme in Chavín art. The Chavin culture is also noted for the spectacular murals and carvings found its main religious site of Chavin de Huantar; these works include the Raimondi Stela, the Lanzón, and the Tello Obelisk.\n\nContemporary with the Chavin was the Paracas culture of the southern coast of Peru, most noted today for their elaborate textiles. These amazing productions, some of which could measure ninety feet long, were primarily used for as burial wraps for Paracas mummy bundles. Paracas art was greatly influenced by the Chavín cult, and the two styles share many common motifs.\n\nOn the south coast, the Paracas were immediately succeeded by a flowering of artistic production around the Nazca river valley. The Nazca period is divided into eight ceramic phases, each one depicting increasingly abstract animal and human motifs. These period range from Phase 1, beginning around 200 CE, to Phase 8, which declined in the middle of the eighth century. The Nasca people are most famous for the Nazca lines, though they are usually regarded as making some of the most beautiful polychrome ceramics in the Andes.\n\nOn the north coast, the Moche succeeded the Chavin. The Moche flourished about 100–800 CE, and were among the best artisans of the Pre-Columbian world, producing delightful portrait vases (Moche ware), which, while realistic, are steeped in religious references, the significance of which is now lost. For the Moche, ceramics functioned as a primary way of disseminating information and cultural ideas. The Moche made ceramic vessels that depicted and re-created a plethora of objects: fruits, plants, animals, human portrais, gods, demons, as well as graphic depictions of sexual acts. The Moche are also noted for their metallurgy (such as that found in the tomb of the Lord of Sípan), as well as their architectural prowess, such as the Huaca de la Luna and the Huaca del Sol in the Moche River valley.\n\nFollowing the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the Wari (or Huari) Empire, based in their capital city of the same name. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the Staff God, an important deity in the Andes which during the Wari period had become specifically associated with the Lake Titicaca region on the modern Peru-Bolivia border. Similarly, the Wari's contemporaries of the Tiwanaku empire, also centered around a capital city of the same name, held the Staff God in similar esteem. Tiwanaku's empire began to expand out of Titicaca around 400 BCE, but its \"Classic Period\" of artistic production and political power occurred between 375 and 700 CE. Tiwanaku is currently known for its magnificent imperial city on the southern side of Lake Titicaca, now in modern-day Bolivia. Especially famous is the Gate of the Sun, which depicts a large image of the Staff God flanked by other religious symbols which may have functioned as a calendar.\n\nFollowing the decline of the Wari Empire in the late first millennium, the Chimú people, centered out of their capital city of Chimor began to build their empire on the north and central coasts of Peru. The Chimú were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as Sicán (700-900 CE) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chimú in the early second millennium. The Chimú produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chimú also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chimú. The Chimú are best known for their magnificent palatial complex of Chan Chan just south of modern-day Trujillo, Peru; now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Chimú went into decline very quickly due to outside pressures and conquest from the expanding Inca Empire in the mid-15th century.\n\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest, the Inca Empire (Tawantinsuyu in Quechua, the \"Land of the Four Quarters\") was the largest and wealthiest empire in the world, and this was depicted in their art. Most Inca sculpture was melted down by the invading Spanish, so most of what remains today is in the form of architecture, textiles, and ceramics. The Inca valued gold among all other metals, and equated it with the sun god Inti. Some Inca buildings in the capital of Cusco were literally covered in gold, and most contained many gold and silver sculptures. Most Inca art, however, was abstract in nature. Inca ceramics were primarily large vessels covered in geometric designs. Inca tunics and textiles contained similar motifs, often checkerboard patterns reserved for the Inca elite and the Inca army. Today, due to the unpopularity of abstract art and the lack of Inca gold and silver sculpture, the Inca are best known for the architecture - specifically the complex of Machu Picchu just northwest of Cusco. Inca architecture makes use of large stone blocks, each one cut specifically to fit around the other blocks in a wall. These stones were cut with such precision that the Incas did not need to make use of mortar to hold their buildings together. Even without mortar, Inca buildings still stand today; they form many of the foundations for even modern-day buildings in Cusco and the surrounding area. The Incas produced thousand of large stone structures, among them forts, temples, and palaces, even though the Inca Empire lasted for only ninety-five years.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It opened on 18 November 1862 and functioned for 20 years, during which time over 5,000 performances were presented. Between 1866 and 1876 the theatre staged the premieres of four of Bedřich Smetana's operas, including \"The Bartered Bride\". The Provisional Theatre building was eventually incorporated into the structure of the National Theatre, which opened its doors on 11 June 1881.\n\nBefore the early 1860s almost all cultural institutions in Prague, including theatre and opera, were in Austrian hands. Bohemia was a province of the Habsburg Empire, and under that regime's absolutist rule most aspects of Czech culture and national life had been discouraged or suppressed. Absolutism was formally abolished by a decree of the Emperor Franz Josef on 20 October 1860, which led to a Czech cultural revival. The Bohemian \"Diet\" (parliament) had acquired a site in Prague on the banks of the Vltava, and in 1861 announced a public subscription, which raised a sum of 106,000 gulden. This covered the costs of building a small 800-seat theatre, which would act as a home for production of Czech drama and opera while longer-term plans for a permanent National Theatre could be implemented.\nThe Provisional Theatre opened on 18 November 1862, with a performance of Vítězslav Hálek's tragic drama \"King Vukašín\". Since there was at the time no Czech opera deemed suitable, the first opera performed at the theatre, on 20 November 1862, was Cherubini's \"Les deux journées\". For the first year or so of its life, the Provisional Theatre alternated opera with straight plays on a daily basis, but from the start of 1864 opera performances were given daily.\n\nThe first principal conductor (or musical director) of the Provisional Theatre, appointed in the autumn of 1862, was Jan Nepomuk Maýr – to the disappointment of Smetana, who had hoped for the position himself. Maýr held the position until September 1866; his tenure was marked by a professional rivalry with Smetana, who criticised the theatre's conservatism and failure to fulfil its mission to promote Czech opera. Maýr retaliated by refusing to conduct Smetana's \"The Brandenburgers in Bohemia\". A change in the theatre's management in 1866 led to Maýr's removal and replacement by Smetana, who held the post for eight years. Maýr's bias in favour of Italian opera was replaced by Smetana's more balanced repertoire, which mixed Italian, German and French pieces with such Slavonic and Czech works as he could find. Apart from his own compositions (\"The Bartered Bride\", \"The Brandenburgers in Bohemia\" and \"Dalibor\", Smetana introduced works by the Czech composers Lepold Eugen Měchura and Josef Rozkošný, but was nevertheless attacked by some parts of the music establishment for giving insufficient encouragement to native talent. Efforts to remove him from his post, and to reinstate Maýr, were unsuccessful.\n\nSmetana was responsible for the establishment of an independent school attached to the theatre. He became the school's director and professor of theory. However, in 1874 Smetana became afflicted with deafness, which forced him to yield his duties as principal conductor to his assistant Adolf Čech, and to resign his post later that year. Maýr was reappointed to the conductorship; he had no interest in the school, which subsequently closed. The Provisional Theatre continued as the main venue for Czech opera, several of Antonín Dvořák's works being premiered there. In 1881 the theatre was incorporated into the Czech National Theatre building, which opened on 11 June. Shortly thereafter the new building was badly damaged by fire and remained closed for two years. During this period the Provisional Theatre continued to operate, using other theatre premises. During its lifetime the Provisional theatre mounted more than 5,000 performances.\n\n"}

A (female: ) is a craftsperson who makes the image. Some ' which have gained greater public devotion among the faithful have also merited papal approval through canonical coronations. ' remain a living tradition of religious iconography and folk art in Mexico, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and some other Caribbean islands, South and Central America, and the Southwestern United States, especially New Mexico.\n\nIcons and other religious images were crucial for the conversions of indigenous peoples to Roman Catholic Church, which was itself an integral part of the Spanish colonization of the Americas. However, long distances, inefficient methods of transportation, and high demand for such artworks limited the ability of ecclesiastical authorities to supply parish churches, especially those in remote outposts, with works of religious art from the Kingdom of Spain.\nThe practice of creating ' began in Spain, where mannequin-style religious images were commonly vested in ornate religious clothing, often expensive and funded by religious devotees. An early known example is the 1555 statue of Infant Jesus of Prague, already vested during the time of Saint Teresa of Avila. Customarily, jewels are various accessories were also added onto larger ', a tradition still carried on today. While larger pieces are typically used in churches, many smaller ones are personal or family items of reverence, or kept as decorations. \" are also common throughout Latin America, the Spanish Caribbean, and the Southwestern United States, as well as the Philippines, with distinct styles and traditions in each area.\n\n\" statues and statuettes, carved in the round, are commonly known as or informally as . They are usually made of wood. Larger scenic pieces, including multiple statues or done in bas relief, or simply painted on wood panels, and which may include non-figural iconography, are called , originally altar backboards or screens, though today often adapted to secular artistic purposes in the Chicano art movement .\n\nAmong ', two distinct types are often noted, the ('frame', 'structure') style, a mannequin intended to be dressed with clothing and accessories, and the ('detailed') style, with adornments painted on permanently (though sometimes also featuring added items). ' often have interchangeable or posable arms, and sometimes feature a cage-like lattice (thus the name) to hold and shape the vestments.\n\nIvory was often cited as the best and most expensive material for carving '. Elephant ivory, especially of African origin, has been restricted or banned from sale, distribution, or commercialization in Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and many other countries. While exact laws vary by jurisdiction (from total bans to legal sale of antiques only), ivory is now rarely used. While the most economical modern type of ' are made of resin or fiberglass, and mass-produced, traditional examples are still made primarily of wood, sometimes with metal accessories.\n\nThe ' culture in the Philippines is widely prevalent among Filipino Catholics, having been influenced by centuries of Spain colonial rule and various forms of folk Catholicism. The earliest recorded vested ' in the Philippines is the Santo Niño de Cebu, a baptismal gift given by Ferdinand Magellan to Rajah Humabon's consort in 1521.\n\nIn the Spanish period, only the nobility (such as the ') and the rich could afford to have Santo, due to their elaborate ornamentation and design. The procurement and maintenance of Santo is today still considered costly, with the most expensive type of Santo are ones made of ' (ivory). From a religious perspective, the practice of owning and maintaining ' images are often regarded as a mild Catechism for people, especially with regards to the iconographic attributes attached to specific images. A custodian or family of custodians of a ' are termed ' (female: ', plural \"), which in modern Spanish means 'waiting staff'.\n\nThe most well-known ' in the Philippines are often Marian titles, such Our Lady of Manaoag and Our Lady of La Naval de Manila, while those of Jesus Christ are the Santo Niño de Cebu and the Black Nazarene. ' (cottonfruit, \"Sandoricum koetjape\") is a favorite material for the figures in the Philippines, as is the wood of \"Elaeocarpus calomala\", while \"\" (\"Litsea leytensis\") wood is highly sought after and more expensive, given its resistance to termites.\n\nThe tradition of wooden ' carving was preserved as a folk art in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado, where isolated villages remain relatively secluded to this day. Of particular note is the village of Cordova, New Mexico which has produced several well-known '; one was George López, who was awarded the National Heritage Fellowship by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1982.\n\nIn this region, traditional ', unless made for specific church needs, are usually small, and intended for the home, or for the local church or .

They are most often made of cottonwood, pine or aspen. Many are multi-piece, with hands, head, and other details carved separately and added to a body that is otherwise carved from single block of wood. Nevertheless, the region also has a long tradition of larger, articulated, and often bloody Crucifixion '. A ' usually carves a ' with a knife or other wood carving tools, and then covers it with gesso, a mixture of native gypsum and glue, to prepare it for painting. Some contemporary ' still use paints from homemade pigments.\n\nSome ' supplement their income by making ' to sell to tourists, especially at the annual Santa Fe International Folk Art Market and Spanish Market, including whimsical items, such as ' of Saint Patrick, who does not figure in Spanish Catholicism. One such ' figurine, by Santa Fe ' Frank Brito Sr. (1022–2005) is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Museum of American Art since 1997,; many more traditional ' and other carvings by him are in the Museum of International Folk Art, along with those of other ' from various parts of the world. Entire Nativity scenes in ' style are also popular tourist items.\n\nThe wardrobe items of more elaborate ', especially \" mannequins, are often expensive, such as the ones woven with gold thread; the most expensive type is known in the Philippines as \" (Tagalog: 'wormed'), which uses a form of French gold bullion thread to make embroidered floral patterns on the statue's clothing.\n\nHeaddresses are also an integral part of a ', often encrusted with costume jewelry (such as paste and rhinestones) or real precious stones, to symbolize the spiritual wealth of the saint.

{"id": "97079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97079", "title": "Shango", "text": "Shango\n\nṢàngó (Yoruba language: Ṣàngó, also known as Changó or Xangô in Latin America; and also known as Jakuta or Badé) (from '=shan, 'to strike') is an Orisha. He is syncretized with either Saint Barbara or Saint Jerome. Historically, Shango is a royal ancestor of the Yoruba as he was the third Alafin of the Oyo Kingdom prior to his posthumous deification. Ṣàngó has numerous manifestations including Airá, Agodo, Afonja, Lubé, and Obomin. He is considered to be one of the most powerful rulers that Yorubaland has ever produced, and is noted for his anger.\n\nJakuta was the third Alafin of Oyo, following Oranmiyan and Ajaka. Jakuta brought prosperity to the Oyo Empire. According to Professor Mason's \"Mythological Account of Heroes and Kings\", unlike his peaceful brother Ajaka, Jakuta (meaning: someone who fought with stones) was a powerful and violent ruler. He reigned for seven years which were marked by his continuous campaigns and many battles. His reign ended due to his inadvertent destruction of his palace by lightning. He had three wives, namely Princess Oshun, Princess Oba, and Princess Oya. The Oyo Empire declined in the 19th century, which led to the enslavement of its people by the Fulani and the Fon. Among them were many followers of Ṣàngó, and worship of the deity thrives in the New World as a result. Strong devotion to Ṣàngó led to Yoruba religions in Trinidad and Recife, Brazil being named after the deity.\n\nIn Yorubaland, Sango is worshiped on the fifth day of the week in which is named Ojo Jakuta. Ritual worship foods include guguru, bitter cola, àmàlà, and gbegiri soup. Also, he is worshiped with the Bata drum. One significant thing about this deity is that he is worshiped using red clothing, just as he is said to have admired red attire during his lifetime.\n\nṢàngó is viewed as the most powerful and feared of the orisha pantheon. He casts a \"thundersone\" to earth, which creates thunder and lightning, to anyone who offends him. Worshippers in Yorubaland in Nigeria do not eat cowpea because they believe that the wrath of the god of iron would descend on them. The Ṣàngó god necklaces are composed in varying patterns of red and white beads; usually in groupings of four or six which are his sacred numbers. Rocks created by lightning strikes are venerated by Ṣàngó worshipers; these stones, if found, are maintained at sacred sites and used in rituals. Ṣàngó is called on during coronation ceremonies in Nigeria to the present day.\n\nṢàngó is venerated in Santería and Haiti as \"Chango\". As in the Yoruba religion, Chango is the most feared god in Santería.\n\nIn Haïti, he is from the \"Nago\" Nation, as Ogou. Palo recognizes him as \"Siete Rayos\".\n\nṢàngó is known as Xangô in the Candomblé pantheon. He is said to be the son of Oranyan, and his wives include Oya, Oshun, and Oba, as in the Yoruba tradition. Xangô took on strong importance among slaves in Brazil for his qualities of strength, resistance, and aggression. He is noted as the god of lightning and thunder. He became the patron orixa of plantations and many Candomblé terreiros. In contrast Oko, the orixá of agriculture, found little favor among slaves in Brazil and has few followers in the Americas. The main barracão of Ilê Axé Iyá Nassô Oká, or the terreiro Casa Branca, is dedicated to Xangô. Xangô is depicted with an \"oxê\", or double-sided ax similar to a labrys; a brass crown.\n\n\nAmalá, also known as \"amalá de Xangô\", is the ritual dish offered to the orixá. It is a stew made of chopped okra, onion, dried shrimp, and palm oil. Amalá is served on Wednesday at the \"pegi\", or altar, on a large tray, traditionally decorated with 12 upright uncooked okra. Due to ritual prohibitions, the dish may not be offered on a wooden tray or accompanied by bitter kola. Amalá de Xangô may also be prepared with the addition of beef, specifically an ox tail. Amalá de Xangô is different than àmàlà, a dish common to Yoruba areas of Nigeria.\n\nXangô is depicted with an oxê, also known as the \"oxê de Xangô\".

{"id": "11999451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11999451", "title": "Speculum Humanae Salvationis", "text": "Speculum Humanae Salvationis\n\nThe Speculum Humanae Salvationis or \"Mirror of Human Salvation\" was a bestselling anonymous illustrated work of popular theology in the late Middle Ages, part of the genre of encyclopedic speculum literature, in this case concentrating on the medieval theory of typology, whereby the events of the Old Testament prefigured, or foretold, the events of the New Testament. The original version is in rhyming Latin verse, and contains a series of New Testament events each with three Old Testament ones that prefigure it. It is one of the most common books found as an illuminated manuscript, and also in early printing in both blockbook and incunabulum forms.\n\nAfter a short Prologue (two pages) and Prohemium (four), both unillustrated, the first two chapters deal with the Creation, the Fall of Satan, the story of Adam and Eve and the in four pages. Then follow forty more double-page chapters where a New Testament event is compared with three from the Old Testament, with four pictures each above a column of text. Usually each chapter occupies one two page opening. The last three chapters cover the Seven Stations of the Cross, and the Seven Joys and Sorrows of Mary, at double this length. In all a complete standard version has fifty-two leaves, or 104 pages, and 192 illustrations (including a blank page at the beginning and end). The blockbook editions were much shorter, with 116 pictures, two to a woodblock. \n\nThe writing of the text follows an exact scheme: twenty-five lines per column, with two columns per page, one under each miniature, so a hundred lines per standard chapter. Sometimes there are captions over the pictures as well, of varying content. Many copies reduced the original text, often by omitting the non-standard chapters at the beginning or end, whilst others boosted the content with calendars and commentaries, or extra illustrations.\n\nThe work originated between 1309, as a reference to the Pope being at Avignon indicates, and 1324, the date on two copies. A preface, probably from the original manuscript, says the author does not give his name out of humility, though numerous suggestions have been made. He was almost certainly a cleric, and there is evidence he was a Dominican. Ludolph of Saxony is a leading candidate for authorship, and Vincent of Beauvais has also been suggested. \n\nThe first versions are naturally in illuminated manuscript form, and in Latin. Many copies were made, and several hundred still survive (over 350 in Latin alone), often in translations into different vernacular languages; at least four different translations into French were made, and at least two into English. There were also translations into German, Dutch, and Czech. \n\nManuscript versions covered the whole range of the manuscript market: some are lavishly and expensively decorated, for a de luxe market, whilst in many the illustrations are simple, and without colour. In particular, superb Flemish editions were produced in the 15th century for Philip the Good and other wealthy bibliophiles. The \"Speculum\" is probably the most popular title in this particular market of illustrated popular theology, competing especially with the \"Biblia pauperum\" and the \"Ars moriendi\" for the accolade.\n\nIn the 15th century, with the advent of printing, the work then appeared in four blockbook editions, two Latin and two in Dutch, and then in sixteen incunabulum editions by 1500. The blockbooks present unique questions as only editions of this work combine hand-rubbed woodcut pages with text pages printed in movable type. Further eccentricities include a run of twenty pages in one edition which are text cut as a woodcut, based on tracings of pages from another edition printed with movable type. Though the circumstances of production of these editions are unknown, two of the editions are in Dutch and the Netherlands was probably the centre of production, as with most blockbooks. Hind places them in Holland, from about 1470–75. It appears the \"Prohemium\" may have been sold separately as a pamphlet, as one version speaks of the usefulness of it for \"poor preachers who cannot afford the entire book\". \n\nThe incunabulum editions, from eleven different presses, mostly, but not all, printed their woodcut illustrations in the printing press with the text. Some seem to have been printed in two sessions for texts and images. Günther Zainer of Augsburg, a specialist in popular illustrated works, produced the first one in 1473, in Latin and German, and with a metrical summary newly added for each chapter; this is considered an especially beautiful edition. Further incunabulum editions include Latin, German, French, Spanish and Dutch versions, and it was the first illustrated book printed in both Switzerland, at Basel, and France, at Lyon, which used the Basel picture blocks, later also used in Spain. A Speyer edition has woodcuts whose design has been attributed to the Master of the Housebook. In addition, the first of the somewhat legendary editions supposedly produced by Laurens Janszoon Coster, working earlier than Johannes Gutenberg, was a \"Speculum\". Even if the Coster story is ignored, the work seems to have been the first printed in the Netherlands, probably in the early 1470s. Editions continued to be printed until the Reformation, which changed the nature of religious devotion on both sides of the Catholic/Protestant divide, and made the \"Speculum\" seem outdated.\n\nThe images in the \"Speculum\" were treated in many different styles and media over the course of the two centuries of its popularity, but generally the essentials of the compositions remained fairly stable, partly because most images had to retain their correspondence with their opposite number, and often the figures were posed to highlight these correspondences. Many works of art in other media can be seen to be derived from the illustrations; it was for example, the evident source for depictions for the \"Vision of Augustus\" in Rogier van der Weyden's \"Bladelin Altarpiece\" and other Early Netherlandish works. In particular the work was used as a pattern-book for stained glass, but also for tapestries and sculpture.\n\n"}

{"id": "7254135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7254135", "title": "The Brus", "text": "The Brus\n\nThe Brus, also known as The Bruce, is a long narrative poem, in Early Scots, of just under 14,000 octosyllabic lines composed by John Barbour which gives a historic and chivalric account of the actions of Robert the Bruce and the Black Douglas in the Scottish Wars of Independence during a period from the circumstances leading up the English invasion of 1296 through to Scotland's restored position in the years between the Truce of 1328 and the death of Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray in 1332.\n\nThe poem's centre-piece (literally) is an extensive account of the Battle of Bannockburn of 1314. Barbour's poetic account of these events is a keystone in Scotland's national story. The description of the battle is Barbour’s masterpiece.\n\nThe poem was written about 1375, \"...to throw behind the new king, Robert II (who gave Barbour a pension) the weight of his grandfather's (Bruce's) achievements and reputation.\" Barbour's work is a romance based upon a lost life of Douglas and a chronicle or chronicles which told of King Robert and his times. At the beginning of the poem, he conflates three Bruces into the single person of the hero, probably by design. Archie Duncan notes Barbour's fondness for exaggerated numbers for the size of any army. Here and there the order of events is transposed. Despite this, it has been regarded from his own time as, in all details, a trustworthy source for the history of the period.\n\nThroughout the piece, Bruce overshadows all his associates. In book nine, in recounting Edward Bruce's victories in Galloway, Barbour does not relate the whole story, but sums up his worthiness by remarking that \"he might have rivaled any of his contemporaries \"excepting only his brother\"\". The king is a hero of the chivalric type common in contemporary romance; freedom is a \"noble thing\" to be sought and won at all costs; the opponents of such freedom are shown in the dark colours which history and poetic propriety require; but there is none of the complacency of the merely provincial habit of mind. The lines do not lack vigour; and there are passages of high merit, notably the oft-quoted section beginning \"A! fredome is a noble thing\".\n\nDespite a number of errors of fact, the account has a greater degree of historical veracity than is usually associated with the verse-chronicle genre (for instance, Blind Harry's Wallace composed in the following century). But it is much more than a rhyming chronicle; it contains many fine descriptive passages, and sings the praises of freedom. Its style is somewhat bald and severe. No one has doubted Barbour's authorship of the Brus, but argument has been attempted to show that the text as we have it is an edited copy, perhaps by John Ramsay, a Perth scribe, who wrote out the two extant texts, one preserved in the Advocates Library, Edinburgh, and the other in the library of St John's College, Cambridge.\n\nBarbour's influence on later Scottish writers can be seen in Walter Scott's \"Lord of the Isles\" and \"Castle Dangerous\".\n\nText from \"The Brus\"<br>\nby Barbour (1375 Transcribed by Ramsay in 1489)<br>\n(a) THE POET’S PROEM.\n\nStoryß to rede ar delitabill,<br>\nsuppoß þat þai be nocht bot fabill,<br>\nþan suld storyß þat suthfast wer,<br>\nAnd þai war said on gud maner,<br>\nHawe doubill plesance in heryng.<br>\nþe fyrst plesance is þe carpyng,<br>\nAnd þe toþir þe suthfastnes,<br>\nþat schawys þe thing rycht as it wes;<br>\nAnd suth thyngis þat ar likand<br>\nTyll mannys heryng ar plesand.<br>\nþarfor I wald fayne set my will,<br>\nGiff my wyt mycht suffice þartill,<br>\nTo put in wryt a suthfast story,<br>\nþat it lest ay furth in memory,<br>\nSwa þat na length of tyme it let,<br>\nna ger it haly be forȝet.<br>\nFor auld storys þat men redys,<br>\nRepresentis to þaim þe dedys<br>\nOf stalwart folk þat lywyt ar,<br>\nRycht as þai þan in presence war.<br>\nAnd, certis, þai suld weill hawe pryß<br>\nþat in þar tyme war wycht and wyß,<br>\nAnd led thar lyff in gret trawaill,<br>\nAnd oft in hard stour off bataill<br>\nWan [richt] gret price off chewalry,<br>\nAnd war woydit off cowardy.<br>\nAs wes king Robert off Scotland,<br>\nþat hardy wes off hart and hand;<br>\nAnd gud Schyr Iames off Douglas,<br>\nþat in his tyme sa worthy was,<br>\nþat off hys price & hys bounte<br>\nIn fer landis renoenyt wes he.<br>\nOff þaim I thynk þis buk to ma;<br>\nNow god gyff grace þat I may swa<br>\nTret it, and bryng it till endyng,<br>\nþat I say nocht bot suthfast thing!\n\n\n"}

The explanatory inscription provided by Burne-Jones tells the viewer \"of a knight who forgave his enemy when he might have destroyed him and how the image of Christ kissed him in token that his acts had pleased God.\" \n\nJohn Gualbert was an Italian Roman Catholic saint, the founder of the Vallumbrosan Order. He was a member of the Visdomini family of Florentine nobility. One Good Friday he was entering Florence accompanied by armed followers, when in a narrow lane he came upon a man who had killed his brother. He was about to kill the man in revenge, when the other fell upon his knees with arms outstretched in the form of a cross and begged for mercy in the name of Christ, who had been crucified on that day. John forgave him. He entered the Benedictine Church at San Miniato to pray, and the figure on the crucifix bowed its head to him in recognition of his generosity. John Gualbert was later canonised.\n\nThis arguably being Burne-Jones's most important early work, it demonstrates a new and more personal style, evident in its design, technique and expression. It remained Burne-Jones's own favourite among his early works: this interest in knights and chivalry was aroused when painting the Arthurian Oxford Union murals in 1863 and was to remain with him throughout his life. In 1894 he tried to borrow \"The Merciful Knight\" to make a large oil version, and he was actually working on \"The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon\" when he died in 1898.\n\nIn Burne-Jones preliminary sketches for \"The Merciful Knight\", the kiss given by Christ is far more passionate, with strong homoerotic overtones. In this finished version, painted in gouache, the kiss became protective and deeply caring, without any sexual implications. The beard of Christ provides a shield over the knight's forehead and inexpressibly sad face; the wounds in Christ's hands draw attention to the vulnerability of the knight's exposed hands – whose armoured gauntlets hang from his waist. Incidentally, the marigolds in the foreground came from the 'town garden' in Russell Square, close to Burne-Jones' house opposite the British Museum.\n\n\n\n"}

The documentary is written and directed by Stephen K. Bannon. \"The Undefeated\" was released on , 2011.\n\nThe film is constructed in three acts. The film opens with a montage. The first act concerns itself with Palin's term as mayor of Wasilla. The second act is about Palin's half term as governor of Alaska. The third act, titled \"From here, I can see November,\" revolves around her candidacy for vice-president and her rise to national prominence. It goes into detail how she became the darling of the Tea Party movement. The film ends with clips of the Madison rally where Palin challenged Republicans to: \"Fight like a girl.\" The last shot is of Palin saying into the camera, \"Mr. President, game on!\"\n\nStephen K. Bannon wrote and directed \"The Undefeated\", which was independently financed by Victory Film Group. Sarah Palin was familiar with Bannon because of his Tea Party documentary \"Generation Zero\". After the United States elections in November 2010, when the Republican Party increased their seats in Congress, Palin asked her aide, Rebecca Mansour, to contact Bannon about creating a series of videos to explain Palin's stepping down as Governor of Alaska and to \"protect her legacy\" to set up for a potential campaign for the 2012 United States presidential election. Bannon instead decided to produce a feature film about Sarah Palin and provided of his own financing. For the documentary, he interviewed Palin's supporters, including Alaskan residents and conservative bloggers like Andrew Breitbart. While Sarah Palin and her team were not part of the production, they gave Bannon's documentary their blessing. Bannon bought audio rights to Palin's book \"Going Rogue\" so he could include clips of Palin's voice in the documentary. While he considered titling the documentary \"Take a Stand\" after Palin's campaign slogan during the 2006 Alaska gubernatorial election, he chose \"The Undefeated\" as a \"more triumphant\" title.\n\nWes Little of CNN describes some of the imagery in the film: \"Clockwork Orange\"-esque evocative images sprinkled throughout (shark attacks, bodies being buried, warfare both modern and ancient).\"\n\nArc Entertainment released \"The Undefeated\" on , 2011 in AMC theaters in Dallas, Denver, Oklahoma City, Orlando, Atlanta, Orange County, Phoenix, Houston, Indianapolis, and Kansas City. Before the commercial release, the documentary had one-night screenings at select theaters in the states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. On June 17, the movie premiered to attendees of the RightOnline convention in Minneapolis.\n\nThere are two versions of the documentary: one version rated PG-13 by the MPAA, and an unedited version featuring anti-Palin clips from Rosie O'Donnell, Matt Damon, Bill Maher, David Letterman, Howard Stern and Louis C.K.\n\n\"The Politico\" reported that professional film critics greeted it with \"a chorus of boos\", describing the film as 'biased', 'hagiographic', and \"propaganda\". The film currently holds a 0% approval rating on the movie review website Rotten Tomatoes and a 32 out of 100 on the review aggregator Metacritic. John Wilson, creator of the Golden Raspberry Award, said in a pre-screening comment, \"Sarah Palin is what the Razzies are all about.\" \"New York Post\" critic Kyle Smith described the film as \"massively flawed\", and said, \"I don't know why Sarah Palin called her movie 'The Undefeated'. She lost the vice presidency, she quit the governorship of Alaska and she cut her bus tour short. The title makes no sense. \"Time\" critic Richard Corliss, who panned the film, stated \"Bannon applies so much idolatrous airbrushing to his portrait of the divine Sarah that the movie might be called Going Rouge. But he is canny in identifying the 2½-year governor of Alaska as both a faultless heroine and, even better, a victim of the omnipotent American left... in Bannon's version of things, Palin fights the good fight, beats the fat cats and trumpets the pioneer independence of Alaskans from the predatory federal government — a government that, by the way, returns $1.84 in aid to the state for every dollar it sends to Washington...\"\n\nThe film was given a limited theatrical release in ten AMC theaters located in areas with strong Tea Party support, and was received positively there, Victory Film Group reported that the film averaged $5,000 per screen in the first two days of release. \"The Undefeated\" grossed $60,000-75,000, averaging $6,000 to $7,500 per screen. In larger markets, the film surpassed $10,000 per screen, and at least one theater played the film on two screens to meet demand. However, by the second week of release box office revenue declined by 63% despite a 40% increase in theaters showing the film, with a total gross of only $24,000. Palin announced she would not run for president on October 5, 2011, shortly before the film's DVD release.\n\nConservative political commentators generally praised the film. Tony Lee wrote in \"Human Events\" that \"Undefeated\" will \"reaffirm what Palin supporters like about her while presenting a solid case to those who may be on the fence about Palin that she cannot only be a strong executive but that she can and has had a history of winning over independents.\" He found the pivotal moment in the movie was when Mark Levin compared Palin to Ronald Reagan noting that Palin and Reagan share the same type of detractors. Jedediah Bila wrote in \"The Daily Caller\" that the film is \"a compelling, thought-provoking journey through the accomplishments of a competent, ambitious, principled woman who entered the political arena for the right reasons and has consistently cut through the nonsense to get things done.\" She compliments Bannon on the segments dealing with Palin's 2008 Republican National Convention and 2011 Wisconsin Tea Party rally speeches writing, \"[the speeches] impact viewers with renewed meaning.\"\n\n"}

Jackson, Doc Shaw and Jim Belushi. It was released on August 24, 2012.\n\nBrian is a 16-year-old living in Oklahoma. Though he has tried out for the school basketball team, the Eagles, he has never made it, resigned to being water boy for the team. While practicing at home, Brian's sister makes a video of him injuring himself. She shows the video around school, and it is eventually seen by Connor, the star player of the basketball team. Brian takes a liking to Isabelle, a new girl at school, but is embarrassed when Connor shows the video of him to the whole school. In order to cheer him up, Brian's dad takes him to a Thunder game against the Detroit Pistons at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.\n\nAt halftime, Brian is chosen to shoot a half-court shot which he misses and hits Rumble, the mascot in the process. Later on, he meets Kevin Durant and expresses his desire to play just like him. When Durant signs the special edition Oklahoma City Thunder basketball that Brian got to shoot the half-court shot with, a surge of energy causes Durant's talent to transfer to Brian when he hands it over. The Thunder lose the game, with Durant shooting 0-13 in the 2nd half.\n\nThe next morning, Brian learns that Connor, who was at the game, recorded him missing the half-court shot and posted it online. Later that night he goes out to a carnival and sees Connor fail to hit shots to win a prize for the new girl, Isabelle. Connor challenges him to \"do better\", which Brian is able to do, winning a prize which he then gives to Isabelle. Meanwhile, Durant's performance declines at practices, but insists he's only in a slump.\n\nAfter making several impressive shots at home, Brian decides to try out for the Eagles again. The coach, impressed by Brian's new skill, has Brian replace Connor as the team captain, and they win several games. Durant's agent learns of Brian and realizes that he is the same kid who missed the half-court shot. He tracks him down and explains that he believes Brian stole Durant's talent. He arranges for Durant and Brian to practice together to try to reverse it, but all attempts fail.\n\nShortly before the final game, Brian and Isabelle begin fighting about how Brian has changed. Eventually, Brian goes to apologize and, while watching the video of him missing the half-court shot at her house, realizes what has to be done to give Durant his talent back. He rides his bike all the way to Chesapeake Arena and finds Durant. He explains that he hit Rumble before the transfer, and theorized that was what had to happen to reverse it. Brian hits Rumble with exactly the same ball he used to shoot the half-court shot, and then repeats the conversation that he had with Durant at their first meeting. Durant gets his talent back, and the Thunder qualify for the playoffs.\n\nAt the final game for the Eagles, Brian is nervous about playing because he no longer has the talent. Though he plays rather poorly, with help from the other team members, including Connor, he still manages to lead his team to a close game and taking the final shot himself, makes the game-winning shot which sends the Eagles to the state playoffs for the first time in 32 years. Brian, who is gradually getting better at basketball, is later seen playing with Durant.\n\n\nWhile shooting the film, Durant said that the hardest part was not the acting, but rather that he had to miss jump shots on purpose for the film, to indicate that he no longer had the ability to play basketball as well as he used to.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reports that two of 10 critics praised the film with an average score of 4.2/10. The audience gave the film a \"fresh\" 70% rating.\n"}
