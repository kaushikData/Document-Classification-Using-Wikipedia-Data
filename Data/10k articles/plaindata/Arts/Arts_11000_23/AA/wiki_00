{"id": "2121098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2121098", "title": "Aftertaste", "text": "Aftertaste\n\nAftertaste is the taste intensity of a food or beverage that is perceived immediately after that food or beverage is removed from the mouth. The aftertastes of different foods and beverages can vary by intensity and over time, but the unifying feature of aftertaste is that it is perceived \"after\" a food or beverage is either swallowed or spat out. The neurobiological mechanisms of taste (and aftertaste) signal transduction from the taste receptors in the mouth to the brain have not yet been fully understood. However, the primary taste processing area located in the insula has been observed to be involved in aftertaste perception.\n\nCharacteristics of a food's aftertaste are quality, intensity, and duration. Quality describes the actual taste of a food and intensity conveys the magnitude of that taste. Duration describes how long a food's aftertaste sensation lasts. Foods that have lingering aftertastes typically have long sensation durations.\n\nBecause taste perception is unique to every person, descriptors for taste quality and intensity have been standardized, particularly for use in scientific studies. For taste quality, foods can be described by the commonly used terms \"sweet\", \"sour\", \"salty\", \"bitter\", \"umami\", or \"no taste\". Description of aftertaste perception relies heavily upon the use of these words to convey the taste that is being sensed after a food has been removed from the mouth.\n\nThe description of taste intensity is also subject to variability among individuals. Variations of the Borg Category Ratio Scale or other similar metrics are often used to assess the intensities of foods. The scales typically have categories that range from either zero or one through ten (or sometimes beyond ten) that describe the taste intensity of a food. A score of zero or one would correspond to unnoticeable or weak taste intensities, while a higher score would correspond to moderate or strong taste intensities. It is the prolonged moderate or strong taste intensities that persist even after a food is no longer present in the mouth that describe aftertaste sensation.\n\nFoods that have distinct aftertastes are distinguished by their temporal profiles, or how long their tastes are perceived during and after consumption. A sample testing procedure to measure a food's temporal profile would entail first recording the time of onset for initial taste perception when the food is consumed, and then recording the time at which there is no longer any perceived taste. The difference between these two values yields the total time of taste perception. Match this with intensity assessments over the same time interval and a representation of the food's taste intensity over time can be obtained. With respect to aftertaste, this type of testing would have to measure the onset of taste perception from the point after which the food was removed from the mouth.\n\nThe categorization of people into \"tasters\" or \"nontasters\" based on their sensitivity to the bitterness of propylthiouracil and the expression of fungiform papillae on their tongues has suggested that the variations from person-to-person observed in taste perception are genetically based.< If so, then sensations of aftertaste could also be affected by the activities of specific genes that affect an individual's perception of different foods. For example, the intensity of the aftertaste sensations \"nontasters\" experienced after caffeine consumption was found to diminish faster than the sensations \"tasters\" experienced. This may imply that because of their taste bud profiles, \"tasters\" may be more sensitive to the tastes of different foods, and thus experience a more persistent sensation of those foods' tastes.\n\nBecause a lingering taste sensation is intrinsic to aftertaste, the molecular mechanisms that underlie aftertaste are presumed to be linked to either the continued or delayed activation of receptors and signaling pathways in the mouth that are involved in taste processing. The current understanding of how a food's taste is communicated to the brain is as follows:\n\nIn the context of aftertaste, the combination of both receptor-dependent and receptor-independent processes have been proposed to explain the signal transduction mechanisms for foods with distinct aftertastes, particularly those that are bitter. The receptor-dependent process is the same as what was described above. However, the receptor-independent process involves the diffusion of bitter, amphiphilic chemicals like quinine across the taste receptor cell membranes. Once inside the taste receptor cell, these compounds have been observed to activate intracellular G-proteins and other proteins that are involved in signaling pathways routed to the brain. The bitter compounds thus activate both the taste receptors on the cell surface, as well as the signaling pathway proteins in the intracellular space. Intracellular signaling may be slower than taste cell receptor activation since more time is necessary for the bitter compounds to diffuse across the cell membrane and interact with intracellular proteins. This delayed activation of intracellular signaling proteins in response to the bitter compounds, in addition to the extracellular receptor signaling is proposed to be related to the lingering aftertaste associated with bitter foods. The combination of both mechanisms leads to an overall longer response of the taste receptor cells to the bitter foods, and aftertaste perception subsequently occurs.\n\nThe primary taste perception areas in the cerebral cortex are located in the insula and regions of the somatosensory cortex; the nucleus of the solitary tract located in the brainstem also plays a major role in taste perception. These regions were identified when human subjects were exposed to a taste stimulus and their cerebral blood flow measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Although these regions have been identified as the primary zones for taste processing in the brain, other cortical areas are also activated during eating, as other sensory inputs are being signaled to the cortex.\n\nFor aftertaste, much is unclear about the cortical processing related to its perception. The first neuroimaging study to evaluate the temporal taste profile of aspartame, an artificial sweetener, in humans was published in 2009. In it, the insula was observed to be activated for a longer period of time than other sensory processing areas in the brain when the aftertaste profile of aspartame was measured. Subjects were administered a solution of aspartame for a specific amount of time before being instructed to swallow the solution. Functional magnetic resonance images of the blood flow in the subjects' brains were recorded before and after they swallowed the aspartame solution. Before swallowing, the amygdala, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia were all activated. After swallowing, only the insula remained activated and the response of the other brain regions was not evident. This suggests that the insula may be a primary region for aftertaste sensation because it was activated even after the aspartame solution was no longer present in the mouth. This finding aligns with the insula's identification as a central taste processing area and simply expands its function. An explanation for less activation of the amygdala was that because it is a reward center in the brain, less reward would be experienced by the subjects during prolonged exposure to the aspartame solution.\n\nFlavor is an emergent property that is the combination of multiple sensory systems including olfaction, taste, and somatosensation. How the flavor of a food is perceived, whether it is unpleasant or satisfying, is stored as a memory so that the next time the same (or a similar) food is encountered, the previous experience can be recalled and a decision made to consume that food. This process of multisensory inputs to the brain during eating, followed by learning from eating experiences is the central idea of flavor processing.\nRichard Stevenson mentions in \"The Psychology of Flavour\" that people often do not realize that a food's flavor can be described by the food's smell, taste, or texture. Instead, he claims, people perceive flavor as a \"unitary percept\", in which a descriptor for either taste or smell is used to describe a food's flavor. Consider the terms that are used to describe the flavors of foods. For instance, a food may \"taste\" sweet, but often its flavor is described as such while not considering its smell or other sensory characteristics. For example, honey \"tastes\" sweet so its smell is associated with that descriptor, and \"sweet\" is also used to describe its flavor. In fact, sweetness is one of the four basic taste qualities and only comprises part of a food's flavor.\n\nUnlike flavor, aftertaste is a solely gustatory event that is not considered to involve any of the other major senses. The distinction of being based on one (aftertaste) versus multiple (flavor) sensory inputs is what separates the two phenomena.\n\nLow-calorie artificial sweeteners like saccharin and acesulfame-K are known for their bitter aftertastes. Recently, GIV3727 (4-(2,2,3-trimethylcyclopentyl) butanoic acid), a chemical that blocks saccharin and acesulfame-K activation of multiple bitter taste receptors has been developed. In the study, the addition of the bitter taste receptor antagonist GIV3727 to the saccharin and acesulfame-K solutions resulted in significantly lower taste intensity ratings when compared to the solutions that were not treated with GIV3727. This suggests that GIV3727 inhibits the normal functions of the bitter taste receptors because saccharin and acesulfame-K's bitter aftertastes were not observed. The ability to inhibit activation of the bitter taste receptors can have far-reaching effects if the bitter aftertastes of not only these two artificial sweeteners but also other foods, beverages, and even pharmaceuticals can be minimized.\n\nIn wine tasting the aftertaste or \"finish\" of a wine, is an important part of the evaluation. After tasting a wine, a taster will determine the wine's aftertaste, which is a major determinant of the wine's quality. The aftertaste of a wine can be described as bitter, persistent, short, sweet, smooth, or even non-existent. Included in assessing the aftertaste of a wine is consideration of the aromas still present after swallowing. High quality wines typically have long finishes accompanied by pleasant aromas. By assessing the combination of olfactory and aftertaste sensations, wine tasting actually determines not only the aftertaste profile of a wine, but its flavor profile as well.\n"}

The ending date for the show is unclear, but it still appears in a TV schedule from October 1949.\n\nAired in New York City at 9:45am ET on the DuMont Television Network's flagship station WABD (some sources say the show aired 12noon to 12;15pm ET). The show was a 15-minute daytime music program starring Amanda Randolph, who hosted the program and sang.\n\nThe program is significant as one of the first regularly scheduled television show to feature an African-American woman as host. On the program, Randolph sang songs ranging from spirituals to boogie woogie. According to the book \"The Forgotten Network\" (2004), DuMont began offering 4.5 hours of morning and afternoon programming to affiliates in January 1949, but it is not clear which program these included. The program and several other WABD daytime shows seem to appear in Pittsburgh television schedules (on station WDTV) during 1949, so the program may have been shown on a network level.\n\nAccording to the April 30, 1949, edition of newspaper \"Pittsburgh Courier\", the program also featured guest appearances, the first of which was Etta Moten.\n\nAccording to the book \"What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s\" (University of Texas Press, 2005) by Marsha Cassidy, the DuMont daytime schedule beginning in January 1949 was:\n\n\nThe program aired as part of the DuMont experiment in daytime television. While not the first with daytime programming, DuMont's WABD was the first station to offer a schedule that started in the morning and ended after the evening programs; prior to this, daytime programming was occasional with schedules heavy on test patterns.\n\n\"Billboard\" magazine gave a very mixed review of the line-up, but \"Amanda\" was one of several program on the schedule they liked, with the magazine saying that the songs were \"well-sung\" and that \"the gal is by far the most entertaining part of the early stretch\".\n\nAs with most DuMont program, no episodes are known to exist. Kinescopes of daytime television of the 1940s are exceptionally rare, as are kinescopes of local programming (since kinescopes were intended for time-delay purposes, all U.S. stations saw little need to record local programming, and this would remain the case for years).\n\nAlthough DuMont's main stations very occasionally made kinescopes of their local programming (there are more surviving WABD local kinescopes from the late-1940s/1950s than there are for many other stations of the period), most of the local programming is lost. DuMont's archives are alleged to have been dumped into the New York City waterway system and have never been recovered.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"axonometry\" means \"to measure along axes\", and indicates that the dimensions and scaling of the coordinate axes play a crucial role. The result of an axonometric procedure is a uniformly-scaled parallel projection of the object. In general, the resulting parallel projection is oblique (the rays are not perpendicular to the image plane); but in special cases the result is orthographic (the rays are perpendicular to the image plane), which in this context is called an orthogonal axonometry.\n\nIn technical drawing and in architecture, axonometric perspective is a form of two-dimensional representation of three-dimensional objects whose goal is to preserve the impression of volume or of relief. Sometimes also called rapid perspective or artificial perspective, it differs from conical perspective and does not represent what the eye actually sees: in particuliar parallel lines remain parallel and distant objects are not reduced in size. It can be considered a conical perspective conique whose center has been pushed out to infinity, i.e. very far from the object observed.\n\nThe term \"axonometry\" is used both for the graphical procedure described below, as well as the image \"produced\" by this procedure.\n\"Axonometry\" should not be confused with \"axonometric projection\", which in English literature usually refers to \"orthogonal axonometry\".\n\nPohlke's theorem is the basis for the following procedure to construct a scaled parallel projection of a three-dimensional object:\nIn order to obtain undistorted results, select the projections of the axes and foreshortenings carefully (see below). In order to produce an orthographic projection, only the projections of the coordinate axes are freely selected; the foreshortenings are fixed (see ).\n\nNotation:\n\nThe angles can be chosen so that formula_10\nThe forshortenings: formula_11\n\nOnly for suitable choices of angles and forshortenings does one get undistorted images. The next diagram shows the images of the unit cube for various angles and forshortenings and gives some hints for how to make these personal choices.\n\nIn order to keep the drawing simple, one should choose simple forshortenings, for example formula_12 or formula_13.\n\nIf two forshortenings are equal, the projection is called dimetric.\nIf the three forshortenings are equal, the projection is called isometric.\nIf all forshortenings are different, the projection is called trimetric.\n\nThe parameters in the diagram at right (e.g. of the house drawn on graph paper) are: formula_14 Hence it is a \"dimetric\" axonometry. The image plane is parallel to the y-z-plane and any planar figure parallel to the y-z-plane appears in its true shape.\n\nIn this case \nThese angles are marked on many German set squares.\n\nAdvantages of an engineer projection: \nFor more details: see .\n\nIn the literature the terms \"cavalier perspective\" and \"cabinet perspective\" are not uniformly defined. The above definition is the most general one. Often, further restrictions are applied. For example: \n\nSuch axonometries are often used for city maps, in order to keep horizontal figures undistorted.\n\nFor an isometric axonometry all forshortenings are equal. The angles can be chosen arbitrarily, but a common choice is formula_22.\n\nFor the standard isometry or just isometry one chooses:\n\nThe advantage of a standard isometry: \nIn order to prevent scaling, one can choose the unhandy forshortenings\nand the image is an (unscaled) orthographic projection.\n\nA parallel projection of a circle is in general an ellipse. An important special case occurs, if the circle's plane is parallel to the image plane–the image of the circle is then a congruent circle. In the diagram, the circle contained in the front face is undistorted. If the image of a circle is an ellipse, one can map four points on orthogonal diameters and the surrounding square of tangents and in the image parallelogram fill-in an ellipse by hand. A better, but more time consuming method consists of drawing the images of two perpendicular diameters of the circle, which are conjugate diameters of the image ellipse, determining the axes of the ellipse with Rytz's construction and drawing the ellipse.\nIn a general axonometry of a sphere the image contour is an ellipse. \nThe contour of a sphere is a circle only in an \"orthogonal\" axonometry. But, as the engineer projection and the standard isometry are scaled orthographic projections, the contour of a sphere is a circle in these cases, as well. As the diagram shows, an ellipse as the contour of a sphere might be confusing, so, if a sphere is part of an object to be mapped, one should choose an orthogonal axonometry or an engineer projection or a standard isometry.\n\n\n"}

Byzantine silver was prized in both the secular and domestic realms. Aristocratic homes had silver dining ware, and in churches silver was used for crosses, liturgical vessels such as the patens and chalices required for every Eucharist. Silver was also used as a medium in pagan mythological scenes and objects such as the Sevso Treasure. Silver pieces, especially silverware, continued to be rendered in the classical style into the seventh century. \nSilver items were also controlled stamped, sometimes up to five times on a single piece, many such pieces are dated between the fourth and eighth centuries. During the reign of Heraclius (r. 610-41 AD), the production of silverware halts, which coincides with the State confiscating valuable metals to help replenish the treasury during the Persian War. Silver items began to regularly buried, such as the Stuma Treasure of 56 objects found in Syria during 1908, dated between 540 and 640 and attributed to the village church of St Sergios at Kaper Koraon. The Sion Treasure from Lycia consists of 71 pieces with 30 pieces stamped between 550 and 565 AD See Byzantine Coins for currency and monetary information.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century two silver bowls were discovered in Estonia that date to the late fifth or early sixth century period of which the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I reigned 491-518 AD. The silver bowl deemed the “Kriimani” bowl, for the location in which it was found, has a rim of 15.5 cm with a height of 9 cm. Two beaded bands border the rim of the bowl. Silver analysis shows 93-95% Silver, 3.5-5% Copper, and traces of Gold and Platinum. The second bowl, referred to as the “Varnja Bowl,” was discovered in 1895 near the village of Varnja. The Varnja bowl also has two beaded bands that circle the rim, and it is also stamped similar to the Kriimani bowl.\n\nCrosses were also lavishly adorned with precious materials and biblical scenes during the Byzantine period. Scholars refer to a cross called “The Work of Mark,” due to the monks inscriptions on the cross. The cross is dated at late tenth or early eleventh century. This cross is 47 cm high, 26 cm wide, and very ornamented meaning it was probably used in processions. The iron core of the cross is encased in silver. Points projecting from the four arms of the cross would all have had small silver-gilt balls, which can be seen on other such crosses. Traces of gilding where the balls would have been provide further evidence. On one side across the central arm are three roundels forming a deesis, which shows Christ as a central figure holding a book of gospels in his left hand and blessing with his right. The Virgin Mary is shown bowing on Christ’s left while St John the Baptist bows on his right The roundel on the top arm portrays the Archangel Michael, while the bottom roundel portrays a figure titled St Theodore. This side is heavily embossed with silver-gilt, and has a vine scroll and beaded border. The reverse side does not have such borders.\n\nThe reverse has a black medium used in conjunction with the partial gilding of niello, which is an enamel type substance, in this case mixed with sulphur and silver. The roundels portray saints with the top of the cross showing the evangelist St John Theologos. The arm roundels show St Peter on the left and St Paul on the right. The fourth roundel shows St Basil in bishops robes. The middle of the scene has Virgin Mary and her child with a standing portrait of St Constantine above them decorated in his robe. The Virgin Mary has St Demetrius on the left, St Procopius on her right, and the last saint shown is St Nikitas. All saints are identified by the engraving of their names above them. An inscription of a semicircular area just 3 cm wide and embedded into the front of the cross, before the tang projects, reads “‘The work of the Faithful Mark’” \nSimilar crosses are known of such as the cross of Adrianople. This cross has frontal images of Christ and the Virgin Mary, along with archangels Michael and Gabriel on the cross arms. The reverse side shows church fathers, and the donor’s name is inscribed as Sisinnios, which dates the cross to the final years of the tenth century. \n\nAnother cross, in the Cleveland Museum of Art, is dated to the eleventh century due to its comparison of portraits with imperial portraits on coins and seal of that time. Distribution of silver-gilt relief decoration and niello are the same on both sides. \n\nSilver pieces, and especially plates, such as the Missorium of Theodosius I of 338 AD are engraved and styled similary to the set of nine plates showing the Life of David stamped between 613 and 630 AD. The Kaiseraugst Achilles Plate has the closest similarity to the David Plates in regards to late antique silver. The Achilles Plate was buried with a large hoard of domestic silver during the fourth century inside the walls of the Rhine frontier fort of Agusta Rarica, which was discovered in the early 1960s. The Achiles Plate has the signature of Pausylyps of Thessalanike which places its manufacturing in the eastern Byzantine empire. This is reinforced with the similar control stamps on the David Plates. The large octagonal plate has decoration around its rim, and in the center a medallion shows a series of scenes of Achilles’ life before the Trojan War. The Achilles Plate shows a narrative of eleven scenes on one plate. The David Plates and the Achilles Plate show a tradition of late antique silver working that produced many objects between the fourth and seventh centuries with scenes from traditional Grecco-Roman mythology. The David Plates and Achilles Plate are very decorative, and would have been used as show pieces. \n"}

Produced by Union Pictures and John Goldschmidt's Viva Films for joint distribution to BBC Films and HBO. It was first film made by HBO NYC Productions under HBO Pictures banner when HBO Showcase was reconstructed. It tells the true story of Kingsley Ofosu, the sole survivor of a group of nine African stowaways discovered aboard the cargo ship \"MC Ruby\" in 1992 and subsequently murdered by that ship's crew. \n\nAboard the cargo ship \"MC Ruby\", docked in New York City, six stowaways burst from one of the containers being unloaded. They flee from the ship, but are apprehended by dock workers and the New York police. The \"MC Ruby\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Ukrainian crew watches the detention with some amusement, but the ship's captain and his first mate, Ion Plesin, are displeased, aware that the illegal immigrants will cost the shipping company hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. In response, company representative Andreas Vlachos arrives to oversee future operations and warn that the crew will be liable for any more such fines.\n\nLater, the \"MC Ruby\" is docked in Ghana, where dock worker Kingsley Ofosu plans to some day stow away aboard a cargo ship to pursue a better life for himself and his pregnant wife in the United States. Upon winning a lottery, he decides that the time is right, as he can use the money to get on his feet upon his arrival. Ofosu, his brother and six other men slip aboard the \"MC Ruby\" and hide in its cargo holds. With the ship behind schedule, Plesin has only one hour to conduct a stowaway search prior to departure. The hasty endeavour fails to turn up Ofosu's group and the ship sails, bound for France, prior to sailing on to New York.\n\nOfosu's group encounters another stowaway, who had boarded the ship in Cameroon. The men jovially discuss the vocations they intend to pursue in the United States. Later, their water container breaks, forcing them to leave the cargo area to forage for water. They leave evidence of their presence, which the crew discovers. To prevent Vlachos from learning that the stowaway search had failed, the captain has Plesin assemble a small team to conduct a secret search.\n\nThe search finds the stowaways and Plesin discusses the predicament with the captain. Given the illegal immigrant fines, they cannot bring the stowaways into port. However, they also cannot alter course to drop the men off somewhere, as Vlachos would then find out about them. Plesin and his small search team hide the Africans in the ship's anchor hold without food or water. When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty. He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana. Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths.\n\nThe captain acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. Plesin's team takes the men from the hold in small groups. The team brings each group to another area, murders the men, and throws their bodies overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two to be brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions. As they do, Plesin's team shoots Ofosu's brother, catches him and throws him overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees to the main cargo hold to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks.\n\nPlesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate the final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise black immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him.\n\nThe next day, French authorities board the \"MC Ruby\" to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the authorities search the ship's hold and find Ofosu's picture in the cocoa sack. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favour by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally. The police are unimpressed by this rationale and immediately arrest Plesin and his men, along with the captain.\n\nThe film ends with Ofosu on the phone with his wife, hearing the cries of his newborn son, whom he pledges to name after his brother. An epilogue notes that the captain and first mate were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other crew members were also convicted and received 20-year sentences, while one crew member was acquitted. Kingsley Ofosu was living in France and hoping to have his wife and child join him.\n\n(US) Peace Corps volunteers in Ghana were recruited as extras to play the ship's crew members, although many of these scenes do not appear in the final production.\n\nWhen the trial of the crew members made international headlines, multiple film companies approached Ofosu to purchase the rights to his story. He eventually struck a deal with Union Pictures and Viva Films. The Union Pictures/Viva Films production was to be distributed to and financed by HBO and the BBC.\n\nThe screenplay for \"Deadly Voyage\" was written by Stuart Urban, who used interviews with Ofosu as his primary source material. Urban was also originally slated to direct, but when he took ill, John Mackenzie was brought in to replace him. The movie was filmed in England and in Ghana.\n\nProducer John Goldschmidt noted that the Ghana portion of the shoot was particularly challenging, with weather that was extremely hot and humid and multiple crew members coming down with malaria or dysentery. There were also many logistical problems, as Ghana lacked an infrastructure conducive to executing principal photography for a major motion picture. Goldschmidt said that the original plan had been to film in South Africa, since that country was more \"geared up for this sort of thing\", being a location often used for major films set in Africa. However, the decision was made to film in Ghana for the sake of authenticity, and despite the difficulties, Goldschmidt felt that that genuineness shone through in the finished work.\n\nOmar Epps, the film's star, spoke a bit more positively about his experience in Ghana. He said that he was able to spend a good deal of time with Ofosu in preparing for the role. Epps also said that he had learned to speak a little bit of Twi.\n\nIn 2006, Ofosu expressed doubt that he had received fair compensation from Union Pictures for the film. He said that he had received US$67,500, but that that sum had been based on an estimate of the film's total production costs, of which he was to receive 1.5%. Ofosu claimed he'd never been given an accounting of the final production costs to determine if he was owed more. He also said that he was to receive 10% of the movie's net profits and, but that he had never seen any payment along those lines. Union Pictures (which had gone bankrupt by that time) co-producer Bradley Adams pointed the finger at HBO and the BBC, saying that he also had never seen any accounting of profits or total budget figures from the two companies.\n\nNewspaper reviews of \"Deadly Voyage\" were largely positive. Noting that its depictions of man's inhumanity to man were somewhat distressing to watch, the \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" labelled it an \"effective film\". \"The Daytona Beach News-Journal\" called it a \"well-crafted drama\" made all the more disturbing by the fact that observering Ofosu's true story was much like watching a fictional thriller film. The \"Kansas City Star\" branded it a \"tough, provocative docudrama\".\n\n\"The New York Times\", however, was more critical, offering that the film was \"not a great movie\" and declaring that most of its characters were \"little more than stick figures\". Nonetheless, the paper did see the movie as \"nightmarishly harrowing\", calling it a \"searing descent into human cruelty\", and praising the performances of Epps and Pertwee as the film's primary protagonist and antagonist respectively.\n"}
{"id": "276728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=276728", "title": "Deus ex machina", "text": "Deus ex machina\n\nDeus ex machina (: or ; plural: \"dei ex machina\"; English ‘god from the machine’) is a plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem in a story is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected and seemingly unlikely occurrence, typically so much as to seem contrived. Its function can be to resolve an otherwise irresolvable plot situation, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a happy ending, or act as a comedic device.\n\n\"Deus ex machina\" is a Latin calque .\n\nThe term was coined from the conventions of Greek tragedy, where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. The machine could be either a crane (\"mechane\") used to lower actors from above or a riser that brought actors up through a trapdoor. Preparation to pick up the actors was done behind the \"skene\". The idea was introduced by Aeschylus and was used often to resolve the conflict and conclude the drama. Although the device is associated mostly with Greek tragedy, it also appeared in comedies.\n\nAeschylus used the device in his \"Eumenides\", but it was with Euripides that it became an established stage machine. More than half of Euripides' extant tragedies employ a \"deus ex machina\" in their resolution, and some critics claim that Euripides, not Aeschylus, invented it. A frequently cited example is Euripides' \"Medea\", in which the \"deus ex machina\", a dragon-drawn chariot sent by the sun god, is used to convey his granddaughter Medea, who has just committed murder and infanticide, away from her husband Jason to the safety and civilization of Athens. In \"Alcestis\", the eponymous heroine agrees to give up her own life in order to spare the life of her husband, Admetus. At the end, Heracles shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and to Admetus.\n\nAristophanes' play \"Thesmophoriazusae\" parodies Euripides' frequent use of the crane by making Euripides himself a character in the play and bringing him on stage by way of the \"mechane\".\n\nThe effect of the device on Greek audiences was a direct and immediate emotional response. Audiences would have a feeling of wonder and astonishment at the appearance of the gods, which would often add to the moral effect of the drama.\n\nShakespeare used the device in \"As You Like It\", \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\", \"Cymbeline\" and \"The Winter's Tale\". It was also used in John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" where the author uses a character to break the action and rewrite the ending as a reprieve of the hanging of MacHeath. Both in Shakespeare's and Gay's plays the \"deus ex machina\" happens with breaking the dramatic illusion often in the form of an episodic narrator exposing the play itself and laying bare the author. This is different from the use of the \"deus ex machina\" in the ancient examples with the ending coming from a participant in the action in the form of a god. It is natural for the gods to be considered participants and not outside sources because of their privileged position and power. It is these attributes that allow the Greek gods to believably wrap up and solve the series of events.\n\nDuring the politically turbulent 17th and 18th centuries, the \"deus ex machina\" was sometimes used to make a controversial thesis more palatable to the powers of the day. For example, in the final scene of Molière's \"Tartuffe\" the heroes are saved from a terrible fate by an agent of the compassionate, all-seeing king — the same king that held Molière's career and livelihood in his hands.\n\nAristotle was the first to use a Greek term equivalent to the Latin phrase \"deus ex machina\" as a term to describe the technique as a device to resolve the plot of tragedies. It is generally deemed undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author. The reasons for this are that it does not pay due regard to the story's internal logic (although it is sometimes deliberately used to do this) and is often so unlikely that it challenges suspension of disbelief, allowing the author to conclude the story with an unlikely, though perhaps more palatable, ending.\n\nIn H. G. Wells's \"The War of the Worlds\", the Martians, who have destroyed everything in their path and apparently triumphed over humanity, are killed by bacteria.\n\nIn the novel \"Lord of the Flies\", the rescue of the savage children by a passing navy officer (which author William Golding called a \"gimmick\") is viewed by some critics as a \"deus ex machina\". The abrupt ending conveys the terrible fate that would have afflicted the children (in particular Ralph) if the officer had not arrived at that moment.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien referred to the Great Eagles that appear in several places in \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" as \"a dangerous 'machine'.\". This was in a letter refusing permission to a film adapter to have the Fellowship of the Ring transported by eagles rather than traveling on foot. He felt that the eagles had already been overused as a plot device. For example, in \"The Hobbit\", the eagles save Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf, and the dwarves from the goblins and wargs, then help turn the tide of the Battle of the Five Armies, and in \"The Return of the King\" they save Frodo and Sam from certain death on Mount Doom. In the Harvard Lampoon's parody Bored of the Rings, the eagles are referred to as 'Deus ex Machina Airlines.'\n\n\"Deus ex machina\" was also used by Charles Dickens in \"Oliver Twist\", when in the very peak of climax, Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Agnes, and therefore Oliver's aunt; and she marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, allowing Oliver to live happily with his saviour, Mr. Brownlow.\n\nThe \"deus ex machina\" device has many criticisms attached to it, mainly referring to it as inartistic, too convenient, and overly simplistic. On the other hand, champions of the device say that it opens up ideological and artistic possibilities.\n\nAntiphanes was one of the device's earliest critics. Antiphanes believed that the use of the \"deus ex machina\" was a sign that the playwright was unable to properly manage the complications of his plot. \nAnother critical reference to the device can be found in Plato's dialogue \"Cratylus\", 425d, though it is made in the context of an argument unrelated to drama.\n\nAristotle criticized the device in his \"Poetics\", where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play:\nAristotle praised Euripides, however, for generally ending his plays with bad fortune, which he viewed as correct in tragedy, and somewhat excused the intervention of a deity by suggesting that \"astonishment\" should be sought in tragic drama:\nSuch a device was referred to by Horace in his \"Ars Poetica\" (lines 191–2), where he instructs poets that they should never resort to a \"god from the machine\" to resolve their plots \"unless a difficulty worthy of a god's unraveling should happen\" [\"nec deus intersit, nisi dignus uindice nodus inciderit; nec quarta loqui persona laboret\"].\n\nFollowing Aristotle, Renaissance critics continued to view the \"deus ex machina\" as an inept plot device, although it continued to be employed by Renaissance dramatists.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Friedrich Nietzsche criticized Euripides for making tragedy an optimistic genre via use of the device, and was highly skeptical of the \"Greek cheerfulness\", prompting what he viewed as the plays' \"blissful delight in life\". The \"deus ex machina\" as Nietzsche saw it was symptomatic of Socratic culture, which valued knowledge over Dionysiac music and ultimately caused the death of tragedy:\n\nNietzsche argued that the \"deus ex machina\" creates a false sense of consolation that ought not to be sought in phenomena. His denigration of the plot device has prevailed in critical opinion.\nIn Arthur Woollgar Verrall's publication \"Euripides the Rationalist\" (1895), he surveyed and recorded other late 19th century responses to the device. He recorded that some of the critical responses to the term referred to it as 'burlesque', 'coup de théâtre', and 'catastrophe'. Verrall notes that critics have a dismissive response to authors who deploy the device in their writings. He comes to the conclusion that critics feel that the \"deus ex machina\" is evidence of the author's attempt to ruin the whole of his work and prevent anyone from putting any importance on his work.\n\nHowever, other scholars have looked at Euripides' use of \"deus ex machina\" and described its use as an integral part of the plot designed for a specific purpose. Often Euripides' plays would begin with gods, so it is argued that it would be natural for the gods to finish the action. The conflict throughout Euripides' plays would be caused by the meddling of the gods and therefore would make sense to both the playwright and the audience of the time that the gods would resolve all conflict that they began. Half of Euripides' eighteen extant plays end with the use of \"deus ex machina\", therefore it was not simply a device to relieve the playwright of the embarrassment of a confusing plot ending. This device enabled him to bring about a natural and more dignified dramatic and tragic ending.\n\nOther champions of the device believe that it can be a spectacular agent of subversion. It can be used to undercut generic conventions and challenge cultural assumptions and the privileged role of tragedy as a literary/theatrical model.\n\nSome 20th-century revisionist criticism suggests that \"deus ex machina\" cannot be viewed in these simplified terms, and contends that the device allows mortals to \"probe\" their relationship with the divine. Rush Rehm in particular cites examples of Greek tragedy in which the \"deus ex machina\" complicates the lives and attitudes of characters confronted by the deity, while simultaneously bringing the drama home to its audience. Sometimes, the unlikeliness of the \"deus ex machina\" plot device is employed deliberately. For example, comic effect is created in a scene in \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" when Brian, who lives in Judea at the time of Christ, is saved from a high fall by a passing alien space ship.\n\n\n"}

Didactic plays, for instance, were intended to convey a moral theme or other rich truth to the audience. An example of didactic writing is Alexander Pope's \"An Essay on Criticism\" (1711), which offers a range of advice about critics and criticism. An example of didactism in music is the chant \"Ut queant laxis\", which was used by Guido of Arezzo to teach solfege syllables.\n\nAround the 19th century the term \"didactic\" came to also be used as a criticism for work that appears to be overburdened with instructive, factual, or otherwise educational information, to the detriment of the enjoyment of the reader (a meaning that was quite foreign to Greek thought). Edgar Allan Poe called didacticism the worst of \"heresies\" in his essay \"The Poetic Principle\".\n\nSome instances of didactic literature include:\nChildren's Books in England: Five Centuries of Social Life.\" by F.

The 253rd episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star Trey Parker. The episode premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on November 5, 2014. The episode lampoons the popularity of freemium mobile apps such as \"\" and \"\". The episode links addiction to freemium games to other addictions, including alcoholism and gambling addiction, and their possible genetic predisposition.\n\nThe episode was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nJimmy runs into Kyle at school and tells him about the newest game, a mobile app (which closely resembles the game \"Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff\") based on Terrance and Phillip, and encourages Kyle to download it, since it is free. As Kyle plays, he discovers that the game offers freemium upgrades. In Canada, the Prince of Canada and the Minister of Mobile Gaming are amazed at the profits they are getting, when Terrance and Phillip enter, angry that their likenesses have been used to make a game without consulting them and how it is not free, since it charges premiums. The Prince and Minister disclose they have purposefully created a boring game based on the concept of mobile RPGs, and that everyone is doing it.\n\nRandy and Sharon Marsh yell at Stan for spending $489 on the app. Randy worries that Stan may have a gambling problem due to Grampa Marvin Marsh having compulsive gambling issues, as Sharon accuses Randy of having his own compulsive issues with alcohol. Terrance and Phillip begrudgingly accept that since everyone is making boring games and getting micropayments for them, then it must be acceptable. Stan is visited by Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny because Stan skipped school just to play. They realize that Jimmy told them all about the game. Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny confront Jimmy and make him admit that he is being paid to push the game to others. Terrance and Phillip raise concerns about people spending too much money on micropayments, so the Prince and the Minister agree to fund a campaign to play the game in moderation, much like alcohol industry advertisements do. Randy takes Stan to see Marvin, who is addicted to a slot machine, and then confronts Stan and Marvin about their obsessive personalities, as Marvin retorts that Randy is obsessive about alcohol. Stan and Grampa agree to stop their addictive spending.\n\nJimmy confesses that he has been pushing the game like a drug dealer because he is addicted to another freemium game, and compares freemium games to drug addictions. Stan gets multiple text alerts about the game and cannot stop himself from playing again, now having charged over $26,000, while Randy's alcohol consumption increases. Stan goes to Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Jimmy for help. Jimmy encourages Stan to seek out a higher power for help, much like Alcoholics Anonymous and other similar twelve-step programs. Kyle makes a convoluted plan to tell people how Canada has been hiring pushers to get people addicted, but Cartman instead just tweets the information, and it starts trending. Terrance and Phillip again are angered, as the Minister reveals that he had always planned to exploit the addictive nature of people with the game. Stan prays for help, but is visited by Satan, who explains to him what addictions are.\n\nAs Terrance and Phillip continue to listen to the Minister explain his plan, the Minister reveals himself to be the Canadian devil, Beelzaboot (a portmanteau of beelzebub and the Canadian raising pronunciation of \"about\"). Satan realizes that the game is from Canada, so he possesses Stan, then heads to Canada to battle Beelzaboot. Satan defeats Beelzaboot, and Stan is returned to South Park unharmed. The Prince vows to never produce any more freemium games. While Stan and Marvin play board games to counter their addictive natures, Randy offers to place bets on the outcome.\n\nTrey Parker and Matt Stone called \"Freemium Isn't Free\" their favorite episode of the season. On the DVD audio commentary for this episode, they discussed how the episode formed. Parker and Stone had been pitched by several different companies on the idea of creating a freemium mobile game based on the \"South Park\" franchise. They were unsure about actually creating the game because they thought the types of games freemium games usually result in were \"pretty offensive\" in shamelessly asking for money so they decided to do a \"shit load of research\". During this time, they decided to go ahead and make an episode that revolves around freemium games. The research Parker and Stone did was originally only for fully understanding freemium games but because they had decided to make this episode, the research was very beneficial for the episode.\n\nThe episode generally received above average reviews from critics. The episode received a B− rating from \"The A.V. Club\"s Josh Modell, though he felt that it \"dragged a lot\". IGN's contributor Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that \"it took awhile for this episode to get off the ground, but once it did, it was pretty entertaining\". However, Chris Longo from Den of Geek only gave the episode 2 out of 5 stars, calling the episode, along with the previous week's episode \"The Magic Bush\", \"the two weakest episodes of the season\".\n\n"}

Hegt rented the hall at a very reasonable price for the dramatic club's performances but it soon proved to be too small and was also being used for many other activities so, in 1870, another small theater was built on Honmachi Street and became the original Gaiety Theatre.\n\nThis theatre also proved to be too small for the expanding audiences and in 1885 a new building was built on the crest of the Bluff at 256 Yamate and most performances moved to this new building.

It corresponds to the third and final stage of the Spanish Renaissance architecture, which evolved into a progressive purification ornamental, from the initial plateresque to classical purism of the second third of the 16th century and total nudity decorative that introduced the Herrerian style.\n\nIt originated with the construction of the Monastery of El Escorial (San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Community of Madrid) and, more specifically, with the reorganization of the project made by Cantabrian architect Juan de Herrera (1530-1597), after the death of Juan Bautista de Toledo (1515-1567), author of the first design.\n\nIts main representatives are the mentioned Herrera, who the style owes its name, and Francisco de Mora (1553-1610), disciple of the anterior and architect of the Ducal Palace of Lerma (Lerma, Province of Burgos), other key works of Herrerian architecture.\n\nThe Herrerian architecture, or Herrerian style is characterized by its geometric rigor, the mathematical relation between the various architectural features, the clean volumes, the dominance of the wall over the span and the almost total absence of decoration, which is why in time was called desornamentaded style. Is also known as escorial style, referring to the building that serves as best example for the architectural style.\n\nThe Herrerian buildings are noted for its severe horizontality, achieved through the balance of forms, preferably cubic, which are arranged symmetrically in the structure. Usually have wooden roofs covered with slate in the exterior and side towers, tipped with pointed toes pyramidal spire, which introduce an element of verticality, while helping to reinforce the sense of grandeur and elevation.\n\nAt other cases, not looking both the horizontal and the bulkiness, which is reached through the geometrical design of the various architectural elements. This is the case of the model used in the construction of parish churches, with great facades, quadrangular towers and heavy buttresses.\n\nIt is, in most cases, works of great size, imposing in its environment and impress with its austere and monumental air.\n\nIn regard to decorative applications, these reduce the use of basic geometric shapes such as spheres and pyramids. From a sociological standpoint, this sobriety is a response to Protestantism, in line with the guidelines set by the Council of Trent (1545-1563).\n\nThe Herrerian style was the official architecture of the Habsburgs, from the reign of Philip II. The sociopolitical impact meant the construction of the Monastery of El Escorial (1563-1584) facilitated its expansion. To this contributed also the fact that Juan de Herrera was appointed in 1579 Inspector of Monuments of the Crown.\n\nThe style spread through first in the comarcas of Madrid of the Sierra de Guadarrama, located within the catchment area of the Monastery of El Escorial, through two ways: works directly funded by the Royal Family and those promoted by the Guadarraman municipalities.\n\nThe first category covers infrastructure such as the Puente Nuevo, in Galapagar, and buildings for private use by Philip II, as the Casa Veleta, also in the same town, and the Real Aposento de Torrelodones, both disappeared. Were built for comfort the movements of the King from Madrid to the Real Sitio de El Escorial.\n\nIn El Escorial Town, the Crown encouraged the development of various urban planning and the construction of the Church of San Bernabé, by Francisco de Mora, one of the contributors to Herrera in the works of the Royal Monastery.\n\nThe Royal Family also approved the granting of benefits to those municipalities to proceed with the renovation of its main public and religious buildings. The result of this measure is the currently Herrerian aspect of the parish churches of Valdemorillo and Navalagamella, both of medieval origin.\n\nThe Herrerian style quickly spread throughout Spain and America. Some representative works are the Cathedral of Valladolid and the Puente de Segovia (Madrid), both designed by Juan de Herrera; the church of the Monasterio de Uclés (Uclés, Cuenca Province), by Francisco de Mora; the Church of San Sebastián (Villacastín, Segovia Province), attributed to Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón; the Colegiata de San Luis (Villagarcía de Campos, Valladolid Province), by the same author; and the College of Our Lady of Antigua (Monforte de Lemos, Lugo Province) by Simón de Monasterio.\n\nSpecial mention deserves the Ducal Palace of Lerma (Burgos Province), by Francisco de Mora that began in 1601. Led to the adoption of the emerging Herrerian style by the emerging Baroque trends of the time and the establishment of a palatial architecture model, which was repeated throughout the 17th century.\n\nMost civic buildings erected in Madrid during the reign of Philip III and Philip IV continued the architectural guidelines of that palace. This is the case of the Palacio de los Concejos, the Palacio de Santa Cruz and the Casa de la Villa, all of baroque bill, but with notable Herrerian reminiscent.\n\nThe influence of Herrerian style is also visible in the expansion that, separately, had its distinctive spire pyramidal or \"madrilian spire\", with slate roofs. This item was adopted by many constructions after to 16th and 17th century, mainly in the bell towers and domes of the churches, and in many civil constructions.\n\nThe 18th and 19th century meant the decline of this architectural movement. In the 20th century came to pick up, during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. The Plaza de la Moncloa, in Madrid, chaired by Air Force headquarters, among many large constructions of the time, symbolizes the resurgence of Herrerian architecture.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "674787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=674787", "title": "In medias res", "text": "In medias res\n\nA narrative work beginning in medias res (, lit. \"into the middle of things\") opens in the midst of the plot (cf. \"ab ovo\", \"ab initio\"). Often, exposition is bypassed and filled in gradually, either through dialogue, flashbacks or description of past events. For example, \"Hamlet\" begins after the death of Hamlet's father. Characters make reference to King Hamlet's death without the plot's first establishment of said fact. Since the play focuses on Hamlet and the revenge itself more so than the motivation, Shakespeare utilizes \"in medias res\" to bypass superfluous exposition.\n\nWorks that employ \"in medias res\" often, though not always, will subsequently use flashback and nonlinear narrative for exposition of earlier events in order to fill in the backstory. For example, in Homer's \"Odyssey\", we first learn about Odysseus's journey when he is held captive on Calypso's island. We then find out, in Books IX through XII, that the greater part of Odysseus's journey precedes that moment in the narrative. On the other hand, Homer's \"Iliad\" has relatively few flashbacks, although it opens in the thick of the Trojan War.\n\nThe Roman lyric poet and satirist Horace (65–8 BC) first used the terms ab ōvō (\"from the egg\") and in mediās rēs (\"into the middle of things\") in his \"Ars poetica\" (\"Poetic Arts\", c. 13 BC), wherein lines 147–149 describe the ideal epic poet:\nThe \"egg\" reference is to the mythological origin of the Trojan War in the birth of Helen and Clytemnestra from the double egg laid by Leda following her seduction by Zeus in the guise of a swan.\n\nProbably originated in oral tradition, the narrative technique of beginning a story \"in medias res\" is a stylistic convention of epic poetry, the exemplars in Western literature being the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" (both 7th century BC), by Homer. Likewise, the technique features in the Indian \"Mahābhārata\" (c. 8th century BC – c. 4th century AD). \n\nThe classical-era poet Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro, 70–19 BC) continued this literary narrative technique in the \"Aeneid\", which is part of the Greek literary tradition of imitating Homer. Later works featuring \"in medias res\" include the stories \"Sinbad the Sailor\" and \"The Three Apples\" from the \"One Thousand and One Nights\" (c. 9th century), the German \"Nibelungenlied\" (12th century), the Spanish \"Cantar de Mio Cid\" (c. 14th century), the Italian \"Divine Comedy\" (1320) by Dante Alighieri, the Portuguese \"The Lusiads\" (1572) by Luís Vaz de Camões, \"Jerusalem Delivered\" (1581) by Torquato Tasso, \"Paradise Lost\" (1667) by John Milton, and generally in Modernist literature.\n\nModern novelists known to extensively employ \"in medias res\" in conjunction with flashbacks include William Faulkner and Toni Morrison.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe’s The Tell-Tale Heart is written in medias res.\n\nIt is typical for film noir to begin \"in medias res\"; for example, a private detective will enter the plot already in progress. \"Crossfire\" (1947) opens with the murder of Joseph Samuels. As the police investigate the crime, the story behind the murder is told via flashbacks. \"Dead Reckoning\" (1947) opens with Humphrey Bogart as Rip Murdock on the run and attempting to hide in a Catholic church. Inside, the backstory is told in flashback as Murdock explains his situation to a priest.\n\nThe technique has been used across genres, including dramas such as \"Through a Glass Darkly\" (1961), \"8½\" (1963), \"Raging Bull\" (1980), and \"City of God\" (2002); crime thrillers such as \"No Way Out\" (1987), \"Grievous Bodily Harm\" (1988), \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995), and \"Kill Bill Volume 2\" (2004); horror films such as \"Firestarter\" (1984); action films such as many in the James Bond franchise; and comedies such as \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964).\n\nMany war films, such as \"The Thin Red Line\" (1998), also begin \"in medias res\", with the protagonists already actively in combat and no prior domestic scenes leading up to the film's events.\n\nOccasionally, adaptations of source material may employ \"in medias res\" while the original version did not. For example, the film adaptation of the stage musical \"Camelot\" employed \"in medias res\" while the original Broadway version did not (although revivals of the musical have). Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film adaptation of \"Lolita\" begins \"in medias res\" although the novel does not. Herman Wouk's stage adaptation of his own novel \"The Caine Mutiny\" begins \"in medias res\" as it opens with the court-martial that occupies the final section of the novel, telling the earlier part of the story through flashbacks in court-room testimony.\n\n"}

{"id": "16129639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16129639", "title": "Italian Baroque", "text": "Italian Baroque\n\nItalian Baroque (or \"Barocco\") is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late 16th century to the early 18th century.\n\nThe early 17th century marked a time of change for those of the Roman Catholic religion, a symbolization of their strength as a congregation and the intelligence of their creative minds. In response to the Protestant Reformation of the earlier 16th century, Roman Catholics embarked on a program of restoration, a new way of living that became known as the Counter Reformation. The purpose of the Counter Reformation was aimed at remedying some of the abuses challenged by the Protestants earlier in the century. Within the church, a renewed Catholic culture was imposed on Italian society. It started with the Council of Trent, imposed by Pope Paul III, a commission of cardinals who came together to address issues of the Catholic Church and regain faith among worshipers. This resulted in guidelines established by the Church for the commissioning work of artists to communicate biblical truths and ideals.\n\nNew secular construction resulted from the establishment of pioneering religious orders. Between 1524 and 1575, the Barnabite, Jesuit, Oratorian and Theatine orders came into being, and as their influence spread, more and more new churches began being built. By 1725, there were 323 churches in Rome alone, serving a permanent population of fewer than 150,000 people. Because of this rapid growth in church building, it became the responsibility of these religious orders to spread the word of Catholicism to the population. Religious books were increasingly being printed in Venice for distribution to the clergy and literate worshipers, passed out during mass and offering continuous reminders of the presence of Christ on everyday life.\n\nChurches had now become a place for encouragement- spaces of expansive beauty and decoration.\n\nThe Roman Church realized the power that art could have to inspire and, therefore, they became preoccupied with extravagance and display. Their intent was to overwhelm viewers, catch their attention, and make them want to see more. Entering a Baroque church where visual space, music and ceremony were combined was a powerful device for securing loyalty of congregations. The bigger and more beautiful the space, the more people wanted to go. Complex geometry, curving and intricate stairway arrangements and large-scale sculptural ornamentation offered a sense of movement and mystery within the space.\n\nIl Gesù was the first of many Counter-Reformation churches built in Rome; serving as the mother church of the new Jesuit order. Designed by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola, the church of Il Gesù soon became the prototype for the Baroque churches that the Jesuit order built or rebuilt during the Counter-Reformation era. The interior of the Gesu was a study of the grandeur that Roman classicism could offer when combined with simplicity in large scale. High windows puncture the nave’s barrel vault, as a ring of windows in the drum of the dome bring beams of natural light into the interior, creating a dramatic contrast of light and darkness in relatively dim space.\n\nThe plan of Il Gesù became the standard for churches for years to come; a breakaway from the ideal central-plan church of the Renaissance into something new. The Latin Cross variation created a greater sense of spatial unification within the space. In his design for the church of Il Gesù, Vignola broadened the nave and made the transepts and side chapels smaller, creating a better and brighter focal point for the main space and allowing more room for the congregation at mass. The cultural patronage of the pope in Rome was an extreme case of diversity in comparison with surrounding Italian city-states. The pope served his role as not only the head of the Catholic Church, but as the acting ruler for the city. He [the pope] controlled what was built and who was commissioned to build it.\n\nIn 1605, at the very beginning of his pontificate, Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderno to redesign St. Peter's Basilica. It was at the age of 72, in 1546, when Michelangelo first took hold of the unfinished rebuilding project started by Bramante. When Michelangelo died, the construction of the, then, Greek-cross section surrounding the Papal altar and the tomb of Peter had been completed only as far as the top of the drum. The dome then became completed, with some modifications, by Giacomo della Porta in 1590. It was the continuous debates over the religious and aesthetic benefits of keeping the Greek-cross plan or enhancing the space by extending it into Latin-cross plan that led Paul V to boldly commission for Maderno’s services. Maderno’s initial projects, including the long nave addition, which created a new Latin-Cross solution upon the ground plan, the façade and the portico, became an instantly recognizable image of Rome and the heart and spirit of Catholic Christianity.\n\nTo settle the problem of excess open space within the updated basilica, Pope Urban VII commissioned Gian Lorenzo Bernini to design the internal space. Bernini became responsible for much of the internal appearance of the basilica, notably the baldacchino (1624–33) erected over the dome of St. Peter. It acts as a main focal point in the space, combining both sculpture and architecture into a unified art piece. Complex in form and ornate with sculpture, the baldacchino serves as a great example of the Baroque ‘style’, massive and ornate, glorifying the church and the Catholic religion.\n\nThis space is an example of \"quadratura\", an attempt to create an illusion through architecture, painting, and sculpture. Painting and sculpture create an illusion of never-ending height and dramatic composition.\n\nPietro da Cortona was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the Palace of the Barberini family. Pietro da Cortona’s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel. Harold Osborne, author of \"The Oxford Companion of Art\", comments on his work the ‘Divine Providence’ completed for the Barberini palace:\n\nStucco became one of the overall key characteristics of Baroque interiors, enhancing wall spaces, niches, and ceilings.\n\nIt was the reverence for the church that provided funding for more and more building projects which, in turn, brought even more worshipers into the city –as many as five times the permanent population during a Holy Year. With this boom in tourism, a continuing job opportunity arose for the citizens of Rome. The construction industry in Rome soon became the largest employer in the city.\n\nThroughout Italy inspiring architects received training on-the-job. In most parts of Italy, local architects satisfied building needs, but in Rome architects were specifically commissioned either by the Papal state or family dynasties to work on their projects. Families associated with the papacy, including the Barberini, Borghese, Chigi and Pamphili, were extremely well off and, in turn, some of the richest and grandest villas were constructed for them. Competition between these ruling families meant they rivaled each other in the elaborateness of the detailing in their homes as well as in the churches they supported.\n\nThe hot climate of Italy influenced the choosing of materials and planning of architecture. For flooring, tile, marble and stone were used; terrazzo flooring, created by chips of marble case into cement, was also sometimes used in interiors. All of these materials helped cool the space. Consideration of geographic location was also examined during construction planning. For example, on average, Sicily receives 1,000 more hours of sunshine each year than Turin. The facades in Sicilian-built architecture seem extremely massive in comparison to contemporary ones in the Italian mainland. Regional variations like this can be seen throughout Italy, including Rome.\n\nThe role of furniture in Roman interiors was to emphasize social status and to simply add a decorative element to the interior. Carving was the preferred method of decorating furniture; while walnut was the primary furniture wood. Emphasis for furniture was on carved and turned members, which were elaborately placed on high-back armchairs and tables.\n\nSpatial relationships for the interior in the age of the Baroque changed from the block structure of the Renaissance to more open planning. Grand proportions were typical in Baroque interiors. The salone was given high priority, again with an emphasis on exaggerated decoration, this time incorporating accents into the room at different heights. Niches, entablatures, pediments and wall reliefs created dynamics within the space.\n"}

Her novels, which were translated into 37 languages, sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, and her death at age 73, announced by Vincent Browne on Irish television late on 30 July 2012, was mourned as the death of one of Ireland's best-loved and most recognisable writers.\n\nShe appeared in the US market, featuring on \"The New York Times\" best-seller list and in Oprah's Book Club. Recognised for her \"total absence of malice\" and generosity to other writers, she finished 3rd in a 2000 poll for World Book Day, ahead of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Stephen King.\n\nAnne Maeve Binchy was born on 28 May 1939 in Dalkey, the oldest of the four children of William and Maureen (née Blackmore) Binchy. Her siblings include one brother, William Binchy, Regius Professor of Laws at Trinity College, Dublin, and two sisters: Irene \"Renie\" (who predeceased Binchy), and Joan, Mrs Ryan. Her uncle was the historian D. A. Binchy (1899–1989). Educated at St Anne's (then located at No 35 Clarinda Park East), Dún Laoghaire, and later at Holy Child Convent, Killiney, she went on to study at University College Dublin (where she earned a bachelor's degree in history), she worked as a teacher of French, Latin, and history at various girls' schools, then a journalist at \"The Irish Times\", and later became a writer of novels, short stories, and dramatic works.\n\nIn 1968, her mother died of cancer aged 57. After Binchy's father died in 1971, she sold the family house and moved to a bedsit in Dublin.\n\nHer parents were Catholics and Binchy attended a convent school. However, a trip to Israel profoundly affected both her career and her faith. As she confided in a Q&A with \"Vulture\":\nIn 1963, I worked in a Jewish school in Dublin, teaching French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and worked in a kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was going out to the Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.\n\nOne Sunday, attempting to locate where the Last Supper is supposed to have occurred, she climbed a mountainside to a cavern guarded by a Brooklyn-born Israeli soldier. She wept with despair. The soldier asked, \"What'ya expect, ma'am – a Renaissance table set for 13?\" She replied, \"Yes! That's just what I did expect.\" This experience caused her to renounce her Catholic faith, and eventually become an atheist.\n\nBinchy, described as \"six feet tall, rather stout, and garrulous\", although she actually grew to 6'1\", confided to Gay Byrne of \"The Late Late Show\" that, growing up in Dalkey, she never felt herself to be attractive; \"as a plump girl I didn't start on an even footing to everyone else\". After her mother's death, she expected to lead a life of spinsterhood, or as she expressed: \"I expected I would live at home, as I always did.\" She continued, \"I felt very lonely, the others all had a love waiting for them and I didn't.\"\n\nShe ultimately encountered the love of her life, however; when recording a piece for \"Woman's Hour\" in London she met children's author Gordon Snell, then a freelance producer with the BBC. Their friendship blossomed into a cross-border romance, with her in Ireland and him in London, until she eventually secured a job in London through \"The Irish Times\". She and Snell married in 1977 and, after living in London for a time, moved to Ireland. They lived together in Dalkey, not far from where she had grown up, until Binchy's death. The following was her view of her husband, quoted in \"The Irish Times\" after her death: \n\nFiles in Ireland's National Archives, released to the public in 2006, feature a request from Maeve Binchy to President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh asking if he could \"receive\" her. She wrote, \"I know you are extremely busy but I often see in the paper that you 'received' so-and-so and was wondering very simply could I be received too.\" This request came while she was working for \"The Irish Times\" in London in 1975.\n\nIn 2002, Binchy \"suffered a health crisis related to a heart condition\", which inspired her to write \"Heart and Soul\". The book about (what Binchy terms) \"a heart failure clinic\" in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital. Towards the end of her life, Binchy had the following message on her official website: \"My health isn't so good these days and I can't travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I'm always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes me a while to reply.\"\n\nBinchy died on 30 July 2012. She was 73 and had suffered from various maladies, including painful osteoarthritis. As a result of the arthritis she had a hip operation. A month before her death she suffered a severe spinal infection (acute discitis), and finally succumbed to a heart attack. Gordon was by her side when she died in a Dublin hospital. Just ahead of that evening's \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\" and TV3's late evening news, Vincent Browne and then Alan Cantwell, who respectively anchor these shows, announced to Irish television viewers that Binchy had died earlier that evening.\n\nImmediate media reports described Binchy as \"beloved\", \"Ireland's most well-known novelist\" and the \"best-loved writer of her generation\". Fellow writers mourned their loss, including Ian Rankin, Jilly Cooper, Anne Rice, and Jeffrey Archer. Politicians also paid tribute. President Michael D. Higgins stated: \"Our country mourns.\" Taoiseach Enda Kenny said, \"Today we have lost a national treasure.\" Minister of State for Disability, Equality and Mental Health Kathleen Lynch, appearing as a guest on \"Tonight with Vincent Browne\", said Binchy was, for her (Lynch's) money, as worthy an Irish writer as James Joyce or Oscar Wilde, and praised her for selling so many more books than they managed.\n\nIn the days after her death tributes were published from such writers as John Banville, Roddy Doyle, and Colm Tóibín. Banville contrasted Binchy with Gore Vidal, who died the day after her, observing that Vidal \"used to say that it was not enough for him to succeed, but others must fail. Maeve wanted everyone to be a success.\" Numerous tributes appeared in publications on both sides of the Atlantic, including \"The Guardian\" and CBC News.\n\nShortly before her death, Binchy told \"The Irish Times\": \"I don't have any regrets about any roads I didn't take. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help because I can look back, and I do get great pleasure out of looking back ... I've been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around.\" Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said she would like to die \"... on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain\".\n\nDespite being an atheist, Binchy was given a traditional Requiem Mass which took place at the Church of the Assumption, in her hometown of Dalkey. She was later cremated at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reports: Binchy's \"writing career began by accident in the early 1960s, after she spent time on a kibbutz in Israel. Her father was so taken with her letters home that \"he cut off the ‘Dear Daddy’ bits,” Ms. Binchy later recounted, and sent them to an Irish newspaper, which published them.\" Donal Lynch observed of her first paying journalism role: the \"Irish Independent\" \"was impressed enough to commission her, paying her £16, which was then a week-and-a-half's salary for her.\"\nIn 1968, Binchy joined the staff at \"The Irish Times\", and worked there as a writer, columnist, the first Women's Page editor then the London editor, later reporting for the paper from London before returning to Ireland.\n\nBinchy's first published book is a compilation of her newspaper articles titled \"My First Book\". Published in 1970, it is now out of print. As Binchy's bio posted at Read Ireland describes: \"The Dublin section of the book contains insightful case histories that prefigure her novelist's interest in character. The rest of the book is mainly humorous, and particularly droll is her account of a skiing holiday, 'I Was a Winter Sport.'\"\n\nIn all, Binchy published 16 novels, four short-story collections, a play and a novella. A 17th novel, \"A Week in Winter\", was published posthumously. Her literary career began with two books of short stories: \"Central Line\" (1978) and \"Victoria Line\" (1980). She published her debut novel \"Light a Penny Candle\" in 1982. In 1983, it sold for the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy and her husband were two months behind with the mortgage at the time. However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as fast as she could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.\n\nHer first book was rejected five times. She would later describe these rejections as \"a slap in the face [...] It's like if you don't go to a dance you can never be rejected but you'll never get to dance either\".\n\nMost of Binchy's stories are set in Ireland, dealing with the tensions between urban and rural life, the contrasts between England and Ireland, and the dramatic changes in Ireland between World War II and the present day. Her books have been translated into 37 languages.\n\nWhile some of Binchy's novels are complete stories (\"Circle of Friends\", \"Light a Penny Candle\"), many others revolve around a cast of interrelated characters (\"The Copper Beech\", \"Silver Wedding\", \"The Lilac Bus\", \"Evening Class\", and \"Heart and Soul\"). Her later novels, \"Evening Class\", \"Scarlet Feather\", \"Quentins\", and \"Tara Road\", feature a cast of recurring characters.\n\nBinchy announced in 2000 that she would not tour any more of her novels, but would instead be devoting her time to other activities and to her husband, Gordon Snell. Five further novels were published before her death: \"Quentins\" (2002), \"Nights of Rain and Stars\" (2004), \"Whitethorn Woods\" (2006), \"Heart and Soul\" (2008), and \"Minding Frankie\" (2010). Her final novel, \"A Week in Winter\", was published posthumously in 2012. In 2014 a collection of 36 unpublished short stories that she had written over a period of decades was published under the title \"Chestnut Street\".\n\nBinchy wrote several dramas specifically for radio and the silver screen. Additionally, several of her novels and short stories were adapted for radio, film, and television. (See List of Works: Films, radio and television.)\n\nMaeve Binchy has the ability to allow readers to picture the world in which she creates, her ability to do this is the reason why she is one of the top five Irish writers. She also is one of very few authors who portray the Catholic church in a positive light.\n\nIn 1994, Binchy appeared on \"Morningside\" with Peter Gzowski.\n\nIn 1999, Binchy appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". In 2009, she appeared on \"The Meaning of Life\" with Gay Byrne. Binchy and her husband had a cameo appearance together in \"Fair City\" on 14 December 2011, during which the couple dined in The Hungry Pig.\n\nIn 1978, Binchy won a Jacob's Award for her RTÉ play, \"Deeply Regretted By\". A 1993 photograph of her by Richard Whitehead belongs to the collection of the National Portrait Gallery and a painting of her by Maeve McCarthy, commissioned in 2005, is on display in the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nIn 1999, she received the British Book Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2000, she received a People of the Year Award. In 2001, \"Scarlet Feather\" won the W H Smith Book Award for Fiction, defeating works by Joanna Trollope and then reigning Booker winner Margaret Atwood, amongst other contenders.\n\nIn 2007, she received the Irish PEN Award, joining such luminaries as John B. Keane, Brian Friel, Edna O'Brien, William Trevor, John McGahern and Seamus Heaney.\n\nIn 2010, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Irish Book Awards. In 2012, she received an Irish Book Award in the \"Irish Popular Fiction Book\" category for \"A Week in Winter\".\n\nThere were posthumous proposals to name a new Liffey crossing \"Binchy Bridge\" in memory of the writer. Ultimately the bridge was named for trade unionist Rosie Hackett.\n\nIn September 2012, a new garden behind the Dalkey Library in County Dublin was dedicated in memory of Binchy.\n\nIn 2014 the University of Dublin announced the first annual Maeve Binchy Travel Award. The €4000 award will help student winners \"pursue a novel travel trip to enhance their writing skills\".\n\nBinchy published novels, non-fiction, a play and several short story collections. Two collections of short stories, \"Chestnut Street\" (2014) and \"A Few of the Girls\" (2015), were released after her death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinchy wrote several dramas specifically for radio and the silver screen. Additionally, several of her novels and short stories were adapted for radio, film, and television.\n\n\nSince 1968, Binchy was a \"frequent and hugely popular contributor to RTÉ Radio\".

Her father was a dental surgeon serving in the United States Navy Dental Corps, and she grew up in Manila, Panama, Japan, and spent four years living in Peking, China, where she learned Mandarin.\n\nShe graduated with a degree in English literature from the University of California, Berkeley, then studied creative writing at University of California, Los Angeles. On June 30, 1945, she married Garo Armen, a naval officer, and started a family. While raising her son, she worked from home, writing newspaper articles and short stories, before finally breaking into television writing Westerns, furnishing scripts for \"Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre\" (1960), \"The Rebel\" (1961), \"Lawman\" (1960–62), \"The Tall Man\" (1962), \"The Rifleman\" (1960–63) and \"The Big Valley\" (1965–69) during the 1960s.\n\nShe was also responsible for three episodes of the original \"\" series, writing \"The Gamesters of Triskelion\" and \"The Paradise Syndrome\" (both 1968), and provided the final teleplay for \"The Cloud Minders\" (1969). She later wrote two episodes of \"\" (\"The Lorelei Signal\" and \"The Ambergris Element\", both 1973). Armen also co-wrote (with Alfred Harris) \"The Savage Syndrome\", an episode of the cancelled series \"\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, she also wrote episodes for the detective series \"Ironside\" (1973), \"Cannon\" (1975), \"Baretta\" (1977) and \"Barnaby Jones\" (1977, 1978), as well as the science fiction series \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" (1975), \"Land of the Lost\" (1974, 1975), \"The Bionic Woman\" (1978) and \"Jason of Star Command\" (1979).\n\nIn the early 1980s, she wrote episodes of \"Fantasy Island\" (1981), \"Flamingo Road\" (1981) and \"Emerald Point N.A.S.\" (1983).

The technique is mostly used by artists who through illness, accident or congenital disability have no use of their hands. The Association of Mouth and Foot Painting Artists (AMFPA) is a worldwide organization representing these artists.\n\nThe brushes and tools that are used are ordinary artist's implements, but they may be modified in length or width. Mouth painters hold the brush in their mouth or between their teeth and maneuver it with their tongue and cheek muscles. The paper or canvas is usually mounted vertically on an easel. Mouth painting is strenuous for neck and jaw muscles since the head has to perform the same back and forth movement as a hand does when painting. Foot painting can be done sitting on the floor, at a table or at an easel, as most foot painters use their toes with the same dexterity as people with hands use their fingers.\n\n\n"}

It was the town house for Peter the Clerk, the administrator of Chester Castle. It initially contained a section of the Chester Rows, but these were enclosed during the alterations made between the 15th and early 17th centuries. The latest of these alterations were made for Randle Holme I. The building was restored in 1935, and again during the 1960s.\n\nIt is basically a timber-framed building, part of which has been refaced with yellow sandstone, and with brick that has been painted or rendered.

The magazine will cease publication in Summer 2017 with its 100th issue.\n\nPublished three times per year in English and German by its publishing house in Zurich, Switzerland, with an additional editorial office in New York, Parkett has a circulation of 12,000 and is read by some 30,000 readers in 40 countries, one third of them in North America.\n\nFounded in the early 1980s with the idea of fostering an open dialogue between the artistic communities of Europe and America, \"Parkett\" is based in Zurich, with an office also in New York. The magazine's goal has been to actively and directly collaborate with important international artists whose oeuvre is explored in several essays by leading writers and critics in both German and English. Each artist featured also creates a special signed and numbered work exclusive to Parkett. By 2010, \"Parkett\" had published more than 80 volumes with some 180 monographs and over 1500 in-depth texts making it one of the most comprehensive libraries on contemporary art worldwide. Critics, curators, art historians, and other commentators join in the conversation contained within its pages. Many write on the collaborating artists; some write opinions under a variety of topic headings that recur issue to issue; others write on additional artists and ideas. The result is more of a curated event-between-covers than a typical art magazine with reviews and news items.\n\nTo celebrate the fortieth issue of \"Parkett\", in June 1994 the editors presented a special thematic issue asking what beauty will look like after it reemerges from Postmodernism? And how, when contemporary life demands so many different things from contemporary art, do we strike a balance between history and presence, politics and humor? Taking the children's game of Snakes and Ladders as a guiding metaphor, the gala issue offers six mini-collaborations: Holland Cotter on Francesco Clemente; Boris Groys on Peter Fischli and David Weiss; David Rimanelli and Max Weechsler on Gunther Förg; Gordon Burn on Damien Hirst; Joan Simon on Jenny Holzer; and Gilbert Lascault on Rebecca Horn. Also in this issue, Dave Hickey wrote on magic, Vik Muniz on apparitions, Jeff Perrone on boards and borders, and G.

{"id": "995952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=995952", "title": "Protest art", "text": "Protest art\n\nProtest art is a broad term that refers to creative works that concern or are produced by activists and social movements. There are also contemporary and historical works and currents of thought that can be characterized in this way.\n\nSocial movements produce such works as the signs, banners, posters, and other printed materials used to convey a particular cause or message. Often, such art is used as part of demonstrations or acts of civil disobedience. These works tend to be ephemeral, characterized by their portability and disposability, and are frequently not authored or owned by any one person. The various peace symbols, and the raised fist are two examples that highlight the democratic ownership of these signs.\n\nProtest art also includes (but is not limited to) performance, site-specific installations, graffiti and street art, and crosses the boundaries of art genres, media, and disciplines.\nWhile some protest art is associated with trained and professional artists, an extensive knowledge of art is not required to take part in protest art. Protest artists frequently bypass the art-world institutions and commercial gallery system in an attempt to reach a wider audience. Furthermore, protest art is not limited to one region or country, but is rather a method that is used around the world. \n\nThere are many politically charged pieces of fine art — such as Picasso's \"Guernica\", some of Norman Carlberg's Vietnam war-era work, or Susan Crile's images of torture at Abu Ghraib.\n\nIt is difficult to establish a history for protest art because many variations of it can be found throughout history. While many cases of protest art can be found during the early 1900s, like Picasso's Guernica in 1937, the last thirty years has experienced a large increase in the number of artists adopting protest art as a style to relay a message to the public.\n\nAs awareness of social justices around the world became more common among the public, an increase in protest art can be seen. Some of the most critically effective artworks of the recent period were staged outside the gallery, away from the museum and in that sense, protest art has found a different relationship to the public.\n\nActivist art represents and includes aesthetic, sociopolitical, and technological developments that have attempted to challenge and complicate the traditional boundaries and hierarchies of culture as represented by those in power. Like protest art, activist art practice emerged partly out of a call for art to be connected to a wider audience, and to open up spaces where the marginalized and disenfranchised can be seen and heard.\n\nActivist art incorporates the use of public space to address socio-political issues and to encourage community and public participation as a means of bringing about social change. It aims to affect social change by engaging in active processes of representation that work to foster participation in dialogue, raise consciousness, and empower individuals and communities. The need to ensure the continued impact of a work by sustaining the public participation process it initiated is also a challenge for many activist artists. It often requires the artist to establish relationships within the communities where projects take place.\n\nIf social movements are understood as “repeated public displays” of alternative political and cultural values, then activist art is significant in articulating such alternative views. Activist art is also important to the dimension of culture and an understanding of its importance alongside political, economical, and social forces in movements and acts of social change. One should be wary of conflating activist art with political art, as doing so obscures critical differences in methodology, strategy, and activist goals.\n\nActivist art cites its origins from a particular artistic and political climate. In the art world, performance art of the late 1960s to the 70s worked to broaden aesthetic boundaries within visual arts and traditional theatre, blurring the rigidly construed distinction between the two. The transient, interdisciplinary, and hybrid nature of performance art allowed for audience engagement. The openness and immediacy of the medium invited public participation, and the nature of the artistic medium was a hub for media attention.\n\nEmerging forms of feminism and feminist art of the time was particularly influential to activist art. The idea that “the personal is the political,” that is, the notion that personal revelation through art can be a political tool, guided much activist art in its study of the public dimensions to private experience. The strategies deployed by feminist artists parallel those by artists working in activist art. Such strategies often involved “collaboration, dialogue, a constant questioning of aesthetic and social assumptions, and a new respect for audience” and are used to articulate and negotiate issues of self-representation, empowerment, and community identity.\n\nConceptual Art sought to expand aesthetic boundaries in its critique of notions of the art object and the commodity system within which it is circulated as currency. Conceptual artists experimented with unconventional materials and processes of art production. Grounded by strategies rooted in the real world, projects in conceptual art demanded viewer participation and were exhibited outside of the traditional and exclusive space of the art gallery, thus making the work accessible to the public. Similarly, collaborative methods of execution and expertise drawn from outside the art world are often employed in activist art so as to attain its goals for community and public participation. Parallel to the emphasis on ideas that conceptual art endorsed, activist art is process-oriented, seeking to expose embedded power relationships through its process of creation.\n\nIn the political sphere, the militancy and identity politics of the period fostered the conditions out of which activist art arose.\n\nIn practice, activist art may often take the form of temporal interventions, such as performance, media events, exhibitions, and installations. It is also common to employ mainstream media techniques (through the use of billboards, posters, advertising, newspaper inserts…etc.). By making use of these commercial distributive channels of commerce, this technique is particularly effective in conveying messages that reveal and subvert its usual intentions.\n\nThe use public participation as a strategy of activating individuals and communities to become a “catalyst for change” is important to activist art. In this context, participation becomes an act of self-expression or self-representation by the entire community. Creative expression empowers individuals by creating a space in which their voices can be heard and in which they can engage in a dialogue with one another, and with the issues in which they have a personal stake.\n\nThe Artist and Homeless Collaborative is an example of a project that works with strategies of public participation as a means of individual and community empowerment. It is an affiliation of artists, arts professionals and women, children and teenagers living in NYC shelters, the A & HC believe that their work in a collaborative project of art-making offers the residents a “positive experience of self-motivation and helps them regain what the shelter system and circumstances of lives destroy: a sense of individual identity and confidence in human interaction.” The process of engaging the community in a dialogue with dominant and public discourses about the issue of homelessness is described in a statement by its founder, Hope Sandrow: “The relevancy of art to a community is exhibited in artworks where the homeless speak directly to the public and in discussion that consider the relationship art has to their lives. The practice of creating art stimulates those living in shelters from a state of malaise to active participation in the artistic process”\n\nThe A & HC came into being at a time when a critique of the makers, sellers, and consumers of art that addressed social concerns became increasingly pronounced. Critics argued that the very works of art whose purpose was to provoke political, social and cultural conversation were confined within the exclusive and privileged space of galleries museums, and private collections. By contrast, the A & HC was an attempt to bridge the gap between art production and social action, thus allowing for the work subjects that were previously excluded and silenced to be heard.\n\nResistance art is art used as a way of showing their opposition to powerholders. This includes art that opposed such powers as the German Nazi party, as well as that opposed to apartheid in South Africa. Willie Bester is one of South Africa's most well known artists who originally began as a resistance artist. Using materials assembled from garbage, Bester builds up surfaces into relief and then paints the surface with oil paint. His works commented on important black South African figures and aspects important to his community. South African resistance artists do not exclusively deal with race nor do they have to be from the townships. Another artist, Jane Alexander, has dealt with the atrocities of apartheid from a white perspective. Her resistance art deals with the unhealthy society that continues in post-apartheid South Africa.\n\nThe Center for the Study of Political Graphics archive currently contains more than 85,000 posters and has the largest collection of post-World War II social justice posters in the United States and the second largest in the world. Many university libraries have extensive collections including the Joseph A. Labadie Collection at University of Michigan documents the history of social protest movements and marginalized political communities from the 19th century to the present.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Celebrating the progress of Enlightenment ideas and the retreat of prejudice, it comments on cultural, economic and technological progress made in France during the reign of Louis XV of France.\n\nThe material for the \"Précis\" had been previously been part of a history that Voltaire spent twenty years working on and which included \"Essai sur les mœurs et l'esprit des nations\" (\"Essay on the customs and spirit of the nations\") and \"The Age of Louis XIV\". The \"Precis\" was introduced in 1762 as an appendix within this larger work, but later published separately.\n\nVoltaire comments on the trial of Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally; a case he had been following closely. Lally had been a successful military officer, and personally known to Voltaire. When Lally was involved at a military defeat, relinquishing the Indian town of Pondicherry to the English, his fellow officers blamed him. On his return to France, Lally was imprisoned without charge, put on trial in which he was denied a lawyer, and finally executed. In his account of the case, Voltaire wrote, \"His character made him detested by all who had to do with him. But that is not a reason for cutting off a man's head. The briefs both for and against him, which I have read attentively, contain nothing but insults, and not the least proof.\"\n\nThe \"Precis\" also praises the courage of the Corsicans in defending against the French at the Battle of Ponte Novu. Voltaire writes:\nThe principal weapon of the Corsicans was their courage. This courage was so great that in one of these battles, near a river named Golo, they made a rampart of their dead in order to have the time to reload behind them before making a necessary retreat […] Bravery is found everywhere, but such actions aren’t seen except among free people.\n\n"}
{"id": "1844252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844252", "title": "Retting", "text": "Retting\n\nRetting is a process employing the action of micro-organisms and moisture on plants to dissolve or rot away much of the cellular tissues and pectins surrounding bast-fibre bundles, and so facilitating separation of the fibre from the stem. It is used in the production of fibre from plant materials such as flax and hemp stalks and coir from coconut husks.\n\nThe most widely practised method of retting, water retting, is performed by submerging bundles of stalks in water. The water, penetrating to the central stalk portion, swells the inner cells, bursting the outermost layer, thus increasing absorption of both moisture and decay-producing bacteria. Retting time must be carefully judged; under-retting makes separation difficult, and over-retting weakens the fibre. In double retting, a gentle process producing excellent fibre, the stalks are removed from the water before retting is completed, dried for several months, then retted again.\n\n\"Natural water retting\" employs stagnant or slow-moving waters, such as ponds, bogs, and slow streams and rivers. The stalk bundles are weighted down, usually with stones or wood, for about 8 to 14 days, depending upon water temperature and mineral content.\n\n\"Tank retting\", by contrast, employs vats usually made of concrete, requires about four to six days, and is feasible in any season. In the first six to eight hours, called the leaching period, much of the dirt and colouring matter is removed by the water, which is usually changed to assure clean fibre. Waste retting water, which requires treatment to reduce harmful toxic elements before its release, is rich in plant minerals, such as nitrates, and can be used as liquid fertilizer.\n\nThis is a common method in areas with limited water resources. It is most effective in climates with heavy night time dews and warm daytime temperatures. The harvested plant stalks are spread evenly in grassy fields, where the combined action of bacteria, sun, air, and dew produces fermentation, dissolving much of the stem material surrounding the fibre bundles. Within two to three weeks, depending upon climatic conditions, the fibre can be separated. Dew-retted fibre is generally darker in color and of poorer quality than water-retted fibre.\n\nThe retted stalks, called straw, are dried in open air or by mechanical means, and are frequently stored for a short period to allow \"curing\" to occur, facilitating fibre removal. Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the scutching operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and scutching operations. Waste material from the first scutching, consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time. The short fibre (tow) thus obtained is frequently used in paper manufacture, and the shives may serve as fuel to heat the retting water or may be made into wallboard.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10409684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10409684", "title": "Steven B. Smith (poet)", "text": "Steven B. Smith (poet)\n\nSteven B. Smith (born 1946 in Wallace, Idaho), is an underground artist and poet from Cleveland, Ohio. He published \"ArtCrimes\", a zine influenced by the beats. Smith's art and poetry uses cultural themes as found objects with a Dadaist influence.\n\nHis life is pockmarked with colorful episodes such as stealing cars when he was thirteen, getting kicked out of the U.S. Naval Academy, armed robbery, and prison.\n\nSmith was born in Wallace, Idaho, to Pappy Smith and Florence E. \"Mother Dwarf\" Smith. He was raised in Paradise Prairie, twenty miles outside of Spokane, Washington. He stole thirteen cars when he was thirteen.\n\nIn 1968 Smith was one of thirteen middies ousted by the Naval Academy for smoking pot. He haggled a deal with the government upon discharge; they agreed to pay for his education. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy with a 3.8 GPA from Loyola College in Maryland.\n\nSmith married into an East Coast blue-blood family in 1969. In 1970, he was arrested for armed robbery. Smith lived in Baltimore and other cities before coming to Cleveland in 1977 in pursuit of another man's wife. She then divorced her husband and decided to marry someone other than Smith.\n\nSmith's art assemblages started when one day, instead of painting a key on a canvas, he picked it up and pasted it onto the canvas.\n\nSmith's art uses iconic baubles with the effect of cheapening and attacking cultural themes. The work has been characterized as \"difficult and uncompromising,\" and \"repellent and grotesque,\" with roots from the dadaist collages of Schwitters and Rauschenberg.\n\nMaterials used include rusted wire, shattered glass, obscene imagery, dead mice, the artificial leg of a dead drug dealer and sometimes other people's art. His work is washed in blue \"corrosion,\" a mix of matte medium, copper powder, and salt. Another reviewer says Smith's use of oxidized copper makes his works appear to be fetched from the bottom of the sea.\n\nSmith uses cultural themes as found objects. \"I deal in symbolic juxtapositions of the odd and unwanted,\" Smith says. \"My materials consist of cultural castoffs, sociological implications and the refuse known as suburban thought. My goals are simple; erase your labels; learn to look about ... Learn to see dead frog and rust and thus re-see yourself.\" He says, \"My art is a collaboration with the pieces.\"\n\nAfter the death of his brother Cat (Vincent Smith), Smith started exhibiting his brother's remains at his shows, leaving some of the ashes behind after each exhibit.\n\nSmith first gained notoriety with a piece — \"American Ego\" — in the People's Art Show at CSU. His piece was a four-by-three grid of Polaroid snapshots, nude photos of himself in compromising positions with the American flag. This piece won the \"most outrageous\" award at the show.\n\nNext, three pieces of his art were censored from a show at Tri-C West. Smith agreed to the removal as long as a \"censored\" notice was put on the wall in place of the missing art. The opening night poetry reading was reassigned to a remote conference room. During the reading Smith discovered that Tri-C neglected to post the notes. He wrote \"CENSORED\" on the wall with a ball point pen. Poet Daniel Thompson decided to read in the original gallery, and mouthed the words to his poem silently as a Tri-C co-director sanded the words off the wall.\n\nSmith worked longest as a computer programmer, which helped support \"ArtCrimes\" and his art. He frequently contracted with BP. Previous occupations include sailor, milk man, life insurance salesman, avant garde theater manager, newspaper film and music critic, woman's shoe salesmen, prison cook, carnival laborer, and church janitor. He's also worked at Bethlehem Steel.\n\nSmith's \"resume\" was published in an article from 2000:\n\n\nSmith and his friend and frequent collaborator S. Judson Wilcox were two early \"urban pioneers\": artists who settled the Warehouse District in Cleveland in 1981. Artists, musicians and renegades moved there to revel in Cleveland's industrial beauty. The warehouse district was a haven.\n\nSmith and Wilcox had an \"Art Behind Bars\" installation in the district with mannequins, Mickey Mouse, and neon tube calliope.\n\nSmith's brother \"Cat\" moved into the warehouse with him. Cat Smith's collages were dead ringers for Schwitters'.\n\nSmith and Cat's spot in the warehouse became a gathering spot for other artists in the building, and scene, including S. Judson Wilcox, Melissa Jay Craig (AKA \"Field Marshal May Midwest\"), Jeff Chiplis, Laszlo Gyorki, Ken Nevadomi, Randy Rigutto, Jay Clements, and Beth Wolfe. Guests were offered keepsakes of miniature toy soldiers, babies in plastic bubbles, or poetry.\n\nSPACES Gallery was located on the first floor, making the warehouse the de facto epicenter of creative activity.\n\nCat was a troubled man who eventually committed suicide. After he died, Smith heard a beeping in his studio. He couldn't figure out where the beeping came from, and thought it was the soul of his dead brother. He then found a worn-out smoke detector at the bottom of a huge pile in his studio.\n\nIn another installation with Wilcox, Smith used a bag of his dead brother's ashes. He claimed to have a pact with Cat. The first to die would be included in an exhibition of the other's work. In one of the exhibitions at SPACES gallery, Smith put Cat's ashes on a pedestal. The bag was punctured by a friend and ashes spilled onto the pedestal and the floor.\n\nBefore making visual art, Smith crafted unique journals into which he'd juxtapose images and poetry and journal entries. Smith wrote clever, punning poetry and read it all over town. (His poetry is described as \"a stream-of-consciousness assault on reason and order\" and \"a cross between Dada and Jack Kerouac.\") Smith used his art and poetry to make political statements, and he also participated in a couple legendary \"regional art terrorist\" raids in the Flats.\n\nStarting in 1986, Smith published the Cleveland cult underground publication \"ArtCrimes\", a zine full of images and poems which also shared his disrespect for authority. \"ArtCrimes\" took on the spirit of Smith's journals, like a sketchbook that's been passed around to dozens of different artists. The zine was influenced by the beats, and was consistent with the style of publications from the days of Kerouac, Corso, and Ginsberg.\n\nContributors included everyone from Bukowski and Micheline to people's pets. Ohio poets and artists included the likes of Daniel Thompson, Maj Ragain, Amy Bracken Sparks, Ben Gulyas, Chris Franke, Harvey Pekar, Gary Dumm, Masumi Hayashi and Ken Nevadomi. One reviewer postulated that \"ArtCrimes\" was the most significant publication of the Cleveland underground art scene in recent history.\n\nThe affordability of Cleveland neighborhoods periodically caused mass migrations of artists. In the 1980s, Smith was one of the urban pioneers to move into the Warehouse District. In '85, he was one of many artists who moved from the warehouses to Tremont, in the typical pattern where artists move into undesirable but inexpensive neighborhoods, fixing up old buildings in which to live and work.\n\nShortly after Smith's move to Tremont, Cat committed suicide. Pappy Smith died shortly after, and Mother Dwarf (Florence E. Smith) left Las Vegas to come to live with Smith. Mother Dwarf began her art career producing collages for \"ArtCrimes\". Smith and his mother's life together became a mother-son artistic collaboration.\n\nSmith nearly died in 1991 from alcohol, and has been sober since then. One notable drunken episode was after an art auction. He'd bid loudly on every piece offered. He took a walk home with Mother Dwarf. He passed a fence of barking dogs, and started to howl \"in communion.\" He leaned up over the dogs and they bit his scalp. The next day, Smith asked Mother Dwarf why he was covered in blood. \"You mean...\" she said, \"You don't remember the dogs?\"\n\nIn an interview in 2000, Smith claimed his voice was raspy \"because I don't talk to anyone anymore.\" He'd become a recluse whose doormat said \"Go Away.\" He said, \"I had to learn silence. People only remember the old days when I shocked people with what I said or made or did. But there's a lot of beauty in the things I've done.\"\n\nIn 2005 Smith's life hit a series of highs and lows. His mother died, he fell in love, he retired, and then discovered he had throat cancer. He published the final issue of \"ArtCrimes\" in 2006.\n\nSmith is a documentarian. His journals are not the only documentation of his life. He continues with his 2500-page website agentofchaos.com.\n\nSmith married poet Lady K in 2006. They began their relationship shortly after the death of Mother Dwarf in 2005. In 2006 Smith and his wife sold their home, gave away all of their possessions, and moved to Europe.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "461143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=461143", "title": "The House of the Dead (novel)", "text": "The House of the Dead (novel)\n\nThe House of the Dead (, \"Zapiski iz Myortvogo doma\") is a semi-autobiographical novel published in 1860–2 in the journal \"Vremya\" by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky, which portrays the life of convicts in a Siberian prison camp. The novel has also been published under the titles Memoirs from the House of The Dead, Notes from the Dead House (or Notes from a Dead House), and Notes from the House of the Dead. The book is a loosely-knit collection of facts, events and philosophical discussion organised by \"theme\" rather than as a continuous story. Dostoevsky himself spent four years in exile in such a camp following his conviction for involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle. This experience allowed him to describe with great authenticity the conditions of prison life and the characters of the convicts.\n\nAfter his mock execution on 22 December 1849, Dostoevsky's life was spared in exchange for four years of imprisonment in one of Siberia’s \"katorga\" labor camps. Though he often was met with hostility from the other prisoners due to his noble status of \"dvoryanin\", his views on life changed. After his time in the camps Dostoevsky returned to write \"The House of the Dead\". The novel incorporates several of the horrifying experiences he witnessed while in prison. He recalls the guards’ brutality and relish performing unspeakably cruel acts, the crimes that the convicted criminals committed, and the fact that blended amid these great brutes were good and decent individuals.\nHowever, he is also astonished at the convicts’ abilities to commit murders without the slightest change in conscience. It was a stark contrast with his own heightened sensitivity. During this time in prison he began experiencing the epileptic seizures that would plague him for the rest of his life. \"House of the Dead\" led Dostoevsky to include the theme of murder in his later works, a theme not found in any of his works preceding \"House of the Dead\".\n\nThe narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov, has been sentenced to penalty deportation to Siberia and ten years of hard labour for murdering his wife. Life in prison is particularly hard for Aleksandr Petrovich, since he is a \"gentleman\" and suffers the malice of the other prisoners, nearly all of whom belong to the peasantry. Gradually Goryanchikov overcomes his revulsion at his situation and his fellow convicts, undergoing a spiritual re-awakening that culminates with his release from the camp. It is a work of great humanity; Dostoevsky portrays the inmates of the prison with sympathy for their plight, and also expresses admiration for their energy, ingenuity and talent. He concludes that the existence of the prison, with its absurd practices and savage corporal punishments is a tragic fact, both for the prisoners and for Russia.\n\nMany of the characters in the novel were very similar to the real-life people that Dostoevsky met while in prison. While many of the characters do mirror real-life people, he has also made some of the characters appear more interesting than their real-life counterparts.\n\n\"The House of the Dead\" was Dostoevsky’s only work that Leo Tolstoy revered.\n\n\nIn 1927–1928, Leoš Janáček wrote an operatic version of the novel, with the title \"From the House of the Dead\". It was his last opera.\n\nIn 1932, the novel was adapted to a film, directed by Vasili Fyodorov and starring Nikolay Khmelyov.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7508621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7508621", "title": "The Painted Veil (2006 film)", "text": "The Painted Veil (2006 film)\n\nThe Painted Veil is a 2006 American drama film directed by John Curran. The screenplay by Ron Nyswaner is based on the 1925 novel of the same title by W. Somerset Maugham. Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Toby Jones, Anthony Wong Chau Sang and Liev Schreiber appear in the leading roles.\n\nThis is the third film adaptation of the Maugham book, following a 1934 film starring Greta Garbo and Herbert Marshall and a 1957 version called \"The Seventh Sin\" with Bill Travers and Eleanor Parker.\n\nOn a brief trip back to London, earnest, bookish bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) is dazzled by Kitty Garstin (Naomi Watts), a vain London socialite. He proposes; she accepts (\"only to get as far away from [her] mother as possible\"), and the couple honeymoon in Venice. They travel on to Walter's medical post in Shanghai, where he is stationed in a government lab studying infectious diseases. They find themselves ill-suited, with Kitty much more interested in parties and the social life of the British expatriates.\n\nKitty meets Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a married British vice consul, and the two engage in a clandestine affair. When Walter discovers his wife's infidelity, he seeks to punish her by threatening to divorce her on the grounds of adultery, if she doesn't accompany him to a small village in a remote area of China. He has volunteered to treat victims of an unchecked cholera epidemic sweeping through the area. Kitty begs to be allowed to divorce him quietly, but he refuses, stating \"Why should I put myself through the smallest trouble for you?\" She hopes Townsend will leave his wife Dorothy and marry her. When she proposes this possibility to Charles, he declines to accept, despite earlier claiming to love Kitty.\n\nShe is compelled to travel to the mountainous inland region with her husband. They embark upon an arduous, two-week-long overland journey, which would be considerably faster and much easier if they traveled by river, but Walter is determined to make Kitty as unhappy and uncomfortable as possible. Upon their arrival in Mei-tan-fu, she is distressed to discover they will be living in near-squalor, far removed from everyone except their cheerful neighbor Waddington, a British deputy commissioner living with Wan Xi (Lu Yan), a young Chinese woman, in relative opulence.\n\nWalter and Kitty barely speak to each other and, except for a cook and a Chinese soldier assigned to guard her, she is alone for long hours. After visiting an orphanage run by a group of French nuns, Kitty volunteers her services, and she is assigned to work in the music room. She is surprised to learn from the Mother Superior that her husband loves children, especially babies. In this setting, she begins to see him in a new light as she learns what a selfless and caring person he can be. When he sees her with the children, he in turn realizes she is not the shallow, selfish person he thought her to be. As Walter's anger and Kitty's unhappiness subside, their marriage begins to blossom in the midst of the epidemic crisis. She soon learns she is pregnant, but is unsure who the father is. Walter – in love with Kitty again – assures her it doesn't matter.\n\nThe cholera epidemic takes many victims. As Walter and the locals are starting to get it under control, due to his importation of clean water through a system of aqueducts (as the local people did not understand water-borne infectious disease) cholera-carrying refugees from elsewhere pour into the area, forcing Walter to set up a camp outside town. He contracts the disease and Kitty lovingly nurses him, but he dies, and she is devastated. Bereft and pregnant, she leaves China.\n\nFive years later, Kitty appears well-dressed and happy in London shopping with her young son Walter. They meet Townsend by chance on the street, and he suggests that Kitty meet with him. Asking young Walter his age, he realizes from the reply that he might be the boy's father. Kitty rejects his overtures and walks away. When her son asks who Townsend is, she replies \"No one important, darling\".\n\n\nPrior to 1999, producer Sara Colleton sought to develop a script for \"The Painted Veil\". The script was frequently redrafted, being written to be close to the source material, to take liberties with the source material, and to create a feminist version. Actor Edward Norton became involved with the project in 1999. Norton explained his attraction to the project, \"It's very much a story about people getting beyond the worst in themselves and figuring out how to look at each other honestly, forgive each other for their failings and get to a better place... When I read it, I was very affected by it because in it I saw my own failings.\" The actor suggested casting Naomi Watts for the role of Kitty, which did not happen until Watts proved herself a bankable star with her performances in \"Mulholland Drive\" (2001) and \"21 Grams\" (2003). When Watts joined the project, she recommended director John Curran, with whom she had collaborated on the 2004 film \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\". The director's expertise with \"We Don't Live Here Anymore\" convinced Watts and Norton that he would be capable of depicting the dysfunctional relationship in \"The Painted Veil\". The project began development at producers Bob Yari and Mark Gordon's Stratus Film Company, but when Stratus executive Mark Gill left to start Warner Independent Pictures, he brought the project with him. Gill began production of the film in partnership with Yari. Gill was later fired before the film's completion by Warner Bros. production president Jeff Robinov, which later led to the film's marketing difficulties.\n\nYari and Warner Independent Pictures collaborated with a Chinese partner who was granted approval over the script and the finished film. The partnership permitted a budget of $19 million for \"The Painted Veil\". When the Chinese production company reviewed the film, it was unhappy with the depiction of the Chinese uprising and the cholera victims, requesting that the scenes be revised. Norton and Curran expressed concerns that their studio accepted the censorship too quickly, with the director threatening to remove his name from the film. Their pressure resulted in limiting cuts from the film to only 38 seconds' worth.\n\nScreenwriter Ron Nyswaner and Norton collaborated on the screenplay for the film. The 1925 novel by author W. Somerset Maugham was considered one-dimensional, so Norton altered the story so the character Walter Fane had a more enhanced role. The character was also rewritten to make his peace with his wife Kitty, leading to them falling in love with each other. Norton explained, \"I like to think that we didn't change the book so much as liberate it. We just imagined it on a slightly bigger scale, and made external some of what is internal in the novel.\" Norton described the novel as \"almost unremittingly bleak\" and believed that the author had thought that British colonials were unlikely to change. The actor explained of the change to the story, \"I went on the assumption that if you were willing to allow Walter and Kitty to grow... you had the potential for a love story that was both tragic and meaningful.\" Norton considered \"The Painted Veil\" to be in the spirit of films like \"Out of Africa\" (1985) and \"The English Patient\" (1996), seeing it as \"rooted in really looking at the way that men and women hurt each other\".\n\nDirector John Curran suggested setting the film during 1925, when the events of the Chinese nationalist movement were taking place. Norton, who had studied Chinese history at Yale University, agreed with the suggestion. To detail scenes from the time period, Curran, Norton, and Nyswaner relied on excerpts from historian Jonathan Spence's 1969 book \"To Change China\", which covered the inept efforts of Western advisers during these years. Norton described the character Walter Fane served as \"the proxy for the arrogance of Western rationalism\", explaining about Fane's confusion at the lack of gratitude for his help, \"Walter means well, but he's the folly of empire, and that adds a whole new dimension to what happens in the story. It's a metaphor for the way empires get crushed.\"\n\nFilming took place on location in Shanghai, China. The director did not want to build a set for the cholera-stricken village, instead seeking out an untouched parcel of land in China. He found Huang Yao Ancient Town (黄姚古镇 - huáng yáo gǔ zhèn) in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which served as the location for the village. The director described the location, \"Even the Chinese crew members were amazed at the place we found... It was like going back in time.\" According to Nyswaner, a large amount of time of the film production was spent negotiating with the Chinese government for the completion of the film, as there were disagreements over issues in the script. Most of the film was shot in Guangxi. Director John Curran commented, \"We wanted this movie to be distinctly Chinese. We didn’t want it to look like a film that you could shoot in Canada or Mexico or Italy.\" After a search of location in Hunan province, the scouts chose the location in Guangxi for the film. Line producer Antonia Barnard states that initially the film, like the novel, was going to be set in Hong Kong; however, the crew realized Hong Kong of the time period would be difficult to replicate, thus the story was altered so it would take place in Shanghai; the crew shot \"Shanghai for Shanghai in the period, and shot London scenes in Shanghai as well.\"\n\nThe official soundtrack is composed by Alexandre Desplat.\n\n\nThere are also three songs not listed on the official soundtrack. All of them are performed by the Choir of the Beijing Takahashi Culture and Art Centre: \n\nThe film's post-production schedule was initially slated to conclude in late summer 2006, but did not finish until November. According to Laura Kim, the marketing and publicity head of Warner Independent Pictures, the delay slowed award and media recognition for the film. Other studios were duplicating DVDs of their films for awards organizations, so \"The Painted Veil\" was unable to get first priority in processing. When \"The Painted Veil\" experienced a limited release in the United States on December 20, 2006 in the cities of Los Angeles and New York City, the meager marketing campaign for the film was criticized. The lack of attention caused half a dozen people associated with the film to complain about how Warner Independent Pictures was conducting the marketing campaign. Film critic Rex Reed of \"The New York Observer\" wrote, \"Nobody can understand why Warner Independent Pictures is keeping this movie such a secret; it is filled with Oscar possibilities that should be shouted from the rooftops.\"\n\nThe firing of Mark Gill, one of the initial producers of \"The Painted Veil\" who brought it to Warner Independent Pictures, was cited as a reason for the small scale of the film's marketing campaign. Director John Curran explained about the move to Warner Independent, \"Any transition is not going to be ideal. When the guy who has gotten you on board is gone, you're kind of exposed.\" Others also criticized the studio for not providing a large enough marketing budget, pointing out that the previous year's \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" had a more successful campaign with television and newspaper ads. \"The Painted Veil\" was eventually able to expand to 23 more markets on December 29, 2006, with additional cities on January 5, 2007. Warner Independent also hosted 80 screenings of \"The Painted Veil\" in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and London, as well as to various Hollywood guilds, to promote the film.\n\n\"The Painted Veil\" initially had a limited release in four theaters in the United States on December 20, 2006, grossing $51,086 over the opening weekend. The film gradually expanded its showings in the United States and Canada, peaking at 287 theaters on the weekend of January 26, 2007. \"The Painted Veil\" ultimately grossed $8,060,487 in the United States and Canada and $14,525,904 in other territories for a worldwide total of $22,586,391.\n\nOn the film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Painted Veil\" has received a 74% 'fresh' rating based on 143 reviews. On the similar website Metacritic, the film has received a metascore of 69 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, considered generally favorable reviews.\n\nManohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said the story seems \"so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from Edna Ferber. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance. Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles . . . An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback . . . Whether through craft or constitution, [he] invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant.\"\n\nCarina Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the film \"has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary E.M. Forster, the prose with the passion. It's impeccable, but leaves you cold.\"\n\nPeter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" rated the film three out of four stars and commented, \"If you're suspecting this third movie version of W. Somerset Maugham's 1925 novel may carry the infectious dullness of prestige filmmaking, rest easy . . . the film is a period piece propelled by emotions accessible to a modern audience . . . \"The Painted Veil\" has the power and intimacy of a timeless love story. By all means, let it sweep you away.\"\n\nMeghan Keane of the \"New York Sun\" said the film \"may at times threaten to fall into an abyss of sentimentality, and it has moments that seem mere transitions to propel the plot, but it manages a charming historic portrait without insulting the audience's intelligence.\"\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety\" thought the story \"feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked.\" He added, \"Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening . . . All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings . . .

In 2003, Balkin purchased of land in Tehachapi, California with the intention of giving them to a \"global everyone.\" As a means of doing this, Balkin looked into a number of legal strategies within the constraints of property and copyright law.\n\nThose working to create \"This is the Public Domain\" have attempted a number of legal strategies to achieve their goal. The first was attempting to copyright and then enter into the public domain the land within the project's boundaries as a conceptual artwork. However, the artists involved learned that one can only give away the rights of works which can be reproduced. In order to deal with this limitation, a bench was created and the land was declared an extension of said bench.\n\nThe second was to enter the land into the public domain by putting the land into a trust and then distributing the license which allows people to occupy or modify the land. Included in the license is that the land must either be licensed for universal use or for no one's use. Redistribution of this license is allowed, but modification is not.\n\nThe final three strategies appear to be theoretical. One is the creation of a bearer corporation which controls the land. The upside to this from the artists' perspective is that the land would have strong legal protection, but they question whether corporate control is the proper way to achieve it. Another is creating a Limited Common Property Regime. This is seen as acceptable if one can include the entire world as members of the regime, but they have doubts about whether or not that would be possible. The final is creating a land trust. However, this would require private ownership, and thus is likely to be rejected.\n\n"}

Miani married Domenico Negri in 1593, with whom she had five children, Isabetta, Isabella, Lucretia, Guilio, and Anzolo. Miani is known for being the first woman to publish a tragedy prior to the 18th century. In addition, she was the third woman in Italy to write in the newly popular genre, the pastoral. Miani's works explored themes such as cross-dressing, death and punishment, female virtue, and female resilience.\n\nMiani was born in the year 1563, most likely in the northern Italian city of Padua.\n\nWhile it is unknown who Miani's mother was, Miani's father was Vidal Miani, a practicing Paduan lawyer. In addition to earning an income by practicing law, he also taught law, and rented rooms to students. There is written record of Miani having two siblings, a brother who was a priest and a sister named Cornelia. Miani most likely had more siblings, as there would have been another son who would be the heir in the family. It would have been unlikely in this time period for a family to have their only son enter into the clergy, and have no son to continue the family line.\n\nThere is no written record of where Miani attended school. However, many young girls in this century were educated in convents, so it is possible that Miani was educated in a convent as well. Miani did however, have contact with the Ricovrati of Padua, a society made up of intellectuals, and both foreign and domestic professors. This academy was founded in 1599, and was the first academy to be established in Padua. Among its 25 founders was Galileo Galilei, famed Italian astronomer and philosopher. Decades after Valeria Miani had contact with the Ricovrati, the academy became known for its wide acceptance of women into its membership. It is not known however, if the Ricovrati allowed women to become members in Miani's time, and if so, whether or not Miani was a member.\n\nMiani got married on September 22, 1593, at the age of 30. Her husband was Domenico Negri, a man whose occupation is unknown. The formal ceremony was at the Church of the Eremitani, while the marriage contract was signed in the groom's home city of Venice. Compared to other women of a similar background in Italy during this time period, this was considered late in a woman's life to get married. While this may have been late for a typical woman of Miani's background, it was not for women of Miani's occupation. Other female writers during this century were married late in their life as well. Venetian writer and poet Moderata Fonte married at the age of 27, while Venetian author and women's rights activist Lucrezia Marinella married at the age of 35. Negri's death occurred sometime between the years 1612 and 1614. Following the time of his death, Miani no longer published anything else, seemingly ending her writing career.\n\nMiani and her husband are known to have five children. Their three daughters were Lucretia, Isabella, and Isabetta, and their two sons were Guilio ad Anzolo.\n\nVery little is known regarding the death of Valeria Miani. While it is known that she died in the year 1620, a specific date is not given. The place of her death is not known either, though it is likely that she passed somewhere in her home country of Italy.\n\nMiani's first pastoral drama, Amorosa Speranza was published in 1604. It took Miani six years to have her play published, having submitted it to her publisher in 1598. Her publisher and editor Francesco Bolzetta had the play in his possession for years before he decided to put it into print. Bolzetta was the primary publisher for the Ricovrati of Padua, the same academy which Miani was in contact with. By publishing Amorosa Speranza, Miani became the third woman in Italy to have ever published a nonreligious play. The play Amorosa Speranza appears to have not been written for print, but rather for performance. Multiple times during the play the performer addresses the audience, even so much as having the prologue of the performance primarily spoken to the audience. The plot of Amorosa Speranza revolves around the life of the virtuous sprite Venelia, who has been abandoned by her husband following their wedding night. Venezia struggles throughout the play to rid herself of the unwanted advances of two shepherds, Alliseo, and Isandro.\n\nIn Amorosa Speranza, Miani shields her two main characters from the satyrs and their deviance by having a third nymph be the one to outsmart and trick the satyr. By this third nymph deceiving the satyr who would want to do her harm, she is emphasizing the independence and autonomy that her female characters have within the story.\n\nMiani's second published work, Celinda, a Tragedy, was published seven years after Amorosa Speranza, in 1611. The publishing of this play marked the first known tragedy written and published by an Italian woman. Just as Amorosa Speranza was, Celinda, a Tragedy was published by the official publisher for the Ricovrati, Francesco Bolzetta. During the time when Celinda was published, the tragedy genre was exploding in popularity, with approximately 60 new tragedies published in 1611. While Celinda enjoyed popularity in print, there is no record of it ever making it to the stage. This was due in part to the fact that audiences considered tragedies bad omens to watch. Additionally, these performances were very expensive to put on, due to the cost of hiring actors, and having to recreate the bloody and violent imagery detailed in the play. The plot of Celinda, a Tragedy follows the story of the title character, 15 year old princess Celinda, and her prohibited relationship with Persian prince Autilio. Despite the fact that the two meet under false pretenses, with Autilio disguised as a woman, they fall in love. The entirety of the play details the horror and tragedy that befalls the two young lovers, complete with suicide and vendettas, both common motifs in the tragedy genre.\n\n\n"}

They believed that designers needed an association to promote professional advocacy, support them in both legal and educational issues, and to represent the profession to the public. Around that same time they joined the ICSID as a full member. VDID also works closely with the German Fashion and Textile Design Association (VDMD) under the umbrella of the German Designer Association (DDV).\n\nThe VDID promotes many other organizations within Germany and all of Europe by promoting exhibits, awards, and contests within the profession of industrial design.

It was declared treasure and valued at £350,000—the highest reward granted under the Treasure Act 1996 up to the time.\n\nThe hoard consists of two sets of jewellery of a very high purity of gold dating from 75–25 BCE. Although, the items pre-date the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 CE, the manufacturing technology was Roman rather than Celtic. The total weight of the items is nearly .\n\nThe find was described as \"the most important discovery of Iron Age gold objects\" for fifty years; and the items were probably an \"expensive\", \"diplomatic gift\". The brooches alone were \"the third discovery of its kind from Britain\".\n\nThe Winchester Hoard is now housed at the British Museum in London.\n\nThe hoard was discovered near Winchester over a series of trips to a farmer's ploughed field in September, October, and December, 2000 by retired florist and amateur metal detectorist Kevan Halls.\n\nThe first discovery, which was of the brooches, was reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, and archaeologists attached to the British Museum were able to excavate the find site to ascertain the historical context of the find. No evidence of a settlement or temple, by way of architectural remnants, was found. It was more likely that the hoard was buried \"on top of a small hill... covered with trees\".\n\nThe hoard was declared treasure following a coroner's inquest, and later valued at £350,000, which was shared between finder and landowner under the Treasure Act 1996 – the highest reward granted under that Act at that time. It was also the first time the context of a find was investigated by the British Museum in conjunction with said Act.\n\nThe hoard contains two sets of gold jewellery; each includes a torc, a pair of brooches, or fibulae, linked by a chain (of which only one chain was found), and a bracelet (of which one was broken in half). They were all made with a very high gold content – between 91% and 99% – determined by X-ray fluorescence tests at the British Museum. The total weight of the hoard is (37.25 troy ounces). It is dated from 75–25 BC, which places it in the Late British Iron Age.\n\nAll of the brooches are of a bow type, with two being further classified as \"Knotenfibeln\" (\"interlace fibulas\"), typical of La Tène style The chain is of gold wire, interlinked, with a hook at either end to attach to each pair of brooches. The bracelets are, or were in the case of the broken one, ring shaped. The ends of the torcs exhibit some ornamentation (granulation), and in the case of the smaller one, filigree. Both granulation and filigree had been attached by diffusion soldering.\n\nOne of the torcs is larger than the other, so it is assumed that each was intended for different sexes, and that the items had been worn.\n\nThe find was called \"the most important discovery of Iron Age gold objects\" since the Snettisham Hoard, over fifty years previously. The objects were also described as \"unique\", \"very unusual\" and even \"iconic\".\n\nGiven that gold brooches from the Iron Age are more rare than silver ones—in fact, this was only the third discovery of its kind from Britain, and one of \"less than a dozen\" from Northern Europe—it was possible to date the hoard more accurately by these. However, the torcs were unusual in that no others of this type had been found from Iron Age Britain, indeed Europe, up until then. The design was close to typical Iron Age torcs, but were made \"using Roman or Hellenistic Greek technology\", although this was several years before the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD – in other words, the execution was beyond the manufacturing knowledge of the Celts, and a link between Britain, Rome and Greece before such historical events. Moreover, social changes in Hampshire and West Sussex in the first century BC were highlighted.\n\nThe dichotomy of Roman craftmanship against \"Barbarian taste\" was further reinforced by Dr Jeremy Hills, who compiled both the British Museum and Treasure Annual Report for the hoard, by stating, \"I would have liked them to have been made in Britain, but they weren't... They're massive, chunky and showy. No self-respecting Greek or Roman would have worn anything as gaudy\".\n\nIt was determined that the hoard was not associated with grave goods, and was not part of a hoard associated with a settlement or religious location. It may, instead, have been a personal collection or votive offering. Hills further conjectured that \"[t]hey were a very expensive gift, a major diplomatic gift\", and that in doing so the Romans were \"winning friends and influencing them\", ultimately \"conquering them that way\". Ingratiating themselves with pro-Roman tribal kings, the Romans would have found it easier to quell internal unrest, thus making the recipients \"puppet rulers beholden to the superpower of their age\".\n\nWho the recipient, or indeed the giver, of the \"gift\" was is still unknown. However, it could have a link to the Gaul turncoat, Commius, who eventually became king of the Atrebates after fleeing a position as aide to Caesar which he took up in 56 BC.\n\nThe hoard is now housed in Room 50 of the British Museum in London and was part of the \"Buried Treasure: Finding Our Past\" exhibition (November 2003 — November 2005). Among other items in the exhibition were the Mildenhall Treasure, the Lewis chessmen, and the Ringlemere Cup.\n\nIn September 2003, BBC Two screened a documentary on the discovery of the hoard.\n\n"}
