Upon its completion in 1889, the large wooden structure boasted the second largest stage in the United States. The New York Opera House was the largest stage at the time.\n\nThe Louisville theater was built with materials from the nearby dismantled remains of the Southern Exposition building, which was located just a block away. It contained over 2,000 electric lights, could seat 3,072, and had a stage was 90 feet across and 60 feet deep. The theater opened on September 23, 1889.\n\nThe theater was operated by philanthropist William Norton, Jr., who went by the name Daniel Quilp, a villain in Charles Dickens' novel \"The Old Curiosity Shop\". He promoted the auditorium with the phrase \"Only for great attractions\". Norton also used the theatre as a place for the poor to collect handouts once a week. Upon his death he willed that his theatre workers receive three months' salary. He also gave 900,000 dollars of his estate to the Louisville Baptists' Orphans' Home.\n\nOn March 6, 1890, the highly acclaimed opera singer Adelina Patti gave her first performance of a three-day stop in Louisville during a six-city tour in the United States. The theater began having significant success following her performance. The summer season was the most productive.\n\nMany of the day's great actors and political figures performed there, including Edwin Booth, Lawrence Barrett, John Philip Sousa, Theodore Roosevelt, and Booker T. Washington. The theater was part of a large entertainment complex that included a bike riding park, a man-made lagoon, a promenade, and a ten-thousand-seat outdoor amphitheatre used for fireworks shows, including \"The Last Days of Pompei\" and \"Americus\".\n\nAfter Norton's death in 1903, no buyers could be found for the Auditorium or surrounding attractions. The last event, the \"Children's Floral Ball\", was held on April 30, 1904. Later, the site was purchased for $900 and razed on May 5, 1905, only 16 years after its completion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1550643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1550643", "title": "André Antoine", "text": "André Antoine\n\nAndré Antoine (31 January 185823 October 1943) was a French actor, theatre manager, film director, author, and critic who is considered the father of modern mise en scène in France.\n\nAndré Antoine was a clerk at the Paris Gas Utility and worked in the Archer Theatre when he asked to produce a dramatization of a novel by Émile Zola. The amateur group refused it, so he decided to create his own theatre to realize his vision of the proper development of dramatic art.\nAntoine founded the Théâtre Libre in Paris in 1887. This was a \"théâtre d'essai\", a workshop theatre, where plays were produced whether they would perform at the box office or not. It was also a stage for new writing whose subject matter or form had been rejected in other theatres. Over a seven-year period, until 1894, the Théâtre Libre staged some 111 plays. His work had enormous influence on the French stage, as well as on similar companies elsewhere in Europe, such as the Independent Theatre Society in London and the Freie Buhne in Germany.\n\nAntoine opposed the traditional teachings of the Paris Conservatory, and focused on a more naturalistic style of acting and staging. In particular, Théâtre Libre productions were inspired by the Meiningen Ensemble of Germany. They performed works by Zola, Becque, Brieux, and plays by contemporary German, Scandinavian, and Russian naturalists. In 1894, Antoine was forced to relinquish the theater due to financial failure, but he went on to form Théâtre Antoine, which followed the traditions established by Théâtre Libre until its demise 10 years later.\n\nThe work of the Theatre Libre was said to embrace both Realism and Naturalism. In theatre, Realism is generally thought to be a 19th-century movement which uses dramatic and stylistic conventions to bring authenticity and 'real life' to performances and drama texts while Naturalism is commonly seen as an extension to this where an attempt is made to create a perfect illusion of reality. Naturalism is often said to be driven by Darwinism and its view of humans as behavioral creatures shaped by heredity and environment. Antoine believed that our environment determines our character and he would often start rehearsals by creating the set, settings or environment which would then allow his actors to explore their characters and their behaviors with greater authenticity. Often he would only hire untrained actors (a practice still common with young film makers) since he believed that the professional actors of his time could not realistically portray real people.\n\nAntoine's Theatre Libre dedicated itself more specifically to the Quart d'heure or short, simple, free, episodic, one act play performances. he concentrated on script development but advocated naturalistic, behavioral acting dependent on the interaction of actors and helping acting to find their psychological motivations. Discussions on matters of interpretation and setting were a normal part of rehearsals with actors. Antoine believed each play had its unique mood or atmosphere and he hardly ever reused sets and settings. He also literally believed in the notion of removing the fourth wall. With some plays he would rehearse in the space with four walls around the action, natural set and actors and then decide which fourth wall to remove and thus deciding which side or perspective to place the audience on. Plays performed at the Théâtre Libre were often \"thin on plot, dense in social and psychological implication\" (Chothia, Andre Antoine). Productions rejected formal acting styles that were prevalent at the time and they built the \"fourth wall.\" Despite being proponents of naturalism, they still adhered to some ideas of \"playing for the audience\" – there is no evidence that Antoine ever set any chairs facing away from the audience, and the actors still had to make sure that their voices could be heard to the back of the house—so, in a way, their \"naturalism\" was really just a higher level of illusion than theatre had been up to that point.\n\nIn 1894, Antoine gave up the direction of his own theatre, and became connected with the Gymnase, and two years later, with the Odéon theatres. Heavily indebted, he left the Odéon in 1914 and turned to the cinema. Meanwhile, he stayed a short period in Istanbul in order to found The Istanbul City Theater. Once World War I started he returned to Paris. Between 1915 and 1922, he directed several films under auspices of the \"Société cinématographique des auteurs et gens de lettres\" (\"Film Society of Authors and Men of Letters\") of Pierre Decourcelle, adapting literary or dramatic works, such as \"La Terre\" (\"Earth\"), \"Les Frères corses\" (\"The Corsican Brothers\") and \"Quatre-vingt-treize\" (\"Ninety-three\"). He applied the principles of naturalism to film, giving importance to the scenery, natural elements that actually determine the behavior of the protagonists, and by using non-professional actors who were not tied up in the old forms of theater. For Jean Tulard, his literary reputation and is involved in \"giving the film its sense of nobility\". Influencing film makers like Mercanton, Capellans Hervil and he is \"the true father of neorealism\".\n\nAntoine concluded his career as a theatre and film critic beginning in 1919. For twenty years, his commentary was published by \"L'Information\", and more sporadically in \"Le Journal, Comœdia\", and \"Le Monde illustré\". Two volumes of memoirs were published in 1928, and appeared in the journal \"Théâtre\" from 1932 to 1933.\n\n\n\"(Works as film director)\" \n\n\n"}

Aphrodite inspires love and passionate desire in humankind while her brother , her antithesis, promotes warfare and conflict. Despite this conflict of values, Ares and Aphrodite are siblings and allies. Aphrodite is portrayed as a modern-day Greek Goddess, with somewhat of a dumb blonde and usually vain persona. She is essentially good-natured and helpful; she is close friends with Gabrielle because of that. Nearly all of Aphrodite's attire resembles lingerie, and she is nearly always barefoot. She romances Hephaestus, but unlike the myths, their relationship is essentially a happy one.\n\nAs in the myth of her birth, Aphrodite first appears rising out of the sea in a giant seashell. As a joke, she then uses the seashell to go windsurfing.\n\nBefore her marriage to Hephaestus she is portrayed as being a bit promiscuous; she steals a boyfriend away from Hera and because of that Hera places a curse on her son Cupid. Cupid falls in love with a girl named Psyche, who is said to be more beautiful than Aphrodite, which makes her extremely jealous. Out of jealousy, Aphrodite tries to shoot a love arrow at Psyche, but Cupid tries to stop her. This only makes things worse when Hercules is accidentally hit and falls in love with Psyche. Thanks to Hera's curse, Cupid literally turns into a green-eyed monster with jealousy at the thought of losing Psyche. The curse is eventually lifted when the truth comes, after he confesses his love for Psyche and she marries him. Aphrodite gives Psyche Ambrosia to make her a goddess to make amends, since she is the one who started the mess. Although she soon realizes she is now a mother-in-law, which does not make her very happy. She becomes a grandmother later on when Psyche and Cupid have a son, Bliss.\n\nOn \"Hercules\", Aphrodite is usually the comic relief or the viewers' window into the politics of Mount Olympus. Though she is originally introduced as a scheming goddess, devious and almost as uncaring as Ares, she quickly evolves into a more benevolent fun-loving character, though still prone to mood-swings. She is also the only member of his Olympian family Hercules seems to have any sort of close relationship with (in one episode he refers to her as his favorite little sister, and is somewhat close to her son Cupid who refers to him as \"Uncle Herc\"), despite the trouble he seems to cause him.\n\nAphrodite determines to break up a royal family marriage that will end a war, only because the newly allied kingdoms plan to destroy her temples. As her son Cupid explains to Gabrielle, \"When the Goddess of Love decides to do something petty and spiteful, she can be a tad difficult to reason with.\" She later develops a friendship with Gabrielle and tries to save her during the of the Olympian Gods.\n\nAphrodite becomes one of the survivors of the Twilight of the Olympian Gods, organized by Xena when the gods, under Athena's flag, join together to kill Eve. Aphrodite remains unconvinced that Eve will willingly destroy the gods, to the point where she sneaks Xena and Gabrielle into Olympus itself. After the Twilight of the Gods, Aphrodite becomes mentally unbalanced due to Ares losing his powers; Love must be balanced by War. Her powers are stolen by Caligula, whom Xena tricks into killing himself. This makes matters worse, since love is now gone from the world altogether. Xena restores the powers of both Aphrodite and Ares using golden apples she stole from the Norse Gods, thereby restoring balance to the universe.\n\n\n"}

Designed by the architect Lewin Sharp for owner Henry Lowenfeld, it became the fourth legitimate theatre to be constructed on the street when it opened its doors on 21 February 1901, with the American musical comedy \"The Belle of Bohemia\".\n\nHenry Lowenfeld had bought land on the newly created Shaftesbury Avenue at the turn of the 20th century—next door to the Lyric Theatre, which opened in 1888—and as a consequence the Apollo is one of the few theatres in London to be freehold.\n\nThe only complete theatre design of architect Lewin Sharp, the Apollo was specifically designed for musical theatre and named after the Greek god of the arts and leader of the muses. It was constructed by builder Walter Wallis of plain London brick in keeping with the neighbouring streets; the front piece is in the Renaissance style with a sculpted stone fascia by T. Simpson. The structure encloses a four-level auditorium, with three cantilevered balconies and a first-floor central loggia, decorated in the Louis XIV Style by Hubert van Hooydonk. In keeping with then European style, each level has its own foyer and promenade.\n\nOwing to the death of Queen Victoria the previous month, it became the first London theatre to be completed in the Edwardian period. The capacity on the opening night, 21 February 1901, was 893, with a proscenium of wide and deep.\n\nThe capacity today is 775 seats, with the balcony on the 3rd tier considered the steepest in London.\n\nOwing to a relatively unsuccessful opening, impresario Tom B. Davis took a lease on the building, and hence management of operations, from 1902. The theatre was renovated by Ernest Schaufelberg in 1932, with a private foyer and anteroom installed to the Royal Box. Prince Littler took control of the theatre in 1944.\n\nStoll Moss Group purchased the theatre in 1975, selling it to Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and Bridgepoint Capital in 2000. Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the theatre and several others in 2005, creating Nimax Theatres, which still owns the theatre.\n\nOn 19 December 2013, at about 20:15 GMT, of the auditorium's ornate plasterwork ceiling collapsed around 40 minutes into a performance of \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\". It brought down a lighting rig and a section of balcony, thereby trapping two people and injuring around 88, including seven seriously. There were 720 people in the audience at the time. The incident was preceded by heavy rain.\n\nThe emergency services responded with 25 ambulance crews, an air ambulance rapid response team, 8 fire engines with more than 50 firefighters, and the Metropolitan Police. Casualties were taken to the foyers of the adjacent Gielgud and Queen's theatres, where the emergency services could triage. The London Ambulance Service later stated that they had treated 76 injured people, with 58 taken to four London hospitals, some on commandeered buses. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust said 34 adults and 5 children were subsequently treated in accident and emergency at St Thomas' Hospital.\n\nThe venue reopened on 26 March 2014, with an adaptation of \"Let the Right One In\" produced by the National Theatre of Scotland. The owners were able to reopen the theatre by sealing the fourth level and balcony with a temporary floor, which allowed investigators to continue their work in determining the cause of the collapse.\n\nThe opening caused a public uproar, with a selected audience for the first performance, on Thursday 21 February 1901, and the first public performance scheduled for 22 February. \"The Times\" refused to review the private opening, instead waiting until the first public production on the following day. The opening production was the American musical comedy \"The Belle of Bohemia\", which survived for 72 performances—17 more than it had accomplished when produced on Broadway. The production was followed by John Martin-Harvey's season, including \"A Cigarette Maker's Romance\" and \"The Only Way\", an adaptation of Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\".\n\nGeorge Edwardes produced a series of successful Edwardian musical comedies, including \"Kitty Grey\" (1901), \"Three Little Maids\" and \"The Girl from Kays\" (1902). An English version of André Messager's light opera \"Véronique\" became a hit in 1904, starring with Ruth Vincent, who also starred in Edward German's \"Tom Jones\" in 1907 in which Cicely Courtneidge made her London debut. Between 1908 and 1912 the theatre hosted H. G. Pelissier's \"The Follies\". After this it staged a variety of works, including seasons of plays by Charles Hawtrey in 1913, 1914 and 1924, and Harold Brighouse's \"Hobson's Choice\" in 1916. \"Inside the Lines\" by Earl Derr Biggers ran for 421 performances in 1917. Gilbert Dayle's \"What Would a Gentleman Do?\" played in 1918 and \"Tilly of Bloomsbury\" by Ian Hay was the success in 1919.\n\nGeorge Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard managed the theatre from 1920 to 1923, presenting a series of plays and revivals, including \"Such a Nice Young Man\" by H.F. Maltby (1920) and the stage version of George Du Maurier's novel \"Trilby\" (1922). They had produced \"The Only Girl\" here in 1916 and \"Tilly of Bloomsbury\" in 1919. \"The Fake\" was produced in 1924, starring Godfrey Tearle. 1927 saw \"Abie's Irish Rose\" and \"Whispering Wires\", with Henry Daniel. The next year, Laurence Olivier starred in R. C. Sherriff's \"Journey's End\". Seán O'Casey's \"The Silver Tassie\" and Ivor Novello's \"A Symphony in Two Flats\" both played in 1929. Diana Wynyard starred as Charlotte Brontë in Clemence Dane's \"Wild Decembers\" in 1932. Marion Lorne was the star of a number of plays by her husband Walter Hackett from 1934 to 1937. Ian Hay's \"Housemaster\" had the most successful run in this period with 662 performances from 1936. Raymond Massey starred in Robert Sherwood's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Idiot's Delight\" in 1938. Patrick Hamilton's play \"Gaslight\" held the stage in 1939, and Terence Rattigan's \"Flare Path\" played in 1942.\n\nControl of the theatre transferred to Prince Littler in 1944. John Clements and Kay Hammond starred that year in a revival of Noël Coward's \"Private Lives\", and Margaret Rutherford starred in \"The Happiest Days of Your Life\" in 1948, followed by Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson in \"Treasure Hunt\", directed by John Gielgud in 1949. After this, \"Seagulls Over Sorrento\" ran for over three years beginning in 1950. The theatre's longest run was the comedy \"Boeing-Boeing\", starring Patrick Cargill and David Tomlinson, which opened in 1962 and transferred to the Duchess Theatre in 1965. In 1968 Gielgud starred in Alan Bennett's \"Forty Years On\", and in 1969 he returned in David Storey's \"Home\", with Ralph Richardson. He returned to the theatre in 1988, at the age of 83, in \"The Best of Friends\" by Hugh Whitemore.\n\nA number of hit comedies transferred to or from the theatre in the 1970s and 1980s, and other important plays here during the period included Rattigan's \"Separate Tables\", with John Mills in 1976, Lyle Kessler's \"Orphans\" in 1986 with Albert Finney, \"I'm Not Rappaport\" the same year, with Paul Scofield, and Dorothy Tutin, Eileen Atkins and Siân Phillips in \"Thursday's Ladies\" in 1987. \"Driving Miss Daisy\" played in 1988, starring Wendy Hiller, and 1989 saw Zoë Wanamaker in \"Mrs Klein\", Vanessa Redgrave in \"A Madhouse in Goa\", \"Thunderbirds FAB\" starring Andrew Dawson and Gavin Robertson, and Peter O'Toole in \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\". Penelope Wilton starred in Rattigan's \"The Deep Blue Sea\" in 1993, and \"In Praise of Love\" played in 1995 with Peter Bowles.

{"id": "1212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1212", "title": "Artist", "text": "Artist\n\nAn artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n\nWiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines the older broad meanings of the term \"artist\":\n\n\nThe Greek word \"techně\", often translated as \"art,\" implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, \"technicus\",\nbecame the source of the English words technique, technology, technical.\n\nIn Greek culture each of the nine Muses oversaw a different field of human creation:\n\nNo muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.\n\nThe word \"art\" derives from the Latin \"ars\" (stem \"art-\"), which, although literally defined, means \"skill method\" or \"technique\", and conveys a connotation of beauty.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word \"artist\" already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling \"craftsman\", while the word \"artesan\" was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some \"artisanal\" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.\n\nThe first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472): \"De re aedificatoria, De statua, De pictura\", which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a project behind).\n\nWith the Academies in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.\n\nMany contemporary definitions of \"artist\" and \"art\" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into kitsch.\n\n\"Artist\" is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as \"a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium\". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person creative in, innovative in, or adept at, an artistic practice.\n\nMost often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or 'high culture', activities such as drawing, painting, sculpture, acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, new media, photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an aesthetic value. Art historians and critics define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the applied arts or decorative arts include artisan, craftsman, and specialized terms such as potter, goldsmith or glassblower. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the Renaissance in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.\n\nThe term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-\"art\" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.\n\nOften, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among \"artist\" and \"technician\", \"entertainer\" and \"artisan\", \"fine art\" and \"applied art\", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word \"artiste\" (which in French, simply means \"artist\") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in Music Hall or Vaudeville). Use of the word \"artiste\" can also be a pejorative term.\n\nThe English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.\n\nIn \"Living with Art\", Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:\n\nAfter looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between \"arts for art's sake\" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that \"this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down\" (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies many visual artists as either \"craft artists\" or \"fine artists\". A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing. A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as book illustrations or medical illustrations), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.\n\nThe main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice. Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts. Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.\n\nThe number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields. About half of US artists are self-employed. Others work in a variety of industries. For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.\n\nIn the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year. This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as graphic designers, multimedia artists, animators, and fashion designers. Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.\n\n\n"}

The wife of film director Michael Curtiz, Meredyth wrote \"The Affairs of Cellini\" (1934) and adapted \"The Unsuspected\" (1947). She was one of the 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nMeredyth began her involvement in performing and writing from an early age. Her father was the manager at a local theatre, and she studied piano throughout her childhood. After encouragement from her English teacher, Meredyth also pursued fiction writing. At the age of 13, she approached the local newspaper editor about writing a fiction column. Each story she wrote for the paper earned her a dollar, making this her first paid work as a writer.\n\nMeredyth began her career in show business in vaudeville as a comedian. She most often sang or performed monologues while accompanying herself on the piano, a form she referred to as a \"pianologue.\" \n\nMeredyth began her screen career as an extra at D.W. Griffith's Biograph Studios in New York, before moving to Los Angeles in 1911. Meredyth worked as an actress for five years, supplanting her income with screenwriting. While most of this work was as an extra, her most prominent role was the titular character in the 4-reel \"Bess the Detectress\" (1914) serials.\n\nMeredyth met Wilfred Lucas in 1911 when he encouraged her to pursue screen acting. The year after, the two worked together on the film \"A Sailor's Heart\" (1913)\",\" the first of many artistic collaborations. They were eventually given their production unit at Universal Studios, in which they produced the 30-reel long \"Trey of Hearts\" (1914) serials.\n\nMeredyth and Lucas had one child together, television writer John Meredyth Lucas (1919-2002). They divorced in 1927, following her return from supervising \"\" (1925)\n\nIn 1918, Meredyth and Lucas traveled to Australia to work with Australian sportsman Snowy Baker. They made three films together, \"The Man from Kangaroo\" (1920), \"The Jackeroo of Coolabong\" (1920) and \"The Shadow of Lightning Ridge\" (1921), the first two of which Meredyth co-directed. She was arguably the first professional screenwriter to work in Australia.\n\nMeredyth and director Michael Curtiz met soon after his arrival in the United States, while both were working at Warner Brothers Studios. They were married in 1929 and unsuccessfully attempted to start a production unit at MGM studios in 1946.\n\nThough often uncredited, Meredyth contributed to several of Curtiz's projects. Most notably, Curtiz reportedly called Meredyth for input several times a day while working on his most successful film, \"Casablanca\" (1942). \nMeredyth and Curtiz separated twice; once in 1941, and again in 1960. However, they remained in contact after this separation, and Curtiz included Meredyth in his will upon his death in 1962.\n\nThroughout her time at MGM studios, Meredyth had mainly worked under Irving Thalberg. Upon his death in 1936, the new MGM executives dropped Meredyth's contract. Rather than re-entering as a \"junior writer,\" as the new executives offered, Meredyth decided to retire from professional screenwriting. Despite this announcement, she has three credits after her alleged retirement,\" The Mark of Zorro\" (1940), \"That Night in Rio\" (1941), and \"The Unsuspected\" (1947).\n\n"}

{"id": "1903488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1903488", "title": "Dream sequence", "text": "Dream sequence\n\nA dream sequence is a technique used in storytelling, particularly in television and film, to set apart a brief interlude from the main story. The interlude may consist of a flashback, a flashforward, a fantasy, a vision, a dream, or some other element.\n\nCommonly, dream sequences appear in many films to shed light on the psychical process of the dreaming character or give the audience a glimpse into the character's past. For instance in \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure\", the purpose of Pee-wee's dreams is to inform the audience of his anxieties and fears after losing his bike. Other times major action takes place in dreams, allowing the filmmaker to explore infinite possibilities, as Michel Gondry demonstrates in \"The Science of Sleep\". Harvard psychologist Deirdre Barrett points out in the book \"The Committee of Sleep\" that, while the main content of dream sequences is determined by the film's overall plot, visual details often reflect the individual dream experience of the screenwriter or director. For Hitchcock's \"Spellbound\", Salvador Dalí designed sharply angled sets inspired by his own dream space. Ingmar Bergman lit dream sequences in several films with a harsh glare of light which he says reflects his own nightmares (though most people's have dim light), and Orson Welles designed a scene of \"The Trial\" to reflect the manner in which architecture constantly changed in his dreams.\n\nFilms normally present dreams as a visually accessible or objectively observed space, a discrete environment in which characters exist and interact as they do in the world rather than restricting themselves to the subjective point of view a dream is normally experienced from in real life. In this way films succeed in presenting a coherent dreamed world alongside the diegetic reality of the film. Via transition from one to the next, a film establishes not only the boundaries but resonances between the two worlds. These resonances can reveal a character's subjective observations or desires without breaking away from the objective viewpoint of the narrator, camera, or director with which some theorist, such as Christian Metz, believe the viewer identifies.\n\nIt is also possible to retroactively explain past plot elements as a dream sequence in order to maintain a plausible continuity in continuing fiction, such as a television series. Such was the case with \"Dallas\", which had killed off Bobby Ewing, one of the more popular characters on the show; when the show's writers decided to bring Bobby back to the show, the tenth-season premiere \"Return to Camelot\" revealed that the events between Bobby's death and the end of season nine were all part of a nightmare his wife was having.\n\nAudio or visual elements, such as distinctive music or coloration, are frequently used to signify the beginning and end of a dream sequence in film. It has also become commonplace to distinguish a dream sequence from the rest of the film by showing a shot of a person in bed sleeping or about to go to sleep. Other films show a dream sequence followed by a character waking up in their own bed, such as the dream sequence George Gershwin composed for his film score to \"Delicious\". In classic Hollywood, the wavy dissolve was the standard way to transition between reality and a dream; there would be a close-up of the character having the dream, which would begin shimmering as we crossed over from reality to fantasy. One of the most common contemporary transitions into a fantasy is to zoom in on a character's face and then spin around to the back of that character to reveal that he/she is now standing in an alternate reality. Perhaps the most common technique today is the post-reveal in which a character is shown in an awkward or unusual situation, the scene builds to an even more absurd or unusual situation, and then suddenly there is a cut to the character waking up, as exemplified by the opening sequence of \"Bring It On\" where a pep rally with irreverent routines builds into an abnormal moment where a character is revealed topless; she then wakes up to the viewers' realization that she had been dreaming.\n\nThis is akin to the technique wherein a dream sequence is a plot device in which an entire story has been revealed to be a dream. As opposed to a segment of an otherwise real scenario, in these cases it is revealed that everything depicted was unreal. Often this is used to explain away otherwise inexplicable events. Because it has been done in many occasions to resolve a storyline that seemed out of place or unexpected, it is often considered weak storytelling; a particularly referenced example of this is the TV show \"Dallas\" in which the entirety of season 9 was revealed after the fact to have been a dream. Furthermore, in-jokes are often made in writing (particularly television scripts) that refer to the disappointment a viewer might feel in finding out everything they have watched was a dream. For example, entire sequences of the \"Family Guy\" two-part episode \"Stewie Kills Lois\" and \"Lois Kills Stewie\" are revealed to have taken place within a virtual reality simulation, upon which a character asks whether a potential viewer could be angry that they have effectively watched a dream sequence, but this technique can also be effective and its use lauded when the status of dream or reality is left more ambiguous as it was in \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe camera angles and movements used to depict dream sequences enable this kind of play and confusion between the diegetic reality and the dreamed world by presenting the dream world as a visually accessible space in which the character moves around the same as he does in the diegetic reality, as opposed to restricting themselves cinematographically to a subjective viewpoint even though dreams are generally understood to be experienced by the dreamer from their own subjective point of view. This point is made salient by the films which choose to employ first-person camera angles such as \"Strange Days\" (1995) when it depicts recorded memories experienced via the \"SQUID\" recorder, the first-person sequence of \"Doom\" (2005), the beginning of \"Enter the Void\" (2010), and others, and how radically these moments stand out against normal cinematography even when the subject matter is something as subjective as a dream. Many have cited the general impracticality and unattractiveness of sustained first-person perspective in film as a reason for its absence from filmed dream sequences.\n\nThe dream sequence that Atossa narrates near the beginning of Aeschylus' Athenian tragedy \"The Persians\" (472 BCE) may be the first in the history of European theater. The first dream sequence in a film is more contested. Film critic Bob Mondello claims that the first famous movie with a dream sequence was Buster Keaton's \"Sherlock, Jr.\" (1924). Predating this, Leslie Halpern claims that the earliest dream sequence was in Edwin S. Porter's \"Life of an American Fireman\" (1903). Earlier than either of these, James Walters points out G.A. Smith's use of a dream sequence in \"Let Me Dream Again\" (1900), but is careful to note the precariousness of claiming any film the first to feature dream sequence given the rapid transnational development of cinema in its early years and that so many films from the period have been lost.\n\nWalters traces the dream sequence technique of revealing one thing to be another (revealing what the audience thought was a dream to actually be reality), back to magic lantern shows features \"slipping\" or \"slipper\" slides in which; some lantern slides for examples would feature two sheets of glass with different images painted on each, say a cocoon and a butterfly. The first sheet would be projected and then the second sheet slid on top of it to reveal a change, such as a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. Dream sequences became very popular in the early period of film following this change of phase format. Alongside this technique, a dream sequence which is introduced by a character falling asleep and then entering the dream sequence also became popular via such films as Edwin S. Porter's \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\" (1906). What is important to note is these films created a model for dream sequences in which a character's inner thoughts are not represented subjectively (from the character's point of view), but from an objective camera angle that gives the audience the impression less of a character having a dream than of being transported alongside the character into a dreamed world in which the character's actions are captured by the camera in the same way they are the films' real fictional worlds.\n"}

He wrote more than twenty pieces for the theatre, as well as numerous shorter works, including his famous poem, \"Lasca\".\n\nDesprez was born in Bristol, England, the eldest of the eleven children of Charles Desprez, a jeweller and silversmith. The family was of French descent. He was educated at Cosham School, Wiltshire and spent three years in his teens in the U.S. State of Texas. In 1883, Desprez married Jessie Louisa Potter Macqueen. They had a son and two daughters.\n\nDesprez returned to Britain in 1875. His first piece written for the theatre shortly thereafter was an adaptation of \"La fille de Madame Angot\". When this piece went on the road in 1876, he also wrote a companion piece for it called \"Happy Hampstead\", which was set to music by the theatrical agent and composer Richard D'Oyly Carte. Desprez became a close friend of Carte's and worked with him for many years as Carte's secretary.\n\nAt the same time Desprez wrote the texts for ten short works for D'Oyly Carte, most of which accompanied the Gilbert and Sullivan operas on the bills at the Opera Comique and later the Savoy Theatre. These pieces had long runs in tandem with, and sometimes beyond, the runs of the principal pieces, and they were usually played on tour throughout Britain as companion pieces, benefit pieces and short-programme items. Working with composers such as Alfred Cellier and Edward Solomon, Desprez became perhaps the most popular librettist of one-act operas in Britain.\nDesprez's most frequently played work was his 1879 two-act musical play, \"Tita in Thibet\", which was later played in the British provinces by the Majilton company more than a thousand times. It was written as a vehicle for the music hall star Kate Santley. W. H. Seymour, who would become the stage manager of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for 20 years, also played in the piece. The story concerns an unusual marriage custom purportedly to be found \"in out of the way parts of the world\" such as Tibet. The customs of the country permit every wife to have four husbands. The reviewer from \"The Era\" did not find the piece \"refined\" enough for his taste.\n\nDesprez's best work as a lyricist was \"The Nautch Girl, or, The Rajah of Chutneypore\", which played at the Savoy Theatre in 1891-92.\n\nDesprez' best-known work, however, is a poem, \"Lasca\", about a Mexican girl and her cowboy sweetheart caught in a cattle stampede \"in Texas down by the Rio Grande.\" The ballad-like poem, first published in a London magazine in 1882, has often been reprinted, usually with deletions and changes, and recited in many parts of the English-speaking world. Between 1873 and 1882 at least four other of Desprez's poems had been published, two of which are about Texas.\n\nIn 1884, Desprez began writing for \"The Era\", London's foremost theatre paper, and he became its editor in 1893, a position he held until illness forced him to retire in 1913. Desprez also wrote dozens of essays on travel, art, music, and famous personalities that were published in English periodicals, most of them between 1905 and 1914.\n\nDesprez died in London at the age of 63.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "390698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390698", "title": "Gilding", "text": "Gilding\n\nGilding is any decorative technique for applying a very thin coating of gold to solid surfaces such as metal (much the most common), wood, porcelain, or stone. A gilded object is also described as \"gilt\". Where metal is gilded, it was traditionally silver in the West, to make silver-gilt (or \"vermeil\") objects, but gilt-bronze is commonly used in China, and also called ormolu if it is Western. Methods of gilding include hand application and gluing, typically of gold leaf, chemical gilding, and electroplating, the last also called gold plating. Parcel-gilt (partial gilt) objects are only gilded over part of their surfaces. This may mean that all of the inside, and none of the outside, of a chalice or similar vessel is gilded, or that patterns or images are made up by using a combination of gilt and ungilted areas.\n\nGilding gives an object a gold appearance at a fraction of the cost of creating a solid gold object. In addition, a solid gold piece would often be too soft or too heavy for practical use. A gilt surface also does not tarnish as silver does.\n\nHerodotus mentions that the Egyptians gilded wood and metals, and many such objects have been excavated. Certain Ancient Greek statues of great prestige were chryselephantine, i.e., made of gold (for the clothing) and ivory (for the flesh); these however, were constructed with sheets of gold over a timber framework, not gilded. Extensive ornamental gilding was also used in the ceiling coffers of the Propylaea. Pliny the Elder informs us that the first gilding seen at Rome was after the destruction of Carthage, under the censorship of Lucius Mummius, when the Romans began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces, the Capitol being the first place on which this process was used. But he adds that luxury advanced on them so rapidly that in very little time you might see all, even private and poor people, gild the walls, vaults, and other parts of their dwellings. Owing to the comparative thickness of the gold leaf used in ancient gilding, the traces of it that remain are remarkably brilliant and solid. Fire-gilding of metal goes back at least to the 4th century BC, and was known to Pliny (33,20,64–5), Vitruvius (8,8,4) and in the Early Mediaeval period to Theophilus (De Diversis Artibus Book III).\n\nIn Europe, silver-gilt has always been more common than gilt-bronze, but in China the opposite has been the case. The ancient Chinese also developed the gilding of porcelain, which was later taken up by the French and other European potters.\n\nModern gilding is applied to numerous and diverse surfaces and by various processes; those used in modern technology are described in gold plating. More traditional techniques still form an important part of framemaking and are sometimes still employed in general woodworking, cabinet-work, decorative painting and interior decoration, bookbinding, and ornamental leather work, and in the decoration of pottery, porcelain, and glass.\n\nMechanical gilding includes all the operations in which gold leaf is prepared, and the processes to mechanically attach the gold onto surfaces. The techniques include burnishing, water gilding and oil-gilding used by wood carvers and gilders; and the gilding operations of the house decorator, sign painter, bookbinder, the paper stainer and several others.\n\nPolished iron, steel and other metals are gilded mechanically by applying gold leaf to the metallic surface at a temperature just under red-hot, pressing the leaf on with a burnisher, then reheating when additional leaf may be laid on. The process is completed by cold burnishing.\n\n\"Overlaying\" or folding or hammering on gold foil or gold leaf is the simplest and most ancient method, and is mentioned in Homer's Odyssey (Bk vi, 232) and the Old Testament. The \"Ram in a Thicket\" of about 2600–2400 BCE from Ur uses this technique on wood, with a thin layer of bitumen underneath to help adhesion.\n\nThe next advances involved two simple processes. The first involves gold leaf, which is gold that is hammered or cut into very thin sheets. Gold leaf is often thinner than standard paper today, and when held to the light is semi-transparent. In ancient times it was typically about ten times thicker than today, and perhaps half that in the Middle Ages.\n\nIf gilding on canvas or on wood, the surface was often first coated with gesso. \"Gesso\" is a substance made of finely ground gypsum or chalk mixed with glue. Once the coating of gesso had been applied, allowed to dry, and smoothed, it was re-wet with a sizing made of rabbit-skin glue and water (\"water gilding\", which allows the surface to be subsequently burnished to a mirror-like finish) or boiled linseed oil mixed with litharge (\"oil gilding\", which does not) and the gold leaf was layered on and left to dry. Those gilding on canvas and parchment also sometimes employed stiffly-beaten egg whites (\"glair\"), gum, and/or Armenian bole as sizing, though egg whites and gum both become brittle over time, causing the gold leaf to crack and detach, and so honey was sometimes added to make them more flexible.\n\nOther gilding processes involved using the gold as pigment in paint: the artist ground the gold into a fine powder and mixed it with a binder. Then the gold was applied in the same way as with any paint. Sometimes, after either gold-leafing or gold-painting, the artist would heat the piece enough to melt the gold slightly, ensuring an even coat. These techniques remained the only alternatives for materials like wood, leather, the vellum pages of illuminated manuscripts, and gilt-edged stock.\n\nChemical gilding embraces those processes in which the gold is at some stage of chemical combination. These include:\n\nIn this process the gold is obtained in a state of extremely fine division, and applied by mechanical means. Cold gilding on silver is performed by a solution of gold in aqua regia, applied by dipping a linen rag into the solution, burning it, and rubbing the black and heavy ashes on the silver with the finger or a piece of leather or cork.\n\n\"Wet gilding\" is effected by means of a dilute solution of gold(III) chloride in aqua regia with twice its quantity of ether. The liquids are agitated and allowed to rest, to allow the ether to separate and float on the surface of the acid. The whole mixture is then poured into a separating funnel with a small aperture, and allowed to rest for some time, when the acid is run off from below and the gold dissolved in ether separated. The ether will be found to have taken up all the gold from the acid, and may be used for gilding iron or steel, for which purpose the metal is polished with fine emery and spirits of wine. The ether is then applied with a small brush, and as it evaporates it deposits the gold, which can now be heated and polished. For small delicate figures, a pen or a fine brush may be used for laying on the ether solution. The gold(III) chloride can also be dissolved in water in electroless plating wherein the gold is slowly reduced out of solution onto the surface to be gilded. When this technique is used on the second surface of glass and backed with silver, it is known as \"Angel gilding\".\n\n\"Fire-gilding\" or \"Wash-gilding\" is a process by which an amalgam of gold is applied to metallic surfaces, the mercury being subsequently volatilized, leaving a film of gold or an amalgam containing 13 to 16% mercury. In the preparation of the amalgam, the gold must first be reduced to thin plates or grains, which are heated red-hot, and thrown into previously heated mercury, until it begins to smoke. When the mixture is stirred with an iron rod, the gold is totally absorbed. The proportion of mercury to gold is generally six or eight to one. When the amalgam is cold, it is squeezed through chamois leather to separate the superfluous mercury; the gold, with about twice its weight of mercury, remains behind, forming a yellowish silvery mass with the consistency of butter.\n\nWhen the metal to be gilded is wrought or chased, it ought to be covered with mercury before the amalgam is applied, that this may be more easily spread; but when the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam may be applied to it directly. When no such preparation is applied, the surface to be gilded is simply bitten and cleaned with nitric acid. A deposit of mercury is obtained on a metallic surface by means of quicksilver water, a solution of mercury(II) nitrate, the nitric acid attacking the metal to which it is applied, and thus leaving a film of free metallic mercury.\n\nThe amalgam being equally spread over the prepared surface of the metal, the mercury is then sublimed by a heat just sufficient for that purpose; for, if it is too great, part of the gold may be driven off, or it may run together and leave some of the surface of the metal bare. When the mercury has evaporated, which is known by the surface having entirely become of a dull yellow color, the metal must undergo other operations, by which the fine gold color is given to it. First, the gilded surface is rubbed with a scratch brush of brass wire, until its surface is smooth.\n\nIt is then covered with \"gilding wax\", and again exposed to fire until the wax is burnt off. Gilding wax is composed of beeswax mixed with some of the following substances: red ochre, verdigris, copper scales, alum, vitriol, and borax. By this operation the color of the gilding is heightened, and the effect seems to be produced by a perfect dissipation of some mercury remaining after the former operation. The gilt surface is then covered over with potassium nitrate, alum or other salts, ground together, and mixed into a paste with water or weak ammonia. The piece of metal thus covered is exposed to heat, and then quenched in water.\n\nBy this method, its color is further improved and brought nearer to that of gold, probably by removing any particles of copper that may have been on the gilt surface. This process, when skillfully carried out, produces gilding of great solidity and beauty, but owing to the exposure of the workmen to mercurial fumes, it is very unhealthy. There is also much loss of mercury to the atmosphere, which brings extremely serious environmental concerns as well.\n\nThis method of gilding metallic objects was formerly widespread, but fell into disuse as the dangers of mercury toxicity became known. Since fire-gilding requires that the mercury be volatilized to drive off the mercury and leave the gold behind on the surface, it is extremely dangerous. Breathing the fumes generated by this process can quickly result in serious health problems, such as neurological damage and endocrine disorders, since inhalation is a very efficient route for mercuric compounds to enter the body. This process has generally been supplanted by the electroplating of gold over a nickel substrate, which is more economical and less dangerous.\n\nIn depletion gilding, a subtractive process discovered in Pre-columbian Mesoamerica, articles are fabricated by various techniques from an alloy of copper and gold, named tumbaga by the Spaniards. The surface is etched with acids, resulting in a surface of porous gold. The porous surface is then burnished down, resulting in a shiny gold surface. The results fooled the conquistadors into thinking they had massive quantities of pure gold. The results startled modern archaeologists, because at first the pieces resemble electroplated articles. Keum-boo is a special Korean technique of silver-gilding, using depletion gilding.\n\nThe gilding of decorative ceramics has been undertaken for centuries, with the permanence and brightness of gold appealing to designers. Both porcelain and earthenware are commonly decorated with gold, and in the late 1970s it was reported that 5 tonnes of gold were used annually for the decoration of these products. Some wall tiles also have gold decoration. Application techniques include spraying, brushing, banding machines, and direct or indirect screen-printing. After application the decorated ware is fired in a kiln to fuse the gold to the glaze and hence ensure its permanence. The most important factors affecting coating quality are the composition of applied gold, the state of the surface before application, the thickness of the layer and the firing conditions.\n\nA number of different forms and compositions are available to apply gold to ceramic, and these include:\n\n\n\n"}

Ginny, who believes that the legend of Jason Voorhees is more than a myth, soon encounters the vengeful killer and realizes that she must delve into his psyche if she wants to survive.\n\nOriginally in \"Friday the 13th Part III\" (1982), Ginny's role in the film was supposed to be similar to Laurie Strode's in \"Halloween II\" (1981) with Ginny being pursued in a mental asylum by Voorhees just like Michael Myers stalked Strode in the hospital. However, Steel feared being typecast and ultimately turned down the offer to reprise her role. She subsequently appears in \"\" (1984) through archive footage.\n\nShe also appears in the \"Friday the 13th\" expanded universe, appearing in the novelizations and merchandise based on the films. Some scholars regard Ginny as an example of the \"final girl\" archetype.\n\nIn \"Friday the 13th Part 2\", Ginny is an aspiring child psychologist who is Paul Holt's girlfriend, she arrives at Crystal Lake late for training. At the campfire that night, Paul tells the camp counselors the legend of Jason Voorhees and the disappearance of Alice which occurred months after Jason allegedly witnessed his mother being beheaded, to scare the other counselors from entering Camp Crystal Lake. Later on, Paul offers them a trip to the next town, but only Ginny and Ted accept his offer. At a bar, Ginny admits that she takes the legend of \"Camp Blood\" seriously. She feels sympathetic towards Jason Voorhees, because of his traumatic childhood and she believes the legends of him witnessing Alice beheading his mother. Meanwhile, Jason begins to murder all of the counselors. When Ginny and Paul return, she believes that something is wrong. Ginny is soon forced to fight for her life. After Jason knocks Paul out, Ginny becomes his new target. After an evading Jason numerous times and fighting back, Ginny stumbles across Jason's shack in the woods, and finds a shrine for Pamela Voorhees. She puts on an old sweater, belonging to Pamela, in effort to convince Jason Voorhees that she is his mother. Jason believes her, and she manages to calm him down before he notices his mother's head behind Ginny. He then slices open Ginny's leg just as Paul comes in. As Jason prepares to kill Paul, Ginny comes up behind Jason and drives a machete into his shoulder. In the end of the film, Ginny is seen being carried away in a stretcher, crying out for Paul, whose fate is unknown.\n\n\"Friday the 13th Part III\" picks up directly after the second film, with Ginny Field shown being pulled away on a stretcher during a news report detailing the ordeal she survived. Originally, Ginny was set to return as a main character in \"Part III\" but Amy Steel feared being typecast and officially decided to not return when her agent of the time convinced her to decline the offer. Her role in the film would have been similar to Laurie Strode's in \"Halloween II\" (1981). According to Kelly Konda, \"Director Steve Miner and Martin Kitrosser, the script supervisor for Parts 1 and 2 and co-writer of Part 3, wanted Ginny to go to a mental institution as a result of her trauma after Part 2. Jason would eventually arrive to settle his vendetta against her, killing any guards, doctors, or patients that got in his way.\" However, producers soon became skeptical of the idea and eventually abandoned it when Steel officially declined to return.\n\nWhen asked why she didn't reprise her role as the lead character in \"Part III\", Steel confirmed her fear of being typecast and her subsequent regret of declining the offer to return, stating:\nGinny appears in \"\" (1984) through archive footage which is currently the last \"Friday the 13th\" film that she Ginny appears in.\n\nGinny makes her first literary appearance in the novelization of \"Friday the 13th Part 3\" (1982), which states that she is in \"serious condition\" and is suffering from \"severe hysterical shock: because of her battle with Jason Voorhees. She subsequently appears as the lead protagonist in \"Friday the 13th Part II: A Novel\", a novelization of the 1981 film \"Friday the 13th Part 2\", which was released seven years after the film premiered in February 1988. The novel was written by Simon Hawke and based on Ron Kurz's screenplay.\n\nThe aftermath of her encounter with Jason is once again referenced in the novel \"Friday the 13th: Carnival of Maniacs\", which states that her claims of finding Jason's shack in the woods went ignored, due to the authorities doubting her sanity.\n\nIn 2014, Fright-Rags released \"Ginny's Revenge\", a Horror T-shirt with Ginny being the main part of the design. It received a limited release with only 300 shirts being sold. The cost of the shirts were $27 with sizes ranging from S-5X, Girls S-2X. In 2017, Ginny was featured on the design of another Fright-Rags T-shirt entitled \"Victims and Survivors\".\n\nIn \"\" (2017), Ginny is referenced in the Virtual Cabin 2.0 mode. When viewing the statue of Jason's design from \"Friday the 13th Part 2\", his biography states, \"Only the aspiring child psychologist, Ginny Field, is able to outsmart and eventually \"defeat\" Jason. She puts on Pamela's sweater to trigger Jason, and then buries a machete deep into his shoulder...\" She is also referenced in the biography for Jason's design from \"Friday the 13th Part III\" which states that Jason barely survived his encounter with Ginny.\n\nIn an interview, Amy Steel discussed her audition for the film, stating:\nWhile discussing the character, Steel described the parallels between herself and Ginny and praised the character's intelligence and strength, noting:\n\nShe then said she liked the character because she wasn't a \"total bimbo\" and that she was \"smart and confident and you knew she had something driving her.\"\n\nIn \"The Dread of Difference: Gender and the Horror Film\", Barry Keith Grant stated that, \"Ginny temporarily adopts Mrs. Voorhees's authoritarian role to survive. Although circumstances necessitate this, she clearly uses her enemy's strategy to become a phallic mother herself. This posture really questions the positive image of the Final Girl.\" He then called her \"not victorious\" when she called out for her boyfriend at the end of the film saying that it was done in a \"non-independent manner\".\n\nJohn Kenneth Muir references Ginny in \"Horror Films of the 1980s, Volume 1\", saying \"Amy Steel is introduced as Ginny, our final girl and heroine, and the only person who seems to have an inkling of the nearby danger. She's more resourceful than Alice and nearly upstages even Laurie Strode during the film's tense finale, wherein she brazenly dresses up as Jason's dead mother and starts barking orders at the confused serial killer.\"\n\nIn \"Blood Money: A History of the First Teen Slasher Film Cycle\", Richard Nowell said \"The shift in characterization of the female leads was also trumpeted during Ginny's self-confident entrance (Amy Steel) in \"Friday the 13th Part II\". Where the makers of its predecessor introduced Alice as she prepared cabins while dressed in denim jeans and a shapeless lumberjack shirt, the sequel's conventionally attractive lead is established immediately as combining masculine traits with feminine attributes. Ginny exits a battered VW bug in a flowing fuchsia skirt and a low-cut t-shirt.\"\n\nIn \"Horror and the Horror Film\", Bruce F. Kawin states that \"The heroine and survivor, Ginny (Amy Steel), is not a virgin, though she is having her period and may gain from that some blood power against Jason. Ginny is majoring in Child Psychology, which lets her deal with Jason (who, she deduces, has the mind of child fixated on the mother he saw killed because she loved him) when she pretends to be his mother. She survives partly because she takes children's emotions seriously.\" In 2012, \"Complex\" ranked Ginny 16th on their list of \"The 25 Most Badass Horror Movie Heroines\".\n\nIn 2016, \"Paste\" ranked Ginny 17th on their list of \"The 20 Best \"Final Girls\" in Horror Movie History\", calling her \"a realistic girl of her time period who, at the same time, has the guts and resolve to face off against Jason (sans hockey mask, which he didn’t get until the third film) and come out on top.\"\n\n"}

On 16 March 1598 he entered as a student in the Middle Temple, and on 7 June 1605 he was called to the degree of an utter barrister.\n\nA fellow-student, Edward, son of William Curll and brother of Walter Curll, obtained for him the post of auditor of the court of wards. He was also befriended by a distant relative, Richard Manningham, who, born at St Albans in 1539, made a fortune in London as a mercer, and in his old age retired to Bradbourne, near Maidstone. Richard Manningham died on 25 April 1611, and was buried in East Malling Church, where John Manningham erected a monument to his memory. To John, his sole executor, Richard left his house and lands in Kent.\n\nManningham wrote a diary, preserved among the Harleian Manuscripts, and first printed by the Camden Society in 1868, under the editorship of John Bruce. It covers the period from January 1602 to April 1603; at the time the writer was a student in the Middle Temple. The work is a medley of anecdotes of London life, political rumours, accounts of sermons, and memoranda of journeys. The gossip respecting Queen Elizabeth's illness and death and the accession of James I is set down in detail, and Manningham often supplies comments on the character of the chief lawyers and preachers of the day. He also gives an account of the performance of Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" on 2 February 1602 in the Middle Temple Hall. John Payne Collier first called attention to Manningham's work. The anecdote of Shakespeare's triumph over Richard Burbage in the pursuit of the favors of a lady of doubtful virtue (\"William the Conqueror was before Richard III\") comes from his diary entry dated March 13, 1602. Sir Thomas Bodley, John Stow, and Sir Thomas Overbury are also occasionally mentioned by Manningham.\n\nManningham married, about 1607, Ann, sister of his friend Curll. By her he had three sons, Richard (born 1608), John (born 1616), and Walter, and three daughters, Susannah, Ann, and Elizabeth. Walter Curll, by his will of 15 March 1646–7, left legacies to his sister Mrs. Manningham and her son and his godson Walter. She was dead before 1656, when her eldest son Richard sold the property at Bradbourne to Thomas Twysden, serjeant-at-law.\n\n\n"}

The LOOP Fair was held from November 27 to 30 at Hotel Barceló Sants in Barcelona.\n\n2004\n\nFrom November 18 to 21, 50 rooms on the first floor of the Hotel Barceló Sants were once again occupied by 50 galleries presenting video art. There was also an area of 900m2 in which institutions and museums could present their collections of video art. Magazines and publications specialized in contemporary art also occupied the Fair LOOP. To encourage collectors, LOOP'04 created a program of video art patronage, formed by a group of institutions and enterprises engaged in the acquisition of works presented at the fair. At the same time, arts centers, galleries and other spaces in Barcelona presented videos through the Off LOOP festival. A series of conferences in the media library of CaixaForum and a course organized by the Friends of the Museums of Catalunya were also scheduled.\n\n2005\n\nThe LOOP Festival returned from November 7 to 20 with more than 350 participating artists presenting their video art works along 8 main routes: Route El Raval, Route Eixample, Route Calle Montcada, Route Montjuïc, Route Gràcia, Route Born/Ciutat Vella, Route Playa and Route Nau Ivanow.

It is one of two surviving Nahua pictorial records recounting the Spanish conquest of Guatemala and one of the earliest surviving maps of what is now Guatemala.\n\nThe cloth was probably painted in Ciudad Vieja, in the modern Guatemalan department of Sacatepéquez, by Nahua allies of the Spanish from the city of Quauhquechollan (now known as San Martín Huaquechula). These allies had assisted conquistador Jorge de Alvarado in his campaign of 1527 to 1529. The Quauhquechollan allies settled in the Guatemalan Highlands and the cloth records their participation in the Spanish conquest of Mexico and Guatemala. The original is currently in the Casa de Alfeñique Museum in Puebla in central Mexico.\n\nThe Lienzo was made sometime in the 1530s; it consists of 15 individual pieces of painted cotton stitched together to form a large map. The pieces are of differing sizes and manufacture and some of them are reused. The complete Lienzo de Quauhquechollan measures (width by height). The Lienzo was executed in a central Mexican style using indigenous artistic conventions to portray a mixture of Nahua and Spanish subjects. The main focus of the map lies within the borders of modern Guatemala, specifically the area around Chimaltenango and Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, the colonial capital. The Lienzo concentrates upon the role of the Quauhquechollan allies in the conquest, their travels and the battles they took part in. It was executed by more than one artist, as evidenced by stylistic differences in the painting.\n\nThe earliest mention of the Lienzo, under the name of the \"Lienzo de la Academia de Puebla\" (\"Cloth of the Puebla Academy\"), dates to the final decade of the 19th century when it was in the collection of the Puebla Painting Academy, although its provenance was unknown. It has various pieces of paper fixed beside the images and bearing text using the Latin alphabet, although these are very poorly preserved.\n\nThe top left corner of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is illustrated with the place glyph representing Quauhquechollan combined with the Habsburg coat of arms. Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is shown embracing a Quauhaquechollan noble, both are accompanied by their retinues and the scene includes an exchange of gifts. Another scene shows Jorge de Alvarado at the head of a large army as they depart from Quauhquechollan; the army itself is mixed, containing both Spanish and Nahuas. All the Quauhquechollans are depicted bearing Spanish swords, a privilege bestowed upon some of the native allies of the conquistadors. The route of the army on its march to Guatemala is depicted, including Tehuantepec in Oaxaca and the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas (both within the borders of modern Mexico). In Guatemala the army passes through Retalhuleu, Zapotitlán and Suchitepéquez and is shown engaging in a number of battles, even though Pedro de Alvarado had previously conquered this region.\n\n\n"}

Spencer's article first appeared in the daily edition of the \"New York World\" on 26 April 1874, and appeared again in the weekly edition of the newspaper two days later. In the article, a letter was published by a purported German explorer named \"Karl Leche\" (also spelled as Karl or Carl Liche in later accounts), who provided a report of encountering a sacrifice performed by the \"Mkodo tribe\" of Madagascar: This story was picked up by many other newspapers of the day, which included the \"South Australian Register\" of 27 October 1874, where it gained even greater notoriety. Describing the tree, the account related:\n\nThe slender delicate palpi, with the fury of starved serpents, quivered a moment over her head, then as if instinct with demoniac intelligence fastened upon her in sudden coils round and round her neck and arms; then while her awful screams and yet more awful laughter rose wildly to be instantly strangled down again into a gurgling moan, the tendrils one after another, like great green serpents, with brutal energy and infernal rapidity, rose, retracted themselves, and wrapped her about in fold after fold, ever tightening with cruel swiftness and savage tenacity of anacondas fastening upon their prey.\n\nThe tree was given further publicity by \"Madagascar: Land of the Man-eating Tree\", a book by Chase Osborn, who had been a Governor of Michigan. Osborn claimed that both the tribes and missionaries on Madagascar knew about the hideous tree, repeated the above Liche account, and acknowledged \"I do not know whether this tigerish tree really exists or whether the bloodcurdling stories about it are pure myth. It is enough for my purpose if its story focuses your interest upon one of the least known spots of the world.\" \n\nIn his 1955 book, \"Salamanders and other Wonders\", science author Willy Ley determined that the Mkodo tribe, Carl Liche, and the Madagascar man-eating tree all appeared to be fabrications: \"The facts are pretty clear by now. Of course the man eating tree does not exist. There is no such tribe.\"\n\nIn J. W. Buel's \"Sea and Land\" (1887), the \"Yateveo\" plant is described as being native to Africa and Central America, so named for producing a hissing sound similar to the Spanish phrase \"ya-te-veo\" (lit. \"I-see-you\"), and having poisonous \"spines\" that resemble \"many huge serpents in an angry discussion, occasionally darting from side to side as if striking at an imaginary foe\" which seize and pierce any creature coming within reach.\n\nWilliam Thomas Stead, editor of \"Review of Reviews,\" published a brief article in October 1891 that discussed a story found \"Lucifer\" magazine, describing a plant in Nicaragua called by the natives the devil's snare. This plant had the capability \"to drain the blood of any living thing which comes within its death-dealing touch.\" According to the article:\n\nMr. Dunstan, naturalist, who has recently returned from Central America, where he spent nearly two years in the study of the flora and the fauna of the country, relates the finding of a singular growth in one of the swamps which surround the great lakes of Nicaragua. He was engaged in hunting for botanical and entomological specimens, when he heard his dog cry out, as if in agony, from a distance. Running to the spot whence the animal's cries came. Mr. Dunstan found him enveloped in a perfect network of what seemed to be a fine rope-like tissue of roots and fibers... The native servants who accompanied Mr. Dunstan manifested the greatest horror of the vine, which they call \"the devil's snare\", and were full of stories of its death-dealing powers. He was able to discover very little about the nature of the plant, owing to the difficulty of handling it, for its grasp can only be torn away with the loss of skin and even of flesh; but, as near as Mr. Dunstan could ascertain, its power of suction is contained in a number of infinitesimal mouths or little suckers, which, ordinarily closed, open for the reception of food. If the substance is animal, the blood is drawn off and the carcass or refuse then dropped.\n\nAn investigation of Stead's review determined no such article was published in the October issue of \"Lucifer\", and concluded that the story in \"Review of Reviews\" appeared to be a fabrication by the editor. The story in fact appeared in the September issue, proceeded by a longer version in an 1889 newspaper describing Dunston as a \"well-known naturalist\" from New Orleans.\n\n\n\n"}

She is best known for her work as a storyboard revisionist for Cartoon Network's \"Adventure Time\", and as the creator of Cartoon Hangover's and Frederator Studios \"Bee and PuppyCat\".\nNatasha Allegri is the daughter of an Okinawan mother of Japanese descent and a Bolivian father of French, Italian and Native Bolivian descent. She grew up in Inverness, Florida. In high school and college she made comics about her life that she posted to LiveJournal, which is how she met Pendleton Ward.\n\nWhile in college at the University of Arizona in Tucson, her friend, and creator of \"Adventure Time\", Pendleton Ward, contacted her about working on \"Adventure Time\" and she has worked on the show for five seasons. While working on the show, Allegri began drawing gender-swapped versions of the show's characters, including \"Fionna and Cake\" as her gender-swapped versions of Finn and Jake, and eventually these characters were featured in full episodes of \"Adventure Time\". Since August 6, 2013, she also has written and illustrated \"Fionna and Cake\" comics for BOOM! Studios.\n\nAllegri created and produced her own animated short, \"Bee and PuppyCat\", for Frederator Studios' YouTube channel Cartoon Hangover which was released on July 11, 2013. The episode introduces viewers to Bee, a recently unemployed young woman, and PuppyCat, a small and mysterious creature resembling both a dog and a cat. Bee takes PuppyCat in and, in return, he helps her find strange temp work, in this case babysitting a giant fish named Wallace in Fishbowl Space. In response to fans' overwhelming love for the original \"Bee and PuppyCat\" short, Frederator launched a Kickstarter on October 14, 2013 to raise funds for a full season. The Kickstarter was successful, raising Frederator $872,133 toward the production of \"Bee and PuppyCat\", the animated series. This exceeded their original goal of $600,000 and made them the 4th most funded Video and Film project to date.\n\nAllegri has created multiple graphic novels/comic books starring \"Fionna and Cake\" and \"Bee and Puppycat\", respectively.\n\nBee and Puppycat:\n\nBee and Puppycat #1, created with Garrett Jackson.\n\nBee and Puppycat #2, created with Garrett Jackson.\n\nBee and Puppycat #3, created with Madeleine Flores, Ian McGinty, Anissa Espinosa, and Tait Howard.\n\nBee and Puppycat #4, created with T.

{"id": "907712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=907712", "title": "Pazyryk culture", "text": "Pazyryk culture\n\nThe Pazyryk culture is a Scythian nomadic Iron Age archaeological culture (c. 6th to 3rd centuries BC) identified by excavated artifacts and mummified humans found in the Siberian permafrost, in the Altay Mountains, Kazakhstan and nearby Mongolia. The mummies are buried in long barrows (or \"kurgans\") similar to the tomb mounds of Scythian culture in modern Ukraine. The type site are the Pazyryk burials of the Ukok Plateau.\nMany artifacts and human remains have been found at this location, including the Siberian Ice Princess, indicating a flourishing culture at this location that benefited from the many trade routes and caravans of merchants passing through the area. The Pazyryk are considered to have had a war-like life.\n\nOther kurgan cemeteries associated with the culture include those of Bashadar, Tuekta, Ulandryk, Polosmak and Berel. There are so far no known sites of settlements associated with the burials, suggesting a purely nomadic lifestyle.\n\nBecause of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai burials, notably those of the 5th century BC at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as Katanda, Shibe, and Tuekt, were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them. At Pazyryk these included the bodies of horses and an embalmed man whose body was covered with tattoos of animal motifs. The remarkable textiles recovered from the Pazyryk burials include the oldest woollen knotted-pile carpet known, the oldest embroidered Chinese silk, and two pieces of woven Persian fabric (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). Red and ochre predominate in the carpet, the main design of which is of riders, stags, and griffins. Many of the Pazyryk felt hangings, saddlecloths, and cushions were covered with elaborate designs executed in appliqué feltwork, dyed furs, and embroidery. Of exceptional interest are those with animal and human figural compositions, the most notable of which are the repeat design of an investiture scene on a felt hanging and that of a semihuman, semibird creature on another (both in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). Clothing, whether of felt, leather, or fur, was also lavishly ornamented.\n\nHorse reins either had animal designs cut out on them or were studded with wooden ones covered in gold foil. Their tail sheaths were ornamented, as were their headpieces and breastpieces. Some horses were provided with leather or felt masks made to resemble animals, with stag antlers or rams’ horns often incorporated in them. Many of the trappings took the form of iron, bronze, and gilt wood animal motifs either applied or suspended from them; and bits had animal-shaped terminal ornaments. Altai-Sayan animals frequently display muscles delineated with dot and comma markings, a formal convention that may have derived from appliqué needlework. Such markings are sometimes included in Assyrian, Achaemenian, and even Urartian animal representations of the ancient Middle East. Roundels containing a dot serve the same purpose on the stag and other animal renderings executed by contemporary \"Śaka\" metalworkers. Animal processions of the Assyro-Achaemenian type also appealed to many Central Asian tribesmen and are featured in their arts.\n\nCertain geometric designs and sun symbols, such as the circle and rosette, recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. The stag and its relatives figure as prominently as in Altai-Sayan. Combat scenes between carnivores and herbivores are exceedingly numerous in Pazyryk work; the Pazyryk beasts are locked in such bitter fights that the victim's hindquarters become inverted.<ref name=\"Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts\"></ref>\n\nDNA samples recovered from the remains of two Pazyryk males showed them to be members of Y-chromosome haplogroup N1b-P43.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4279208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4279208", "title": "Peer-to-peer file sharing", "text": "Peer-to-peer file sharing\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing is the distribution and sharing of digital media using peer-to-peer (P2P) networking technology. P2P file sharing allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content. The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like Napster, which popularized the technology, to the later models like the BitTorrent protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the mmorpg Skyforge) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various file transfer systems and other file-sharing networks.\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing became popular in with the introduction of Napster, a file sharing application and a set of central servers that linked people who had files with those who requested files. The central index server indexed the users and their shared content. When someone searched for a file, the server searched all available copies of that file and presented them to the user. The files would be transferred directly between the two private computers. A limitation was that only music files could be shared. Because this process occurred on a central server, however, Napster was held liable for copyright infringement and shut down in July 2001. It later reopened as a pay service.\n\nAfter Napster was shut down, the most popular peer-to-peer services were Gnutella and Kazaa. These services also allowed users to download files other than music, such as movies and games.\n\nNapster and eDonkey2000, which both used a central server-based model, may be classified as the first generation of P2P systems. These systems relied on the operation of the respective central servers, and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. The second generation of P2P file sharing encompasses networks like Kazaa, Gnutella and Gnutella2, which are able to operate without any central servers, eliminated the central vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other.\n\nThe third generation of filesharing networks are the so-called darknets, including networks like Freenet, which provide user anonymity in addition to the independence from central servers.\n\nThe BitTorrent protocol represents a special case. In principle, it is a filesharing protocol of the first generation, relying on central servers called \"trackers\" to coordinate users. However, it does not form a network in the traditional sense. Instead new, separate networks of coordinating users are created for every set of files, called a \"torrent\". Newer extensions of the protocol removes the need of centralized trackers, allow the usage of a decentralized server-independent network for source identification purposes, referred to as the Mainline DHT. This allows BitTorrent to encompass certain aspects of a filesharing network of the second generation as well. Users create an index file containing the metadata of the files they want to share, and upload the index files to websites where they are shared with others.\n\nPeer-to-peer file sharing is also efficient in terms of cost. The system administration overhead is smaller because the user is the provider and usually the provider is the administrator as well. Hence each network can be monitored by the users themselves. At the same time, large servers sometimes require more storage and this increases the cost since the storage has to be rented or bought exclusively for a server. However, usually peer-to-peer file sharing does not require a dedicated server.\n\nThere is still ongoing discussion about the economic impact of P2P file sharing. Norbert Michel, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said that because of \"econometric and data issues, studies thus far have produced disparate estimates of file sharing's impact on album sales.\"\n\nIn the book \"The Wealth of Networks\", Yochai Benkler states that peer-to-peer file sharing is economically efficient and that the users pay the full transaction cost and marginal cost of such sharing even if it \"throws a monkey wrench into the particular way in which our society has chosen to pay musicians and re-cording executives. This trades off efficiency for longer-term incentive effects for the recording industry. However, it is efficient within the normal meaning of the term in economics in a way that it would not have been had Jack and Jane used subsidized computers or network connections\".\n\nAs peer-to-peer file sharing can be used to exchange files for which the distribution right was granted (e.g. public domain, Creative Commons, Copyleft licenses, online games, updates, ...).\n\nEspecially startups can save massive amounts of money compared with other means of content delivery networks.\n\nA calculation example:\n\nwith peer to peer file sharing: formula_1\n\nwith casual content delivery networks: formula_2\n\nThe economic effect of copyright infringement through peer-to-peer file sharing on music revenue has been controversial and difficult to determine. Unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on record sales. It has proven difficult to untangle the cause and effect relationships among a number of different trends, including an increase in legal online purchases of music; illegal file-sharing; drops in the prices of CDs; and the extinction of many independent music stores with a concomitant shift to sales by big-box retailers.\n\nAlso many independent artists choose a peer-to-peer file sharing method named BitTorrent Bundle for distribution.\n\nThe MPAA reported that American studios lost $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005, representing approximately one third of the total cost of film piracy in the United States. The MPAA's estimate was doubted by commentators since it was based on the assumption that one download was equivalent to one lost sale, and downloaders might not purchase the movie if illegal downloading was not an option. Due to the private nature of the study, the figures could not be publicly checked for methodology or validity, and on January 22, 2008, as the MPAA was lobbying for a bill which would compel universities to crack down on piracy, it was admitted by MPAA that its figures on piracy in colleges had been inflated by up to 300%.\n\nA 2010 study, commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce and conducted by independent Paris-based economics firm TERA, estimated that unlawful downloading of music, film and software cost Europe's creative industries several billion dollars in revenue each year. Furthermore, the TERA study entitled \"Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of Saving Jobs in the EU's Creative Industries\" predicted losses due to piracy reaching as much as 1.2 million jobs and €240 billion in retail revenue by 2015 if the trend continued. Researchers applied a substitution rate of ten percent to the volume of copyright infringements per year. This rate corresponded to the number of units potentially traded if unlawful file sharing were eliminated and did not occur. Piracy rates of one-quarter or more for popular software and operating systems have been common, even in countries and regions with strong intellectual property enforcement, such as the United States or the EU.\n\nIn 2004, an estimated 70 million people participated in online file sharing. According to a CBS News poll, nearly 70 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds thought file sharing was acceptable in some circumstances and 58 percent of all Americans who followed the file sharing issue considered it acceptable in at least some circumstances.\n\nIn January 2006, 32 million Americans over the age of 12 had downloaded at least one feature-length movie from the Internet, 80 percent of whom had done so exclusively over P2P. Of the population sampled, 60 percent felt that downloading copyrighted movies off the Internet did not constitute a very serious offense, however 78 percent believed taking a DVD from a store without paying for it constituted a very serious offense.\n\nIn July 2008, 20 percent of Europeans used file sharing networks to obtain music, while 10 percent used paid-for digital music services such as iTunes.\n\nIn February 2009, a Tiscali UK survey found that 75 percent of the English public polled were aware of what was legal and illegal in relation to file sharing, but there was a divide as to where they felt the legal burden should be placed: 49 percent of people believed P2P companies should be held responsible for illegal file sharing on their networks, 18 percent viewed individual file sharers as the culprits, while 18 percent either didn't know or chose not to answer.\n\nAccording to an earlier poll, 75 percent of young voters in Sweden (18-20) supported file sharing when presented with the statement: \"I think it is OK to download files from the Net, even if it is illegal.\" Of the respondents, 38 percent said they \"adamantly agreed\" while 39 percent said they \"partly agreed\". An academic study among American and European college students found that users of file-sharing technologies were relatively anti-copyright and that copyright enforcement created backlash, hardening pro-file sharing beliefs among users of these technologies.\n\nCommunities have a prominent role in many peer to peer networks and applications, such as BitTorrent, Gnutella and DC++. There are different elements that contribute to the formation, development and the stability of these communities, which include interests, user attributes, cost reduction, user motivation and the dimension of the community.\n\nPeer communities are formed on the basis of common interests. For Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta common interests can be labelled as attributes \"which are used to determine the peer communities in which a particular peer can participate\". There are two ways in which these attributes can be classified: explicit and implicit attributes.\n\nImplicit values means that peers provide information about themselves to a specific community, for example they may express their interest in a subject or their taste in music. With explicit values, users do not directly express information about themselves, albeit, it is still possible to find information about that specific user by uncovering his or her past queries and research carried out in a P2P network. \nKhambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta divide these interests further into three classes: personal, claimed and group attributes.\n\nA full set of attributes (common interests) of a specific peer is defined as personal attributes, and is a collection of information a peer has about him or herself. Peers may decide not to disclose information about themselves to maintain their privacy and online security. It is for this reason that the authors specify that \"a subset of...attributes is explicitly claimed public by a peer\", and they define such attributes as \"claimed attributes\". The third category of interests is group attributes, defined as \"location or affiliation oriented\" and are needed to form a...basis for communities\", an example being the \"domain name of an internet connection\" which acts as an online location and group identifier for certain users.\n\nCost reduction influences the sharing component of P2P communities. Users who share do so to attempt \"to reduce...costs\" as made clear by Cunningham, Alexander and Adilov. In their work Peer-to-peer file sharing communities, they explain that \"the act of sharing is costly since any download from a sharer implies that the sharer is sacrificing bandwidth\". As sharing represents the basis of P2P communities, such as Napster, and without it \"the network collapses\", users share despite its costs in order to attempt to lower their own costs, particularly those associated with searching, and with the congestion of internet servers.\n\nUser motivation and the size of the P2P community contribute to its sustainability and activity. In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is \"a crucial factor\" in encouraging users to participate in an online P2P community, particularly because the \"lack of a critical mass of active users\" in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly.\n\nUsefulness is a valued aspect by users when joining a P2P community. The specific P2P system must be perceived as \"useful\" by the user and must be able to fulfil his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Consequently, the \"size of the community of users defines the level of usefulness\" and \"the value of the system determines the number of users\". This two way process is defined by Vassileva as a feedback loop, and has allowed for the birth of file-sharing systems like Napster and KaZaA. However, in her research Vassileva has also found that \"incentives are needed for the users in the beginning\", particularly for motivating and getting users into the habit of staying online. This can be done, for example, by providing the system with a wide amount of resources or by having an experienced user provide assistance to a less experienced one.\n\nUsers participating in P2P systems can be classified in different ways. According to Vassileva, users can be classified depending on their participation in the P2P system. There are five types of users to be found: users who create services, users who allow services, users who facilitate search, users who allow communication, users who are uncooperative and free ride.\n\nIn the first instance, the user creates new resources or services and offers them to the community. In the second, the user provides the community with disk space \"to store files for downloads\" or with \"computing resources\" to facilitate a service provided by another users. In the third, the user provides a list of relationships to help other users find specific files or services. In the fourth, the user participates actively in the \"protocol of the network\", contributing to keeping the network together. In the last situation, the user does not contribute to the network, downloads what he or she needs but goes immediately offline once the service is not needed anymore, thus free-riding on the network and community resources.\n\nCorporations continue to combat the use of the internet as a tool to illegally copy and share various files, especially that of copyrighted music. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has been active in leading campaigns against infringers. Lawsuits have been launched against individuals as well as programs such as Napster in order to \"protect\" copyright owners. One of the most recent efforts of the RIAA has been to implant decoy users to monitor the use of copyrighted material from a firsthand perspective.\n\nIn early June 2002, Researcher Nathaniel Good at HP Labs demonstrated that user interface design issues could contribute to users inadvertently sharing personal and confidential information over P2P networks.\n\nIn 2003, Congressional hearings before the House Committee of Government Reform (\"Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy & Security on File Sharing Networks\") and the Senate Judiciary Committee (\"The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?\") were convened to address and discuss the issue of inadvertent sharing on peer-to-peer networks and its consequences to consumer and national security.\n\nResearchers have examined potential security risks including the release of personal information, bundled spyware, and viruses downloaded from the network. Some proprietary file sharing clients have been known to bundle malware, though open source programs typically have not. Some open source file sharing packages have even provided integrated anti-virus scanning.\n\nSince approximately 2004 the threat of identity theft had become more prevalent, and in July 2008 there was another inadvertent revealing of vast amounts of personal information through P2P sites. The \"names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers of about 2,000 of (an investment) firm's clients\" were exposed, \"including [those of] Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.\" A drastic increase in inadvertent P2P file sharing of personal and sensitive information became evident in 2009 at the beginning of President Obama's administration when the blueprints to the helicopter Marine One were made available to the public through a breach in security via a P2P file sharing site. Access to this information has the potential of being detrimental to US security. Furthermore, shortly before this security breach, the \"Today\" show had reported that more than 150,000 tax returns, 25,800 student loan applications and 626,000 credit reports had been inadvertently made available through file sharing.\n\nThe United States government then attempted to make users more aware of the potential risks involved with P2P file sharing programs through legislation such as H.R. 1319, the Informed P2P User Act, in 2009. According to this act, it would be mandatory for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with peer-to-peer file sharing before purchasing software with informed consent of the user required prior to use of such programs. In addition, the act would allow users to block and remove P2P file sharing software from their computers at any time, with the Federal Trade Commission enforcing regulations. US-CERT also warns of the potential risks.\n\nNevertheless, in 2010, researchers discovered thousands of documents containing sensitive patient information on popular peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, including insurance details, personally identifying information, physician names and diagnosis codes on more than 28,000 individuals. Many of the documents contained sensitive patient communications, treatment data, medical diagnoses and psychiatric evaluations.\n\nThe act of file sharing is not illegal per se and peer-to-peer networks are also used for legitimate purposes. The legal issues in file sharing involve violating the laws of copyrighted material. Most discussions about the legality of file sharing are implied to be about solely copyright material. Many countries have fair use exceptions that permit limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders. Such documents include commentary, news reporting, research and scholarship. Copyright laws are territorial- they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Most countries today are parties to at least one such agreement.\n\nIn the area of privacy, recent court rulings seem to indicate that there can be no expectation of privacy in data exposed over peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. In a 39-page ruling released November 8, 2013, US District Court Judge Christina Reiss denied the motion to suppress evidence gathered by authorities without a search warrant through an automated peer-to-peer search tool.\n\n\n"}

Under the directorship of Emily Sartain (1886–1920), it became the largest art school for women in the United States, and its faculty included Robert Henri, Samuel Murray and Daniel Garber. In 1932, it merged into what is now the Moore College of Art and Design. \n\nSarah Worthington King Peter, wife of the British consul in Philadelphia, established an industrial arts school in her home in 1848 to teach women without a means of supporting themselves a trade. The school taught lithography, wood carving, and design, such as for household items like carpets and wallpaper. Peter's husband died soon after she established the school and she returned to her Cincinnati, Ohio home. \n\nIn 1850, Peter wrote to the Franklin Institute about her drawing class of some 20 young women becoming a \"co-operative, but separate branch\" of the Institute. The Franklin Institute established and supervised the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1850 to 1853. A group of 17 men were designated the incorporators of the school in 1853. Elliott Cresson was among these 17 directors, and was elected president at the first meeting. It was the country's largest art school for women and its students included Emily Sartain, Jessie Willcox Smith, Alice Barber Stephens, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Annie Traquair Lang and Alice Neel.\n\nElizabeth Croasdale was the school's principal before Emily Sartain took the position in 1886. Sartain was the school's leader until 1920. She implemented life-drawing classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, using draped male and nude women models, which was revolutionary at the time for women artists. Sartain created a professional program that was built upon technical and lengthy training and high standards. The women were taught to create works of art based upon three-dimensional and human forms, based upon her training in Paris and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

In 1813 it was named after György Pray, who discovered it in 1770. It is the first known example of continuous prose text in Hungarian. The Codex is kept in the National Széchényi Library of Budapest. \n\nOne of the most prominent documents within the Codex (f. 154a) is the Funeral Sermon and Prayer (Hungarian: Halotti beszéd és könyörgés). It is an old handwritten Hungarian text dating to 1192-1195. Its importance of the Funeral Sermon comes from that it is the oldest surviving Hungarian, and Uralic, text. \n\nThe Codex also features a missal, an Easter mystery play, songs with musical notation, laws from the time of Coloman of Hungary and the annals, which list the Hungarian kings. \n\nOne of the five illustrations within the Codex shows the burial of Jesus. It is sometimes claimed that the display shows remarkable similarities with the Shroud of Turin: that Jesus is shown entirely naked with the arms on the pelvis, just like in the body image of the Shroud of Turin; that the thumbs on this image appear to be retracted, with only four fingers visible on each hand, thus matching detail on the Turin Shroud; that the supposed fabric shows a herringbone pattern, identical to the weaving pattern of the Shroud of Turin; and that the four tiny circles on the lower image, which appear to form a letter L, \"perfectly reproduce four apparent \"poker holes\" on the Turin Shroud\", which likewise appear to form a letter L. The Codex Pray illustration may serve as evidence for the existence of the Shroud of Turin prior to 1260–1390 AD, the fabrication date established in the radiocarbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin in 1988. Critics of this idea point out, that the item that is sometimes identified as the Shroud is probably a rectangular tombstone as seen on other sacred images. The alleged holes may just be decorative elements, as seen, for example, on the angel's wing. Moreover, the alleged shroud in the Pray codex does not contain any image. \n\n"}

It has been called \"The most famous of the British romantic works...;\" it was the first of Martin's characteristically dramatic, grand, grandiose large pictures, and anchored the development of the style for which Martin would become famous. \n\nThe painting shows a human figure climbing in a mountain landscape. The man struggles to surmount a rocky outcrop beside a pool and waterfall; more jagged cliffs and peaks loom in the background, vastly receding.\n\nMartin later stated that he finished the work in a month. And he wrote, \"You may easily guess my anxiety when I overheard the men who were to place it in the frame disputing as to which was the top of the picture! Hope almost forsook me, for much depended on this work.\" (At the time, Martin had left his £2-per-week job as a glass painter in a china factory, and was attempting to establish himself as an independent artist.)\n\nThe artist's anxiety was unnecessary; displayed in the Royal Academy exhibition at Somerset House, the picture was a popular success. It was purchased for fifty guineas by William Manning, a member of the board of governors of the Bank of England. Reportedly, Manning's \"dying son had been moved by its depiction of the slight solitary figure clinging perilously to a ledge.\"\n\n\"What makes the work so remarkable is its persuasive combination of science and fantasy: while the scale seems beyond terrestrial experience, the attention given to geological and meteorological phenomena is that of the knowledgeable observer.\"Critics who accept the conventions of Romanticism in art have appreciated Martin's \"Sadak\"; those who do not have regarded the picture as lurid or puzzling.\n\nMartin's Romantic style can be seen as influenced by prevailing Promethean zeitgeist. This is the story of Prometheus, the Greek God who betrayed Zeus and stole the secret gift of fire. Eventually this became a popular metaphor to depict in romantic works of art, because romantics were known for employing the role of nature vs. man in their works.They believed that humans were obsolete to natural world around them. Due to this interpretation, Sadak is drawn to a much smaller scale than the landscape that surrounds him, revealing that he stands no chance against the power of nature. Also, romanticism arose during the industrial revolution, a time when engineers and scientists were exploring nature's secret gifts, analogous to the act of Prometheus stealing the secret gift of fire. Romantics portray the unknown of nature with its unpredictability, intractability and its barbaric capabilities as an opposite of the enlightenment thought. This can be seen in the background of \"Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion\" with an erupting volcano taking place in an other worldly dimension. The idea behind the piece was not to render a precise location and accurate in its depiction, but to express the emotion that was being experienced by the subject. \n\nAnother key factor of Martins style can also be seen as \"end of the world\" or \"apocalyptic\". Although, he depicts a grim scene Martin shows a mere chance of hope in the distance. A glimmering stream of light beams in the corner, giving the viewer a sense of aspiration.\nSadak is a fictional character in a story in James Ridley's \"The Tales of the Genii\" (two volumes, 1764); it is a \"faux\"-Oriental tale allegedly from a Persian manuscript, but actually the work of Ridley himself. In Ridley's story, the hero Sadak is sent by his Sultan, Amurath, to find the memory-destroying \"waters of oblivion.\" The Sultan maliciously intends to use the waters on Sadak's wife Kalasrade in a seduction attempt. Sadak endures a range of trials — a tempest at sea, a plague, evil genii, a subterranean whirlpool — before he attains his goal. In the end, the Sultan himself falls victim to the water's effect. Amurath dies; Sadak becomes Sultan. Martin's picture portrays Sadak at the climax of his struggle, just before he reaches the waters of oblivion.\n\nThe picture was reproduced as a steel-plate etching in 1828. The print bore a poem on the same subject, \"Sadak the Wanderer,\" which was attributed by some to Percy Bysshe Shelley. Modern editors of Shelley are skeptical.\n\nWith this and his subsequent paintings, Martin gained a reputation for replicating the effects of stained glass on canvas. He employed a strong \"chemical red\" hue to express volcanic landscapes.\n\nFor many years the painting was known only in a reduced version in the Southampton Art Gallery. The full-size original was discovered in Sweden and acquired by the Saint Louis Art Museum in 1983. \n\nMartin followed \"Sadak\" with \"Adam's First Sight of Eve\" (1813) and \"Clytie\" (1814), both shown at the Royal Academy.\n\nBy many, Martin's best work was \"Sadak in the Search of the Waters of Oblivion\"\n"}
{"id": "28674214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28674214", "title": "Shigir Idol", "text": "Shigir Idol\n\nThe Shigir Sculpture, or Shigir Idol (), is the oldest known wooden sculpture in the world, made during the Mesolithic period, shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. The wood it was carved from is approximately 11,500 years old.\nIt is displayed in the in Yekaterinburg, Russia.\n\nThe sculpture was discovered on January 24, 1894 at a depth of in the peat bog of Shigir, on the eastern slope of the Middle Urals, approximately from Yekaterinburg. Investigations in this area had begun 40 years earlier, after the discovery of a variety of prehistoric objects in an open-air gold mine.\n\nIt was extracted in ten parts. Professor D. I. Lobanov combined the main fragments to reconstitute a sculpture 2.8 meters high.\n\nIn 1914, archaeologist proposed a variant of this reconstruction by integrating the unused fragments. His reconstruction suggested that the original height of the statue was 5.3 metres.\n\nLater, some of these fragments were lost, so only Tolmachev's drawings of them remain.\n\nThe initial radiocarbon dating carried out by G. I. Zajtseva of the in Saint-Petersburg, confirmed by the of Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, gave an age of around 9,500 years. In the 1990s, when this first radiocarbon dating was carried out, scholars suggested that the dating was incorrect, because they believed that the hunter-gatherers who inhabited the area 9,500 years ago would have been incapable of crafting and decorating such a massive object. \n\nA later German analysis gave an age of 11,500 years. It is the most ancient wooden sculpture of its kind known in the world. Typically, wood degrades in most environments and does not endure for archaeological discovery so readily as other materials such as stone and metal. A decorated antler was found near the Shigir Idol and dated to the same period, giving credence to the estimated age of 11,500 years. \n\nThe sculpture is carved from larch. As identified from the annual rings, the tree was at least 159 years old. Stone tools were used for carving the markings. The top portion is a head with a face with eyes, nose, and mouth. The body is flat and rectangular. Geometrical motifs decorate its surface, including zigzag lines and depictions of human faces and hands. Horizontal lines at the level of the thorax may represent ribs, and lines broken in chevrons cover the rest of what often is described as the body, however, along with the face at the top, several faces are visible at various points along the sculpture. The arrangement resembles a totem pole.\n\nScholars have proposed various theories about the carvings' meaning. Svetlana Savchenko, a researcher at the Sverdlovsk Regional Museum, suggested that the decoration tells the creation myth those who carved it believed in. Other researchers at the museum have suggested that the markings could have served as a navigational aid or map. Professor Mikhail Zhilin, an archaeologist at the Institute of Archaeology in Moscow, guessed that the statue could depict mythological creatures such as forest spirits. Archeologist Peter Vang Peterson, of the National Museum of Denmark, speculated that the idol could serve as a warning not to enter a dangerous area.\n\nScholars noted that the Shigir Idol's decoration was similar to that of the oldest known monumental stone ruins, at Gobekli Tepe in Turkey.\n\nThe ornamentation on the sculpture was carved using three different sizes of chisels. In addition, following his 2014 examination of the sculpture, Professor Zhilin discovered another face in the sculpture and asserted that the faces were carved last of all, using tools made from the lower jaw bones of a beaver, with sharpened incisor teeth. A beaver jaw tool from the same period was found at the Beregovaya 2 site.\n\nThe discovery upended scholars' views on when humans began making ritual art, as opposed to the kind of realistic art seen in the Lascaux caves. Scientists had previously believed that complex art comparable to the Shigir Idol began in sedentary farming populations in the Middle East around 8,000 years ago.\n\nProfessor Zhilin stated that the sculpture was made from the phytoncidic larch, then preserved in turf, a bog, that had an acid anaerobic environment, which kills microorganisms and also has a tanning effect. Scientists suspect that many more statues like the Shigir Idol existed, but that they did not benefit from the same unusual conditions and therefore were not preserved.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "297466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297466", "title": "Spontaneous symmetry breaking", "text": "Spontaneous symmetry breaking\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetric state ends up in an asymmetric state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.\n\nIn explicit symmetry breaking, if we consider two outcomes, the probability of a pair of outcomes can be different. By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of a symmetric probability distribution—any pair of outcomes has the same probability. In other words, the underlying laws are invariant under a symmetry transformation.\n\nThe system, as a whole, changes under such transformations.\n\nPhases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the fractional quantum Hall effect.\n\nConsider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis. But the ball may \"spontaneously break\" this symmetry by rolling down the dome into the trough, a point of lowest energy. Afterward, the ball has come to a rest at some fixed point on the perimeter. The dome and the ball retain their individual symmetry, but the system does not.\n\nIn the simplest idealized relativistic model, the spontaneously broken symmetry is summarized through an illustrative scalar field theory. The relevant Lagrangian of a scalar field formula_1, which essentially dictates how a system behaves, can be split up into kinetic and potential terms,\n\nIt is in this potential term formula_2 that the symmetry breaking is triggered. An example of a potential, due to Jeffrey Goldstone is illustrated in the graph at the right.\n\nThis potential has an infinite number of possible minima (vacuum states) given by\nfor any real \"θ\" between 0 and 2\"π\". The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to . This state has a U(1) symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of \"θ\"), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or \"spontaneously broken\".\n\nIn fact, any other choice of \"θ\" would have exactly the same energy, implying the existence of a massless Nambu–Goldstone boson, the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian.\n\n\nIn particle physics the force carrier particles are normally specified by field equations with gauge symmetry; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A \"by the same amount\". The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.\n\nAn actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. \"Hidden\" is a better term than \"broken\", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called \"spontaneous\" symmetry breaking (SSB) because \"nothing\" (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations.\n\nChiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the chiral symmetry of the strong interactions in particle physics. It is a property of quantum chromodynamics, the quantum field theory describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the nucleons, and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound quarks into 100 times heavier constituents of baryons. The approximate Nambu–Goldstone bosons in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the pions, whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\nThe strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from gauge symmetries. The Higgs mechanism, the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the superconductivity of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and \"gauge symmetries\", is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu–Goldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.\n\nIn the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The W and Z bosons are the elementary particles that mediate the weak interaction, while the photon mediates the electromagnetic interaction. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The Weinberg–Salam theory predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge. In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.\n\nWithout spontaneous symmetry breaking, the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the W and Z bosons) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the Higgs mechanism to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the Higgs boson, detected in 2012.\n\nSuperconductivity of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.\n\nMost phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking rotational symmetry. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others.\n\nThere are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like fractional quantum Hall liquids, and spin-liquids. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.\n\nThe ferromagnet is the canonical system which spontaneously breaks the continuous symmetry of the spins below the Curie temperature and at , where \"h\" is the external magnetic field. Below the Curie temperature the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization \"m\"(x) such that . The symmetry is spontaneously broken as when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.\n\nSpontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.\n\nSpontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu–Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.\n\nAn important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu–Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations).\n\nOther long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the Coulomb potential or Yukawa potential has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries. It was shown, in the presence of a symmetric Hamiltonian, and in the limit of infinite volume, the system spontaneously adopts a chiral configuration, i.e. breaks mirror plane symmetry.\n\nDynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description (Lagrangian).\n\nDynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the effective action).\n\nDynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists an unstable Higgs particle in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. Electroweak interaction). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional Higgs mechanism in the standard model, by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as \"Composite Higgs models\"). Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a fermionic condensate; for example the quark condensate, which is connected to the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in quantum chromodynamics. Conventional superconductivity is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.\n\nFor spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore symmetric with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed \"hidden symmetry\", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the Goldstone boson.)\n\nWhen a theory is symmetric with respect to a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate \"which\" member is distinct, only that \"one is\". From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.\n\nThe crucial concept in physics theories is the order parameter. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a \"vacuum\" expectation value) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the ordered phase, and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a \"frame of reference\" to be measured against. In that case, the vacuum state does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized Wigner mode in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) Nambu–Goldstone mode. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless Goldstone bosons arise.\n\nThe symmetry group can be discrete, such as the space group of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a Lie group), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a vacuum state of the full quantum theory, although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.\n\nOn October 7, 2008, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. Yoichiro Nambu, of the University of Chicago, won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically chiral symmetry breaking. Physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, of Kyoto University, shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the explicit breaking of CP symmetry in the weak interactions. This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a \"just so\" feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19010531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19010531", "title": "Visual arts of Chicago", "text": "Visual arts of Chicago\n\nVisual arts of Chicago refers to paintings, prints, illustrations, textile art, sculpture, ceramics and other visual artworks produced in Chicago or by people with a connection to Chicago. Since World War II, Chicago visual art has had a strong individualistic streak, little influenced by outside fashions. \"One of the unique characteristics of Chicago,\" said Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts curator Bob Cozzolino, \"is there's always been a very pronounced effort to not be derivative, to not follow the status quo.\" The Chicago art world has been described as having \"a stubborn sense ... of tolerant pluralism.\" However, Chicago's art scene is \"critically neglected.\" Critic Andrew Patner has said, \"Chicago's commitment to figurative painting, dating back to the post-War period, has often put it at odds with New York critics and dealers.\" It is argued that Chicago art is rarely found in Chicago museums; some of the most remarkable Chicago artworks are found in other cities (such as the brilliantly warped epic drawings of Henry Darger at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City, or Carlos Cortez' collection of early twentieth-century Chicago \"Wobbly\" (Industrial Workers of the World) woodcut prints, now in the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University in Detroit).\n\nThe School of the Art Institute of Chicago was founded in 1879, from the remains of an earlier school founded in 1866 (thus the school predates the museum of the same name). Early students and faculty were conservative and derivative in their tastes, imitating popular European models. Arthur B. Davies, a former SAIC student and one of \"the Eight\" was considered a disappointment for being a member of a radical group of urban modernists. In 1913, SAIC students held a protest with costumes and bonfires against the Chicago showing of the Armory Show, a collection of the best new modern art; the newspapers described the students' activity as a riot.\n\nOnly a year later the African-American realist Archibald J. Motley, graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago; he kept his modern, jazz-influenced paintings secret for some years after.\n\nFor many years the Art Institute of Chicago regularly held annual exhibits of local artists, but these ended decades ago. Mary Agnes Yerkes, (1886–1989), was an American Impressionist painter and one such exhibitor at AIC from 1912-1915. Born in Oak Park, she studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, where she also taught, and the at the currently named School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is noted for her plein-air painting while camping the American West and its National Parks.\n\nThe time period between the World Wars witnessed an outpouring of artistic creativity in Chicago, led by artists of the calibre of Stanislav Szukalski, Todros Geller and Albin Polasek.\n\nThe Chicago art scene was not strictly an all-boys club however; Sr. Maria Stanisia was able to overcome the patriarchal attitudes both within early twentieth century Chicago and the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church to become acclaimed as one of the greatest painters in the field of religious art. Another woman artist Gertrude Abercrombie who like Stanisia attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, sold her surrealist paintings in art fairs that took place near the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nEarly evidence of Chicago's unique style came with Ivan Albright, with his \"excruciatingly detailed surfaces depicting things in states of decay.\" Eldzier Cortor documented African-American life for the WPA. Vera Berdich, an influential surrealist printmaker, taught many future Chicago Imagists at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nClaes Oldenburg was born in Sweden and only spent a few years in the 1950s in Chicago, but he sold his first works here, 5 pieces at the 57th Street Art Fair for $25.\n\nPost-War art in Chicago was more figurative and less abstract than the New York fashion dictated, and was largely ignored by New York dealers and critics. Chicago artists rejected the abstract aesthetics of New York modernists, preferring strong surrealism, \"following their own vision,\" and \"savage political satire.\"\n\nClaire Zeisler, a fiber artist, switched from weaving to large, free-standing fiber sculptures which \"redefined the art form\".\n\nIn the late 1960s, a group of former students of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, many of whom had been mentored by teacher-artist Ray Yoshida, organized a series of exhibits at the Hyde Park Art Center. Their art was notable for its surrealism and cartoon-influenced grotesques.\n\nStrictly speaking, they were three different groups: The earliest was the \"Monster Roster\", which included Cosmo Campoli, Leon Golub, Nancy Spero, and Karl Wirsum; then the \"Hairy Who\", which included Art Green, Gladys Nilsson, and Jim Nutt; and finally the Chicago Imagists, which included Roger Brown, Ed Paschke, and Barbara Rossi.\n\nAccording to Imagist Ed Paschke, the Imagists felt liberated by a lack of critical coverage. \"There was a sense that no one much cared what we did here. We weren't going to get a whole lot of national attention. We could do what we wanted to do.\" After Paschke's death, in 2004, a New York critic infamously said that Paschke's \"contribution to the art of his time was somewhat obscured by his distance from New York.\" At that same time, Chicago artists Tony Fitzpatrick and Wesley Kimler and art consultant Paul Klein stirred outrage when they reported that not a single Chicago museum had any of Paschke's work on display (a claim that was later disputed).\n\nIn 1972 the Chicago Imagists were given recognition in a show at the Museum of Contemporary Art.\n\nUnder the leadership of Penelope and Franklin Rosemont, the Chicago Surrealist Group came together with both artistic and political ideals. In 1976 the group played a major role in organizing the World Surrealist Exhibition at the Gallery Black Swan.\n\nChicago produced several photorealists, including Arne Besser, and Richard Estes. Many photorealists were collected by Morton Neumann \"against the grain of the prevailing critical thought at the time\" (which espoused abstract expressionism), and exhibited at Chicago's Terra Museum of American Art.\n\nOver the last few decades, many contemporary Chicago artists have become internationally successful. A persistent problem for the development of art scenes in Chicago has been the fact that, in the past, a large number of artists began in Chicago, but had to relocate elsewhere before gaining attention. Curator Robert Cozzolino sees this positively, stating that we must \"recognize a powerful Chicago diaspora.\" Such artists include Claes Oldenburg, Elizabeth Murray, Richard Estes, Robert Indiana, Joan Mitchell, Georgia O'Keeffe, and many others.\n\nAlthough no overarching theme or style characterizes Chicago's contemporary art, many contemporary critics contend that institutional support has favored Neo-Conceptual work almost to exclusion. Chicago art is nevertheless diverse and pluralistic, as is art in general. Contemporary Chicago artists continue to explore personal styles. Although abstraction has never been as strong in Chicago as in New York, there are noteworthy Chicago abstract artists, such as William Conger, who paints brightly colored, sprightly designs, and Rodney Carswell, whose work is more formal and cooler; and conceptual artists such as photographer Jeanne Dunning and installation artist Kay Rosen. Chicago's other notable contemporary artists are too numerous to name; but a few who would make any list are Kerry James Marshall, Dan Peterman, Gregg Bordowitz, Julia Fish, Wesley Kimler, Tony Fitzpatrick and Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle.\n\nRobert Guinan paints psychologically penetrating portraits of bar patrons and jazz musicians which are very popular in France, but he is almost unknown in Chicago. Laurie Hogin continues the grotesque Chicago tradition with lush, Dutch-style portraits of cartoonishly savage animals. Ellen Lanyon's paintings show \"fairy-tale gentleness and antiquarian whimsy.\" Riva Lehrer, herself disabled, paints intense, sympathetic, surreal portraits of disabled persons. Richard Loving paints luminous, spiritual abstractions. Tim Lowly, who has mastered the difficult medium of egg tempera, paints heartbreaking spiritual pictures of seemingly ill children. Audrey Niffenegger paints beautifully weird surreal images and writes acclaimed fiction as well. Frank Piatek paints not-quite-abstracts of giant, writhing tube-forms. Judith Raphael paints pugnacious little girls posed like classical artworks. Patrick Skoff leaves his paintings in public places for people to find and keep.Matt Lamb, a self-taught artist, creates luminous expressionist paintings with bold uses of color, whimsical figures and symbols, and unlikely combinations of mediums. Maria Tomasula paints exquisitely realistic, symbolic still-lives. Wesley Kimler paints expressive, gestural, hybrid paintings that combine abstract and figurative elements in theatrical, sometimes grotesque and highly creative ways. John F. Miller taught for a few decades at the SAIC and, during the bulk of that period, produced paintings and some drawings in an abstract style. Since the late 1990s, Miller has produced most of his work using compters and graphics software. Mark Staff Brandl combines the influences of comic books, sign-painting and philosophy in talented paintings and installations which are accessible, intellectually demanding, and warily subversive.\n\nCat Chow constructs dresses out of subversive materials. Richard Hunt sculpts ruggedly abstract commentaries on social issues. Kerry James Marshall paints and sculpts multi-media works commenting on African-American life.\n\nThese same impulses also appeared in Chicago's lively Street photography scene, gaining notoriety through artists centered around the Institute of Design such as Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, Leon Lewandowski as well as in the work of nanny-savant Vivian Maier. Ray K. Metzker and Barbara Crane studied at the Institute of Design in the 1950s. They spread the ideas of the Institute of Design teaching photography in the second half of the 20th century. Metzker was Philadelphia based and Crane was based in Chicago. Bob Thall's beautiful, bleak photographs of Chicago-area architecture have also won much acclaim.\n\nContemporary illustrators include Jay Ryan, whose hand-silkscreened posters have advertised many a rock band, and fantasist Scott Gustafson. Tony Fitzpatrick etches wild, detailed, tattoo-like pop images.\n\nChicago had a revival, dating to the 1960s, of public mural art, involving local artists and community members. Chicago Public Art Group is a non profit cultural organization in Chicago that organizes and promotes creation of community public art. Founded in 1971, several of its recent works have been large bricolage mosaics in city underpasses.\n\nToday, Jeff Zimmerman paints photorealistic portrait murals, which can be found in various neighborhoods and restaurants in Chicago and Cincinnati.\n\nChicago has a strong tradition of satirical, even grotesque art and illustration. The early books of L. Frank Baum were illustrated with the strange work of William Wallace Denslow. The Chicago tradition of political satire is seen in installation artist Öyvind Fahlström, cartoonish artist Hy Roth, and actual cartoonists Heather McAdams and Nicole Hollander. Other Chicago cartoonists recognised by the art world include Lynda Barry, Dan Clowes, Jay Lynch and Chris Ware (whose work was shown at the 2002 Whitney Biennial). Significant comics artists from Chicago include Jessica Abel, \"Herblock\" (Herbert Block), animator Walt Disney, adventure satirist Phil Foglio, and goth cartoonist Jill Thompson.\n\n\"Chicago emerged early on as an outpost for outsider art,\" according to critic Andrew Patner.\n\nManierre Dawson was an early self-taught artist, who began painting abstracts in 1910. He was invited to display in the Armory Show.\n\nIn the 1990s, a group of Chicago collectors, including Bob Roth, founder of the \"Chicago Reader\", and Ann Nathan and Judy Saslow, both of whom have opened acclaimed galleries, organized , which leads tours of Midwestern self-taught artists and has its own exhibition space.\n\nPaul Waggoner, an eccentric himself, was an art dealer and champion of outsider art.\n\nCarl Hammer, an art dealer in Chicago, has handled much strange, figurative outsider art, including the epic novel, illustrated with hermaphroditic girls traced from coloring books, of Henry Darger, and the naive portraits of society ladies of Lee Godie. Hammer also represents Mr. Imagination, a self-taught bottlecap muralist Mr. Imagination, whose work is in several museums, also participated in the 2007 public art project, \"\".\n\nIn the 1980s, the Museum of Contemporary Art, along with the Art Institute of Chicago and Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs, attempted to put on a show of contemporary Chicago art. Called \"The Chicago Show\", it was supposed to celebrate Chicago's artistic diversity. Embarrassingly, 84 of the 90 artists chosen by the 5-member blind jury were found to be white. The organizers published an apology in the exhibit catalogue and invited twenty minority artists who had not been juried in to participate. Half of the invited artists, angered by this condescension, refused and organized a counter-exhibit at the Chicago Cultural Center.\n\nOn April 15, 1989, the same night that the Hyde Park Art Center celebrated its 50th anniversary, a devastating fire destroyed most of an entire block of important galleries and art spaces in the River North gallery district.\n\nIn spring of 1996, the Feigen, Inc. gallery's exhibit of Gregory Green's \"10,000 Doses\" and \"Recipe for Making 'LSD' in the Kitchen\" was raided by the Chicago police, who confiscated and broke open the artworks. No drugs were found.\n\nIn 1996 the Museum of Contemporary Art, to get over the embarrassment of \"The Chicago Show\", attempted a survey of Chicago Art called \"Art in Chicago: 1945-1995\". It was criticized by the press as cramped, inadequate, and incomprehensive. Its catalogue was judged a disappointment by Dennis Adrian, an art critic and participant, who called it \"visually ... an atrocity of staggering proportions.\"\n\nIn the last decade, all major print publications in Chicago have ceased seriously covering the visual arts . In 2009, the \"Chicago Reader\", an alternative weekly newspaper, reduced its formerly complete art listings of galleries and museums and regular art reviews by Fred Camper to \"a smattering of listings and pictures\". The \"Chicago Tribune\", one of Chicago's two major newspapers, never had gallery or art listings and fired its sole dedicated fine arts reporter, Alan G. Artner, in 2009.\nAnd the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", the other of Chicago's two major newspapers, has no gallery or art listings and no dedicated arts reporter, although Kevin Nance has covered some fine art issues along with movies and popular culture.\n\nAdditionally, The \"New Art Examiner\" (from Chicago) and \"Dialogue\" magazine (Columbus, Ohio) reported on Chicago and midwestern arts communities until they both folded in 2002, though the \"New Art Examiner\" relaunched in 2015' \"Chicago Gallery News\", a glossy color magazine published three times a year, lists gallery shows but has no articles. \"Gallery Guide\" magazine publishes a Chicago/midwest edition which is similar.\n\nHowever, smaller online and print publications have continued to cover the art scene in Chicago and have increased dramatically in number in recent years. Since 1988, New City Magazine has covered the visual arts in Chicago, joined in the 1990s by Lumpen Magazine.. Gapers Block, a Chicago-focused web publication established in 2003, added coverage with their arts and culture section. They were soon followed by Paul Klein's Art Letter in 2004 and the Bad At Sports podcast and blog in 2005. In 2008, print-based Proximity Magazine was established, joined by two more print publications, Jettison Quarterly, and The School of the Art Institute's F News Magazine in 2009. Also in 2009, Chicago Art Magazine broke off of Art Talk Chicago, part of the Chicago Tribune-sponsored blog network, to start their own independent online platform. Chicago Art Review, which ran from 2009-2011 and is currently in hiatus, began in 2009 as well. In 2010, Sixty Inches From Center was established and includes The Chicago Arts Archive, a web publication focusing on visual art in Chicago.\n\nAdditionally, Chicago Artists Resource, launched by the Department of Cultural Affairs in 2005, provides articles on visual art in addition to providing resources and tools for Chicago artists.\n\nLocal artists' interests are represented by the Chicago Artists' Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy organization, which has a monthly newsletter, the \"Chicago Artists' News\".\n\n"}

{"id": "53614383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53614383", "title": "Wall Hangings (exhibition)", "text": "Wall Hangings (exhibition)\n\nWall Hangings was an exhibition of textile fiber art at Museum of Modern Art from 25 February to 4 May 1969. It was planned in 1966 and toured 11 cities in 1968–1969.\n\nWall Hangings Exhibition was curated by Mildred Constantine and Jack Lenor Larsen and featured 28 Artists from 8 countries. It was the first major art exhibition in fiber arts or textiles. Artworks were noted for their techniques, material, scale and three-dimensionality and were referenced both to their break from and use of tradition in those areas. The history of the artists in the show were directly attributed to the Austrian Wiener Werkstätte and the German Bauhaus, though mention was made of other inspirations such as Pre-Columbian Peruvian weavers. \n\nThe 19 December 1968 Press release by the Museum of Modern Art for the exhibition Wall Hangings states: \"During the last 10 years, developments in weaving have caused us to revise our concepts of this craft and view the work within the context of twenty-first century art. The weavers from eight countries represented in this exhibition are not part of the fabric industry, but of the world of art. They have extended the formal possibilities of weaving, frequently using complex and unique techniques.\"\n\nThe only national art world press was written by Louise Bourgeois for \"Craft Horizons\" and was negative and suggested that the work was not fine art. As craft theorist Elissa Auther states in her 2009 book \"String Felt & Thread\": \"Despite the awareness of the negative art world attitudes concerning media traditionally associated with the crafts, the strategy Constantine and Larsen adopted to assert fiber's art status was to introduce the new genre into the fine art world on the terms set by that world.\"\n"}
