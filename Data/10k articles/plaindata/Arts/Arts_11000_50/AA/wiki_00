This book appears in Robert Steele's list of books banned in Henry's reign; Steele refers to it as \"Dialogue between gentleman & plowman.\" While clearly in the Piers Plowman Tradition, Piers does not appear as a character. The first version has a 684 line acrostic poem opening and dialogue that was written in the sixteenth-century invention. Following this, there is an authentic, late fourteenth-century Lollard anti-clerical text, written ca. 1375-85. (It is included in Matthew, ed. \"The English Works of Wyclif\".) To all this, the second version adds another prose tract probably from the late fifteenth century, which argues in favor of vernacular Bible translations. \n\nThe dialogue begins with the gentleman lamenting how his class has fallen low and is unable to help the poor, because long ago they were fooled into giving their lands and wealth to the church. The husbandman then argues for confiscating the possessions of a corrupt clergy which preys upon the poor. Belief in purgatory and indulgences is singled out as the favorite swindle of the clergy, who are ultimately to blame for rising rents. The husbandman suggests taking the issue to parliament (the 1529 \"Reformation Parliament\"), but the gentleman demurs, alluding to Simon Fish's \"A Supplicacyon for the Beggers\" and Thomas More's rebuttal and defense of purgatory in \"The Supplycacyon of Soulys\" (1529). King John, Sir John Oldcastle, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester are listed as good men who came to bad ends for opposing the clergy. Then there is an allusion to the burning of William Tyndale's New Testament in 1526 and Henry V's persecution of Lollards. To defend Lutherans and opposition to clerical possessions from charges of \"newfangledness,\" the husbandman introduces what he takes to be a century-old treatise; i.e., a late-fourteenth-century Lollard text that supports disendowment of the clergy and barring them from secular offices. (The husbandman places it in the time of Richard II.)\n\nThe \"I\" of the husbandman at this point leads into the \"I\" of the Lollard treatise which is attached at the end with little done to make a transition; it is revised to function as contemporary anti-Roman polemic. \n\n"}

{"id": "30456429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30456429", "title": "And the Band Played On", "text": "And the Band Played On\n\nAnd the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by \"San Francisco Chronicle\" journalist Randy Shilts. The book chronicles the discovery and spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease is caused by a biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.\n\nThe book is an extensive work of investigative journalism, written in the form of an encompassing time line; the events that shaped the epidemic are presented as sequential matter-of-fact summaries. Shilts describes the impact and the politics involved in battling the disease on particular individuals in the gay, medical, and political communities. Shilts begins his discussion in 1977 with the first confirmed case of AIDS, that of Grethe Rask, a Danish doctor working in Africa. He ends with the announcement by actor Rock Hudson in 1985 that he was dying of AIDS, when international attention on the disease exploded.\n\n\"And the Band Played On\" was critically acclaimed and became a best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the \"Library Journal\" called it \"one of the most important books of the year\", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, \"Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved.\" The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.\n\nShilts decided to write \"And the Band Played On\" after attending an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: \"What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian.\" Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it \"says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go in front of a journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people.\"\n\nAfter publication of the book, Shilts explained his use of the title: \"\"And the Band Played On\" is simply a snappier way of saying 'business as usual'. Everyone responded with an ordinary pace to an extraordinary situation.\" The phrase itself is originally from The Temptations' popular 1970 song about encroaching chaos, \"Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)\"; in the song, the phrase repeatedly signals that no one is paying proper attention to world problems.\n\nShilts focuses on several organizations and communities that were either hit hardest by AIDS—and were given the task of finding the cause of the disease—or begging the government for money to fund research and provide social services to people who were dying. He often uses an omniscient point of view to portray individuals' thoughts and feelings.\n\nAIDS in the United States first struck gay men and IV drug users in Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco due to unsafe sexual and drug-taking practices. Shilts' sources in the gay community tried to remember the last time everyone they knew was healthy, which was the United States Bicentennial celebration in 1976, when sailors came from all over the world to New York. Some of them carried sexually transmitted diseases and rare tropical fevers. A marked difference in these cities arose in two phases of consciousness in the gay community: \"Before\" in 1980, and \"After\" by 1985. \"Before\", according to Shilts, was characterized by a care-free innocence, preceding the period when gay men were aware of a deadly infectious disease. \"After\" signified the realization that gay men knew most or all of their friends were infected with AIDS, and the syndrome became pervasive throughout the media.\n\nIn San Francisco, particularly in the Castro District, gay community activists such as Bill Kraus and Cleve Jones found a new direction in gay rights when so many men came down with strange illnesses in 1980. The San Francisco Department of Public Health began tracing the disease, linked it to certain sexual practices, and made recommendations—stop having sex—to gay men to avoid getting sick, a directive that defied the chief reason why many gay men had migrated to the Castro, and for what gay rights activists in San Francisco had fought for years. Kraus and Jones often found themselves fighting a two-fronted battle: against city politicians who would rather not deal with a disease that affected gay men, who were seen as an undesirable population, and the gay men themselves, who refused to listen to doomsday projections and continued their unsafe behavior.\n\nIn New York City, men like Larry Kramer and Paul Popham, who had previously shown no desire for leadership, were forced by bureaucratic apathy into forming the Gay Men's Health Crisis to raise money for medical research and to provide social services for scores of gay men who began getting sick with opportunistic infections. Shilts describes the desperate actions of the group to get recognition by Mayor Ed Koch and assistance from the city's Public Health Department to provide social services and preventive education about AIDS and unsafe sex.\n\nIn these cities, however, the sizable gay communities in most instances were responsible for raising the most money for research, providing the money for and subsequently the social services for the dying, and educating themselves and other high-risk groups. Kramer would go on to form AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP), a political activist organization that forced government and media to pay attention to AIDS. Jones formed the NAMES Project that created the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest folk art display in the world.\n\nDoctors were the first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their professional life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.\n\nShilts praised the Public Health Department of San Francisco's handling of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, although some of them were living in different parts of the country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.\n\nAround the same time gay men were getting sick in the United States, doctors in Paris were receiving patients who were African or who had lived in Africa with the same symptoms as the Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.\n\nDepartmental ego and pride, according to Shilts, also confounded research as the Centers for Disease Control and the National Cancer Institutes battled over funding and who might get credit for medical discoveries that were to come from the isolation of HIV, blood tests to find HIV, or any possible vaccine. Once AIDS became known as a \"gay disease\" there was particular difficulty for many doctors in different specialties to get other medical professionals to acknowledge that AIDS could be transmitted to people who were not gay, such as infants born from drug-using mothers, children and adults who had hemophilia (and later, their wives), Haitians, and people who had received blood transfusions.\n\nThe discovery of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred as early as 1982, yet it was not until 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the agency responsible for tracking down and reporting all communicable diseases in the U.S., faced governmental apathy in the face of mounting crisis. Shilts reported how CDC epidemiologists forged ahead blindly after being denied funding for researching the disease repeatedly. Shilts expressed particular frustration describing instances of the CDC fighting with itself over how much time and attention was being paid to AIDS issues.\n\nAlthough Reagan Administration officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler and Assistant Secretary Edward Brandt spoke publicly about the epidemic, calling it in 1983 its \"Number One Health Priority\" no extra funding was given to the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health for research. What the U.S. Congress pushed through was highly politicized and embattled, and a fraction of what was spent on similar public health problems.\n\nShilts made comparisons to the government's disparate reaction to the Chicago Tylenol murders, and the recent emergence of Legionnaire's Disease in 1977. In October 1982, seven people died after ingesting cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. The \"New York Times\" wrote a front-page story about the Tylenol scare every day in October, and produced 33 more stories about the issue after that. More than 100 law enforcement agents, and 1,100 Food and Drug Administration employees worked on the case. Johnson & Johnson disclosed they spent $100 million attempting to uncover who had tampered with the bottles. In October 1982, 634 people were reported having AIDS, and of those, 260 had died. The \"New York Times\" wrote three stories in 1981 and three more stories in 1982 about AIDS, none on the front page. The Tylenol Crisis was a criminal act of product-tampering; Legionnaire's Disease was a public health emergency. Twenty-nine members of the American Legion died in 1976 at a convention in Philadelphia. The National Institute of Health spent $34,841 per death of Legionnaire's Disease. In contrast, the NIH spent $3,225 in 1981 and about $8,991 in 1982 for each person who died of AIDS.\n\nShilts accused Ronald Reagan of neglecting to address AIDS to the American people until 1987—calling his behavior \"ritualistic silence\"—even after Reagan called friend Rock Hudson to tell him to get well. After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless clear about what causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.\n\nOn a civic level, the closure of gay bathhouses in San Francisco became a bitter political fight in the gay community. Activists put pressure on the San Francisco Public Health director to educate people about how AIDS is transmitted, and demanded he close bathhouses as a matter of public health.\n\nShilts was assigned to AIDS full-time at \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" in 1982. It was from this unique vantage point that he repeatedly criticized the U.S. news media for ignoring the medical crisis because it did not affect people who mattered, only gays and drug addicts. Shilts noted most newspapers would print stories about AIDS only when it affected heterosexuals, sometimes taking particular interest in stories about AIDS in prostitutes. AIDS was not reported in the \"Wall Street Journal\" until it involved heterosexuals. Many stories called AIDS a \"gay plague\" or \"homosexual disease\" in articles that pointed to it showing up in new populations, like hemophiliacs or people who had received blood transfusions. Shilts recounted the irony of a reporter commenting on how little was reported about the disease, then linking it once more to rarer instances of transmission to non-drug-using heterosexuals. On the other end of the extreme, a general phobia of AIDS was exacerbated by the news media who erroneously reported that AIDS could be contracted by household contact, without checking any facts in their stories, which prompted mass hysteria across the United States.\n\nThe book became a commercial success, contrary to Shilts' own expectations. It remained on the \"New York Times Bestseller List\" for five weeks, was translated into seven languages, nominated for a National Book Award, and made Shilts an \"AIDS celebrity\". In \"Rolling Stone\", Shilts is compared to great American writers whose careers were made by the circumstances surrounding them, such as Thomas Paine in the American Revolution, Edward R. Murrow during the Blitz, and David Halberstam during the Vietnam War. Writer Jon Katz explains, \"No other mainstream journalist has sounded the alarm so frantically, caught the dimensions of the AIDS tragedy so poignantly or focused so much attention on government delay, the nitpickings of research funding and institutional intrigue\". In the \"American Journal of Public Health\", Howard Merkel characterizes \"And the Band Played On\" as the first volume of the historiography of AIDS. Because the content expanded into law and science, reviews were published not only in literary sources but legal and medical journals as well.\n\nLiterary reviews of the work were generally positive, with reviewers commenting on the \"hypnotic\" and \"thriller-like\" qualities of the book. Shilts' investigative and journalistic endeavors were praised, and reviewers seemed genuinely moved by the personal stories of the major players. \"And the Band Played On\" won the Stonewall Book Award for 1988. It earned the 10th spot on \"100 Lesbian and Gay Books That Changed Our Lives\", compiled by the \"Lambda Book Report\". In 1999, The New York City Public Library topped its list of \"21 New Classics for the 21st Century\" with \"And the Band Played On\". Two years after it was published however, Shilts remained \"fundamentally disappointed\" when a radical response to the AIDS crisis did not materialize, despite the reaction to his book.\n\nIn a 1988 book review, Jack Geiger of \"The New York Times\" commented that the detail in Shilts' work was too confusing, being told \"in five simultaneous but disjointed chronologies, making them all less coherent\", and notes that Shilts neglected to dedicate as much detail to black and Hispanic intravenous drug users, their partners and their children as to gay men. Geiger also expressed doubts that a swifter response by the government would have stemmed the spread of AIDS as quickly as Shilts was implying. Woodrow Myers from the \"Los Angeles Times\" was frustrated by Shilts not asking the right questions: \"Shilts fails to probe the broader questions and stops where far too many of us stop: We don't ask why the Department of Defense and the entitlements like Social Security are getting all the money when the homosexuals and the IV drug abusers with AIDS and the multiple sclerosis patients are not.\" The \"Gay Community News\" in Boston also criticized the book's implications that a diagnosis of HIV indicated that death was sure and imminent. Richard Rouilard, editor of \"The Advocate\" in 1992 criticized Shilts for being out of touch with the contemporary style of activism and its sexual overtones.\n\nShilts' book has been used as a standard by the lay press when reviewing books chronicling subsequent medical crises including breast cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome, Agent Orange, and continued response to AIDS. However, the academic and scientific communities have been somewhat more critical. Howard Merkel, in the \"American Journal of Public Health\", notes Shilts' tendency to assign blame, writing \"A requirement of the journalist, and certainly the historian, however, is to explain human society rather than to point fingers\". Jon Katz in \"Rolling Stone\" refutes this by stating \"[Shilts] fused strong belief with the gathering of factual information and the marshaling of arguments, the way the founders of the modern press did. In doing so, he has exposed the notion of objectivity as bankrupt, ineffective, even lethal\".\n\nAlthough Sandra Panem in the journal \"Science\" praised Shilts' efforts and the attention the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight to the issue of homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks that even if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.\n\nWendy Parmet, a professor at Northeastern University Law School, highlights the greatest strengths of \"And the Band Played On\" to be \"the pain and courage of individual confronted with AIDS\" and how it \"eloquently portrays the human side of the crisis\" and believes the blame others criticized to be justified; but Parmet considers his technique of assigning an omniscient point of view a weakness, suggesting that it blurs the lines between fact and fiction. In \"Contemporary Sociology\", Peter Manning and Terry Stein also call Shilts' narrative method into question, and ask why, for a syndrome that affects people beyond race, class, and sexual orientation, that Shilts focuses so narrowly on AIDS as it is related to homosexuality. The writers, however, were mostly impressed with the book, calling it an \"informative, often brilliant, overview of the emergent meanings of the AIDS epidemic\".\n\nShilts is often quoted as claiming that Ronald Reagan neglected to mention AIDS publicly until 1987. However, Reagan briefly mentioned AIDS research in questions and answers during a news conference on September 17, 1985.\n\nThe book includes extensive discussion of Gaëtan Dugas, a Canadian flight attendant who died in 1984. Dugas was labeled Patient Zero of AIDS, because he was linked directly or indirectly with 40 of the first 248 reported cases of AIDS in the United States, and after he was told of his ability to infect others, defiantly continued to have unprotected sex. Many book reviews concentrated their material on Dugas, or led their assessment of the book with discussion of his behavior. Some reviewers interpreted Shilts' naming Dugas \"Patient Zero\" to mean that Dugas brought AIDS to North America; the \"National Review\" called Dugas the \"Columbus of AIDS\" and in their review of \"And the Band Played On\" states, \"[Dugas] picked up the disease in Europe through sexual contact with Africans. Traveling on his airline-employee privileges, he spread it here from coast to coast.\" Shilts never stated this in the book, instead writing, \"Whether Gaëtan Dugas actually was the person who brought AIDS to North America remains a question of debate and is ultimately unanswerable ... there's no doubt that Gaëtan played a key role in spreading the new virus from one end of the United States to the other.\" \"Time\" titled its review of \"And the Band Played On\" \"The Appalling Saga of Patient Zero\", erroneously restating the claim that Dugas had brought AIDS to the continent. Even a press release by St. Martin's Press made the connection between Dugas and the introduction of AIDS to the Western World in its title, but not its text.\n\nWhen the book was released, Dugas' story became a controversial subject in the Canadian media. Shilts claimed that \"the Canadian press went crazy over the story\" and that \"Canadians... saw it as an offense to their nationhood.\" The original study identifying Dugas as the index case had been completed by William Darrow, but it was called into question by University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Andrew Moss. Moss wrote in a letter to the editor of \"The New York Review of Books\", \"There is very little evidence that Gaetan was 'patient zero' for the US or for California,\" while also stating that Shilts did not overstress Dugas' lack of personal responsibility. Sandra Panem in \"Science\" uses Shilts' approach toward Dugas' behavior as an example of his \"glib\" treatment of the science involved in the epidemic. Author Douglas Crimp suggests that Shilts' representation of Dugas as \"murderously irresponsible\" is in actuality \"Shilts' homophobic nightmare of himself\", and that Dugas is offered as a \"scapegoat for his heterosexual colleagues, in order to prove that [Shilts], like them, is horrified by such creatures.\" Many years later, in the 2000s, it was shown, by tracing the roots of the virus, that it had spread from Africa to Haiti, and then to the U.S. in the mid 1960s, before Dugas would have been very sexually active, if at all, and before he was working as a flight attendant. Even the labelling of Dugas as \"Patient Zero\" was due to an misunderstanding of the study of sexual contacts amongst a group of men indicating how the disease was transmitted – he was identified in the study as ‘Patient [letter] O’, for \"Out of California\" – but people reading and discussing the research began referring to and thinking about a \"Patient Zero\" as the origin of the disease.\n\nIn 2016, a study of early AIDS cases demonstrated that Dugas could not have been \"Patient Zero\".\n\nWhile Shilts was writing the book he was tested for HIV but insisted his doctor not tell him the results until the book was finished so it would not affect his journalistic integrity and judgment. On the day he sent the final manuscript to the publisher, he learned he was HIV-positive. He also revealed that he received abuse from gays for the articles he wrote for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" supporting the bathhouse closures, as well as for \"And the Band Played On\", saying it was common for him to be spat upon in the Castro District. He was openly booed when he attended the premiere of \"The Times of Harvey Milk\"—based on his book \"The Mayor of Castro Street\"—at the Castro Theatre. Footage he had shot as a television reporter was included in the film, but during the construction of the documentary he was so controversial that the film's editors removed him from footage showing him with Milk. Following the publication of \"And the Band Played On\", however, he was \"worshipped\" by many in the gay community for writing the book, but also seen as someone who pandered to publicity.\n\nShilts declared while promoting the book in Australia in 1988 that AIDS in the western world could be eradicated, and by 1994, \"AIDS could be as manageable as diabetes\". However, in reference to Africa, Shilts noted, \"At this point it's inconceivable that there will be an AIDS-free world in Central Africa, as we're looking at a death rate on the scale of the Holocaust.\" Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed, \"the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years...the people who did the best job—and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn't let them—tended to be women\", and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic, media coverage would have been vastly different.\n\nShilts died from complications of AIDS in 1994, age 42. Upon his death he was eulogized by Cleve Jones, who said \"Randy's contribution was so crucial. He broke through society's denial and was absolutely critical to communicating the reality of AIDS.\" Larry Kramer said of him, \"He single-handedly probably did more to educate the world about AIDS than any single person.\"\n\n\"And the Band Played On\" was used as the basis for a 1993 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO television film of the same name. It was produced by Aaron Spelling, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, and starred Matthew Modine as epidemiologist Don Francis and Richard Masur as William Darrow at the Centers for Disease Control. Alan Alda portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for union-scale pay. The film was released the same year as \"Philadelphia\", and the play \"\" premiered, which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it. Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the intricacies of the response to AIDS. However, \"And the Band Played On\", along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.\n\n\n"}

She won an Academy Award for her short film \"Wasp\" in 2005. She has since made the leap to feature films and television, including \"Red Road\" (2006), \"Fish Tank\" (2009), and \"American Honey\" (2016), all of which have won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Arnold has also directed four episodes of the Emmy Award-winning series \"Transparent\", as well as all seven episodes of the second season of the Emmy Award-winning series \"Big Little Lies\".\n\nArnold was born in Dartford, Kent, the eldest of four children. She was born when her mother was only 16 years old and her father was 17, and they separated when she was very young. Raised in a housing project, she spent her youth days constantly exploring the “chalk pits, fields, woods and motorways” of Dartford. Her mother had to bring up all four children alone, which is reminiscent of Arnold's own directorial debut short, \"Wasp\". When people are asked if the story is in any way biographical, Arnold replies \"I grew up in a working class family, so I guess you could say I write from what I know.\"\n\nAs a young girl, she was writing dark stories about human experience. In an interview, Arnold speaks about how when she was 10 years old, she wrote her first play that expressed her \"horror\" of the slave trade, and a few years later while studying for a dance GCSE, she made a performance piece; \"I took quotes from the Diary of Anne Frank and read them aloud as I moved around the room. All the other kids would just bung on some pop music and dance. I remember the examiners sitting there looking at me, perplexed.\" Arnold left high school when she was 16, when she was drawn to becoming an actress. When Arnold was 18 years old she began working as a host and actress for a children's TV show called \"No. 73\". She worked in TV for the next 10 years, while continually writing on the side. Arnold realised she could turn her stories into films, so she studied at the American Film Institute of Los Angeles where she gained experience in the film industry. In explaining why she moved from London to study film in the U.S., she states, “I felt my lack of education and accent always held me back in the eyes of the gatekeepers” After finishing school and returning to Britain she had her daughter, Coral and began making short films for TV.\n\nAfter leaving school in the late 1970s, Arnold got her first TV jobs as a dancer on shows that included \"Top of the Pops\". She first came to prominence as an actress and television presenter alongside Sandi Toksvig, Nick Staverson and Neil Buchanan in the 1980s children's television show \"No. 73\". This Saturday morning show on ITV, in which she played Dawn Lodge, had a similar premise to that of \"The Kumars at No. 42\" in the way that the show was part sitcom, part chat show and based at a domestic residence. In addition to these parts, the show had the usual mix of music, competitions and cartoons that was in keeping to the formula of British Saturday morning children's TV of the 1980s. After a couple of years of experience in front of the camera, Arnold realised, \"Television was great fun and I went along for the ride, but I never felt that comfortable in front of the camera\".\n\nIn 1988 No. 73 had morphed into \"7T3\", with the set being moved from the Maidstone house (in fact in TVS studios in Kent) to that of a theme park. This revamp would only last the season, but Arnold would be seen for another two years in the same timeslot as part of the \"Motormouth\" presenting team. In 1990 she presented and wrote for the environmental awareness show for teens, \"A Beetle Called Derek\". This also featured Benjamin Zephaniah and gave exposure to The Yes/No People of Stomp fame.\n\nAfter retiring from her career as a television presenter, Arnold studied directing at the AFI Conservatory in Los Angeles and trained in screenwriting at the PAL Labs in Kent. Her early short films included \"Milk\" (1998) and \"Dog\" (2001). She won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for \"Wasp\", in 2004.\n\nShe was named a \"Screen International\" Star of Tomorrow. Also in 2003, she directed an episode of the Channel 4 series \"Coming Up\" titled \"Bed Bugs\", though she is sometimes erroneously credited as \"Andrew Arnold\" for the work.\n\n\"Red Road\" is the first instalment of Advance Party, a planned set of three conceptually-related films by different first-time directors. Set on a housing estate in Glasgow, the revenge-themed story centres on a CCTV (security TV cameras) operator who develops an obsession with someone she observes, for reasons that become clear through the progress of the film. The picture has won the British director comparisons with established names such as Michael Haneke and Lars von Trier. \"Screen International\" critic Allan Hunter said the film was \"likely to emerge as one of the discoveries of this year's Cannes Film Festival (2006).\" It went on to win the Jury Prize at Cannes that year.\n\nShe won the 2007 BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer for directing \"Red Road\". In 2008, Arnold was reported to be directing an adaptation of Gillian Flynn's novel \"Sharp Objects\" for French production company Pathé, but the project never materialized. In 2011, she was reported to be working on a television project with writer Danny Brocklehurst called \"Dirty\", but this project also failed to materialize.\n\nHer 2009 film \"Fish Tank\" premiered at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, where she once again won the Jury Prize. The film also went on to win the BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film in 2010. In 2011, she completed shooting an adaptation of Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\", produced by London's Ecosse Films. The film was shown in competition at the 68th Venice International Film Festival in September where it won the Golden Osella for Best Cinematography.\n\nShe was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to the film industry.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that she would direct two episodes of the Amazon Studios series \"Transparent\".\n\nInitially released in 2003, \"Wasp\" was a short (26 minutes) written and directed by Arnold. Released in 2003, it stars Natalie Press as a struggling single mother determined not to let her four young children prove an obstacle in the pursuit of igniting a relationship with an old friend (Danny Dyer). Arnold's native Dartford is the setting. The film was commissioned by the UK Film Council and the Britain's Channel 4. It won the Sundance Short Film Prize in 2005, and won Arnold an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film\n\n\"Red Road\" was a 2006 film that is a part of a creative series proposed by the Advance Party of Filmmakers to create three films using the same characters, all directed by different new directors. It tells the story of a CCTV security operator who observes through her monitors a man from her past. It is named after, and partly set at, the Red Road flats in Barmulloch, Glasgow, Scotland which were the tallest residential buildings in Europe at the time they were built. It is shot largely in a Dogme 95 style, using handheld cameras and natural light.\n\nOne rule was that if any of the directors decide to incorporate a new main character, then all of the other films must incorporate that character as well. All three directors cast together so they could all see who they believed would fit their film as well as the others. Arnold mainly used first time actors, stating that \"I always want the world that I create to be its own universe. When you have really famous people, I find that it is very hard to transcend that awareness. I am always aware of who they are. When you see someone for the first time, that universe feels even more real. I like the idea of working with either unknowns or people that haven't even acted before.\" \"Red Road\" cost $1 million to make and was shot digitally on a schedule of six weeks. The film was accepted into competition for the Palme d'Or in Cannes and received the Jury Prize.\n\n\"Fish Tank\" premiered in 2009 and was accepted into competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and received the Jury Prize. In its initial production, distributor Artificial Eye had acquired the UK theatrical rights, while ContentFilm International handled the worldwide sales. The film was backed by the Limelight Fund, BBC Films and the UK Film Council's New Cinema Fund. The film was shot entirely on location in the UK. Arnold was adamant about shooting the film in chronological order, so that the journey of the film would make sense to new coming actor Katie Jarvis. She would only give her a day's worth of script to study so that she could take it day by day. The film originally premiered on around 45–50 screens in Britain, making them less accessible to the general public. In regards to this, Arnold said, \"I definitely feel sorry more people don't get to see my films. They aren't inaccessible, and if people got the chance to see them, I know they'd like them. I wish cinema [owners] could be braver, or had more money to help them show films like mine.\" The film cost around $2 million to make, which is still a relatively low budget for a feature-length film. Fish Tank won many awards including the best film award at the Evening Standard Film Awards. Fish Tank was released on 11 September 2009. The film and Arnold were honoured at the 20th Annual Women in Film and TV Awards in 2010.\n\nArnold's third film was based on Emily Brontë's 1847 novel and starred Kaya Scodelario and James Howson. This is the first film that Arnold has directed which she did not write herself, though she did co-write the screenplay. Originally, the film adaptation was set to be directed by Peter Webber, who directed \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\", but Arnold was asked to take over and gladly accepted. The film was made in 18 months, which is half the amount of time Arnold used to make Red Road and Fish Tank. Oscilloscope Laboratories picked up the North American distribution rights to the adaptation, which won Best Cinematography at the Venice Film Festival in 2011, being praised for its visuals.\n\nArnold's fourth film, \"American Honey\", revolves around a group of young adults traveling across the country selling magazine subscriptions. The meandering plot focuses on the journey of the mag-crew kids as they drink, smoke, dance, joke around, and have various conversations in their van. The film had its world premiere and competed for Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. It won Arnold her third Jury Prize. The film features a mix of both professional and non-actors, with all the non-actors being found through construction sites, parking lots, and on beaches. Out of the 15 youth actors cast, 11 had never acted before. The lead Sasha Lane was spotted by Arnold on a beach during spring break. Arnold shot the film in chronological sequence, not telling her actors where they were going next. The film was released in the United States on 30 September 2016, and in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2016, by A24 and Focus Features respectively.\n\nArnold has been very active in working with film festivals around the world. She has been described as a \"film festival regular even between films.\" In 2012 she was a member of the Jury for the Main Competition at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. In 2013 she was named as a member of the jury at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. In 2014 Arnold was announced as the chair of the jury for International Critics' Week at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. In 2016, Arnold was chosen to take part in a public conversation about her career as part of the Tribeca Film Festival's \"Tribeca Talks\" programme. Arnold was a jury member of the 2017 Sheffield Doc/Fest.\n\nIn September 2013, Arnold was named the New York Film Festival's inaugural \"Filmmaker in Residence.\" As the first \"Filmmaker in Residence,\" Arnold was responsible for \"creating a template for the programme.\" The programme is designed to \"further the goals of filmmakers at an earlier stage in the creative process.\" Through the programme, Arnold was given the \"opportunity to focus on developing or refining new work, and participate in master classes, mentorships or cultural exchange and enrichment film programmes with the Film Society of Lincoln Center members, the film community and the public.\"\n\nAndrea Arnold was named to as Chair of the European Film Festival of Les Arcs, which ran from December 16 to 23, 2017.\n\nThroughout all of her films, Arnold is known for giving her actors almost total control in creating their characters.  Her directorial style was to provide support and reassurance to her actors in an effort to create their most pure reflections of themselves. Sasha Lane, star of \"American Honey,\" describes that “She constantly told me to be who I was. There wasn’t really any teaching. More like, ‘Sasha, you’re fine.'” \n\nIn general, Arnold’s films are characterized by (but do not indulge in) the themes of deprivation and impoverishment.  For example, both \"Fish Tank\"and \"Wuthering Heights\" are dramas featuring teenagers living in the poverty-stricken English edge-lands. Even in \"American Honey\"(despite not taking place in the UK) the young adults encounter many instances of poverty as they travel the U.S. In fact, the entire plot of the film revolves around scamming members of the upper and middle-class into buying magazines; many of whom are rude and/or easily manipulated. This perhaps reflects Arnold’s distaste of upper and middle class entitlement.\n\nArnold lives in Greenwich, London, with her daughter.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The basic concept is to offer willing participants the opportunity of being buried alive in a real coffin underground for fifteen to twenty minutes. As a framework program, monochrom offers lectures about the history of the science of determining death and the medical cultural history of premature burial.\nThe series has created controversy in some places it has been staged.\n\nmonochrom's founder and conceptualist Johannes Grenzfurthner states that the performance series wants to start a conversation about death, culture, medical and scientific myths and mass media. Grenzfurthner says that one of the inspirations for the performance series was the wish to deal with his claustrophobic tendencies.<br>\n\nOver the years the performance has attracted a lot of mainstream media coverage like the popular German TV show \"Joko gegen Klaas\" on Pro7 and the Austrian TV series \"Herr Ostrowski sucht das Glück\" on ORF.\n\nThe first public burials were organized in 2005, 2006 and 2007 as part of a performance tour. People in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and Toronto had the opportunity to be buried alive in a real coffin for fifteen minutes. No cell phones, lamps or other devices were allowed inside the coffin. Participants had to sign a damage waiver.\nmonochrom provided a 45 minute lecture about the history of premature burial and offered a set of different funeral marches and songs about death as \"Death Jockeys\".\n\nIn 2010 monochrom updated the original concept and created the \"Six Feet Under Club\". Couples could volunteer to be buried together in a casket beneath the ground. In a press release they explained that the space they occupy is \"extremely private and intimate\". The coffin \"is a reminder of the social norm of exclusive pair bonding 'till death do us part'.\" However, this intimate scene was corrupted by the presence of a night vision webcam which projects the scene on to an outside wall. The scenario kept the intimacy of a sexual moment intact while moving the private act into public space. monochrom's performance can be seen as an absurd parody of pornographic cinema or an examination of the high value placed on sexual privacy.\n\nThe performance was repeated at the Viennese club \"Schwelle 7\" in 2013 and 2014.\n\nSince 2011 monochrom offers a constant burial site at \"VSL Lindabrunn\" in Lower Austria.\n\n"}

BHAC was founded by Glenn Jordan as a non-profiting organisation with the aim to involve the local people of Butetown to help promote the area's history of the docklands.\n\nBHAC was located in the heart of Butetown (previously known as Tiger Bay), one of the UK's oldest multi-racial communities. The community centre started off as a place for weekly oral history classes and was the initiative of African-American academic, Glenn Jordan, who arrived in Cardiff during the 1980s and decided to stay, hoping to allow the Tiger Bay residents a chance to track the 150-year history of Cardiff Bay. Jordan and BHAC have aimed to create an archive of local people's memories, documents and photographs. The Centre emerged in 1988 with the help of a small handful of local residents, meeting at the Butetown Community Centre where they learnt interview techniques and recording methods. By 2000 the Centre had recorded several hundred hours of oral history, published several books and was running cultural-political and educational activities for local adults.By 2005 the centre had collected 450 hours of oral history and 3,000 photographs. BHAC's collection also includes paintings, photographs and sculptures by local artists. It occupied a building in the centre of Butetown, which it moved into in 1996 with the help of European funding.\n\nThe Centre was featured in a 2001 report, \"Creative Regeneration: Lessons from 10 Community Arts Projects\", by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\n\nVisual and performing arts have become increasingly important dimensions of BHAC's work. The centre now runs the Diversity Arts Wales (DAW) programme – an initiative, funded by the Arts Council of Wales, that supports the professional development of artists from ethnic minority backgrounds. DAW also encourages artists, whatever their background, to engage in multicultural and intercultural work.\n\nBHAC has been funded by the Home Office, Welsh Assembly, Arts Council for Wales, Cardiff Council and various foundations. However the BHAC now relies largely on volunteer staff and income from the museum shop.\n\nOne of the main areas within the BHAC is the archive which is the result of over 25 years of collecting history connected to the multicultural area of Cardiff Bay. By 2005 BHAC had collected 3000 photographs and 500 hours of oral history. The centre’s collection also includes paintings, videos, official documentation and sculptures by local artists. The current priority of the BHAC is to make the archive fully accessible online and to add to the collection, to expand their multimedia displays and educational materials to allow for more exhibitions. \n\nSince 2003, Butetown History and Arts Centre have held nineteen exhibitions, which have focused on bringing awareness of Wales as a culturally and ethnically diverse nation. Some of the pieces have even been featured on BBC’s ‘Your Paintings’.\n\nWithin the Butetown History and Arts Centre, there have been a number of books published over the years. All of the books held in the BHAC are based around Cardiff Bay and they all, in one way or another, focus upon the Bay's history such as; 'Butetown & Cardiff Docks' compiled by Brian Lee and Butetown History & Arts Centre.\n\nIn May 2016 the centre's committee announced they had no alternative but to close BHAC, because of a lack of new funding. They were looking for a storage facility to preserve their archive. The centre is reported as closed in December 2017.\n"}

It is a federally recognized historic district since 1985 and became a City of Atlanta Landmark District in 2006. Since 2000, the area has experienced an influx of residents and new businesses. The area, which is made up predominantly of Walker, Nelson and Peters Streets is home to a growing number of small art galleries, restaurants, coffee shops, and loft residences. Less than a mile from the historically black colleges and universities that make up the Atlanta University Center Consortium and from the expansive downtown campus of Georgia State University, the area also offers local shopping as well as spa services, like iwi Fresh. Other notable area eateries include No Mas! Cantina, a spacious Mexican-themed restaurant, bar and fine home furnishings establishment, often used as a point of reference. Castleberry Hill residents gather at local watering holes, such as Elliott Street Pub and Bottle Rocket.\n\nThe area in the city limits of Atlanta known today as Castleberry Hill was originally part of the renegade Snake Nation community that functioned during the 1850s. According to an article from Atlanta Magazine, Castleberry Hill was, by the mid-nineteenth century, a red-light district filled with prostitutes, gambling, and cockfighting. By the time the Civil War began, however, this area was in the process of industrialization. Items such as terra cotta and other building materials were produced then in Atlanta factories. Additionally, Castleberry Hill then contained cotton warehousing and grocers. One of those grocers was Daniel Castleberry, for whom the area was named. Daniel Castleberry, however, is believed to have been an established businessman in the area as a result of his winning the land in 1821 in a Georgia land lottery. By the early 1990s, the area had fallen on hard times, serving as the backdrop for dystopic films such as Freejack and Kalifornia. Loft conversions began in the 1980s, and by 1992, there were 120 lofts with 150 residents. The saw another influx of development.

{"id": "33453685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33453685", "title": "Choreopoem", "text": "Choreopoem\n\nA choreopoem is a form of dramatic expression that combines poetry, dance, music, and song. The term was first coined in 1975 by American writer Ntozake Shange in a description of her work, \"for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf\". Shange's attempt to depart from traditional western poetry and storytelling resulted in a new art form that doesn't contain specific plot elements or characters, but instead focuses on creating an emotional response from the audience. In Shange’s work, nontraditional spelling and vernacular are aspects of this genre that differ from traditional American literature. She emphasizes the importance of movement and nonverbal communication throughout the choreopoem so that it is able to function as a theatrical piece rather than being limited to poetry or dance.\n\nThe \"XX Chromosome Genome Project\" by S. Ann Johnson is a modern example of a choreopoem. It combines poetry, song and dance to illuminate the commonalities and differences between women of various cultures. In this choreopoem, Johnson writes about eight women in search of self-acceptance and liberation. These colorfully dressed women, who are named after flavors of foods, represent international cultures around the world through music, spoken word, and movement.\n\nInfluenced by women from the Black Arts Movement, based on Black Nationalism that encouraged black separatism, and the feminist arts movement, which focused on using art of various mediums as acts against war and in favor of civil and homosexual rights, Shange wanted to create a genre that was interdisciplinary and allowed for performers to use all senses of the body. Working closely with choreographer Dianne McIntyre, Shange was able to confront her childhood experiences through movement. McIntyre helped to choreograph \"for colored girls\" with Shange, as they wanted to convey awareness and community through dance. The inclusion of movement and dance in a choreopoem was as essential to her as the poetry aspect. Shange described that \"with dance (she) discovered (her) body more intimately than (she) had imagined possible.\" Shange’s emphasis on dance was a result of her experience with African dance and movement classes as well as her exposure to Santeria through dance and music as it relates to African dance.\n\nIn her choreopoems, Shange tends to focus on “self-awareness, self-definition, and solidarity”.\nMany choreopoems were performed with African-American cultural inspiration but were not focused on black separatism. These choreopoems were focused upon teaching the culture and history of Africans and Americans of African descent to all comers interested in learning.\nSeattle's Choreopoets held this philosophy. Members of the Choreopoets included Mary Stone Hanley who founded Choreopoets along with Gilda Sheppard. Michael Hureaux, an early board member of Red Sky Poetry Theatre, was an active part of Choreopoets. Other Choreopoets were Gina Miller, Sabria Rahima, Karen Simms, Giovanna Westward, Akele Ayanna, Reyburn Brown, and Calvalita Browning.\n\n\n\n"}

collective work, harmonizes the contributions, edits, publishes and discloses the work.\nThe \"maître\" decides on the theme, treatment and spirit of the work, assembles the contributions, harmonizes it and publishes the overall work. \nThe contributors have not significantly cooperated in creating the overall work, but have each worked independently under the direction of the \"maître\".\nIt does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.\n\nIn a 1999 dispute over the rights of the daily newspaper Le Progrès to publish articles online, the lower court refused to designate Le Progrès a collective work, but the Court of Appeal ruled that it was a collective work by virtue of assembling a newspaper in several editions, selecting and presenting the contributions at the sole discretion of the owner, Groupe Progrès.\nBy working under the direction of the owner, the contributors lose their creative independence, however important their contributions are to the collective work.\n\nA collective work is unusual in French law in that a juristic person may be the initial owner of a work without having to show evidence that the copyright was assigned.\nAs a rule, French courts do not recognise that an employee has transferred their rights to an employer unless there is evidence of such a transfer in the form of an agreement.\nA collective work is an exception.\nThe \"maître\" takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the \"maître\" rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the \"maître\" directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.\n\nThe 1885 Berne Convention stated that journalists owned their work, but this depends on whether a newspaper is seen as a collection of works or as a collective work.\nIn France, journalists own their work in either case.\nArticle L121-8 states that whether or not a newspaper or periodical is considered to be a collective work the journalists retain the rights to exploit their contributions.\nThe promoter is the sole owner of the rights in the collective work as a whole, but the contributors have author rights in their own contributions.\nCase law has determined that the investor's initial right of property is limited to the first commercial release of the collective work.\nThe contributors can then commercialize their contributions separately as long as this does not adversely affect commercialization of the collective work as a whole.\nThe contributors to a newspaper thus have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.\n\nMoral rights are seen as personality rights in French law, attached to the personality of the author and inalienable.\nThey are retained by the author even when the patrimonial rights are sold.\nThe Intellectual Property Code says the \"maître\" has the author's rights, and does not distinguish between moral and economic rights.\nHowever, only a natural person can be an author, and moral rights cannot be alienated from the author, giving rise to uncertainty over whether the \"maître\" could claim any moral rights in the collective work.\nHowever, in a 22 March 2012 decision the French Supreme Court (\"Cour de cassation\") reversed the decision of a lower court and stated that \"the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives\".\nThe owner of the collective work may not be a natural person, so they are not an author in the strict sense, but they own the moral rights as well as the economic rights, and may therefore prohibit violations of their moral rights such as distortion of the collective work.\n\nEach contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution, and may enforce this right against third parties or against the \"maître\" if they make unauthorized changes to the contribution. \nDespite this, the \"maître\" may modify the contributions as far as is needed to harmonize them with the collective work as a whole.\nThe moral right of the contributor is limited by the fusion of their contribution with those of the other co-authors.\n\nThe rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.\nWhen a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.\nPublication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.\nElectronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.\nHowever, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.\n\nAs an example of digital reproduction of the full work, since 2005 the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) has been digitizing editions of daily and weekly periodicals that were published before 1943. Some of this has been through agreements with the publishers \"L’Ouest-Éclair\" and \"Le Monde diplomatique\". \nWhere the BnF does not have such an agreement, the BnF considers the newspaper to be a collective work that entered the public domain 70 years after publication.\nSome of these digitized journals may contain contributions for which the individual author's rights have not expired.\nThus the cover of the digitized \"\" of 2 December 1915 has an illustration by the artist , who died in 1962 and whose rights would not expire until 2033.\n\nFrance was the first country to introduce an online newspaper, with the Minitel service in the 1980s.\nToday the online and print versions of newspaper are typically run by different departments and have different appearance, with the online versions updated frequently and providing video boxes and interactive features. Some newspapers are online only.\nA case between the French national union of journalists and \"Le Figaro\" newspaper was heard on 14 April 1999 by the Court of First Instance in Paris.\n\"Le Figaro\" had created a website where articles by the journalists could be consulted online.\nThe court ruled that although the printed newspaper was a collective work, the rights of the journalists concerning their articles had been infringed.\n\"Le Figaro\" only had the right to publish the articles in the printed newspaper, and the website would be considered another newspaper or magazine.\n\nOn 9 December 1999 the Lyon Court of Appeal ruled similarly that the daily newspaper \"Le Progrès\" was guilty of forgery for having published its journalists' articles on the internet.\nAlthough the newspaper was a collective work, the right of the owner to reproduction was limited to the paper edition, and the website could not be seen as an extension of that edition.\nA similar judgement was issued by the Court of Cassation on 3 July 2013 in a case concerning the newspaper \"L'Union\".\nThe court said that whether or not that newspaper was a collective work, which had not been proven, the consent of a contributor was required before his contributions could be reproduced on an Internet site and reproduced in another newspaper.\n\nNewspapers have responded by signing agreements with journalist's unions that took different approaches to cover online publication of articles.\n\"Les Derniéres Nouvelles d'Alsace\" paid journalists for online use. \n\"Le Monde\" compensated journalists for ceding their copyright. \n\"Les Échos\" made an agreement that treated the print and online versions as one.\n\n"}

Commercial art uses a variety of platforms (magazines, websites, apps, television, etc.) for viewers with the intent of promoting sale and interest of products, services, and ideas. It relies on the iconic image (pictorial representations that are recognized easily to members of a culture) to enhance recall and favorable recognition for a product or service. An example of a product could be a magazine ad promoting a new soda through complimentary colors, a catchy message, and appealing illustrative features. Another example could be promoting the prevention of global warming by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving in an eye catching poster. It communicates something specific to an audience.\n\nPeople can obtain training, certifications, and degrees that incorporate commercial arts in many exercises, activities, and programs.\n\nCommercial artists have the ability to organize information and knowledge of fine arts, visualization and media in a way to reach an audience's attention. Some of these skills may include the following:\n\n\nCommercial art can include many genres of art and categories of art technique, including:\n\n\nCommercial art is art that is created for commercial purposes to promote services, products, and ideas to viewers. In the process of creating commercial art, an audience is taken into consideration when designing and/or forming the goods that are being advertised/promoted. An example of this can be seen in the recognized works of American painter and consumer ad designer, Andy Warhol. Using Campbell's soup and Coca-Cola bottles as everyday products of consumers, he recreated a visually stimulating design through pop art that advertises the products through consumption habits of consumers. Consumerism was present when pop art was popular. Pop art could contain mass cultural objects and/or celebrities (popular culture and mass media) to endorse markets and goods.\n"}
{"id": "411512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411512", "title": "Cymatics", "text": "Cymatics\n\nCymatics, from , meaning \"wave\", is a subset of modal vibrational phenomena. The term was coined by Hans Jenny (1904-1972), a Swiss follower of the philosophical school known as anthroposophy. Typically the surface of a plate, diaphragm or membrane is vibrated, and regions of maximum and minimum displacement are made visible in a thin coating of particles, paste or liquid. Different patterns emerge in the excitatory medium depending on the geometry of the plate and the driving frequency.\n\nThe apparatus employed can be simple, such as the Chinese spouting bowl, in which copper handles are rubbed and cause the copper bottom elements to vibrate. Other examples include the Chladni Plate and the so-called cymascope.\n\nOn July 8, 1680, Robert Hooke was able to see the nodal patterns associated with the modes of vibration of glass plates. Hooke ran a bow along the edge of a glass plate covered with flour, and saw the nodal patterns emerge.\n\nThe German musician and physicist Ernst Chladni noticed in the eighteenth century that the modes of vibration of a membrane or a plate can be observed by sprinkling the vibrating surface with a fine dust (e.g., lycopodium powder, flour or fine sand). The powder moves due to the vibration and accumulates progressively in points of the surface corresponding to the sound vibration. The points form a pattern of lines, known as \"nodal lines of the vibration mode\". The normal modes of vibration, and the pattern of nodal lines associated with each of these, are completely determined, for a surface with homogeneous mechanical characteristics, from the geometric shape of the surface and by the way in which the surface is constrained.\n\nExperiments of this kind, similar to those carried out earlier by Galileo Galilei around 1630 and by Robert Hooke in 1680, were later perfected by Chladni, who introduced them systematically in 1787 in his book \"Entdeckungen über die Theorie des Klanges\" (Discoveries on the theory of sound). This provided an important contribution to the understanding of acoustic phenomena and the functioning of musical instruments. The figures thus obtained (with the aid of a violin bow that rubbed perpendicularly along the edge of smooth plates covered with fine sand) are still designated by the name of \"Chladni figures\".\n\nIn 1967 Hans Jenny, a follower of the anthroposophical doctrine of Rudolf Steiner, published two volumes entitled \"Kymatic\" (1967 and 1972), in which, repeating Chladni's experiments, he claimed the existence of a subtle power based on the normal, symmetrical images made by sound waves. Jenny put sand, dust and fluids on a metal plate connected to an oscillator which could produce a broad spectrum of frequencies. The sand or other substances were organized into different structures characterized by geometric shapes typical of the frequency of the vibration emitted by the oscillator. Modern analysts, including Michael Shermer, have termed anthroposophy's application in areas such as engineering, medicine, biology, and biodynamic agriculture as pseudoscience.\n\nAccording to Jenny, these structures, reminiscent of the mandala and other forms recurring in nature, would be a manifestation of an invisible force field of the vibrational energy that generated it. He was particularly impressed by an observation that imposing a vocalization in ancient Sanskrit of Om (regarded by Hindus and Buddhists as the sound of creation) the lycopodium powder formed a circle with a centre point, one of the ways in which Om had been represented. In fact, for a plate of circular shape, resting in the centre (or the border, or at least in a set of points with central symmetry), the nodal vibration modes all have central symmetry, so the observation of Jenny is entirely consistent with well known mathematical properties.\n\nFrom the physical-mathematical standpoint, the form of the nodal patterns is predetermined by the shape of the body set in vibration or, in the case of acoustic waves in a gas, the shape of the cavity in which the gas is contained. The sound wave, therefore, does not influence at all the shape of the vibrating body or the shape of the nodal patterns. The only thing that changes due to the vibration is the arrangement of the sand. The image formed by the sand, in turn, is influenced by the frequency spectrum of the vibration only because each vibration mode is characterized by a specific frequency. Therefore, the spectrum of the signal that excites the vibration determines which patterns are actually nodally displayed.\n\nThe physical phenomena involved in the formation of Chladni figures are best explained by classical physics.\n\nIt has been speculated by some researchers that application of ultrasound cause wounds to heal faster. However, other than select articles on the subject of low-amplitude high-frequency sound in bone fracture healing, there is no medical evidence of this phenomenon.\n\nDevices for displaying nodal images have influenced visual arts and contemporary music. Artist Björk created projections of cymatics patterns by using bass frequencies on tour for her album \"Biophilia\".\n\nHans Jenny's book on Chladni figures influenced Alvin Lucier and helped lead to Lucier's composition \"Queen of the South\". Jenny's work was also followed up by Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) founder György Kepes at MIT. His work in this area included an acoustically vibrated piece of sheet metal in which small holes had been drilled in a grid. Small flames of gas burned through these holes and thermodynamic patterns were made visible by this setup.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, visual artist Ron Rocco, who also developed his work at CAVS, employed mirrors mounted to tiny servo motors, driven by the audio signal of a synthesizer and amplified by a tube amp to reflect the beam of a laser. This created light patterns which corresponded to the audio's frequency and amplitude. Using this beam to generate video feedback and computers to process the feedback signal, Rocco created his \"Andro-media\" series of installations. Rocco later formed a collaboration with musician David Hykes, who practiced a form of Mongolian overtone chanting with The Harmonic Choir, to generate cymatic images from a pool of liquid mercury, which functioned as a liquid mirror to modulate the beam of a Helium-Neon laser from the sound thus generated. Photographs of this work can be found in the Ars Electronica catalog of 1987.\n\nContemporary German photographer and philosopher Alexander Lauterwasser has brought cymatics into the 21st century using finely crafted crystal oscillators to resonate steel plates covered with fine sand and to vibrate small samples of water in Petri dishes. His first book, \"Water Sound Images\", translated into English in 2006, features imagery of light reflecting off the surface of water set into motion by sound sources ranging from pure sine waves to music by Beethoven, Karlheinz Stockhausen, electroacoustic group \"Kymatik\" (who often record in ambisonic surround sound) and overtone singing. The resulting photographs of standing wave patterns are striking. Lauterwasser's book focused on creating detailed visual analogues of natural patterns ranging from the distribution of spots on a leopard to the geometric patterns found in plants and flowers, to the shapes of jellyfish and the intricate patterns found on the shell of a tortoise.\n\nComposer Stuart Mitchell and his father T.J. Mitchell claimed that Rosslyn Chapel's carvings supposedly contain references to cymatics patterns. In 2005 they created a work called \"The Rosslyn Motet\" realised by attempting to match various Chladni patterns to 13 geometric symbols carved onto the faces of cubes emanating from 14 arches.\n\nLike many claims in the cymatics community, the hypothesis that the carvings represent Chladni patterns is not supported by scientific or historical evidence. One of the problems is that many of the 'box' carvings are not original, having been replaced in the 19th century following damage by erosion.\n\nThe musical group, \"The Glitch Mob\" used cymatics to produce the music video \"Becoming Harmonious (ft. Metal Mother)\".\n\nInfluenced by Yantra diagrams and cymatics, artist and fashion designer Mandali Mendrilla created a sculpture dress called \"Kamadhenu (Wish Tree Dress III)\" the pattern of which is based \non a Yantra diagram depicting goddess Kamadhenu.\n\nAphex Twin suggests learning more about cymatics (linking to this article) in reference to 'master tuning of 440 Hz' in a conversation with synth-maker Tatsuya Takahashi.\n\nSince 2010, the art collective Analema Group creates participatory performances in which cymatic patterns are produced digitally in real-time by the audience.\n\nInspired by periodic and symmetrical patterns at the air-liquid interface created by sound vibration, P. Chen and coworkers developed a method to engineer diverse structures from microscale materials using liquid-based templates. This liquid-based template can be dynamically reconfigured by tuning vibration frequency and acceleration.\n\n"}
{"id": "52299493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52299493", "title": "Filibus", "text": "Filibus\n\nFilibus is a 1915 Italian silent adventure film directed by Mario Roncoroni and written by Giovanni Bertinetti. The film features Cristina Ruspoli as the title character, a mysterious sky pirate who makes daring heists with her technologically advanced airship. When an esteemed detective sets out on her trail, she begins an elaborate game of cat and mouse with him, slipping between various male and female identities to romance the detective's sister and stage a midnight theft of a pair of valuable diamonds.\n\n\"Filibus\" was released by Corona Film, a short-lived Turin-based studio operating on relatively low budgets and obscure casts. Though Italian reviews at the time of its release were negative, \"Filibus\" has been well received by later writers and film historians, who have highlighted the film's pioneering use of lesbian attraction, genderfluidity, and science fiction motifs, as well as its creative adaptation of stylistic elements from contemporary popular fiction. The film has been screened at numerous film festivals, and prints of it survive in archives in the Netherlands and in Italy.\n\nThe elegant Baroness Troixmonde has a secret identity: a mysterious burglar known to the world only as Filibus. In the wake of a bank robbery, a large cash reward is offered to anyone who can track Filibus down, and the renowned Detective Hardy puts himself on the case. The Baroness visits the notary in charge of the cash reward, and enters her own name in the competition. Encountering Hardy in the notary's office, she hatches a plan to baffle him: she tells him that she knows he himself is Filibus. Leaving the office in her chauffeured motorcar, she catches sight of Hardy's sister, Leonora.\n\nThe Baroness rides to a deserted country road, where she uses a heliograph to signal for Filibus's airship. Her crew of silent masked assistants lower a capsule, allowing Filibus to reach the airship, change into her burglary outfit, and fly to Hardy's residence. Hardy is being visited by his friend, the antiques collector Leo Sandy, who is unrequitedly in love with Leonora. Filibus, seizing a moment when Hardy is alone, uses the capsule to reach him and put him to sleep with a narcotic. She takes a print of Hardy's hand, which she will use to make a specially formed glove.\n\nIn disguise as a young nobleman, the Count de la Brive, Filibus stages the kidnapping and rescue of Leonora, leaving a print from the special glove on Leonora's clothing. The grateful Hardy invites the nobleman to stay with them for some days, and the Count begins courting Leonora. At a party at Leo Sandy's villa, they see a glass case containing his prize acquisition, an ancient Egyptian statue of a cat with priceless diamond eyes. When Sandy turns out the lights to show off the sparkling diamonds, the Count cuts a hole in the glass and deposits a note announcing that Filibus will steal the statue that night. Hardy attempts to search the guests, but to his consternation finds the glass piece in his own pocket, with fingerprints that match none of the guests' hands. At home, he realizes to his horror that the prints on both the glass piece and Leonora's outfit match his own handprint.\n\nHardy, resolved to trap Filibus, has Sandy plant a tiny camera in one eye of the statue and replace the real diamonds with artificial ones. That night, Filibus flies to Sandy's villa, kidnaps him, puts Hardy under the narcotic, and reaches the statue. Realizing Hardy's ruse, she locates the real diamonds, and stages the theft so that the hidden camera photographs the unconscious Hardy's face instead of hers.\n\nFilibus returns Hardy to his home, plants one of the real diamonds on his desk, and telephones the police to alert them of the theft and kidnapping. Hardy pleads his innocence, but when they examine the diamond and the hidden camera's picture, the police are led to believe that Hardy must indeed be Filibus. Hardy fears that this may indeed be the case, if he committed all of Filibus's heists while sleepwalking. Meanwhile, Leo Sandy, escaping Filibus's assistants and parachuting out of the dirigible, is picked up by a passing car and brought back to his villa. Learning of Hardy's arrest, Sandy rushes to his assistance and gives his evidence about his kidnapping. The relieved Hardy is allowed to go free and pursue the real Filibus, whose identity is still unknown.\n\nIntending to trap Filibus, he tells the press to announce that he has returned to his home. Filibus decides to use the narcotic to pin another crime on him, a robbery of the International Bank. This time Hardy is prepared, and seizes Filibus when she tries to administer the narcotic. Recognizing her as the Count de la Brive, he ties her up, locks her in his office, and goes to get the police. By the time he returns with policemen, Filibus has managed to get to a window, signal for her airship, and escape into the sky. A few days later, Sandy proposes to Leonora and is accepted. Just as Hardy is congratulating them, a letter falls from the sky—a letter from Filibus, telling him that they may meet again. High in the clouds, the Baroness Troixmonde, the mysterious sky pirate Filibus, laughs over her haul from the International Bank.\n\nIn 1914, the Turin-based film distributor Umberto Corona launched his own production company, Corona Film. The company produced 26 films before disbanding in 1918, mostly low-budget adventure films with little-known casts.\n\n\"Filibus\", one of the company's offerings for 1915, was directed by Mario Roncoroni, probably making his directorial debut. Roncoroni went on to direct \"La Nave\" (1921) in collaboration with Gabriele d'Annunzio, before moving to Spain, where his film career continued during the rest of the 1920s. The cinematography was by Luigi Fiorio. In the title role was the actress Cristina Ruspoli, who appeared in some thirty feature films between 1912 and 1916. Other players included Giovanni Spano, Mario Mariani, and Filippo Vallino.\n\nThe screenplay was by Giovanni Bertinetti, a writer connected to the Futurist movement among the Turin intelligentsia; in addition to film scenarios, he wrote science fiction and adventure stories for children, as well as self-help guides espousing the Futurist ideals of \"courage, audacity and revolt.\" In writing \"Filibus\", Bertinetti may have been especially influenced by a contemporary push to bring feminist ideals to Futurism, spearheaded by the French writer Valentine de Saint-Point's call for women to shake off oppression and torpor and to embrace the activity and independence associated with men.\n\n\"Filibus\" reflects the vogue in the 1910s for action-packed serial films featuring supervillains, such as Louis Feuillade's \"Fantômas\" (1913) and \"Judex\" (1916). Filibus's adventures in the film also recall other early action serials such as \"The Exploits of Elaine\" (1914), as well as the Arsène Lupin novels by Maurice Leblanc. (While the character of Filibus was likely inspired by the huge popularity of Fantômas, she strongly resembles Lupin in her enthusiasm for burgling and baffling for the thrill of it rather than for direct reward.) The film also recalls Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset's 1913 adventure film \"Protéa\", featuring a female spy who dons multiple disguises (albeit working under a male boss and in partnership with a male spy, unlike the autonomous Filibus).\n\nThe film, while based in motifs and themes already popular in adventure serials, uses them in unusual ways; for example, the film's plot pushes the genre to the limits of its stylistic conventions, verging on a style redolent of fantasy. The screenplay also includes numerous unusual ideas, including the central image of the female sky pirate in her innovative airship and the concept of a high-society protagonist with a Jekyll-and-Hyde-like double nature.\n\nIn particular, the character of Filibus was novel for adventure films in presenting an all-powerful female character in full control of her life and actions, able to move fluently between gendered identities as well as on and over the earth. These themes mirror a wave of gender identity exploration then occurring in Italian culture: for example, Francesca Bertini had recently played a male protagonist in \"Pierrot the Prodigal\", women's fashions at Futurist parties had begun to imitate styles for men, and a trickle of short action films with autonomous heroines had begun to appear. In real life, women's rights were highly limited in Italy, where married women were required to seek their husbands' permission to divorce, inherit property, or take out newspaper subscriptions, a situation dramatized in the popular \"diva\" films of the day.\n\n\"Filibus\" went further than its contemporaries not only in its title character's total independence and completely male-coded outfits, but also in its overarching critique of appearances. The American writer Monica Nolan notes that, with its multiple disguises, stealthy adventures, and psychological subterfuges, the film blurs the line between illusion and reality—so thoroughly, indeed, that \"it's anybody's guess whether [Filibus's] flirtation [with Leonora] is opportunistic, genuine, or a combination of the two.\"\n\n\"Filibus\" was reviewed by the censorship department of the Italian Ministry of the Interior on 25 March 1915, and was first screened in Rome on 14 April of that year. Early Italian reviews of the film were unfavorable; Monsù Travet, in the journal \"Film\", criticized \"Filibus\" for borrowing the plot point of the glove from \"Fantômas\", while G. Murè in \"L'Alba Cinematografica\" mocked the film's special effects, which he found childish. Early critics also reacted poorly to the plot as a whole, which they described as disjointed.\n\nThe film's conclusion suggests the possibility of a sequel, but Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary shortly after the film's release, taking a dramatic toll on the country's film industry and possibly leading to the disbanding of Corona Film in 1918. A print of \"Filibus\" survives at the EYE Film Institute Netherlands. A print is also held at the National Museum of Cinema in Turin.\n\nThe Cineteca di Bologna screened \"Filibus\" in 1997 as part of the Cinema Ritrovato festival, with its program calling the film \"an odd and funny forerunner of science-fiction movies.\" When the Dortmund Cologne International Women's Film Festival screened the film in 2013, its program described Filibus as \"probably one of the first lesbian characters in the history of film.\" A film festival program for the Yugoslav Film Archive, where \"Filibus\" was shown in 2015, also commented on its pioneering exploration of lesbianism in film, nominating Filibus as cinema's first lesbian \"bad girl\". In 2017, an EYE Film Institute restoration of the film was shown at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, with a score by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. In her program notes, Monica Nolan calls the film's protagonist \"one of a kind,\" adding: \"The special effects are endearingly low-budget, but who cares, when the action is fast-paced and just plain fun?\"\n\nIn a 2014 review of the film, Claude Rieffel praised the film's \"elegant and elusive woman pirate\" (\"élégante et insaisissable femme pirate\"), saying that Filibus's ability to pass between male and female identities made the character \"a champion of transgenderism before that term had been coined\" (\"championne avant l'heure du trans-genre\"). The performing arts writer Imogen Sara Smith, in an essay for \"Film Comment\" on the 2017 San Francisco festival, noted that the film \"zips along with crisp, deliciously absurd plotting and an effervescent lightness of touch,\" highlighting Ruspoli's \"gracefully androgynous and slyly gleeful\" performance as well as the plot's feminist themes. According to Smith, \"In a summer when \"Wonder Woman\" was hailed in some quarters as a milestone for women in cinema, the audience watching \"Filibus\" (1915) at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival could be forgiven for wondering sardonically if movies are finally catching up to where they were a century ago.\"\n\nIn his autobiographical work \"Balão cativo\" (1973), the Brazilian writer Pedro Nava describes \"Filibus\" as a film \"of major importance\" (\"da maior importância\"), praising the genderfluidity and mythic aspects of the title character, as well as the film's innovative use of science fiction themes.\n\n"}

An extensive fieldwork between 1953 and 1956 allowed the specialists to stratify the principal archaeological layers and reconstruct the architectural form and decoration of the medieval edifices bulk of which dates to the 12th century, the period when the first written mention of Geguti appears in the Georgian Chronicle. The earliest structure – a plain, one-room building with a large fireplace – dates back to the 8th/9th century. A principal part of the royal complex, commissioned by King George III of Georgia (r. 1156-1184), is a four-tier brick edifice built onto a three-metre high stone plinth, with its spacious, cruciform central hall surmounted by a dome 14 m in diameter resting on squinches. The entire building is walled and fortified with massive pillars. Westerly located additional structures and a palace church are of a later period, dating to the 13th/14th century. \n\nThe importance of the ruins of the Geguti palace is emphasized by its largely secular nature as most of the surviving monuments of medieval Georgian architecture are churches and monasteries. Records of medieval secular patronage (basically palaces with extensive decorative cycles) exist in the Georgian written sources, although only the shells of castles and the ruins of Geguti survive to testify the extent of the work produced. \n\nThe main complex of the Geguti royal palace was constructed during what is considered to be medieval Georgia's \"golden age\". Although the Georgian court was quite mobile, the establishment of a royal palace of this scale near the kingdom’s second capital and a major cultural center can be understood as the desire to establish a more settled, regal court, and royal bureaucracy which, indeed, reached its climax under the queen regnant Tamar (r. 1184-1213).\n\nThe Geguti palace frequently features in the Georgian annals as a beloved place of rest of the Georgian royalty. In the reign of Tamar, it was the place where her former husband, Prince Yuri Bogolyubsky, was crowned by the rebellious nobles during an abortive coup against the queen in 1191.\n\nIn 2016, a glass panel installation was erected, surrounding the ruins, to show visitors the complete original shape of the monument.\n\n"}

His work included paintings, drawings and linocuts, of which he was an early pioneer. An associate in his early career of many leading artists working in Britain of his period, including Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Mark Gertler, and members of the Vorticism movement, he ended his life relatively neglected.\n\nBrodzky was born in Kew, Melbourne in 1885 to the Australian journalist Maurice Brodzky (a Jewish immigrant to Australia from Poland), and his wife Flora, née Leon. In his youth he assisted his father in the production of the magazine \"Table Talk\".\n\nBrodzky studied initially at the National Gallery School in Melbourne. In 1904 his father was bankrupted after exposing corruption, and Horace moved with his family to San Francisco.\n\nIn 1908, Brodzky went to London where he studied during 1911 at the City and Guilds South London Technical Art School. He became an acquaintance and follower of Walter Sickert. Amongst his friends was Henri Gaudier-Brzeska who created in 1913 a portrait bust of Brodzky (now in the Tate Gallery, London), and whose biography he wrote in 1933. Brodzky is said to have been so engrossed in talk when he visited Gaudier-Brzeska's studio in the King's Road, that he missed the last bus to Herne Hill where he lived. Brodzky travelled to Italy with the poet John Gould Fletcher and this led to his first London exhibition, \"Paintings and Sketches of Italian and Sicilian Scenes\" (c. 1911), of which one painting was selected for the 1912 Venice Biennale. He was in fact the first Australian to be exhibited at the Biennale. In 1914 his work was exhibited along with that of other Jewish artists, including Mark Gertler and David Bomberg, in the Whitechapel Gallery. Brodzky became a member of The London Group. During this period he was a pioneer of the technique of linocut, in which medium he has been said to have \"excelled\". His early oils reveal the influence of both Gertler and Bomberg. Among his works of this period are portraits of Jacob Epstein and Jacob Kramer.\n\nIn 1915 Brodzky moved to New York, with an introduction to the art patron John Quinn. There he worked as a poster artist and an arts journalist, and in 1917 helped Quinn organize a New York exhibition of Vorticist artists. In 1919 he married Bertha Greenfield; they were to have three sons. In 1920 Egmont Arens published in New York a collection of 21 of Brodzky's linoprints. Brodzky also designed book jackets for writers including Eugene O'Neill and Theodore Dreiser, and painted a portrait of O'Neill.\n\nReturning to London in 1923 he became a professional artist. His work featured in the first-ever exhibition of linocuts, organized by Claude Flight at the Redfern Gallery in 1929. Initial success however withered in the 1930s, when his marriage broke up, and from then on he lived in financial straits. In 1935 James Laver published a study \"Forty Drawings by Horace Brodzky\". Laver described Brodzky's drawing technique as follows:Brodzky prefers the ordinary 'dip-in' steel nib, for this enables the hand, by varying its pressure on the paper, to broaden the line at will, or rather in obedience to the obscure subconscious or half-conscious promptings which guide the hand to its task. He makes no preliminary studies, draws no pencil outline, carefully rubbed out afterwards to give a false impression of spontaneity. There are no erasures or alterations. Each drawing is made 'au premier coup'. It is made very quickly, as a unity, and when finished the artist cannot remember at what point it was started. The drawing has been thrown on the paper, as it were, with a single gesture.\n\nIn 1946 Brodzky published his own study of the French-Romanian-Jewish artist Jules Pascin. In London he lived for most of the rest of his life in the Kilburn and Willesden areas, continuing to produce paintings, drawings and linocuts. He supported himself by teaching and painting stage-decor and from 1948 to 1962 he was art-editor of the \"Antique Dealer and Collector's Guide\", (founded by his brother Adrian).\n\nIn 1963, Brodzky wrote to the collector Ruth Borchard, who had just purchased from him a self-portrait for the sum of 12 guineas (₤12.60):\nSince 1911 I have been connected with the London art world & have exhibited at all important exhibitions…and have worked for modern art... For a long time I have sold none of my work & have had to rely on selling items by other artists that I have collected…This letter is not an angry complaint but just the plain facts that I thought you might like to know.\n\nIn 1965 80th anniversary exhibitions were organized for Brodzky at the Ben Uri Gallery and the Oxford Union Cellars. In 1967 some of his early linocuts were reissued in London in a signed edition of 60 prints. Brodzky died in Kilburn in 1969, when his estate was valued for probate at £7977. Exhibitions of Brodzky's work were held in the Jewish Museum of Australia (1988) and at the Boundary Gallery, London (1989).\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

Daudet originally began making these notes for a projected book, but none of the material was published in his lifetime. He planned to use the title \"La Doulou\", a Provençal word for pain. The collection was published in French in 1930 in a volume titled \"La Doulou (La Douleur): 1887–1895 et Le Trésor d'Arlatan: 1897\", and translated into English in 2002 by Julian Barnes. \n\nDaudet records observations, experiences, and aphorisms related to his intense suffering over the course of many years. He describes his symptoms in graphic detail and charts their progression. This begins with isolated attacks of agonising nerve pain, and eventually becomes a daily litany of pain and use of drugs like opium and chloral hydrate to fight it. He comments on the effect of his illness on family and friends, and on his outlook on life.\n\nHe describes the different physical treatments he underwent, including being suspended in the air, diets, and a variety of injections. He also details his observations of fellow sufferers of the disease and his interactions with them. In his later years, he frequently spent time at sanitariums, becoming a celebrity among the other patients. He describes his time at these sanitariums in detail. Daudet stopped making these notes a few years before his death.\n\nDaudet originally planned to use his notes on his sufferings to make either a novel or an autobiography. After discussing the projected work with fellow writer Edmond de Goncourt, Goncourt predicted the work would be superb because Daudet would be writing from intense personal experience. Although the book was never realized, translator Julian Barnes agrees with Goncourt's prediction in relation to the collection in its current form. He believes the notes format is appropriate and fitting for the subject because of its implication of passing time and its absence of disguise.\n\nAccording to critic Richard Eder, this work is worthy of lasting recognition. Daudet uses wit to probe a dark and distressing subject, providing the reader with powerful images. Daudet surprisingly responds to his pain often with humor and spirit, and even comments mockingly on his disease and its symptoms at times. Some of the most poignant moments in the book are Daudet's expressions of sympathy for his fellow sufferers.\n"}
{"id": "1679152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1679152", "title": "Insignificance (film)", "text": "Insignificance (film)\n\nInsignificance is a 1985 British comedy-drama film directed by Nicolas Roeg, produced by Jeremy Thomas and Alexander Stuart, and adapted by Terry Johnson from his play of the same name. The film is set in 1954, with most of the action taking place in a hotel room in New York City. The action revolves around the interplay of four characters who represent iconic figures of the era - Marilyn Monroe, Joseph McCarthy, Joe DiMaggio, and Albert Einstein - called The Actress, The Senator, The Ballplayer, and The Professor, respectively.\n\nThe film opens on a crowded New York City street where people have gathered to watch a film crew shoot a sequence which becomes recognisable as the iconic shot of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress standing on a grate while the rush of wind caused by a huge fan to imitate the subway going by below blows her skirt up around her waist. The Actress' husband, The Ballplayer, watches with obvious discomfort as she is ogled. The Actress, rather than join him afterwards, disappears in a taxi, leaving him behind. She stops at a store and picks up a variety of toys, flashlights, and balloons.\n\nThe Professor, recognisable as Albert Einstein, is in his hotel room, working on pages of mathematical calculations. He is interrupted by The Senator, who has come to alternately coax and threaten him into appearing before a committee to investigate his activities and answer the famous question, \"Are you now or have you ever been...?\" The Senator is recognisable as Joe McCarthy. The Professor refuses and says he will never appear. The Senator leaves, saying he'll be back to get him at 8 a.m. the following morning.\n\nThe Actress appears at the door of the Professor's hotel room, and he invites her in. They talk about fame, being chased, and the stars. She does a lively demonstration of the Theory of Relativity using the toys and flashlights and balloons. She tells The Professor he is at the top of her list of people she'd like to sleep with. They decide to go to bed, but are interrupted by the arrival of The Ballplayer, who has tracked her to the hotel. The Professor leaves them alone and goes to find another room, meeting a Cherokee elevator man with whom he speaks. The Actress and The Ballplayer talk about their marriage; The Actress tells her husband she believes she is pregnant, but he has fallen asleep.\n\nThe following morning The Senator arrives at The Professor's room to find him gone, but The Actress naked and alone in his bed. The Senator mistakes her for a call girl and threatens to use her to expose and embarrass The Professor, then punches her hard in the abdomen, causing her to collapse in pain. The Professor returns while The Senator is collecting all of the hundreds of pages of The Professor's work to take away with him. The Professor grabs the papers and throws them out of the windows, while The Actress writhes in agony on the bed. The Senator leaves, defeated in his purpose. The Ballplayer returns and talks about his fame in the baseball world, and confides in him about his marital problems while The Actress is in the bathroom, possibly suffering a miscarriage. She finally announces to him that their marriage is over, and he leaves.\n\nThe Actress becomes impatient with The Professor, sensing that he is hiding something. He is sitting on the bed with his watch, which has stopped at 8.15, in one hand, and the alarm clock in the other as the hour approaches 8.15 (the time that \"Little Boy\" was dropped on Hiroshima). He confesses his terrible feelings of guilt about the event, and she reassures him. Right at 8.15 a.m. as she is leaving, he has a vision of the destruction of the room, Hiroshima, and the world. The Actress's skirt swirls in flames as she burns in his vision. Then the film reverses and the world is restored to order as she smiles and leaves.\n\n\n\"Insignificance\" was originally a play, written by Terry Johnson and performed at the Royal Court in 1982, with Judy Davis as The Actress. The seed for Johnson's play was his having read that an autographed photograph of Einstein was found amongst Marilyn Monroe's possessions upon her death. The idea of them meeting piqued his interest, and he wrote what became a meditation on the nature of fame. \"It was always meant to be a play about the era, about fame...what these people stood for, the fact that this was different from what they are.\" He was interested in exploring the differences between who these people really were, as opposed to what qualities others assumed or imbued them with. Johnson acknowledges that there are \"lots of little cheats\" in the play, mostly to do with exactly where and when \"The Seven Year Itch\" was filmed, and the timing of Marilyn's marriage to Joe DiMaggio. Einstein was also never called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, \"but,\" he said, \"had it gone on longer, I can see that as having been a big possibility. He was there in spirit, as it were.\"\n\nRoeg saw the play and felt it \"might be a tool to use. An incident came up in my own life and I thought, 'Good God, nobody knows a damn thing about anyone.' That was the premise that started me thinking about the piece again.\" Roeg notes that \"Insignificance\" is usually talked about as a meeting between Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein, but what moved him was the pain of the problems between The Actress and The Ballplayer, who are married but seem to know nothing about each other. \"Insignificance\" would become his first film adapted from a play.\n\nRoeg asked Johnson to work on the screenplay, which at first meant simply reducing the play to approximately 90 minutes as opposed to two hours, but then Roeg began making suggestions which would expand the screenplay and include flashbacks to the characters' histories, and flash-forwards of imagination. His suggestions inspired Johnson to focus on a deeper development of the characters, while Roeg himself began to imagine how the film could open the play spatially as well as laterally. \"He opened it backwards,\" Johnson said.\n\nAll of the interiors for \"Insignificance\" were shot at Lee Studios in Wembley, with exteriors shot in New York City. Mise-en-scène was created through the use of Pablo Picasso's post-cubism painting \"Woman and Child on the Seashore\" which underscores The Actress' pain about her childlessness, while the fractured structure of the narrative was mirrored in the splintered image of Theresa Russell used as a nude calendar shot of The Actress. Created by photographer-collagist David Hockney, the image is, according to film critic Chuck Stephens, \"a pinup in a hundred pieces, a centerfold sent through a centrifuge...\" and is a reflection of The Actress. With \"her much-exposed and famously exploited psyche already splintered into jagged, mingled shards of kittenish innocence, movie business cunning, overwhelming erotic appeal, and abject inner terror, Monroe was post-cubism's quintessential glittering star...perfectly pieced together and seen prismatically all at once...\" The image is also a metaphor for Roeg's non-linear filmmaking, Stephens notes that \"for a cine-cubist like Roeg, two entirely disparate spatial and temporal dimensions are never more than a splice apart, and in \"Insignificance\", the past is always present, and never goes away.\"\n\n\"Insignificance\" received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release, and currently has a 67% score at Rotten Tomatoes The film has been written about extensively in the years since it was first seen. Film4's movie critic wrote: \"Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson's stage play to the screen. Throughout, tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards (ka-boom!) draw unexpected connections between time, place and circumstance, with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time's passing — but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time; each moment co-existing. As evinced by his back catalogue, it's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity – see \"Don't Look Now\" in particular. Here, 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip-feeds into the 1980s, a period in which another 'Actor' has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States.\"\n\nFrederic and Mary Ann Brussat write: \"\"Insignificance\" shines with some incandescent moments of acting bravado delivered by Theresa Russell, Tony Curtis, and Gary Busey. As a weird meditation on sex, power, knowledge, and fame, this is a four-star treat for those who savor exotic movie fare...Nicolas Roeg (\"Don't Look Now\", \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\") draws out the inner psychological nuances of the drama and delivers the philosophical freight in Terry Johnson's screenplay.\"\n\nThe film was entered into the 1985 Cannes Film Festival where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or and won the Technical Grand Prize.\n\nThe soundtrack to the film was released on the British label ZTT Records. It featured a diverse selection of professional artists and composers including movie composer Hans Zimmer, Glenn Gregory, Claudia Brücken, Stanley Myers, Midge Ure (occasional guitar), Roy Orbison. In addition, Gil Evans and his orchestra contributed with an interpretation of Mozart's \"Jupiter Symphony\", and \"America\" by Death Comet Crew was also included.\n\nThe title of the film was used by musician Jim O'Rourke for his album \"Insignificance\".\n\nThe film is also featured in Big Audio Dynamite's music video for \"E=MC2\" as clips are shown throughout the video and are also referenced throughout the song.\n\n\"Insignificance\" was released on VHS in 1985, on Laserdisc a few years later, and on DVD in 2003. In June 2011, the Criterion Collection released a fully restored and re-mastered DVD and Blu-ray edition, containing interviews with Nicolas Roeg, Terry Johnson, long-time Roeg editor Tony Lawson, and the short film, \"Making 'Insignificance'\". The release also contains a booklet with excerpts from the August 1985 Roeg-Johnson interview called \"Relatively Speaking\" in the 1985 Monthly Film Bulletin, and an essay by film critic Chuck Stephens.\n\n"}

{"id": "296001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296001", "title": "Justice as Fairness", "text": "Justice as Fairness\n\n\"Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical\" is an essay by John Rawls, published in 1985. In it he describes his conception of justice. It comprises two main principles of liberty and equality; the second is subdivided into Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle.\n\nRawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prioritising in the order of the Liberty Principle, Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice—'Justice as Fairness'—and not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the \"least advantaged\" are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten.\n\nRawls presented the theory in the famous \"A Theory of Justice\", subsequently revising it in \"Political Liberalism\".\n\nThe first and most important principle states that every individual has an equal right to basic liberties, Rawls claiming \"that certain rights and freedoms are more important or 'basic' than others\". For example, Freeman argues, Rawls believes that \"personal property\" – personal belongings, a home – constitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property is not. As basic liberties, these rights are inalienable: no government can amend, infringe or remove such rights from individuals. Thomas Mertens says Rawls contends that principles for a society are just when chosen by representative citizens placed within \"fair\" conditions.\n\nIn \"A Theory of Justice\", Rawls articulates the Liberty Principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others; he later amended this in \"Political Liberalism\", stating instead that \"each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties\".\n\nThe Equality Principle is the component of Justice as Fairness establishing distributive justice. Rawls awards the Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle lexical priority over the Difference Principle: a society cannot arrange inequalities to maximize the share of the least advantaged whilst not allowing access to certain offices or positions.\n\nThis principle maintains that \"offices and positions\" should be open to any individual, regardless of his or her social background, ethnicity or sex. It is stronger than 'Formal Equality of Opportunity' in that Rawls argues that an individual should not only have the \"right\" to opportunities, but should have an \"effective\" equal chance as another of similar natural ability.\n\nThe Difference Principle regulates inequalities: it only permits inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as trickle-down economics; Rawls' argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth \"diffuses up\". By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport).\n\nRawls justifies the Difference Principle on the basis that, since Fair Equality of Opportunity has lexical priority, the Just choice from Pareto optimal scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off.\n\nA key component of Rawls' argument is his claim that his Principles of Justice would be chosen by parties in the original position. This is a thought experiment in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a veil of ignorance, which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially, their conception of The Good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally.\n\n"}

Once on set, the key grip coordinates with the electric and camera departments alongside the director of photography to control lighting and camera movement and setup. As a supervisor, the key grip directs the crew of grips, many with specialized skills such as dolly grips, crane operators, or special equipment operators. The key grip is sometimes credited as the \"first company grip.\"\n\nThe key grip is frequently asked to be the safety monitor of the film set. Changes in the film and television worlds have created lasting change in crew responsibilities. Any union production crews working under the \"Hollywood\" umbrella are required to take Occupational Safety and Health Administration-style certified courses in safety. The first AD (first assistant director) is responsible for the safe operation of the set. The key grip no longer has that distinction in newer Hollywood policy.\n\nIn Great Britain the \"grips\" are part of the camera department exclusively and are not generally responsible for regular grip duties as they are in the United States. In Australia and New Zealand the key grip generally owns the grip equipment, often consisting of dollies, track, cranes, camera cars, and insert trailers.\n"}

It curves at an obtuse angle, and its lower extremity is inserted into the back of the gold lion head, and fixed with four gold rivets. The vase is not properly a rhyton, since no secondary orifice is present. A hole on the upper left canine of the lion is very small for effective pouring: it seems accidental. The ferocious animal is shown with open mouth, prominent canines and protruding tongue, in a grimace shared by animals and monsters of the Archaic Greek art. The wrinkled skin on both sides of the muzzle with its triangular nostrils are rendered as continuous lines and dots. Similar dots run along the upper half of the mouth contour, while the lower half shows a chased pattern of minuscule ovals. Punched circles and hatching appear in the mouth's interior. The eyes are almond-shaped, and two low, circular protuberances on the forehead are covered with hatching. The semicircular ears have three radial lines in their interior. The mane is rendered as a plastic collar of triangular section. Its front and back sides are covered with finely chiseled, stylized hair locks.\n\nAmong the various types of rhyta and horns, the one with an animal head termination on a long horn seems the least popular in the Near and Middle Eastern cultural domains. The horns are usually provided with an animal forepart, while the simple heads of rather large dimensions are typically combined with a straight or flaring calyx-like neck. \n\nManassero, who collected the evidence in all materials and reviewed the earlier literature, counts four metal exemplars of the Archaic period, of which only two are made of silver, or silver and gold, both with a lion head finial. \n\nThe type enjoys a revival in Scythia during the Classical period, often with animal heads of precious metal mounted on real horns; it continues in a pipe-like version well into the Hellenistic times. \n\n<br>\nThe bronze lion heads are large, strongly stylized, with an almost flat muzzle; they have little in common with the VBC gold head. They probably come from Luristan and are undeniably much earlier than our exemplar. \nSeveral silver exemplars entered the art market, and later some of them even museum collections, (Louvre, Metropolitan Museum, Miho Museum) without any documentation, since they come from illicit digging, reportedly \"from a cave cache\", which became known as the \"Western Cave\", in Kal-e Makarekh (or Kalmakarra), western Iran.\n\nThe silver rhyta have their lion head finials made of gold and soldered onto the silver horn. All horns are undecorated with very slight tapering towards the finial. All lion heads are quite large (up to three times as big as the VBC exemplar), and show the same stylistic features, chiselled details, and rings on the point of their junction with the horn. None of them is a rhyton stricto sensu, since they are not supplied with a secondary orifice. Consequently, they are supposed to have being made in the same pre-Achaemenid western Iranian workshop, possibly in the second half of the 7th century BC.\n\n"}

It saw the final phase of the baroque style as well as the birth of French neoclassicism. The style was a reaction against the elaborate ornament of the preceding baroque period. It was inspired in part by the discoveries of ancient Roman paintings, sculpture and architecture in Herculaneum and Pompeii. Its features included the straight column, the simplicity of the post-and-lintel, the architrave of the Greek temple. It also expressed the Rousseau-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.\n\nNotable architects of the period included Victor Louis (1731-1811) who completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780), The Odeon Theater in Paris (1779-1782) was built by Marie-Joseph Peyre (1730-1785) and Charles de Wailly (1729-1798). François-Joseph Bélanger completed the Chateau de Bagatelle in just sixty-three days to win a bet for its builder, the King's brother. Another period landmark was the belvedere of the Petit Trianon, built by Rchard Mique. The most characteristic building of the late Louis XVI residential style is the Hôtel de Salm in Paris (Now the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur, built by Pierre Rousseau in 1751-83.\n\nSuperbly crafted desks and cabinets were created for the Palace of Versailles and other royal residences by cabinetmakers Jean-Henri Riesener and David Roentgen, using inlays of fine woods, particularly mahogany, decorated with gilded bronze and mother of pearl. Equally fine sets of chairs and tables were made by Jean-Henri Riesener and Georges Jacob.\n\nThe Royal tapestry works of Gobelins, Aubusson and Beauvais Tapestry continued to make large tapestries, but an increasing part of their business was the manufacture of upholstery for the new sets of chairs, sofas and other furnishings for the royal residences and nobility. Wallpaper also became an important part of interior design, thanks to new processes developed by Reveillon.\n\nThe Lous XVI style was a reaction to and transition the French Baroque style, which had dominated French architecture, decoration and art since the mid-17th century, and partly from a desire to establish a new \"Beau idéal\", or ideal of beauty, based on the purity and grandeur of the art of the Ancient Romans and Greeks. In 1754 The French engraver, painter and art critic Charles-Nicolas Cochin denounced the curves and undulations of the predominant rocaille style: \"Don't torture without reason those things which could be straight, and come back to the good sense which is the beginning of good taste.\"\n\nLouis XVI himself showed little enthusiasm for art or architecture. He left the management of these to Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, the Count of Angiviller, who was made Director General of Buildings, Gardens, Arts, Academies and Royal Manufactories. Angeviller, for financial reasons, postponed a grand enlargement of the Palace of Versailles, but completed the new Château de Compiègne (1751–83), begun by Louis XV, and decorated it from 1782 to 1786. The King's principal architectural addition to Versailles was the new library on the first floor (begun 1774). He was much more generous to Queen Marie-Antoinette; she redecorated the Grand Apartments of the Queen at Versailles in 1785, and carried out important works on her apartments at the Palace of Fontainebleau and Compiegne, as well as new apartments in the Tuileries Palace. The King also gave the Queen the Petit Trianon at Versailles, and in 1785 bought a new chateau for her at St. Cloud.\n\nClassicism, based Roman and Greek models had been used in French architecture since the time of Louis XIV; he rejected a plan by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for a baroque facade of the Louvre, and chose instead a classical facade with a colonnade and pediment. The architects of Louis XIV, Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Jacques Lemercier, turned away from the gothic and renaissance style and used a baroque version of the Roman dome on the new churches at Val-de-Grace and Les Invalides. Louis XV and his chief architects, Jacques Ange Gabriel and Jacques-Germain Soufflot continued the style of architecture based upon symmetry and the straight line. Gabriel created the ensemble of classical buildings around the Place de la Concorde while Soufflot designed the Panthéon (1758–90) on the Roman model.\n\nAn influential building from the late Louis XV period was the Petit Trianon at Versailles (1762-1764), by Jacques Ange Gabriel, built for the mistress of the King, Madame Pompadour. Its cubic form, symmetric facade and Corinthian peristyle, similar to the villas of Palladio, made it model for the following Louis XVI style.\n\nAnother notable influence on the style was the architecture of the Renaissance architect Palladio, which influenced the building of country houses in England, as well as the French architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806). Palladio's ideas were the inspiration for the Château de Louveciennes, and its neoclassical music pavilion (1770–71) built by Claude Nicolas Ledoux for the mistress of Louis XV, Madame du Barry. The pavilion is cubic in form, with a facade of four pilasters supporting the architrave and the pilaster of the terrace. It became the model for similar houses under Louis XVI.\n\nNotable monuments of Louis XVI civil architecture include the Hotel de la Monnaie in Paris (1771–76) by Jacques Denis Antoine, as well as the Palais de Justice in Paris by the same architect; and the theater of Besançon (1775) and the Chateau de Benouville in the Calvados, both by Ledoux. The latter building has geometric architecture, a flat ceiling, and a portico in the colossal order of corinthian columns. The École de Chirurgie, or School of Surgery in Paris by Jacques Gondoin (1769) adapted the forms of the neoclassical town house, with a court of honor placed between a pavilion with a colonnade on the street and the main building. He also added a peristyle and another floor above the columns, and transformed he entrance to the courtyard into a miniature triumphal arch.\nTheaters in Paris and Bordeaux were prominent examples of the new style. The architect Victor Louis (1731-1811) completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780); its majestic stairway was a forerunner of the stairway of the Paris Opera Garnier. In 1791, in the midst of the French Revolution, he completed the Comedie Francaise. The Odeon Theater in Paris (1779-1782) was built by Marie-Joseph Peyre (1730-1785) and Charles de Wailly (1729-1798). It featured a portico in the form of a covered gallery and columns in advance of the facade.\n\nOne of the best-known buildings of the period is the small Chateau de Bagatelle, (1777) designed and built by François-Joseph Bélanger for the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother.. The small chateau was designed and completed in just sixty three days, to win a bet with Marie Antoinette that he could build a chateau in less than three months. Marie Antoinette had a similar small neoclassical belvedere created by architect Richard Mique, who had also designed her picturesque rustic village in the gardens. it was completed in 1789, the year of the French Revolution. \nAnother unusual architectural project was the transformation of the Palais Royal in the heart of Paris, into a grand shopping mall. In 1781 the Duc de Chartres, needing money, commissioned architect Victor Louis to create an arcade of shops, cafes and clubs on the ground floor. In 1788 he added a covered cirque in the center, a covered promenade and space for concerts and entertainments, with a trellis roof supported by seventy-two ionic columns.\n\nThe most characteristic building of the late Louis XVI residential style is the Hôtel de Salm in Paris (Now the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur, built by Pierre Rousseau in 1751-83. The facade is distinguished by its simplicity and purity, and its harmony and balance. A colonnade of corinthian columns supports the entablement of the rotunda, which is surmounted by statues. The facade is also animated by busts of roman emperors in niches, and sculptures in relief above the windows of the semicircular central avant-corps.\n\nThe Pantheon, designed by Jacques Germain Soufflot as the Church of Sainte-Geneviève and begun in 1757 under Louis XV, was the most prominent example of religious architecture under construction during the period. It replaced the colossal columns modeled after those of the Church of the Jesu and St. Peter's in Rome with slender, graceful corinthian columns supporting a continuous entablement. The plan was also classical; the long nave with a vaulted ceiling was replaced by a Greek cross, with the dome in the center. Soufflot employed novel engineering techniques to support the dome; a system of contreforts and arches, and the use of iron bars to support the stone structure. The building was begun in 1764 but not completed until 1790, after the Revolution.\n\nAnother important church completed in the Louis XVI period was Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1768-1784) by Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin. It was one of the last churches finished before the Revolution. The church is inspired by paleo-Christian architecture; it features massive columns and a pediment, and an interior with vaulted ceiling that suggests a vast Roman basilica.\nThe architect Claude-Nicolas Ledoux specialized in designing functional buildings in greatly simplified the classical style. Examples included his simplified neoclassical design for the customs barrier at La Villette in Paris (1785-1789), with its classical facade and rotunda. He was especially known for his project for the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans (1775–79) This was a model industrial site, in an elliptical shape, with the house of the factory director in the center, with a rustic neoclassical colonnade, surrounded by the workshops, storerooms and offices in concentric rings.\n\nEtienne-Louis Boullée (1728-1799) was another visionary architect of the period; his projects, never built, included a monument to Isaac Newton (1784) in the form of an immense dome, with a perforated top allowing the light to enter, giving the impression of a sky full of stars. His project for an enlargement of the Royal Library (1785) was even more dramatic, with a gigantic arch sheltering the collection of books. While none of his projects were ever built, the images were widely published and inspired architects of the period to look outside the traditional forms.\nThe Louis XVI style of decoration marked the triumph of neo-classicism, which had been underway in Europe since 1770. It reflected the murals and designs found in the early archeological excavations in Herculaneum and Pompei, and the travels of groups of artists to Greece and Asia Minor. The \"Taste Pompeiian\" was followed by \"the taste Entruscan\". Motifs in interior decoration included arabesques and grotesques on the Pompeiian model. Bas-reliefs in the Greek and Roman style were popular, often in the form of rectangual friezes in bronze on furniture, or stucco, marble, molded stucco, baked earth, or simply painted in tromp l'oeil over doors. Other popular motifs included garlands of oak leaves or olive leaves; interlaced flowers, ribbons or vines; crowns of roses, flaming torches, horns of plenty, and particularly vases from which emerged flowers or vines.\n\nIn the early part of the reign of Louis XVI, interior decoration was designed to overwhelm the viewer with its scale, majesty and opulence. Grand halls served multiple purposes, for theater entertainments, balls, or banquets. An example of the early Louis XVI style is the dining room of the Chateau de Maisons, rebuilt between 1777-1782 by François-Joseph Bélanger for the Comte d'Artois, the brother of Louis XVI. This dining room, inspired by grand style of Louis XIV and Louis XV. It features columns of the colossal order, inches, frontons, consoles, sculpture in relief, and a gigantic fireplace.\n\nLater in the reign, the tendency shifed to smaller, more intimate and comfortable salons, studies, dining rooms and boudoirs, as the Cabinet Doré of Marie Antoinette at the Palace of Versailles (1783) and the boudoir of Marie Antoinette at Fontainebleau, in the Pompeiian style (1785). The Pompeiian style featured mythical animals, such as sphinxes and griffons, horns of plenty, and vases of flowers mounted on tripods. The style also was frequently used in friezes and cameos, in medallions and in white on blue Wedgewood porcelain. In the laster years of the Louis XVI style, the decorative panels were divided into often geometric divisions, either circles or octagons,\n\nLouis XVI style furniture, particularly the furniture made for the royal palaces, is among the most finely-crafted and valuable ever produced in France. Much of it was produced at the \"Garde-Meuble du Roi\", the royal furniture worship, directed by Francois II Foliot (1748-1808). produced at the Among the notable craftsmen of the period were Georges Jacob, who made a suite of sofas and chairs for the apartments of Marie Antoinette at Versailles and for those of the Comte d'Artois, the King's brother, at the Temple. Oak, mahogany and walnut were the woods most commonly used. The chairs of the early period made for Marie Antoinette were richly decorated gilded carvings, usually with floral patterns. The chairs and sofas were usually upholstered in satin, with more elaborate medallions embroidered in silk attached. Later in the period, more exotic themes, often taken from popular theater productions in Paris, appeared in decoration of furniture,{ These included Chinese, Arabesque, and Etruscan figures. A variety of specialized pieces of furniture were created. These included lightweight chairs for men sitting at gambling tables, and specialized chairs for boudoirs, dressing rooms, libraries, and antechambers.\n\nThe beds, especially in the \"chambers de parade\" or ceremonial bedrooms of the royal palaces, were of extraordinary proportions, and were usually separated from the rest of the room by a balustrade. reached monumental proportions. These beds were termed \"à la Duchesse\", and featured an ornate canopy over the bed. The sculpted and gilded wood frame of the silk embroidered canopy over the bed of Marie Antoinette at Fontainebleau, installed in 1787, was so heavy that two additional columns were placed under it at night avoid its collapse. \nThe craft of the \"Ebenist\", or cabinet-maker, was considered separate from that of other furniture-makers. About a third of the \"Ebenists\" in Paris were of foreign origin, either second-generation immigrants from Belgium and the Netherlands or first-generation from the Rhineland. The latter group included some of the most famous craftsmen, including Jean-Henri Riesener, who became a master in 1768, and David Roentgen. They received special protection and patronage from Marie-Antoinette, who admired German craftsmanship.\n\nSeveral new varieties of the furniture were introduced, including a commode in the form of half-moon form, and the \"commode dessert\", which had a door in the front with shelves on either side. The \"commode bonheur-du-jour\" was a dressing table for a boudoir, with a small armoire on top, with either a mirror or a curtain. The \"table a la Tronchin\" was a table with a built-in-shelf which could be raised by a mechanism for reading. some of the furniture was small and designed to be easily moved, to quickly re-earrange salons. These included the \"table bouillotte\", a small round table with four legs and drawer.\n\nThe tables and cabinets were usually decorated with sculpted and gilded bronze ornament, often in the forms of stylized roses, knotted ribbons, or pine cones. The surfaces were frequently inlaid with plaques of different colored exotic woods or mother-of-pearl, forming either a checkerboard pattern, a pattern of cubes, or more intricate designs. The Commodes Sometimes the wood was dyed to achieve the color contrast, or pieces of wood were laid with the grain in different directions. Rissener were especially known for their richly ornamented surfaces. David Roentgen was particularly famous for his desks, which featured a variety of mechanical features as well as superb woodwork.\n\nThe royal tapestry workshop of Gobelins Manufactory continued to produce high-quality large works for royal residences and the nobility, but tastes had changed. The immense tapestries celebrating historical events were largely out of style. Instead of creating new designs, the manufactories of Gobelins, Beauvais and Aubusson recycled old designs, such as the \"Metamorphoses\" of Boucher. An increasing amount of the work was the creation of designs, especially polychrome floral patterns, for the upholstery of the royal furniture. The other two major tapestry workshops, Aubusson and the Beauvais Manufactory, also oriented their work primarily to furniture upholstery. \nHand-painted wallpaper had been used since in the 16th century for interior decoration, followed by wood block prints. French aristocrats often used tapestries in the major rooms, but in the antechambers and lesser rooms they often used painted or printed of painted paper designs imported from China, India, and especially England. In 1765, the French government placed a heavy tax on imported wallpaper, stimulating French production. During the reign of Louis XVI, the largest French enterprise for making wallpaper was created Jean-Baptiste Réveillon, In 1784 they received the title of Royal Manufactory, opened a large depot near the Tuilieries Palace, and hired a group of noted artists and illustrators, including the son of the painter Boucher, to design wallpaper. They also soon developed a process for printing the wallpaper in long rolls. He also made the colorful paper that covered the balloon that made the first manned flight in 1783. Their factory in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine . became one of the largest in Paris, and was an early target of demonstrations at the beginning of the French Revolution.\n\nAnother popular style that developed during the period was the decoration of rooms with panoramic scenes, composed of a number of painted or printed panels put together. These were commonly used in boudoirs and bath chambers. The salon of the pavilion of the Countess of Provence in Montreuil, and the country \"Cottage\" of the Prince de Condé at Chantilly had a similar panorama installed in 1775.\n\nAnother popular form of decoration was printed fine cotton, with elaborate arabesques and floral patterns. The most famous variety was \"toile de Jouy\". The fabric was made with wood block prints, was usually white and red or blue and red, was used to cover beds, for curtains, and for the covers of furniture. Another important industry was that of the manufacture of silk products. The best quality silk was made in Lyon, and was sold to Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and other royal clients. Lampas silk coverings with motifs of arabesques and medallions covered the walls of the billiards room of Marie-Antoinette in 1779, and thereafter became fashionable in Paris residences.\n\nThe most famous painter of the later French baroque was François Boucher, who perfectly captured the spirit and style of the period. After his death in 1770, shortly before the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI, he had no real successor in the baroque style. The end of the reign of Louis XV also brought to prominence the first artist to paint in the neoclassical style, Joseph Marie Vien, who painted scenes of Rome inspired by the discoveries at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Vien became the last holder of the title of first painter of the King, which he held from 1789 to 1791. Jean Peyron was another neoclassicist in the early Louis XVI reign. Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun was noted for her portraits of the royal family and nobility, including of Marie Antoinette and her children. The most prominent neoclassicist by far was Jacques-Louis David whose works well before the revolution expressed the Roman virtues of noble and grave simplicity. His major early works included \"Belisarius asking for alms\" (1781),\"The Agony of Andromique\" (1783), and especially Oath of the Horatii (1784), exalting the willingness of Roman soldiers to give their lives for the nation. The painting was so popular when shown at the Salon of 1785 that David was permitted to establish his studio in Louvre, a particular honor for artists. This painting became a model of the style that dominated French art during and after the Revolution.\n\nSculpture evolved from the more animated forms of the baroque to the more serene neoclassical style. The sculptors who were most prominent in the period included Étienne Maurice Falconet, who created table sculptures on classical and romantic themes for many Parisian salons, as well as the famous statue of Peter the Great on horseback for St Petersburg. Another notable portrait sculptor was Augustin Pajou, who also made statues of Greek and Roman gods, illustrating virtues; his statue of Mercury represented commerce. The most celebrated portrait sculptor was Jean-Antoine Houdon, known for his busts of leading figures of the period, including, in 1790, in the midst of the Revolution, Louis XVI himself. Louis-Simon Boizot was prominent for making busts of the nobility, including Marie Antoinette, but also for modeling figures for the Sevres porcelain factory, which became better known than his more formal sculpture. Examples include his \"The Toilet of Madame\", made of hard-paste porcelain, mounted on a plaque of marble and gilded bronze. \nMusical tastes at court were guided by Marie Antoinette. The Queen played the harp and sang, and had been, in Vienna, a student of Christoph Willibald Gluck. Her favorite composers were Gluck and Grétry, and she regularly attended concerts at the Academy of Music and the \"Concert Sprituel\", a society created to support new religious music. Gluck came to Paris in December 1776 for performances of his opera \"Iphigenie en Tauride\", and remained to compose seven operas. However his opera, Echo et Narcisse in 1779, was a failure, and he departed Paris, never to return.\n\nMozart came to Paris in 1778, where he conducted two symphonies, including the \"Parisian\" and gave music lessons to members of the nobility, as did Hayden. The members of the new Masonic movement in Paris were particularly active in sponsoring music; they commissioned Hayden in 1786-85 to write the \"Symphonies Parisienees\".\n\n"}
{"id": "34768888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34768888", "title": "Media depictions of body shape", "text": "Media depictions of body shape\n\nBody shape refers to the many physical attributes of the human body that make up its appearance, including size and countenance. Body shape has come to imply not only sexual/reproductive ability, but wellness and fitness. In the West, slenderness is associated with happiness, success, youth, and social acceptability. Being overweight is associated with laziness. The media promote a weight-conscious standard for women more often than for men. Deviance from these norms result in social consequences. The media perpetuate this ideal in various ways, particularly glorifying and focusing on thin actors and actresses, models, and other public figures while avoiding the use or image of overweight individuals. This thin ideal represents less than 5% of the American population.\n\nIt has been stated that the increase in eating disorders over the past several decades has coincided with an overall decrease (pound-wise) in women's ideal body weight portrayed by the mass media. A group of researchers examined the magazines Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Mademoiselle, and Vogue from 1959 to 1999. Fashion models became increasingly thinner during the 1980s and 1990s, making the thin ideal even more difficult for women to achieve. Photos depicting the models' entire bodies significantly increased in number from the 1960s to the 1990s. From 1995 to 1999 models were dressed in far more revealing outfits than they were from 1959 to 1963.\n\nWomen's magazines have been criticized for their conflicting messages, with an emphasis on food, cooking, child rearing, and entertaining. 75% of women's magazines contain at least one ad or article about how to alter one's appearance through cosmetic surgery, diet, or exercise. 25% of the women's magazines surveyed included tips for dieting or messages about weight loss. Many women's magazines focus on how to lead a better life by improving physical appearance. Megenta magazine released an article on \"How to dress for your body type\" giving tips and tricks to look the best in an outfit while striving to encourage women to feel comfortable in their skin. Men's magazines provide information about hobbies, activities, and entertainment in order for men to better their lives.\n\nMuch of the research pertaining to how the media effects body image examines the change in models and magazine articles over time. Garner, Garfinkel, Schwartz, and Thompson paid particular attention to the difference in body shape of Playboy centerfolds over a 20-year period. They found that over the years, the body mass, bust, and hip measurements decreased; however, the height increased. They also determined that the Playboy centerfolds were 13%-19% lower than the normal body weight for women of their age (Cusumano, Thompson 1997). Other studies found that over the years, magazines like Seventeen, YM, and Cosmopolitan all had an increase in articles pertaining to diet and exercise. Anderson and DiDomenico (1992) compared women's and men's popular magazines and found that diet and exercise articles appeared more than 10 times as much in women's magazines than men's.\n\nModeling and fashion industries have come under fire in recent years for embracing and promoting an ultra-thin appearance, giving \"unhealthy stigma\". According to a data research done by Might Goods using 3,000 models from 20 leading model agencies, 94% of the models are underweight. In addition, in a recent study conducted by Jennifer Brenner and Joseph Cunningham, it was observed that the majority of female models were underweight. The average American female fashion model begins working in the modeling business at ages 13–17 years old. The average female model in the United States weighs in ranging from 90 pounds to 120 pounds and an average of 5'8\" to 5'11\" tall. In comparison, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the average weight of a female is 168.5 pounds, and the average height for females is 5'4\". According to the AMA (American Medical Association), thin models on the catwalk as well as social media and fashion photography lead to unrealistic body expectations, which in turn could lead to eating disorders and other emotional problems. With the mass advertisement promoting thin body, plastic surgery and cosmetic surgery, women and young girls are being bombarded with this very idea of achieving thin body. This issue is being control by some countries such as Israel and France in which they regulate the body mass indexes of models and let the public know whether the ad images is manipulated.\n\nPhotoshop is, \"the altering (a photographic image) with Photoshop software or other image-editing software especially in a way that distorts reality\". Aerie, the lingerie line for American Eagle, began the campaign Aerie Real in which models were no longer photoshopped. A 2016 study showed that some women showed a smaller decrease in body satisfaction when seeing the photos of women untouched in comparison to the greater decrease in body satisfaction when seeing previous photos that were retouched. Many well-known magazines have been called out for photoshopping, a few examples being \"AdWeek, InStyle, Modeliste Magazine, and Fashion Magazine.\" Celebrities have recently commented on changes that were made of their photos by such magazines. In 2015, Zendaya, a current 21 year old actress, singer, and dancer, posted two pictures side by side of her magazine photoshoot calling out the changes that were made by the magazine, Modeliste Magazine. She stated that, \"There are the things that make women self conscious, that create the unrealistic ideals of beauty that we have\".\n\nVictoria's Secret puts on an annually televised Fashion Show in which its beautiful models walk down the runway in lingerie and latest releases for PINK, the clothing store of Victoria's Secret. In the televised showing, the models usually include how they prepared for the Fashion Show by showing clips of working out and dieting to prepare for the big day. A study published in 2013 analyzed the responses viewers were tweeting during the showing. Viewers discussed food, weight, eating disorders, and self-harm. The results of this study showed that vulnerable viewers could experience negative affect, or even engage in harmful behaviors, during or after viewing the show or others like it.\n\nIn 28 primetime situational comedies analyzed by researchers in 2002, 33% of the central female characters were below average weight. As the thinness of a female character increased, the number of compliments she received from men did as well. Research has shown below average weight female characters are over represented, while above average weight female characters are underrepresented in situational comedies as compared to the norms of the US population. Primetime television shows that appeal to a primarily female audience, such as Friends or Ally McBeal are helmed by young, attractive, and thin women. Extremely skinny or emaciated women are shown on fashion industry related shows, like House of Style.\n\nMale characters often negatively comment on average and above average weight females' body shapes and weights and audiences usually react by laughing. Male characters are not immune to unfair representation. 33% of male characters were below average weight and 13% were above average weight. By comparison, approximately 30% of men in the US are overweight. \nIn 2003 a study was conducted on ten top-rated American primetime fictional television programs. 33% of female television characters were underweight.\n\nA study was done of 10 primetime television programs on each of the 6 major TV networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, UPN, NBC, and WB) with the largest Nielsen audience ratings during the 1999–2000 season. Of the 1018 characters on all of the shows 14% of females and 24% of males were overweight or obese. These numbers represent less than half the percentage of overweight or obese males and females in the general population. Overweight female characters were less likely to be considered attractive, display physical affection, or to connect with romantic partners. Overweight males characters were less likely to interact with friends or romantic partners and less likely to talk about dating. Overweight males characters were often shown eating. These statistics are representative of the fat stigmatization present in many US television programs. The small number of fat female television characters that do exist are consistently depicted in relation to thinner, highly sexualized female characters. These characters are used as props, against which thinner women are compared, judged and valued.\n\nA study in Fiji showed that the introduction of western television had a detrimental effect on young women's perceptions and eating behaviors. Three fourths of the girls in the study reported feeling fat after prolonged exposure to western television.\n\nIn 2007, analysts sampled 135 scenes featuring overweight individuals from popular television programs and movies and coded for anti-fat humor. The majority of anti-fat humor found was verbal and directed at the individual in their presence, with no regard for their feelings.<ref name=\"Obesity TV/Movies\"></ref> Self-deprecating fat comments were much less common than those about or directed at another person. Male character were three times more likely to engaged in fat commentary than female characters. Media programs containing fat stigmatization content often are popular and have high ratings, suggesting that the general public finds it acceptable to overlook such remarks in the context of the story.\n\nAccording to Renee Hobbs, EdD, associate professor of communications at Temple University, the average teen girl gets about 180 minutes of media exposure daily and only about 10 minutes of parental interaction a day. Girls often take drastic measures in an attempt to become like the media images they view. Many end up with very low self-esteem and dangerous eating disorders. Elissa Gittes, MD, a pediatrician in the division of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh says \"We're seeing girls at younger ages starting to be dissatisfied with their bodies, proactively trying to change them, and feeling like they need to emulate something different than what their bodies can do.\"\n\nIn 2009 a content analysis of 150 top-selling video games found that games rated for children depicted female characters as significantly thinner than female characters in games rated for adults. Females in video games had significantly larger heads, but smaller chest sizes, waists, and hips than the average American woman. In 2008, a study showed that after playing video games, both female and male college-aged participants had significantly lower body esteem.\n\nThe muscular male body in mass media and video is the cause of many symptoms such as body dissatisfaction and body esteem. In the United States, adolescent boys age 13-18 spend nine hours on average playing video games. Exposure to these unattainable avatars within video games lead to higher body dissatisfaction, and in turn lead to many other social and psychology problems. Garner reported that 41% of teenage 13–19 years old boys were found to be dissatisfied with their overall body.\n\nA research done by Zeely Sylvia from Bridgewater State University found that: players who played game with character who had a more average body size and shape would display less body esteem concern than players who played with unrealistic muscular body character. The research concludes that muscularity concerns play a large role in the construct of male body image, and may have a substantial influence on male body esteem.\n\nIn 2001, British newspaper \"The Independent\" wrote about the silhouette of American TV stars like Calista Flockhart and Sarah Jessica Parker and compared it to that of the women in Pop group Destiny's Child saying, \"The lollipop silhouette long-favoured by the female stars of American sitcoms, which involves disproportionately large heads wobbling atop stick-thin bodies does not say rich and it doesn't say clever. It says take me to a clinic. The New Athleticism, however, sends out a rather different set of messages: strong, confident, independent woman.\"\n\nSurgeon General Richard Carmona speaks of obesity as the \"terror within\" and says \"unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf 9–11 or any other terrorist attempt.\" The news media has been criticized for its alarmist and overly dramatized reporting on the issue of weight and obesity. By using key words such as \"war\" or \"epidemic\" in their reporting, the news media attracts greater attention to the issue. News reports likely reinforce the stigma of fat bodies, linking them to disease and likening fatness to a health behavior instead of an inalterable trait.<ref name=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.00399.x-i1/pdf\"></ref>\n\nIn September 2011 nationally syndicated columnist Michael Kinsley, the founding editor of Slate magazine, wrote harshly critical remarks about New Jersey governor Chris Christie and his weight. Kinsley wrote \"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie cannot be president: He is just too fat . . .why should Christie's weight be more than we can bear in a president? Why should it even be a legitimate issue if he runs? One reason is that a presidential candidate should be judged on behavior and character . . . Perhaps Christie is the one to help us get our national appetites under control. But it would help if he got his own under control first.\"\n\nA content analysis done of children's videos and books found that 72% of videos and 7.5% of books placed emphasis on physical attractiveness. In 60% of videos, a character's love for another depends on physical appearance and attractiveness. Examples include Cinderella, where the prince invites maidens to the ball to select a bride and Beauty and the Beast, where the Beast falls in love with Belle purely based upon her physical appearance. In 72% of videos and 10% of books characters with thin bodies have desirable traits. In 84% of videos and 10% of books female physical attractiveness is associated with kindness, sociability, and happiness. While 60% of videos portray female thinness, only 32% show male muscularity. No physical attraction is shown between a slender character and an obese character, with the exception of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nA study published in 2010 involved one hundred and twenty one girls age 3-6 to determine the effects of brief exposure to appearance‐related media on young girls' body image. The exposure ended up not affecting body dissatisfaction. Although nearly all the girls did like how they looked ⅓ would change one physical thing and half were worried of becoming fat.\n\nIn 64% of children's videos and 20% of books obesity is related to negative traits. Obese characters are often shown as evil, unfriendly, cruel, and unattractive. Ursula from The Little Mermaid is an obese, unattractive octopus. In 40% of videos and 20% of books at least one obese character is disliked by others. Obese characters are shown thinking about food or depicted in setting related to food in 52% of videos and 20% of books. Children's media is perpetuating the \"what is beautiful is good\" stereotype through its portrayals of thin and obese characters.\n\nSocial media consists of websites like Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, Pinterest and Facebook enable users to produce and share content. Thinspiration images that promote the idealization of thinness and pro-eating disorder websites are becoming increasingly more prevalent throughout social media. Pro-eating disorder (i.e. pro-ana and pro-bulimia) websites are forms of social media where individuals can share advice and images that encourage their peers to engage in eating disorder behaviors. These websites have been shown to have deleterious effects because they communicate to the viewer that the thin ideal is something that is not only attainable but also necessary. Women are more likely to compare themselves online when they feel the need to improve their appearance. Women with low self-esteem are more likely to feel dissatisfied after comparing themselves to images on social and women who struggle with preexisting eating disorders may exacerbate them through social media fueled body comparison. A study on college women in the US concluded that women who spent a significant amount of time on Facebook had increased body dissatisfaction.\n\n\"A study of 6,928 girls ages 9 to 14 years old found that the desire to emulate the appearance of females on television, in movies, and in magazines was predictive of beginning purging behavior at least on a monthly basis.\" Approximately 92% of women feel pressure to conform to the standards of beauty which the media perpetuates. After viewing images of women with \"ideal\" body weights, 95% of women overestimate their body size and 40% overestimate the size of their waist, hips, cheeks, or thighs. Those with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, show a significant increase in overestimation of body size after viewing such images. Similarly males who are exposed to body-related advertisements show an increase in body dissatisfaction and depression. Men shown advertisements containing images of exceptionally muscular men were shown to be dissatisfied with their own musculature, not their body fat, after viewing such advertisements. This finding is consistent with previous evidence that states muscularity is more important than body fat in men's body satisfaction.\n\nThe correlation between media image and body image has been proven; in one study, among European American and African American girls ages 7 – 12, greater overall television exposure predicted both a thinner ideal adult body shape and a higher level of disordered eating one year later. Adolescent girls are the most strongly affected demographic; \"More and more 12-year-old girls are going on diets because they believe what you weigh determines your worth,\" Cutler observed. \"When all you see is a body type that only two percent of the population has, it's difficult to remember what's real and what's reasonable to expect of yourself and everyone else.\" \n\nPut simply, the beauty ideal in American culture is: thin. \"Large populations of 'average' girls do not demonstrate clinically diagnosable eating disorders—pathologies that the culture marks as extreme and unhealthy—but rather an entirely normative obsession with body shape and size,\" Cutler said. \"This ongoing concern is accepted as a completely normal and even inevitable part of being a modern girl. I think we need to change that.\"\n\nYoung adults and teens are very vulnerable to addict of social media usage because they do not know different life, world, and functioning without it. \"Teens and young adults are considered particularly at risk. They're a generation raised on the internet, social media, and digital technology so these things are integral, indispensable parts of their lives. Young people also are impressionable, eager for acceptance, and relatively inexperienced, which can cloud judgment.\" \n\nStatistics And Interesting Facts:\n\n1.) More than 40% of consumers say that information found via social media affects the way they deal with their health.\n\n2.) 90% of respondents from 18 to 24 years of age said they would trust medical information shared by others on their social media networks.\n\n3.) 18 to 24 year olds are more than 2x as likely than 45 to 54 year olds to use social media for health-related discussions.\n\n4.) 19% of smartphone owners have at least one health app on their phone. Exercise, diet, and weight apps are the most popular types.\n\n5.) 41% of people said social media would affect their choice of a specific doctor, hospital, or medical facility.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that race and ethnicity can affect the way women perceive body image. Women of color often have different perceptions of body image than white women—a difference that may be linked to cultural differences such as family and community experiences and racial or ethnic pride, and other differences such as childhood influences (e.g., school environment). Ultimately, these differences may have lasting effects on the ways in which white and non-white women are affected by media depictions and cultural ideals of body image and beauty.\n\nLovejoy finds in her research—which compares the perceptions of body image and eating disorders in black and white women through a literature review—that the strategies (e.g., resistance to mainstream beauty ideals) that black women use to challenge mainstream depictions of female bodies and develop positive self-valuations are often strengthened through support from other black women. These same types of supportive communities were not replicated in the same way for white women in the literature. Lovejoy argues that this difference in support can influence the way black and white women are affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Namely, black women may be less susceptible to these damaging ideals than white women as a result of strong support within their communities.\n\nHowever, such research does not suggest that black women are not affected by damaging ideals of body image and beauty. Maya A. Poran finds that \"[c]ontrary to popular theories that propose that Black women are protected by a 'Black Culture' that buffers them from negative effects of body representations—thereby leaving them with higher body esteem,\" black women in her study did experience \"(1) pressures to be thin, (2) pressures from the preferences of men of diverse ethnicities, (3) competition with other Black women in the realms of beauty, and (4) a strong sense of being misrepresented by media images of thin Black women.\" Therefore, while it is important to recognize the contribution of supportive communities on the positive self-valuation that some black women may experience, it is important that this not obscure the damaging impact that harmful ideals of body image and beauty may have on black women.\n\n"}

It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of Islamic, Persian, Turkish and Indian architecture. Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character, including large bulbous domes, slender minarets at the corners, massive halls, large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Examples of the style can be found in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.\n\nThe Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of Babur at Panipat in 1526. During his five-year reign, Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though few have survived. His grandson Akbar built widely, and the style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were Agra Fort, the fort-city of Fatehpur Sikri, and the Buland Darwaza. Akbar's son Jahangir commissioned the Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir.\n\nMughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of Shah Jahan, who constructed the Taj Mahal, the Jama Masjid, the Red Fort, and the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore. The end of his reign corresponded with the decline of Mughal architecture and the Empire itself.\n\nAgra fort is a UNESCO world heritage site in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. The major part of Agra fort was built by Akbar The Great during 1565 to 1574. The architecture of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the Rajput planning and construction. Some of the important buildings in the fort are Jahangiri Mahal built for Jahangir and his family, the Moti Masjid, and Mena Bazaars. The Jahangir Mahal is an impressive structure and has a courtyard surrounded by double-storeyed halls and rooms.\n\nHumayun's tomb is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the Indian subcontinent. It is often regarded as the first mature example of Mughal architecture.\n\nAkbar’s greatest architectural achievement was the construction of Fatehpur Sikri, his capital city near Agra at a trade and Jain pilgrimage. The construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574.\n\nIt contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the Emperor’s aim of achieving social, political and religious integration. The main religious buildings were the huge Jama Masjid and small tomb of Salim Chisti. The tomb, built in 1571 in the corner of the mosque compound, is a square marble chamber with a verandah. The cenotaph has an exquisitely designed lattice screen around it. Buland Darwaza, also known as the Gate of Magnificence, was built by Akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat and the Deccan. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level...\n\nThe Haramsara, the royal seraglio in Fatehpur Sikri was an area where the royal women lived. The opening to the Haramsara is from the Khwabgah side separated by a row of cloiters. According to Abul Fazl, in Ain-i-Akbari, the inside of Harem was guarded by senior and active women, outside the enclosure the eunuchs were placed, and at a proper distance there were faithful Rajput guards.\n\nThis is the largest palace in the Fatehpur Sikri seraglio, connected to the minor \"haramsara\" (where the less important harem ladies and maids would have resided) quarters. The main entrance is double storied, projecting out of the facade to create a kind of porch leading into a recessed entrance with a balcony. Inside there is a quadrangle surrounded by rooms. The columns of rooms are ornamented with a variety of Hindu sculptural motifs. \nThe glazed tiles on the roofs from Multan have an eye catching shade of turquoise. The mosque was built in honour of Jodha Bai, mother of Jahangir and wife of Akbar. Her Mughal name was Mariyam Zamani Begum and this being the reason that the mosque was built in her honor in Lahore’s walled city. Jahangir built his mother Mariyam Zamani Begum’s mosque and is just 1 km away from the tomb of Akbar near Agra at a place called Sikandra.\n\nBuland Darwaza dominates the landscape. Historian `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni writes that it was the highest gateway in Hindustan at that time until today.\n\nA chronogram is inscribed on the central archway composed by Ashraf Khan, one of Akbar's principal secretaries that reads,\nThe Tomb of Sheikh Salim Chishti is famed as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in India, built during the years 1580 and 1581, along with the imperial complex at Situated near Zenana Rauza and facing south towards Buland Darwaza, within the quadrangle of the Jama Masjid which measures 350 ft. by 440 ft. It enshrines the burial place of the Sufi saint, Salim Chisti (1478 – 1572), a descendant of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, and lived in a cavern on the ridge at Sikri. The mausoleum, constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire.\n\nThe Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore was commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan, and is famous for its rich embellishment which covers almost every interior surface.\nRather than building a huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power, Shah Jahan built elegant monuments. The force and originality of this previous building style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at Agra, Delhi and Lahore. Some examples include the Taj Mahal at Agra, the tomb of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in the Lahore Fort and the Jama Masjid at Delhi are imposing buildings of his era, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts. Shah Jahan also built sections of the Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha pavilion, which are all enclosed in the fort. He also built a mosque named after himself in Thatta called Shahjahan Mosque. Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort in his new capital at Shah Jahanabad, now Delhi. The red sandstone Red Fort is noted for its special buildings-Diwan-i-Aam and Diwan-i-Khas. Another mosque was built during his tenure in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor.\n\nThe Taj Mahal, a World Heritage Site described as the \"teardrop on the cheek of time\" by Rabindranath Tagore, was built between 1630–49 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.(Mumtaz died after her 14th delivery). Its construction took 22 years and required 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. Built entirely of white marble at a cost of $1018200000, it is one of the New7Wonders of the World. The building's longest plane of symmetry runs through the entire complex except for the sarcophagus of Shah Jahan, which is placed off centre in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry is extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in red sandstone, to complement the Mecca-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Shah Jahan used \"pietra dura\", a method of decoration on a large scale-inlaid work of jewels.\n\nThe Wazir Khan Masjid was commissioned during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1634, and completed in 1642. Considered to be the most ornately decorated Mughal-era mosque. Wazir Khan Masjid is renowned for its intricate faience tile work known as \"kashi-kari\", as well as its interior surfaces that are almost entirely embellished with elaborate Mughal-era frescoes. The mosque has been under extensive restoration since 2009 under the direction of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the Government of Punjab.\n\nThe Shalimar Gardens (1641–1642) built on the orders of Bahadur Shah Zafar in Lahore, Pakistan, is also on the UNESCO world heritage list.\n\nThe Shah Jahan Mosque is the central mosque for the city of Thatta, in the Pakistani province of Sindh. The mosque commissioned by Shah Jahan, who bestowed it to the city as a token of gratitude. Its style is heavily influenced by Central Asian Timurid architecture, which was introduced after Shah Jahan's campaigns near Balkh and Samarkand. The mosque is considered to have the most elaborate display of tile work in South Asia, and is also notable for its geometric brick work - a decorative element that is unusual for Mughal-period mosques.\n\nIn Aurangzeb's reign (1658–1707) squared stone and marble was replaced by brick or rubble with stucco ornament. Srirangapatna and Lucknow have examples of later Indo-Mughal architecture. He made additions to the Lahore Fort and also built one of the thirteen gates which was later named after him (Alamgir).\n\nThe Badshahi Masjid in Lahore, Pakistan was commissioned by the sixth Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction. It is the third largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world. The mosque is adjacent to the Lahore Fort and is the last in the series of congregational mosques in red sandstone. The red sandstone of the walls contrasts with the white marble of the domes and the subtle intarsia decoration. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father, Shah Jahan, the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger. It also functions as an \"idgah\". The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque. The minarets are tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nAdditional monuments from this period are associated with women from Aurangzeb's imperial family. The construction of the elegant Zinat al-Masjid in Daryaganj was overseen by Aurangzeb's second daughter Zinat-al-Nissa. Aurangzeb's sister Roshan-Ara who died in 1671. The tomb of Roshanara Begum and the garden surrounding it were neglected for a long time and are now in an advanced state of decay. Bibi Ka Maqbara was a mausoleum built by Prince Azam Shah, son of Emperor Aurangzeb, in the late 17th century as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. The Alamgiri Gate, built in 1673, is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort in present-day Lahore. It was constructed to face west towards the Badshahi Mosque in the days of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.\n\nAnother construction of the Mughal era is Lalbagh Fort (also known as \"Fort Aurangabad\"), a Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose construction started in 1678 during the reign of Aurangzeb.\n\nMughal gardens are gardens built by the Mughals in the Islamic style of architecture. This style was influenced by Persian gardens and Timurid gardens. Significant use of rectilinear layouts are made within the walled enclosures. Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens. The famous gardens are the Char Bagh gardens at Taj Mahal, gardens at Humayun's Tomb Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, Delhi and Kashmir as well as Pinjore Garden in Haryana.\n\nShahi Bridge, Jaunpur was constructed during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Akbar.\n\n"}

{"id": "39199658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39199658", "title": "Ndop (Kuba)", "text": "Ndop (Kuba)\n\nNdop were figurative sculptures representing different kings (\"nyim\") of the Kuba kingdom.\n\nAlthough the sculptural genre appears naturalistic, \"ndop\" are not actual one-to-one representations of particular subjects, but rather a culmination of visual notations that represented the ideal characteristics of the deceased king. The reign of individual rulers are identified by a small emblem, called an \"ibol\", at the base of the sculpture. Each \"ibol\" is rendered with a great degree of customization and personalization in an otherwise formal and naturalistic standardization. Measuring about 48-55 centimeters in height, \"ndop\" were carved in hardwood and anointed with palm oil to protect them from insects, which is unique in African art and underscores their survival in Western collections today. Ndop sculptures depict subjects sitting cross-legged, a posture that is equally unique in African sculpture.\n\n\"Ndop\" frequently portray the ruler carrying a weapon in his left hand, an \"ikul\" or peace knife, made in the style reserved for the Bushoong, the dominant sub-group of the Kuba. The wooden portraits were kept in the king's quarters with other sculptures referred to as 'royal charms', upon which the king's magical powers rested. When the king was absent from the capital, the ndop were rubbed with oil. Scholars agree that the tradition of the king's \"portrait statue\" was begun in the late eighteenth century.\n\nTo create the distinct round contours of this sculpture, the sculptor primarily worked with an adze, which has a wooden handle to which a metal blade is attached at an acute angle. Knives and a burnisher were also used. Kuba carvers demonstrated fine hand and eye coordination to bring out details with the combination of these tools. In addition to the naturalistic shape of the facial features and body parts, the sculptor reproduces realistic detail on the body, including the collarbones and outline of the lips.\n\nThe durable hardwood and the palm oil anointments underscore the longevity of these works, the earliest examples of which, such as the ndop in the Brooklyn Museum’s collection, are among the oldest surviving wood works from the continent. Three wooden Ndop figures from the Kuba kingdom currently reside in the British Museum. Collected by the Hungarian explorer Emil Torday, one of them is estimated to date back to the eighteenth century, making it one of the oldest wooden sculptures extant from Sub-Saharan Africa. Two similar figures are in the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium.\n\nAfter the rites of investiture were completed, it is said that the \"nyim\" commissioned a sculptor to sculpt his likeness in the form of the \"ndop\". Only one ndop could be made for a king, and if he was not present it could not be sculpted. If the figure decayed over time, it was permissible to sculpt an exact replica.\n\nAs a site of the king's life force after death, it was believed that the \"ndop\" supposedly housed the \"nyim's\" double, the counterpart of his soul. It was believed that if anything happened to the king, it would be reflected in the \"ndop\". For example, if a king were to be wounded in battle, a similar wound would appear on the \"ndop\" sculpture. The statue was kept in the women's quarters, and when a woman of the harem was about to give birth, it was placed near her to insure a safe delivery. In the absence of the king it served as a surrogate, which women of the court would anoint and stroke. After his death, the ndop was removed to a storage room and taken out to be exhibited only on certain occasions.\n"}

It is distinguished from the finer \"opus vermiculatum\" which used tiny \"tesserae\", typically cubes of 4 millimetres or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. \"Opus tessellatum\" was used for larger areas and laid down at the final site. The two techniques were often combined, with small panels of \"opus vermiculatum\" called \"emblemata\" at the centre of a larger design in \"opus tessellatum\". The tiny \"tesserae\" of \"opus vermiculatum\" allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting. There was a distinct native Italian style of \"opus tessellatum\" using only black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.\n\nOpus tessellatum is usually used for backgrounds consisting of horizontally or vertically arranged lines — but not both in a grid, which would be \"opus regulatum\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1974810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974810", "title": "Taste (sociology)", "text": "Taste (sociology)\n\nIn sociology, taste is an individual's personal and cultural patterns of choice and preference. Taste is drawing distinctions between things such as styles, manners, consumer goods, and works of art and relating to these. Social inquiry of taste is about the human ability to judge what is beautiful, good, and proper.\n\nSocial and cultural phenomena concerning taste are closely associated to social relations and dynamics between people. The concept of social taste is therefore rarely separated from its accompanying sociological concepts. An understanding of taste as something that is expressed in actions between people helps to perceive many social phenomena that would otherwise be inconceivable.\n\nAesthetic preferences and attendance to various cultural events are associated with education and social origin. Different socioeconomic groups are likely to have different tastes. Social class is one of the prominent factors structuring taste.\n\nThe concept of aesthetics has been the interest of philosophers such as Plato, Hume and Kant, who understood aesthetics as something pure and searched the essence of beauty, or, \"the ontology of aesthetics\". But it was not before the beginning of the cultural sociology of early 19th century that the question was problematized in its social context, which took the differences and changes in historical view as an important process of aesthetical thought. Although Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Judgement\" (1790) did formulate a non-relativistic idea of aesthetical universality, where both personal pleasure and pure beauty coexisted, it was concepts such as class taste that began the attempt to find essentially sociological answers to the problem of taste and aesthetics. Metaphysical or spiritual interpretations of common aesthetical values have shifted towards locating social groups that form the contemporary artistic taste or fashion.\nIn his aesthetic philosophy, Kant denies any standard of a good taste, which would be the taste of the majority or any social group. For Kant, beauty is not a property of any object, but an aesthetic judgement based on a subjective feeling. He claims that a genuine good taste does exist, though it could not be empirically identified. Good taste cannot be found in any standards or generalizations, and the validity of a judgement is not the general view of the majority or some specific social group. Taste is both personal and beyond reasoning, and therefore disputing over matters of taste never reaches any universality. Kant stresses that our preferences, even on generally liked things, do not justify our judgements.\n\nEvery judgement of taste, according to Kant, presumes the existence of a \"sensus communis\", a consensus of taste. This non-existent consensus is an idea that both enables judgements of taste and is constituted by a somewhat conceptual common spiritual humanity. A judgement does not take for granted that everyone agrees with it, but it proposes the community to share the experience. If the statement would not be addressed to this community, it is not a genuine subjective judgement. Kant's idea of good taste excludes fashion, which can be understood only in its empirical form, and has no connection with the harmony of ideal consensus. There is a proposition of a universal communal voice in judgements of taste, which calls for a shared feeling among the others.\n\nBourdieu argued against Kantian view of pure aesthetics, stating that the legitimate taste of the society is the taste of the ruling class. This position also rejects the idea of genuine good taste, as the legitimate taste is merely a class taste. This idea was also proposed by Simmel, who noted that the upper classes abandon fashions as they are adopted by lower ones.\n\nFashion in a Kantian sense is an aesthetic phenomenon and source of pleasure. For Kant, the function of fashion was merely a means of social distinction, and he excluded fashion from pure aesthetics because of its content's arbitrary nature. Simmel, following Kantian thought, recognises the usefulness of fashionable objects in its social context. For him, the function lies in the whole fashion pattern, and cannot be attributed to any single object. Fashion, for Simmel, is a tool of individuation, social distinction, and even class distinction, which are neither utilitarian or aesthetical criteria. Still, both Kant and Simmel agreed that staying out of fashion would be pointless.\n\nTaste and consumption are closely linked together; taste as a preference of certain types of clothing, food and other commodities directly affects the consumer choices at the market. The causal link between taste and consumption is however more complicated than a direct chain of events in which taste creates demand that, in turn, creates supply. There are many scientific approaches to taste, specifically within the fields of economics, psychology and sociology.\n\nDefinition of consumption in its classical economical context can be summed up in the saying \"supply creates its own demand\". In other words, consumption is created by and equates itself to production of market goods. This definition, however, is not adequate to accommodate any theory that tries to describe the link between taste and consumption.\n\nA more complex economic model for taste and consumption was proposed by economist Thorstein Veblen. He challenged the simple conception of man as plain consumer of his utmost necessities, and suggested that the study of the formation of tastes and consumption patterns was essential for economics. Veblen did not disregard the importance of the demand for an economic system, but rather insisted on rejection of the principle of utility-maximization. The classical economics conception of supply and demand must be therefore extended to accommodate a type of social interaction that is not immanent in the economics paradigm.\n\nVeblen understood man as a creature with a strong instinct to emulate others to survive. As social status is in many cases at least partially based on or represented by one's property, men tend to try and match their acquisitions with those who are higher in a social hierarchy. In terms of taste and modern consumption this means that taste forms in a process of emulation: people emulate each other, which creates certain habits and preferences, which in turn contributes to consumption of certain preferred goods.\n\nVeblen's main argument concerned what he called \"leisure class\", and it explicates the mechanism between taste, acquisition and consumption. He took his thesis of taste as an economic factor and merged it with the neoclassical hypothesis of nonsatiety, which states that no man can ever be satisfied with his fortune. Hence, those who can afford luxuries are bound to be in a better social situation than others, because acquisition of luxuries by definition grants a good social status. This creates a demand for certain leisure goods, that are not necessities, but that, because of the current taste of the most well off, become wanted commodities.\n\nIn different periods of time, consumption and its societal functions have varied. In 14th century England consumption had significant political element. By creating an expensive luxurious aristocratic taste the Monarchy could legitimize itself in high status, and, according to the mechanism of taste and consumption, by mimicking the taste of the Royal the nobility competed for high social position. The aristocratic scheme of consumption came to an end, when industrialization made the rotation of commodities faster and prices lower, and the luxuries of the previous times became less and less indicator of social status. As production and consumption of commodities became a scale bigger, people could afford to choose from different commodities. This provided for fashion to be created in market.\n\nThe era of mass consumption marks yet another new kind of consumption and taste pattern. Beginning from the 18th century, this period can be characterized by increase in consumption and birth of fashion, that cannot be accurately explained only by social status. More than establishing their class, people acquired goods just to consume hedonistically. This means, that the consumer is never satisfied, but constantly seeks out novelties and tries to satisfy insatiable urge to consume.\n\nIn above taste has been seen as something that presupposes consumption, as something that exists before consumer choices. In other words, taste is seen as an attribute or property of a consumer or a social group. Alternative view critical to the attributative taste suggests that taste doesn't exist in itself as an attribute or a property, but instead is an activity in itself. This kind of pragmatic conception of taste derives its critical momentum from the fact that individual tastes can not be observed in themselves, but rather that only physical acts can. Building on Hennion, Arsel and Bean suggest a practice-theory approach to understanding taste.\n\nConsumption, especially mass consumerism has been criticized from various philosophical, cultural and political directions. Consumption has been described as overly conspicuous or environmentally untenable, and also a sign of bad taste.\n\nMany critics have voiced their opinion against the growing influence of mass culture, fearing the decline in global divergence of culture. For example, McDonald's has been seen as a monument to the cultural imperialism of the West. McDonaldization is a term used to describe the practice among fast food companies of extending their franchise worldwide, causing smaller ethnic enterprises and food cultures to disappear. It is claimed that the convenience of getting the same hamburger can reduce consumers interest in traditional culinary experiences.\n\nThe Western culture of consumerism has been criticized for its uniformity. The critics argue, that while the culture industry promises consumers new experiences and adventures, people in fact are fed the same pattern of swift but temporary fulfillment. Here taste, it is suggested, is used as a means of repression; as something that is given from above, or from the industry of the mass culture, to people who are devoid of contentual and extensive ideologies and of will. This critique insists that the popular Western culture does not fill people with aesthetic and cultural satisfaction.\n\nArguably, the question of taste is in many ways related to the underlying social divisions of community. There is likely to be variation between groups of different socioeconomic status in preferences for cultural practices and goods, to the extent that it is often possible to identify particular types of class taste. Also, within many theories concerning taste, class dynamics is understood as one of the principal mechanisms structuring taste and the ideas of sophistication and vulgarity.\n\nSociologists suggest that people disclose much about their positions in social hierarchies by how their everyday choices reveal their tastes. That is preference for certain consumer goods, appearances, manners etc. may signal status because it is perceived as part of the lifestyle of high-status groups. But, it is further argued, not just that patterns of taste are determined by class structure. because people may also strategically employ distinctions of taste as resources in maintaining and redefining their social status.\n\nWhen taste is explained on account of its functions for status competition, interpretations are often built on the model of social emulation. It is assumed, firstly, that people desire to distinguish themselves from those with lower status in the social hierarchy and, secondly, that people will imitate those in higher positions.\n\nThe German sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918) examined the phenomenon of fashion - as manifested in rapidly changing patterns of taste. According to Simmel, fashion is a vehicle for strengthening the unity of the social classes and for making them distinct. Members of the upper classes tend to signal their superiority, and they act as the initiators of new trends. But upper-class taste is soon imitated by the middle classes. As goods, appearances, manners etc. conceived as high-class status markers become popular enough, they lose their function to differentiate. So the upper classes have to originate yet more stylistic innovations.\n\nThe particular taste of the upper classes has been further analyzed by an economist Thorsten Veblen (1857–1929). He argues that distancing oneself from hardships of productive labour has always been the conclusive sign of high social status. Hence, upper-class taste is not defined by things regarded as necessary or useful but by those that are the opposite. To demonstrate non-productivity, members of the so-called leisure class waste conspicuously both time and goods. The lower social stratum try their best to imitate the non-productive lifestyle of the upper classes, even though they do not really have means for catching up.\n\nOne of the most widely referenced theories of class-based tastes was coined by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002), who asserted that tastes of social classes are structured on basis of assessments concerning possibilities and constraints of social action. Some choices are not equally possible for everyone. The constraints are not simply because members of different classes have varying amounts of economic resources at their disposal. Bourdieu argued that there are also significant non-economic resources and their distribution effects social stratification and inequality. One such resource is cultural capital, which is acquired mainly through education and social origin. It consists of accumulated knowledge and competence for making cultural distinctions. To possess cultural capital is a potential advantage for social action, providing access to education credentials, occupations and social affiliation.\n\nBy assessing relationships between consumption patterns and the distribution of economic and cultural capital, Bourdieu identified distinct class tastes within French society of the 1960s. Upper-class taste is characterized by refined and subtle distinctions, and it places intrinsic value on aesthetic experience. This particular kind of taste was appreciated as the legitimate basis for \"good taste\" in French society, acknowledged by the other classes as well. Consequently, members of the middle classes appeared to practice \"cultural goodwill\" in emulating the high-class manners and lifestyles. The taste of the middle classes is not defined as much by authentic appreciation for aesthetics as by a desire to compete in social status. In contrast, the popular taste of the working classes is defined by an imperative for \"choosing the necessary\". Not much importance is placed on aesthetics. This may be because of actual material deprivation excluding anything but the necessary but, also, because of a habit, formed by collective class experiences.\n\nTheories of taste which build on the ideas of status competition and social emulation have been criticized from various standpoints. Firstly, it has been suggested that it is not reasonable to trace all social action back to status competition. That is while marking and claiming status are strong incentives, people also have other motivations as well. Secondly, it has been argued that it not plausible to assume that tastes and lifestyles are always diffusing downwards from the upper classes. and that in some situations the diffusion of tastes may move in the opposite direction.\n\nIt has also been argued that the association between social class and taste is no longer quite as strong as it used to be. For instance, theorists of the Frankfurt School have claimed that the diffusion of mass cultural products has obscured class differences in capitalist societies. That is that products consumed passively by members of different social classes are virtually all the same, with only superficial differences regarding to brand and genre. Other criticism has concentrated on the declassifying effects of postmodern culture; that consumer tastes are now less influenced by traditional social structures, and they engage in play with free-floating signifiers to perpetually redefine themselves with whatever they find pleasurable.\n\n\"Bad taste\" (also poor taste or vulgarity) is generally a title given to any object or idea that does not fall within a person's idea of the normal social standards of the time or area. Varying from society to society and from time to time, bad taste is generally thought of as a negative thing, but also changes with each individual. A contemporary view is that \"a good deal of dramatic verse written during the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods is in poor taste because it is bombast\" or high-sounding language with little meaning.\n\n\n"}

The building is one of eight Grade I listed theatres in the United Kingdom, and is the only working theatre operated under the auspices of the National Trust. It is considered to be one of the most perfect examples of Regency theatres in Britain.\n\nThe theatre presents a diverse programme of drama, music and stand up. It regularly produces its own work which tours nationally, most recently Torben Bett's Invincible in the summer of 2016. In early 2017 the Theatre Royal will produce an adaptation of Jane Austen's \"Northanger Abbey\", which will tour nationally. \n\nThe Theatre Royal is currently a member of the pioneering Black Theatre Live partnership, a consortium of eight UK theatres committed to effecting change nationally for BAME touring through a three-year programme of national touring, structural support and audience development.\n\nThe Theatre Royal was opened by its proprietor and architect William Wilkins on 11 October 1819, and was one of the most elegant, sophisticated and up-to-date playhouses of its age. The fact that it has survived, without significant alteration, into our time is a miracle and it is now one of only three buildings to give the experience of theatre-going in pre-Victorian Britain.\n\nWilkins was an architect of national repute, responsible for, amongst other buildings, the National Gallery in London and Downing College, Cambridge. As the proprietor of the Norwich circuit, he employed a small company of players to undertake an annual tour of six theatres: Yarmouth, Ipswich, Cambridge, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester and King's Lynn. Each was open for just one or two short seasons during the year. The Bury theatre opened for the Great Fair in early October to mid-November and was only available for special events at other times of the year. At that time, it would certainly have enjoyed large audiences particularly as the local community would not have been able to travel far for entertainment, until the arrival of the railway in the 1840s.\n\nGreene King, the local brewery, purchased the freehold, which it still owns, in 1920. However, in 1925, in the face of overwhelming competition from two new cinemas, the theatre closed once more. Greene King had struggled to keep the theatre in operation but was now content to use the building as a barrel store. So it remained until the 1960s when a group of local people led by Air Vice Marshal Stanley Vincent raised over £37,000 to restore and re-open the Theatre Royal in 1965. The building was vested in the National Trust in 1975 on a 999-year lease. The Theatre Royal is now managed as an independent working theatre by the Bury St Edmunds Theatre Management Limited.\n\nIn September 2005 the Theatre was closed to begin a £5.3million restoration project to restore the building to its original 1819 configuration and decorative scheme. Following an extensive research period, architects Levitt Bernstein, in collaboration with theatre staff and the National Trust, drew up plans to restore the historic building to as close to its original design as possible.\n\nPrevious restorations to the building had removed the original Georgian entrances to the pit as well as its distinctive Georgian forestage. The boxes had also been removed from the dress circle and the seating layout changed throughout the building.\n\nThe project restored these aspects to recreate a theatre which could provide further insight into the architecture, stage techniques and repertoire of the 18th and 19th centuries, of which little is known in comparison to theatre of other epochs. In addition to the restoration of the building the theatre's artistic team researched and re-discovered many of the lost texts, of the Georgian repertoire. \n\nUnder the banner of \"Restoring the Repertoire\" the Theatre Royal produced some of plays of the Georgian period in the restored Theatre. On 11 September 2007 the theatre re-opened with a production of the 1829 nautical melodrama, \"Black-Eyed Susan\", written by Douglas Jerrold. \n\nIn addition to the restoration of the main building a new modern foyer was constructed to the side of the Theatre to provide a restaurant, additional bar and more toilets for the building.\n\n"}

{"id": "659316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659316", "title": "Zeami Motokiyo", "text": "Zeami Motokiyo\n\nZeami mixed a variety of Classical and Modern themes in his writing, and made use of Japanese and Chinese traditions. He incorporated numerous themes of Zen Buddhism into his works and later commentators have debated the extent of his personal interest in Zen. The exact number of plays that he wrote is unknown, but is likely to be between 30 and 50. He wrote many treatises about Noh, discussing the philosophy of performance. These treatises are the oldest known works on the philosophy of drama in Japanese literature, but did not see popular circulation until the 20th-century.\n\nAfter the death of Yoshimitsu, his successor Ashikaga Yoshimochi was less favorable to Zeami's drama. Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support. He became well-known and well-respected in Japanese society. Ashikaga Yoshinori became hostile toward Zeami after becoming Shōgun in 1429. Yoshinori held Zeami's nephew Onnami in high regard, and disagreed with Zeami's refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe. Possibly due to this disagreement, though a variety of competing theories have been advanced, Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to Sado Island. After Yoshinori's death in 1441, Zeami returned to mainland Japan, where he died in 1443.\n\nZeami was born in 1363 in Nagoya and was known as Kiyomota as a child. His mother was the daughter of a priest and a Fief Lord. His father Kanami led a theater troupe which primarily performed in the Kyoto region, before becoming popular in the late 1360s and early 1370s. As they became better-known, Kanami's troupe began to perform in Daijogi. Zeami acted in the troupe and was considered attractive and highly skilled.\n\nEbina no Naami, an adviser of the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, booked the troupe to perform for the Shōgun, who was then 17 years old. The shōgun was very powerful politically and was a patron of the arts. He was impressed by the troupe, and patronized Kanami. The troupe began to focus on the entertainment value of performance, rather than its religious significance. It had been a form of entertainment associated with the country, but with Yoshimitsu's support it became associated with the upper class. The Shōgun was highly attracted to Zeami, which proved controversial among aristocrats because of Zeami's lower-class background. Yoshimitsu regularly invited Kanami and Zeami to the court, and Zeami accompanied him to events. Due to his connection with the Shōgun, Zeami was provided with a classical education by court statesman and poet Nijo Yoshimoto. Nijo was renowned for his skill as a Renga and taught Zeami about Literature, Poetry, and Philosophy. This type of education was very unusual for an actor: due to their lower-class backgrounds, actors received little education.\n\nZeami received patronage in 1374, which was then an uncommon honor for an actor. Patronage allowed him to become a vocational artist and he began to lead the troupe after his father's death in 1385. The troupe became successful during his tenure as a leader. While leading the troupe, he wrote the first Japanese treatises on pragmatic aesthetics.\n\nZeami adhered to a formalist writing process: he began with a topic, determined the structure, and finished by writing the lyrics. The number of plays that he wrote is uncertain, but numbers at least 30. His intellectual interests were eclectic and he was a proficient writer of Renga. \"The Tale of the Heike\" was the source of several of his best known plays. He integrated Japanese and Chinese ancient poetry into his drama. Contemporary dramatists Doami and Zoami had a significant influence on him, earning recognition in his treatises. He spoke particularly well of Zoami, but his shift toward Yugen and away from Monomane may have been because of Doami's influence. He mixed popular dance, drama, and music with classical poetics and thus broadened and popularized the classical tradition. In his earlier work, he used Zen illustrations, creating new Zen words and using established Zen words out of context. Many of the themes he used are present in other schools of Buddhism. Japan was dominated by a focus on Zen culture then, and he was registered at a Zen temple and was a friend of a well-known Zen priest. In 1422, he became a lay monk.\n\nOne of the most important performances of Zeami's career occurred in 1394. At that time, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu visited the Kasuga shrine in Nara and Zeami performed during the visit. It was a significant political event, so Zeami was likely a well known artist then. He gave two significant performances for the Shōgun in 1399, one of which could have been attended by Emperor Go-Komatsu.\n\nZeami found Yoshimitsu to be a difficult patron, and was rivaled by Inuo, a Sarugaku actor, for the favor of the Shōgun. Though Yoshimitsu died in 1408, and new Shōgun, Yoshimochi, was indifferent to Zeami and preferred the dengaku work of Zoami, Zeami's career remained strong due to his connections with the urban commercial class. Due to his status as a well respected public figure, he had access to a number of patrons. He eventually reached the stature of a celebrity and wrote a significant amount between 1418 and 1428.\n\nAuthorship of noh plays is a complex issue and often a matter of debate. Many plays have been attributed to Zeami, and he was known to be involved in revising and transmitting many others. But some plays are decisively known to have been written by him. The following are universally attributed to Zeami:\n\n\nZeami produced 21 critical writings over a period of roughly four decades. His treatises discuss the principles of Noh. He sought to inform his colleagues of the most important aspects of theater, discussing character acting, music, and physical movement. They also discussed broader themes, such as how life should be lived. The treatises were intended for a small circle of his colleagues, since the troupes were hereditary and such information was traditionally passed down between generations. He desired to facilitate this process to ensure continued patronage for the troupe.\n\nZeami wrote several treatises on drama, the first of which was the , known colloquially as . It is the first known treatise on drama in Japan; though similar treatises were written by Japanese Buddhist sects and poets, this is the Noh treatise. J. Thomas Rimer suggests that Zeami's education in Renga poetry provided him with the idea. It notably includes a thorough analysis of jo-ha-kyū, which Zeami viewed as a universal concept. His first treatise includes much of his father's views of Noh.\n\nThe treatise \"Kakyo\" was written later and describes Zeami's personal views. Though \"Fushikaden\" discusses flowers at length, \"Kakyo\" deals with spiritual beauty and contains discourses on the voice of the actor and the actors' minds. A possible interest in Zen has been credited with this shift by some scholars. The change in his age between his first and last works also appears to have significantly affected his perspective. He spent a significant amount of time writing \"Kakyo\" and gave the completed work to his son Motomasa, Zeami's son Motoyoshi had previously transcribed Zeami's treatise \"Reflections on Art\".\n\nAfter Ashikaga Yoshinori became the Shōgun, he demonstrated a deeper disdain for Zeami than his predecessors had, though the origins of his feelings are unknown. Speculation has centered on Zeami's association with Masashige and the theory that Zeami was a restorationist. In 1967, the Kanze-Fukudu genealogy was found and gave credence to the idea that politics contributed to Yoshinori's treatment of Zeami. The genealogy showed that a brother of Zeami's mother was a supporter of the southern court against the Ashikaga Shogunate. Yoshinori is sometimes seen as eccentric, and it has been speculated that he punished Zeami because he did not enjoy his performances. (Yoshinori preferred colorful plays that involved actor portraying demons; these types of plays were seldom found in Zeami's repertoire.) Yoshinori, who enjoyed Monomane, preferred Onnami, as his performances included demons. Zeami had been close with his Onnami and they had performed together. Zeami had been unsure whether any of his sons would be able to lead the troupe after his death, so he paid special attention to Onnami's development. Motomasa, however, began to lead the troupe in 1429. That year, though Motomasa and Onnami each performed for Yoshinori during a 10-day festival Yoshinori forbade Zeami to appear at the Sentō Imperial Palace, possibly due to his refusal to provide Onnami with his complete writings. The next year, the music directorship of the Kiyotaki shrine was transferred from Motomasa to Onnami. That year Zeami's son Motoyoshi retired from acting to serve as a Buddhist priest. That same year Motomasa died; it has been speculated that he was murdered. Though he had lost political favor, Zeami continued to write prolifically.\n\nOnnami inherited the leadership of Zeami's Kanze school. The appointment was made by the Shogunate, although the troupes were traditionally hereditary. Zeami initially opposed Onnami's leadership of the troupe, but he eventually acquiesced. Zeami believed that his line had died with Motomasa, but Onnami felt that he continued the line. Zeami gave his completed works to Konparu Zenchiku, rather than to Onnami.\n\nIn 1434, Zeami was exiled to Sado Island. He completed his last recorded work two years later, providing a detailed first-person account of his exile. In the account he conveys a stoic attitude toward his misfortunes. Little is known about the end of his life, but it was traditionally believed that he was pardoned and return to the mainland before his death. Zeami died in 1443 and was buried in Yamato. His wife died a short time later.\n\nZeami is known as the foremost writer of Noh and the artist who brought it to its classical epitome. Scholars attribute roughly 50 plays to him, many of which have been translated into European languages. The contemporary versions of his plays are sometimes simplified. Some of his plays are no longer extant, and roughly 16 exist only in the form of rare manuscripts.\n\nThere are few extant biographical documents of Zeami, the lack of solid information about his life has led to a significant amount of speculation. Some common themes in the speculation are that Zeami could have been a spy, a Ji sect priest, or a Zen master.\n\nZeami's treatises were not widely available after his death, only the upper-class warriors were able to gain access to them. In 1908, several of the treatises were discovered at a used-book store in Japan. They gained wider circulation after this discovery but a complete set was not published until 1940. Zeami's plays have been continually performed in Japan since they were first written.\n\n"}

When Emilie was little, she moved with her family to Paris, where she started to draw in earnest. Then Emilie Desjeux was admitted to the \"Académie Julian\", where she became a student of William-Adolphe Bouguereau, who greatly appreciated her artistic abilities and named Emilie his best student.\n\nAfter graduation from \"Académie Julian\", Desjeux was able to feature her paintings at the «Society of the French artists»'s exhibitions and salons. In 1900 she had participated in the\"Exposition Universelle (1900)\" of Paris. She was decorated with the rank of Officier d'Academie. At the turn of the century Emilie Desjeux took part in the organization «Society of women-artists» and opened in Paris a painting school annex studio for girls in the Rue du Bac, and later moved to Rue Visconti.\n\nEmilie Desjeux traveled across Europe, visiting England, Italy, the Netherlands — and recorded her visits in various albums with sketches and her traveling records. Desjeux was an adherent of realist (or academic) painting. Other directions in the arts failed to influence her.\n\nIn 1906 Emilie Desjeux received a commission from the city council of Auxerre: to depict an historical event, the oration of Émile Combes on the division between church and state. For that time, it was unprecedented that this task was assigned to a woman. In 1908 the picture «Speech of Émile Combes» (125 x 256 cm), was unveiled in the city museum of Auxerre. It now decorates the city of Auxerre's administration boardroom.\n\nAt present works of Emilie Desjeux are stored at the city of Auxerre's museum depot, are exhibited at the Musée-Abbaye Saint-Germain and can be found in private collections.\n\nThe life of Emilie Desjeux came to an end on 23 April 1957. She rests at the cemetery of Bussy-en-Othe, Burgundy.\n\n\n\n"}
